SECTION 2. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF COMMITMENTS

2.1 The Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, each Bank severally agrees to make revolving credit loans
("Revolving Credit Loans") to the Company from time to time during the
Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount at any one time
outstanding not to exceed the amount of its Commitment. During the
Commitment Period, the Company may use such Commitment by borrowing,
prepaying or repaying the Revolving Credit Loans of such Bank, in whole or
in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event may Revolving Credit Loans be borrowed under this
subsection 2.1 if, after giving effect thereto and the application of the
proceeds thereof, the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans
and Liquidity Facility Loans made by any Bank then outstanding would exceed
such Bank's Commitment.

(b) Revolving Credit Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar
Loans, or part Base Rate Loans and part Eurodollar Loans, as determined by
the Company and notified to the Agent in accordance with subsection 2.2,
provided that no Eurodollar Loans shall be made after the day which is
seven days prior to the Termination Date.

2.2 Procedure for Borrowing. The Company may borrow under
subsection 2.1 during the Commitment Period on any Business Day, provided
that the Company shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must
be received by the Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, (i) three
Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, if all or any part of
the requested Revolving Credit Loans are to be initially Eurodollar Loans,
and (ii) one Business Day prior to the requested Borrowing Date, otherwise)
specifying (A) the amount to be borrowed, (B) the requested Borrowing Date,
(C) whether the borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Loan or a Base Rate Loan or
a combination thereof, and (D) if such borrowing is to be entirely or
partly a Eurodollar Loan, the length of the Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Loan. Upon receipt of such notice, the Agent shall promptly
notify each Bank thereof. Not later than 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on
the Borrowing Date specified in such notice, each Bank shall (subject to
subsection 9.3(b)) deposit in its Clearing Account an amount in immediately
available funds equal to the amount of the Revolving Credit Loan to be made
by such Bank pursuant to subsection 2.1. The Agent shall, pursuant to
subsection 9.3(a), cause such amount to be withdrawn from each such
Clearing Account and shall make the aggregate amount so withdrawn available
to the Company by depositing the proceeds thereof in the account of the
Company with the Agent on the date such Loans are made for transmittal by
the Agent upon the Company's request. Each borrowing pursuant to
subsection 2.1 shall be in an aggregate principal amount of the lesser of
(i) $50,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or
(ii) the then Available Commitments, provided that, with respect to any
borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.10
shall not have been contravened.

2.3 Liquidity Facility Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, each Liquidity Facility Bank severally agrees to make
liquidity loans (individually, a "Liquidity Facility Loan"; collectively,
the "Liquidity Facility Loans") to the Company from time to time during the
Commitment Period in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
subsection 2.3 in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding
not to exceed such Bank's Commitment. Amounts borrowed by the Company
under this subsection 2.3 may be repaid and, to but excluding the
Termination Date, reborrowed. All Liquidity Facility Loans shall at all
times be Base Rate Loans. The Company shall give the Agent irrevocable
notice of any Liquidity Facility Loans requested hereunder (which notice
must be received by the Agent prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on
the requested Borrowing Date) specifying (A) the amount to be borrowed, and
(B) the requested Borrowing Date. Upon receipt of such notice, the Agent
shall promptly notify each Liquidity Facility Bank thereof. Not later than
2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date specified in such
notice each Liquidity Facility Bank shall make the amount of its Liquidity
Facility Loan available to the Agent for the account of the Company at the
office of the Agent set forth in subsection 9.2 in funds immediately
available to the Agent. The proceeds of such borrowing will then be made
available to the Company by the Agent crediting the account of the Company
on the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts made
available to the Agent by the Liquidity Facility Banks and in like funds as
received by the Agent. Each borrowing pursuant to this subsection 2.3
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of the lesser of (i) $50,000,000
or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) the then
Available Commitments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, in no event may Liquidity Facility Loans be borrowed
under this subsection 2.3 if, after giving effect thereto and the
application of the proceeds thereof, the aggregate principal amount of
Revolving Credit Loans and Liquidity Facility Loans made by any Bank then
outstanding would exceed such Bank's Commitment.

(b) Notwithstanding the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default or noncompliance with the conditions precedent set forth in Section
4, if any Liquidity Facility Loans shall remain outstanding at 10:00 A.M.,
New York City time, on the fourth Business Day following the Borrowing Date
thereof and if by such time on such fourth Business Day the Agent shall
have received neither (i) a notice of borrowing delivered pursuant to
subsection 2.2 requesting that Revolving Credit Loans be made pursuant to
subsection 2.1 on the immediately succeeding Business Day in an amount at
least equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Liquidity Facility
Loans, nor (ii) any other notice indicating the Company's intent to repay
such Liquidity Facility Loans with funds obtained from other sources, the
Agent shall be deemed to have received a Notice of Borrowing from the
Company pursuant to subsection 2.2 requesting that Revolving Credit Loans
(which shall be Base Rate Loans) be made pursuant to subsection 2.1 on such
immediately succeeding Business Day in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of such Liquidity Facility Loans, and the procedures set forth in
subsection 2.2 shall be followed in making such Revolving Credit Loans. 
The proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans shall be applied to repay such
Liquidity Facility Loans.

(c) If, for any reason, Revolving Credit Loans may not be made
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection 2.3 to repay Liquidity
Facility Loans as required by such paragraph, effective on the date such
Revolving Credit Loans would otherwise have been made, each Bank severally
agrees that it shall unconditionally and irrevocably, without regard to the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, to the extent of such Bank's
Commitment Percentage, purchase a participating interest in such Liquidity
Facility Loans ("Unrefunded Liquidity Facility Loans"). Each Bank will
immediately transfer to the Agent, in immediately available funds, the
amount of its participation, and the proceeds of such participation shall
be distributed by the Agent to each Liquidity Facility Bank in such amount
as will reduce the amount of the participating interest retained by such
Liquidity Facility Bank in its Liquidity Facility Loans to its Commitment
Percentage of the Revolving Credit Loans which were to have been made
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection 2.3. Each Bank shall share on
a pro rata basis (calculated by reference to its participating interest in
such Liquidity Facility Loans) in any interest which accrues thereon and in
all repayments thereof. All payments in respect of Unrefunded Liquidity
Facility Loans and participations therein shall be made in accordance with
subsection 2.15.

2.4 Repayment of Revolving Credit Loans and Liquidity Facility
Loans. The Company shall repay all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and
Liquidity Facility Loans (together with all accrued unpaid interest
thereon) on the last day of the Commitment Period.

2.5 Lending Procedures. (a) Unless the Agent shall have
received notice from a Bank prior to a Borrowing Date that such Bank will
not make available to the Agent such Bank's share of the borrowing
requested to be made on such Borrowing Date, the Agent may assume that such
Bank has made its share of such borrowing available to the Agent on such
Borrowing Date, and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Company on such Borrowing Date a corresponding amount. If
the Agent does, in such circumstances, make available to the Company such
amount, such Bank shall within three Business Days following such Borrowing
Date make its share of such borrowing available to the Agent, together with
interest thereon for each day from and including such Borrowing Date that
its share of such borrowing was not made available, to but excluding the
date such Bank makes its share of such borrowing available to the Agent, at
the Effective Federal Funds Rate. If such amount is so made available,
such payment to the Agent shall constitute such Bank's Loan on such
Borrowing Date for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not
so made available to the Agent, then the Agent shall notify the Company of
such failure, and, on the fourth Business Day following such Borrowing
Date, the Company shall pay to the Agent such amount, together with
interest thereon for each day that the Company had the use of such ratable
portion at the Effective Federal Funds Rate. Nothing contained in this
subsection 2.5(a) shall relieve any Bank which has failed to make available
its share of any borrowing hereunder from its obligation to do so in
accordance with the terms hereof.

(b) The failure of any Bank to make the Loan to be made by it on
any Borrowing Date shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if
any, hereunder to make its Loan on such Borrowing Date, but no Bank shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be
made by such other Bank on such Borrowing Date.

2.6 Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Bank shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of the Company to the appropriate lending office of such Bank
resulting from each Loan made by such lending office of such Bank from time
to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
to such lending office of such Bank from time to time under this Agreement.

(b) The Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to subsection
9.7(c), and a subaccount for each Bank, in which Register and subaccounts
(taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, whether such Loan is a Revolving Credit Loan or a Liquidity
Facility Loan, the Type of each Loan made and the Interest Period (if any)
applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the Company to each Bank
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder
from the Company and each Bank's share thereof.

(c) The entries made in the Register and accounts maintained
pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection 2.6 shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations of the Company therein recorded;
provided, however, that the failure of any Bank or the Agent to maintain
such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error
therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to
repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Company by such Bank
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

2.7 Facility Fees. The Company agrees to pay to the Agent, for
the account of the Banks, a facility fee for each day from and including
the Effective Date to but excluding the later of (a) the last day of the
Commitment Period and (b) the date on which all of the Loans shall have
been paid in full (such later date, the "Final Date"). Such fee shall be
payable quarterly in arrears on (i) the first Business Day of each January,
April, July and October (for the three-month period (or portion thereof)
ended on the last day of the immediately preceding month) and (ii) on the
Final Date (for the period ended on such date for which no payment has been
received pursuant to clause (i) above) and shall be computed for each day
during such period at a rate per annum equal to the Facility Fee Rate in
effect on such day on the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect on
such day (or, if the Commitments shall have been terminated, on the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans on such day).

2.8 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Company shall
have the right, upon not less than five Business Days' notice to the Agent,
to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time to reduce the amount of
the Commitments to an amount not less than the aggregate principal amount
of the Loans then outstanding after giving effect to any contemporaneous
prepayment thereof permitted under subsection 2.9. Upon receipt of such
notice the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Any such
reduction shall be in an amount of at least $100,000,000 and shall reduce
permanently the amount of the Commitments then in effect. Any termination
of the Commitments shall be accompanied by prepayment in full of the Loans,
together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment.

2.9 Optional Prepayments. The Company may at any time and from
time to time prepay the Revolving Credit Loans or Liquidity Facility Loans
hereunder, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon prior
notice to the Agent (which notice must be received by the Agent prior to
10:00 A.M., New York City time (i) three Business Days prior to the
repayment date in the case of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) one Business Day
prior to the repayment date otherwise) specifying the date and amount of
prepayment, and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans, Base Rate
Loans or a combination thereof, and, if a combination thereof, the amount
allocable to each; provided that, in the case of any prepayment of
Liquidity Facility Loans, such notice may be delivered to the Agent as late
as, but no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the date of such
prepayment and provided, further, that each prepayment of Eurodollar Loans
on a day other than the last day of the related Interest Period shall
require the payment of any amounts payable by the Company pursuant to
subsection 2.20. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Agent shall promptly
notify each Bank thereof. Any such notice shall be irrevocable, and the
payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the
date specified, together with accrued interest to such date on the amount
prepaid. Partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of
$25,000,000 or a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

2.10 Minimum Amount of Eurodollar Tranches. All borrowings,
payments, prepayments, continuations and conversions hereunder shall be in
such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving
effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans
comprising any Eurodollar Tranche shall not be less than $100,000,000.

2.11 Interest Rate and Payment Dates. (a) Each Eurodollar Loan
shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period therefor on
the unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the
Eurodollar Rate determined for such Interest Period, plus the Applicable
Eurodollar Margin.

(b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest for each day on the
unpaid principal amount thereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate
determined for such day plus the Applicable Base Rate Margin.

(c) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan,
(ii) any interest payable thereon or (iii) any facility fee or other amount
payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear
interest at a rate per annum which is (x) in the case of overdue principal,
the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this subsection 2.11 plus 2% or (y) in the case of
any overdue interest, facility fee or other amount, the rate described in
subsection 2.11(b) plus 2%, in each case from the date of such non-payment
to (but excluding) the date on which such amount is paid in full (as well
after as before judgment).

(d) Interest shall be payable in arrears (i) with respect to
Eurodollar Loans having an Interest Period of three months or less, on the
last day of such Interest Period, (ii) with respect to Eurodollar Loans
having an Interest Period longer than three months, on each day which is
three months, or a whole multiple thereof, after the first day of such
Interest Period and the last day of such Interest Period, (iii) with
respect to Base Rate Loans (other than Liquidity Facility Loans which do
not constitute Unrefunded Liquidity Facility Loans), on the last day of
each March, June, September and December, and (iv) with respect to all
Loans, upon each repayment, prepayment or conversion thereof; provided that
interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection shall be
payable on demand. The amount of interest on any Loans to be paid on any
date as specified above shall in each case be determined under the
assumption that the Utilization for the Utilization Period(s) during which
such interest accrued was less than 33-1/3%. On the first Business Day
following the last day of each Excess Utilization Period, the Company shall
pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, an additional amount of
interest equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount of interest which
accrued during such Utilization Period after giving effect to the actual
Utilization for such Utilization Period (whether or not such accrued
interest was actually payable during such Utilization Period) over (ii) the
amount of interest which would have accrued during such Utilization Period
if the Utilization during such Utilization Period had been less than 33-
1/3%.

2.12 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) The Company may
elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to Base Rate Loans, by
giving the Agent at least two Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of
such election, provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may
only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. 
The Company may elect from time to time to convert Base Rate Loans to
Eurodollar Loans by giving the Agent at least three Business Days' prior
irrevocable notice of such election. Any such notice of conversion to
Eurodollar Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period or
Interest Periods therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice the Agent shall
promptly notify each Bank thereof. All or any part of outstanding
Eurodollar Loans and Base Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein,
provided that (i) no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan
when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent has
or the Required Banks have determined in its or their sole discretion that
such conversion is not appropriate, (ii) any such conversion may only be
made if, after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.10 shall not have been
contravened and (iii) no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar
Loan after the date that is seven days prior to the Termination Date.

(b) Any Eurodollar Loans may be continued as such upon the
expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the
Company giving irrevocable notice to the Agent, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in
subsection 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable
to such Loans, provided that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such
(i) when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent
has or the Required Banks have determined in its or their sole discretion
that such continuation is not appropriate, (ii) if, after giving effect
thereto, subsection 2.10 would be contravened or (iii) after the date that
is seven days prior to the Termination Date and provided, further, that if
the Company shall fail to give any required notice as described above in
this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the
preceding proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate
Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period.

2.13 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest (other
than interest calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate) shall be
calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. 
Facility fees and interest calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate shall
be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year
for the actual days elapsed. The Agent shall, as soon as practicable,
notify the Company and the Banks of each determination of the Eurodollar
Rate with respect to Eurodollar Loans. Any change in the interest rate in
respect of a Loan or in any facility fee resulting from a change in the
Base Rate, the Applicable Base Rate Margin, the Applicable Eurodollar
Margin or Status shall become effective as of the opening of business on
the day on which a change in the Base Rate shall become effective or such
Applicable Base Rate Margin, Applicable Eurodollar Margin or Status changes
as provided herein, as the case may be. The Agent shall notify the Company
and the Banks of the effective date and the amount of each such change in
the Base Rate.

(b) Each determination, pursuant to and in accordance with any
provision of this Agreement, of an interest rate applicable to a Eurodollar
Loan by the Agent, and each determination by a Reference Bank of a rate
with respect to a Eurodollar Loan to be notified to the Agent pursuant to
the definition of "Eurodollar Rate" shall be conclusive and binding on the
Company and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Agent shall,
at the request of the Company, deliver to the Company a statement showing
any quotations given by the Reference Banks and the computations used by
the Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 2.11(a).

(c) If any Reference Bank's Commitment shall terminate
(otherwise than on termination of all the Commitments) or, as the case may
be, Loans made by it hereunder are assigned, or prepaid or repaid
(otherwise than on the ratable prepayment or repayment of the Loans among
the Banks) for any reason whatsoever, such Reference Bank shall thereupon
cease to be a Reference Bank, and if, as a result of the foregoing, there
shall be only one Reference Bank remaining, then the Agent (after
consultation with the Company and the Banks) shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, by notice to the Company and the Banks, designate another Bank
that is willing to act as a Reference Bank so that there shall at all times
be at least two Reference Banks. In acting so to designate another Bank to
serve as a Reference Bank, the Agent will use its best efforts to ensure
that one Reference Bank will, at all times, be a Bank that has its
headquarters office located outside the United States.

(d) If any of the Reference Banks shall be unable or shall
otherwise fail to provide notice of a rate to the Agent upon its request
with respect to a Eurodollar Loan, the Eurodollar Rate shall be determined
on the basis of rates provided in notices of the remaining Reference Banks.

2.14 Inability to Determine Eurodollar Rate. In the event that
(a) the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Company) that by reason of circumstances affecting the
relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate in respect of any Eurodollar Loans, or (b)
the Required Banks determine (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Company) and shall notify the Agent that the rates of
interest referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Rate" as the basis
upon which the rate of interest for Eurodollar Loans is to be determined do
not adequately cover the cost to the Banks of making or maintaining
Eurodollar Loans, in each case with respect to proposed Revolving Credit
Loans that the Company has requested be made as a Eurodollar Loan, the
Agent shall forthwith give facsimile transmission or other written notice
of such determination to the Company and the Banks at least one Business
Day prior to the requested Borrowing Date for such Eurodollar Loan. If
such notice is given, any requested borrowing of a Eurodollar Loan shall be
made as a Base Rate Loan. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the
Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made.

2.15 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each borrowing of
Revolving Credit Loans (except borrowings pursuant to subsection 2.16),
each payment of facility fees, and any reduction of the amount of the
Commitments of the Banks hereunder (except for the termination or reduction
of a particular Bank's Commitment pursuant to subsection 2.19(a)) shall be
made pro rata according to the amounts of the then existing Commitments
(or, in the case of facility fees payable after the Commitments have been
terminated and prior to the date the Loans shall have been paid in full,
pro rata according to the amounts of the then outstanding Loans of the
Banks). Each borrowing of Liquidity Facility Loans shall be made pro rata
according to the amounts of the then existing Commitments of the Liquidity
Facility Banks. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Company on
account of principal of and interest on (except for payments to a
particular Bank pursuant to subsection 2.16, 2.17, 2.18, 2.19, 2.20 or
2.21) Revolving Credit Loans shall be made on a pro rata basis according to
the amounts of the then outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of the Banks. 
Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Company on account of
principal of and interest on (except for payments to a particular Liquidity
Facility Bank pursuant to subsection 2.16, 2.17, 2.18, 2.19, 2.20 or 2.21)
Liquidity Facility Loans shall be made on a pro rata basis according to the
amounts of the then outstanding Liquidity Facility Loans of the Liquidity
Facility Banks. All payments (including prepayments) by the Company on
account of principal, interest, fees and other amounts shall be made
without setoff or counterclaim to the Agent for the account of the Banks at
the office of the Agent referred to in subsection 9.2 in Dollars and in
immediately available funds. The Agent shall promptly distribute such
payments to each Bank entitled to receive a portion thereof by causing such
Bank's portion of such payment to be deposited in such Bank's Clearing
Account. If any payment hereunder (other than a payment in respect of a
Eurodollar Loan) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business
Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business
Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day
other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be
to extend such payment into another calendar month in which event such
payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the
case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding
two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable
rate during such extension.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Company
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that
the Company will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that
the Company has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date, and
the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to
each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such
Bank. If and to the extent the Company shall not have so made such payment
in full to the Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon,
for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to such
Bank to but excluding the date such Bank repays such amount to the Agent at
the Effective Federal Funds Rate for each such day. Nothing contained in
this subsection 2.15(b) shall relieve the Company from its obligations to
make payments on all amounts due hereunder in accordance with the terms
hereof.

2.16 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if
any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any Bank
to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a)
the commitment of such Bank hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans shall
forthwith be cancelled and (b) such Bank's Loans then outstanding as
Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall, if required by law and if such Bank so
requests, be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the date
specified by such Bank in such notice. To the extent that such affected
Eurodollar Loans are made as (or converted into) Base Rate Loans, all
payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such Eurodollar
Loans shall be applied instead to such Bank's Base Rate Loans. The Company
hereby agrees promptly to pay any Bank, upon its demand, any additional
amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for any costs incurred by such
Bank in making any conversion in accordance with this subsection 2.16,
including, but not limited to, any interest or fees payable by such Bank to
lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar
Loans hereunder (such Bank's notice of such costs, as certified to the
Company through the Agent, to be conclusive absent manifest error).

2.17 Increased Costs. (a) In the event that any law,
regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority enacted or made subsequent to
the date hereof:

(i) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank; or

(ii) does or shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank
of making, or maintaining advances or extensions of credit or to reduce any
amounts receivable hereunder (such increase in cost or reduction in amounts
receivable, "Increased Costs") then, in any such case, the Company shall
promptly pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank, upon the written
demand of such Bank to the Company (with a copy to the Agent), so long as
such Increased Costs are not otherwise included in the amounts required to
be paid to such Bank pursuant to subsection 2.16, 2.17(b), 2.18, 2.19, 2.20
or 2.21, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such
Increased Costs which such Bank deems to be material as determined by such
Bank with respect to its Eurodollar Loans. If a Bank becomes entitled to
claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection 2.17(a), it shall
promptly notify the Company, through the Agent, of the event by reason of
which it has become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional
amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by a Bank,
through the Agent, to the Company shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error.

(b) Upon notice from any Affected Bank (as hereinafter defined),
the Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Affected Bank an
additional amount for each Eurodollar Loan of such Affected Bank, payable
on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, equal to 

P X [[R / (1.00 - r)] - R] X [T / 360]

Where P = the principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan of such Bank;

R = the Eurodollar Rate (expressed as a decimal) for such
Interest Period;

T = the number of days in such Interest Period during which such
Bank was an "Affected Bank"; and

r = the aggregate of rates (expressed as a decimal) of reserve
requirements current on the date two Business Days prior to
the beginning of such Interest Period (including, without
limitation, basic, supplemental, marginal and emergency
reserves) under any regulations of the Federal Reserve Board
or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with
respect thereto, as now and from time to time hereafter in
effect, dealing with reserve requirements prescribed for
eurocurrency funding (currently referred to as "Eurocurrency
liabilities" in Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board)
maintained by a member bank of the Federal Reserve System.

The term "Affected Bank" shall mean any Bank party to this
Agreement that is (i) organized under the laws of the United States or any
State thereof or (ii) a bank organized under laws other than those of the
United States of America or a State thereof that is funding its Eurodollar
Loans through a branch or agency located in the United States of America. 
Each Bank agrees to notify the Agent (A) by appropriate notification on its
Addendum in the case of each original Bank party hereto and (B) in the case
of each New Bank, and each assignee pursuant to subsection 9.7(a) that is
not already a Bank, upon its becoming a party hereto, whether or not it is
an Affected Bank, and of any subsequent change of status, disclosing the
effective date of such change.

2.18 Transfer of Eurodollar Loans. Upon the occurrence of any
of the events specified in subsection 2.16 or 2.17(a), each Bank whose
Eurodollar Loans are affected by any such event agrees that it will
transfer its Eurodollar Loans affected by any such event to another branch
office (or, if such Bank so elects, to an affiliate) of such Bank, provided
that such transfer shall be made only if such Bank shall have determined in
good faith (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties) that, (a) on the basis of existing
circumstances, such transfer will avoid such events and will not result in
any additional costs, liabilities or expenses to such Bank or to the
Company and (b) such transfer is otherwise consistent with the interests of
such Bank.

2.19 Changes in Capital Requirements. (a) In the event that,
in the opinion of counsel for any Bank (which may, in the discretion of
such Bank, be such Bank's internal counsel), compliance with any law, rule,
regulation or guideline, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
Governmental Authority enacted or made subsequent to the date hereof shall
affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank and the amount of such
capital that is required or expected to be maintained is increased by or
based upon the Commitment of such Bank under this Agreement or any
participation agreement entered into pursuant to subsection 9.7, as
applicable (such event, a "Change in Law"), such affected Bank shall notify
the Company and the Agent within 180 days after such affected Bank shall
have obtained actual knowledge of the costs associated with its compliance
with such Change in Law (but in no event later than 365 days after such
Bank is first required to comply with such Change in Law). At the time of
such notification such affected Bank shall provide the Company with a
written statement setting forth the amount that would adequately compensate
such affected Bank for the costs associated with its compliance with such
Change in Law and setting forth in reasonable detail the assumptions upon
which such affected Bank calculated such amount, and a copy of the opinion
of counsel referred to in the preceding sentence. Such affected Bank shall
allocate to the Company the costs associated with such Change in Law in
such a way that the proportion of (i) such costs that are allocated to the
Company to (ii) the total of such costs of such affected Bank associated
with such Change in Law as it relates to all commitments of such Bank to
its customers of similar creditworthiness as the Company, is substantially
the same as the proportion of (i) the Commitment of such affected Bank
under this Agreement or such participation agreement to (ii) the total of
all commitments by such affected Bank to its customers of similar
creditworthiness as the Company. The Company and such affected Bank shall
thereafter negotiate in good faith an agreement to increase that portion of
the facility fee payable to such affected Bank under subsection 2.7 to a
level, which, in the opinion of such affected Bank, will adequately
compensate such affected Bank for such costs. If such increase is approved
in writing by the Company within 90 days from the date of the notice to the
Company from such affected Bank, the facility fee payable by the Company
shall, effective from the date of such Change in Law (but subject to the
last sentence of this subsection 2.19(a)) include the amount of such agreed
increase, and the Company will so notify the Agent. If the Company and
such affected Bank are unable to agree on such an increase within 90 days
from the date of the notice to the Company from such affected Bank, the
Company shall by written notice to such affected Bank within 120 days from
the date of the aforesaid notice to the Company from such affected Bank,
elect either to (a) terminate the Commitment of such affected Bank (each
such Bank, a "Terminated Bank") (subject to the last sentence of this
subsection 2.19(a)) or (b) (subject to the next to last sentence of this
subsection 2.19(a)) increase the facility fee payable to such affected Bank
by the amount requested by such affected Bank. Without limiting the
foregoing, if the Company elects to take the action described in clause (b)
of the preceding sentence, it may simultaneously therewith reduce the
Commitment of such affected Bank by an amount chosen by the Company. If
the Company fails to provide notice to such affected Bank as described in
the second preceding sentence by such 120th day, the Company shall be
deemed to have taken the action described in clause (b) of such second
preceding sentence. The Company (A) may from time to time after such 120th
day reduce the compensation to be received pursuant to this subsection
2.19(a) by any affected Bank as a result of any Change in Law, to the
average compensation (the "Average Compensation") the Company has agreed,
as provided above, to pay the affected Banks as a result of such Change in
Law (such average compensation to be measured by a percentage of the
aggregate Commitments of such affected Banks) and (B) shall pay to each
Terminated Bank, on the date the Commitment of such Bank is terminated, an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the lesser of (x) the aggregate
facility fee that would have been payable to such Bank, from the date of
such Terminated Bank's notice to the Company pursuant to this subsection
2.19(a) to the date the Commitment of such Terminated Bank is terminated,
had such facility fee been determined by reference to the Average
Compensation and (y) the aggregate facility fee that would have been
payable to such Bank during such period had such facility fee been
increased by an amount necessary to adequately compensate such Bank (as
determined by such Bank in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this subsection 2.19(a)) for the costs attributable to the relevant Change
in Law over (ii) the aggregate facility fee actually paid to such Bank
during such period.

(b) Upon the occurrence of any Change in Law each Bank whose
Commitment hereunder is affected by such Change in Law shall transfer its
Commitment to another branch office (or, if such Bank so elects, to an
affiliate) of such Bank, provided that such transfer shall be made only if
such Bank shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall,
absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties)
that (i) on the basis of existing circumstances, such transfer will avoid
the increased costs resulting from such Change in Law and will not result
in any additional costs, liabilities or expenses to such Bank (unless the
Company agrees to pay such additional costs, liabilities or expenses of
such Bank) and (ii) such transfer is otherwise consistent with the
interests of such Bank.

2.20 Indemnity. The Company agrees to indemnify each Bank and
to hold such Bank harmless from any loss or expense (including, but not
limited to, any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable
by such Bank to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its
Eurodollar Loans hereunder, but excluding loss of the Applicable Eurodollar
Margin), which such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a)
failure by the Company in making any payment when due (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) of the principal amount of or interest on the
Eurodollar Loans of such Bank, (b) failure by the Company to make a
borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, or a conversion into or continuation of
Eurodollar Loans, after the Company has given a notice requesting or
accepting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c)
failure by the Company in making any prepayment after the Company has given
a notice in accordance with this Agreement and (d) a payment or prepayment
of a Eurodollar Loan on a day that is not the last day of the Interest
Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or
continued, for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment or of
such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of the relevant
Interest Period (or proposed Interest Period), in each case at the
applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding,
however, the Applicable Eurodollar Margin) over (ii) the amount of interest
(as reasonably determined by such Bank) which would have accrued to such
Bank on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable
period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. The
agreements in this subsection 2.20 shall survive the payment of the Loans
and all other amounts payable hereunder.

2.21 Taxes. (a) In the event that the adoption of any law,
regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, in each case after the date hereof,
shall require any Taxes (as hereinafter defined) to be withheld or deducted
from any amount payable to any Bank under this Agreement, upon notice by
such Bank to the Company (with a copy to the Agent) to the effect that (i)
as a result of the adoption of such law, rule, regulation, treaty or
directive or a change therein or in the interpretation thereof, Taxes are
being withheld or deducted from amounts payable to such Bank under this
Agreement and (ii) such Bank has taken all action required to be taken by
it to avoid the imposition of such Taxes pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
subsection 2.21 prior to demanding indemnification under this paragraph
(a), the Company will pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank
additional amounts so that such additional amounts, together with amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement, will yield to such Bank, after
deduction from such increased amount of all Taxes required to be withheld
or deducted therefrom, the amount stated to be payable under this
Agreement. The term "Taxes" shall mean all net income, stamp or other
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings,
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any country (or by any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), excluding,
with respect to any Bank, net income and franchise taxes imposed with
respect to net income of any country (or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein) where such Bank is organized or, in
respect of such Bank's Eurodollar Loans, by the country (or any political
subdivision or tax authority thereof or therein) where such Bank's
Eurodollar Loans are booked and, in respect of such Bank's Base Rate Loans,
by the country (or any political subdivision or tax authority thereof or
therein) where such Bank's Base Rate Loans are booked. If the Company
fails to pay any Taxes when due following notification by any Bank as
provided above, the Company shall indemnify such Bank for any incremental
taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any Bank as a
result of any such failure by the Company to make such payment. The
Company may, upon payment by the Company to any Bank claiming
indemnification under this paragraph (a) of any amount payable by the
Company to such Bank, elect by not less than four Business Days' prior
written notice to such Bank to terminate the Commitment of such Bank and
prepay the Loans of such Bank outstanding hereunder on the next day upon
which a prepayment may be made pursuant to subsection 2.9.

(b) Each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver to
the Company and the Agent (i) two duly completed copies of United States
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 or any successor applicable
form, as the case may be, and (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or
W-9 or any successor form. Each such Bank also agrees to deliver to the
Company and the Agent two further copies of the said Form 1001 or 4224 and
Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable forms or other manner of
certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring
a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Company,
and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by
the Company or the Agent, unless in any such case an event (including,
without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred
prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required
which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank
from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and
such Bank so advises the Company and the Agent. Such Bank shall certify
(i) in the case of Form 1001 or 4224, that it is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes and (ii) in the case of a Form W-8 or W-
9, that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup
withholding tax.

(c) No Bank may request indemnification for any Taxes from the
Company under paragraph (a) of this subsection 2.21 to the extent that such
Taxes would have been avoided or reduced by such Bank's transfer of its
Loans affected by such event to another office of such Bank (or to an
affiliate of such Bank), by such Bank's properly claiming the benefit of
any exemption from or reduction of such Taxes (whether provided by statute,
treaty or otherwise), including, without limitation, by delivering the
forms required by paragraph (b) of this subsection 2.21, or by such Bank's
taking any other action which in its judgment is reasonable to avoid or
reduce such Taxes, provided that such Bank shall not be required to (i)
take any action which in the reasonable judgment of such Bank could
directly or indirectly result in any increased cost or expense or in any
loss of opportunity to such Bank unless the Company shall have provided to
such Bank indemnity or reimbursement therefor in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to such Bank or (ii) claim or apply any tax credit
against such Taxes.

(d) Within 30 days after the payment by the Company of any
income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions or withholdings, withheld or deducted from any amount payable to
any Bank under this Agreement, and irrespective of whether such Bank is
entitled to demand indemnification in respect thereof under paragraph (a)
above, the Company will furnish to such Bank (with a copy to the Agent),
the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

2.22 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans hereunder shall
be used by the Company for general corporate purposes.

2.23 Replacement of Banks. The Company shall be permitted to
replace any Bank which (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing
pursuant to subsection 2.17, 2.19 or 2.21, (b) is affected in the manner
described in subsection 2.16 and as a result thereof any of the actions
described in said subsection is required to be taken or (c) defaults in its
obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or Liquidity Facility Loans
hereunder, with a replacement Commercial Bank; provided that (i) such
replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
replacement, (iii) the Company shall repay (or the replacement Commercial
Bank shall purchase, at par) all Loans and other amounts (including accrued
interest) owing to such replaced Bank concurrently with such replacement,
(iv) the Company shall be liable to such replaced Bank under subsection
2.20 if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Bank shall be prepaid
(or purchased) other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating
thereto, (v) the replacement Commercial Bank, if not already a Bank, and
the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent, (vi) the replaced Bank shall be obligated to
make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of subsection 9.7
(provided that the Company shall be obligated to pay the registration and
processing fee referred to therein), (vii) until such time as such
replacement shall be consummated, the Company shall pay all additional
amounts (if any) required pursuant to subsection 2.17, 2.19 or 2.21, as the
case may be, and (viii) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of any rights which the Company, the Agent or any other Bank shall
have against the replaced Bank.

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

In order to induce the Banks to enter into this Agreement and to
make the Loans herein provided for, the Company hereby represents and
warrants to each Bank that:

3.1 Financial Condition. The consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of net earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year
ended on such date, certified by Deloitte & Touche, copies of which have
been delivered to each Bank, present fairly the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal year
then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as at March 31, 1994, and the related consolidated
statements of net earnings and cash flows for the three-month period ended
on such date, certified by a Responsible Officer, copies of which have been
delivered to each Bank, present fairly the consolidated financial condition
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated
results of their operations for the three-month period then ended (subject
to normal year-end audit adjustments). Such financial statements,
including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP. As at March 31, 1994, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries had any asset, liability, contingent obligation, liability
for taxes, long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment
material to the financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, which was not reflected in the foregoing statements or in
the notes thereto.

3.2 No Change. Between December 31, 1993 and the Effective Date
there has been no material adverse change in the business, operations or
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

3.3 Corporate Existence. The Company (a) is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Michigan, and (b) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do
business and is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which the
character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature
of business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except in
the case of this clause (b) to the extent that the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

3.4 Corporate Authorization; No Violation. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement are within the
corporate powers of the Company, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and do not contravene any Requirement of Law or
Contractual Obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except to
the extent that such contravention would not have a material adverse effect
on the business, operations or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or on the ability of the Company to fulfill
its obligations under this Agreement or on the rights and remedies of the
Agent and the Banks hereunder.

3.5 Government Authorization. No authorization or approval or
other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required to be obtained or made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of this Agreement.

3.6 Federal Regulations. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is principally engaged in the business of extending credit for
the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of
Regulation U, T, G or X issued by the Federal Reserve Board), and no
proceeds of any borrowing hereunder will be used to purchase or carry any
margin stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any margin stock.

3.7 Enforceable Obligations. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered on behalf of the Company, and this Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by principles of equity, whether considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law.

3.8 No Material Litigation. No litigation, investigation or
proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by or against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or against any of its or their respective
properties or revenues, in which there is a reasonable likelihood of an
adverse determination (a) with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, if such adverse determination would have
a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement or on the rights and remedies of the Agent
and the Banks hereunder or (b) which would, if adversely determined, have a
material adverse effect on the business, operations, property or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

3.9 Taxes. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed
or caused to be filed all material tax returns which to the knowledge of
the Company are required to be filed, and has paid all material taxes shown
to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments made against it
or any of its property and all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed
on it or any of its property by any Governmental Authority (other than
those the amount or validity of which is currently being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in
conformity with GAAP, if any, have been provided on the books of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be).

3.10 ERISA. No Prohibited Transaction or Accumulated Funding
Deficiency (other than those that have been waived by the Internal Revenue
Service) has occurred since July 1, 1974 with respect to any Plan and no
Reportable Event has occurred since July 1, 1974 with respect to any Plan
which could in either case subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to any tax, penalty or other liabilities in the aggregate material in
relation to the business, operations, property or financial or other
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The
projected benefit obligations with respect to all benefits, both vested and
nonvested, under all Single Employer Plans (based on the most recently
available actuarial information and computed in accordance with Statement
of Accounting Standards No. 87) maintained by the Company or a Commonly
Controlled Entity did not exceed, at December 31, 1993, the fair value of
the assets of such Plans by more than $2,500,000,000.

3.11 Investment Company Act; Other Regulations. The Company is
not an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment
company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended. The Company is not subject to regulation under any Federal or
state statute or regulation which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

3.12 Ownership of Property; Liens. The Company and its U.S.
Subsidiaries have good title in fee simple to or valid leasehold interests
in their respective property that is material to the operation of their
respective businesses, subject to defects in title and leasehold and other
interests which are not material to the business, operations and financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and none of
such property is subject to any Lien other than Liens excepted under
subsection 6.7.

SECTION 4. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 

4.1 Conditions to Effectiveness. The effectiveness of this
Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions
precedent:

(a) Execution of Agreement and Addenda. (i) This Agreement
shall have been executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of
each of the Company and the Agent and (ii) the Agent shall have
received an executed Addendum (or a copy thereof by facsimile
transmission) from each Person listed on Schedule I, provided, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that an Addendum has not
been duly executed and delivered by each Person listed on Schedule I
on the date (which shall be no earlier than the date hereof) on which
this Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by each of the
Company and the Agent, this Agreement shall, subject to satisfaction
of the other conditions precedent set forth in this subsection 4.1,
nevertheless become effective on such date with respect to those
Persons which have executed and delivered an Addendum on or before
such date if on such date the Company and the Agent shall have
designated one or more Commercial Banks (the "Designated Banks") to
assume, in the aggregate, all of the Commitments which would have been
held by the Persons listed on Schedule I (the "Non-Executing Persons")
which have not so executed an Addendum (subject to each such
Designated Bank's prior written consent in its sole discretion and its
execution of an Addendum). Schedule I shall automatically be deemed
to be amended to reflect the respective Commitments of the Designated
Banks and the omission of the Non-Executing Persons as Banks
hereunder. 

(b) Closing Certificate. The Agent shall have received a
certificate of the Company, dated the Effective Date, substantially in
the form of Exhibit B, with appropriate insertions, satisfactory in

hereunder.

(d) Corporate Documents. The Agent shall have received true and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the

been terminated pursuant to an irrevocable notice of termination of
commitments and that any amounts owing thereunder (including, without
limitation, accrued unpaid commitment fees thereunder through the
Effective Date) by the Company shall have been (or shall upon the
occurrence of the Effective Date be) paid in full. Without affecting
any terms of the Existing Credit Agreement which expressly survive the
termination of the Existing Credit Agreement, each Bank party to the
Existing Credit Agreement hereby waives any requirement of advance

SECTION 6. NEGATIVE COVENANTS

The Company hereby covenants and agrees that so long as the
Commitments remain in effect, any Loan remains outstanding and unpaid or
any other amount is owing to any Bank or the Agent hereunder:

6.1 Limitation on Indebtedness and Guaranties. The Company will
not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, create, assume or incur, or
become, remain or be liable on any Indebtedness or Guaranty other than

(A) Senior Debt or Guaranties of the Company to the
extent permitted by the proviso to this subsection 6.1, 

(B) Subordinated Debt, and

(C) Capital Notes; and

proviso to this subsection 6.1;

provided, however, that the Company will not permit the sum, without double
counting, of (x) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Senior Debt
and of Indebtedness of Subsidiaries and (y) the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of obligations entitled to the benefits of any Guaranty by
the Company or any Subsidiary, in each case as of the last day of any
calendar month, to exceed 650% of the Capital Base as of such last day (or
675% of the Capital Base as of the last day of any three consecutive
calendar months immediately succeeding six consecutive calendar months in
which such aggregate outstanding principal amount did not exceed 650% of
the Capital Base as of the last day of each such month).

6.2 Consolidated Tangible Net Worth. The Company will not
permit Consolidated Tangible Net Worth to be less than $1,500,000,000.

6.3 Fixed Charges Coverage Ratio. The Company will not permit
its "net earnings available for fixed charges" to be less than 110% of its

any fiscal year of the Company ending with the last day of each calendar
quarter therein. For the purposes of this subsection 6.3, "net earnings
available for fixed charges" and "fixed charges" shall be determined for
the Company and for the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis.

For the purposes of this subsection 6.3:

(a) "Net earnings available for fixed charges" shall mean net
income after deducting operating and maintenance expenses, taxes other
than federal, state and other income taxes, except to the extent
stated below in the case of consolidated subsidiaries, depreciation
and depletion, but excluding extraordinary nonrecurring items of
income or expense appearing in the regular consolidated financial
statements of the Company.

(b) "Fixed charges" shall mean interest on debt, amortization of
debt discount, and rentals for leased properties, except rentals under
leases having a term of one year or less.

(c) In determining net earnings and fixed charges on a
consolidated basis, all intercompany items and the portions of
earnings allocable to minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries
shall be eliminated, provision for or refund of income taxes of
consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company owns directly or
indirectly less than ninety percent of all classes of voting stock
shall be deducted or added, and fixed charges shall include fixed
charges and preferred dividends of consolidated subsidiaries that are
not intercompany items.

(d) Earnings attributable to assets or institutions acquired by
merger, consolidation, reorganization, succession, organization,
purchase or otherwise may be included for that part of the test period
which precedes such acquisition, provided that (i) if less than
substantially all assets of any other institution (or all or less than
all assets of any other type of business enterprise) is acquired, such
earnings may be included to the extent they are certified by an
independent accountant to be attributable to such assets and (ii) if
an institution (or substantially all of its assets) is acquired, such
earnings may be included if they are included in financial statements
of such institution prepared under generally accepted accounting
principles. Fixed charges and preferred dividends for the period of
such inclusion shall either include any additional fixed charges and
preferred dividends properly attributable to such acquisition as
certified by an independent accountant, or be the fixed charges and
preferred dividends with respect to debt and stock outstanding
immediately after such acquisition.

6.4 Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. The Company
will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, engage in any transaction
with an Affiliate (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) on terms
substantially less favorable to the Company or such Subsidiary than would
be obtainable at the time in comparable transactions of the Company or such
Subsidiary with Persons not Affiliates.

6.5 Limitation on Amendments to Income Maintenance Agreement. 
The Company will not amend, modify, terminate or grant any waiver under the
Income Maintenance Agreement, provided that the Company may enter into a
waiver, amendment or modification of the Income Maintenance Agreement which
is solely for the purposes of (a) extending the term thereof or relaxing or
lessening the restrictions on, or duties of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries thereunder or (b) conforming the provisions thereof relating
to the fixed charge coverage ratio to the provisions of subsection 6.3.

6.6 Limitation on Fundamental Change. (a) The Company will
not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, merge or consolidate with or
into any other Person, nor will the Company or any Subsidiary enter into
any Material Asset Disposition (as hereinafter defined) except that:

(i) the Company may merge or consolidate with or into any other
Person, provided that (A) the Company shall be the continuing or
surviving corporation, and (B) immediately after such merger or
consolidation, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing;

(ii) any Subsidiary may merge or consolidate (A) with or into the
Company (provided that the Company shall be the continuing or
surviving corporation), (B) with or into any one or more wholly-owned
Subsidiaries (provided that a wholly-owned Subsidiary shall be the
continuing or surviving corporation), (C) with or into any other
Person, if such Subsidiary shall be the continuing or surviving
corporation, shall continue to be a Subsidiary of the Company and
immediately after such merger or consolidation, no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or (D) with or into any
other Person, if the disposition of the stock of such Subsidiary by
its parent corporation does not constitute a Material Asset
Disposition; and

(iii) any Subsidiary may enter into any Material Asset Disposition
by which its assets are transferred to the Company or a wholly-owned
Subsidiary.

For purposes of this subsection 6.6, the term "Material Asset
Disposition" shall mean any transaction (not including a transaction (1) by
which a Lien is created, which is permitted by subsection 6.7, (2)
consisting of a sale of Receivables, or any interest therein, by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or (3) consisting of a lease of assets entered
into in the ordinary course of business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) consisting of the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition
of assets having a book value at the time of such transaction equal to or
greater than the Maximum Disposition Amount, and any group of related
sales, leases, transfers or other dispositions made within any period of
six consecutive calendar months commencing on or after the Effective Date
shall be treated as one transaction for purposes of determining whether the
same is a Material Asset Disposition, provided, that a sale of any of the
stock of, or any of the assets of, Chrysler First or any subsidiary
thereof, or the sale of any of the stock of, or any of the assets of,
Chrysler Capital, or any subsidiary thereof, shall not constitute a
"Material Asset Disposition".

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries will not engage in any
business other than the Finance Business, the Finance-Related Insurance
Business and the other businesses in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
are engaged as of the date hereof, and other than businesses in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be involved in connection with or
related to any workout, liquidation, foreclosure or other realization on or
disposition of assets in which it has a security interest, or any other
exercise of rights or remedies pursuant to a workout in connection with any
financing (whether equity or debt) provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person.

6.7 Limitation on Liens. (a) The Company will not, and will
not permit any Finance Subsidiary to, create, assume or incur, or suffer to

(iv) any deposits to secure public or statutory obligations of

however, that no such Lien shall extend to or cover any other property
of the Company or such Finance Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(vi) any Liens which are (A) in respect of fixed assets or other
physical properties of a corporation which is not a Finance Subsidiary
as of the date hereof, and (B) in existence at the time such

theretofore subject thereto or the extension, renewal or replacement
(without increase of principal amount) of the indebtedness secured

materialmen's, repairmen's or other like Liens arising in the ordinary
course of business (A) which are not overdue for a period of more than

ordinary conduct of the business of the Company or its Finance
Subsidiaries;

(xi) any attachment or judgment lien, unless the judgment it
secures shall not, within 30 days after the entry thereof, have been
discharged or execution thereof stayed pending appeal, or shall not

and project financings entered into in the ordinary course of the
Finance Business; and 

(xiii) Liens to secure Indebtedness and other obligations of the

(b) The Company will not permit any Domestic Subsidiary that is
not a Finance Subsidiary to create, assume or incur, or suffer to be
created, assumed or incurred or to exist, any Lien in respect of any
property of any character of such Domestic Subsidiary, whether heretofore

SECTION 8. THE AGENT

8.1 Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints the Agent as the agent of such Bank under this Agreement, and each
Bank hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent as agent for such Bank to take
such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to
the Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Agent shall not have any duties
or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any
fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into
this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agent.

duties under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. Without limiting the foregoing, the Agent may appoint CASC as

advancing of funds to the Company and distribution of funds to the Banks
and to perform such other related functions of the Agent hereunder as are
reasonably incidental to such functions.

8.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agent nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates
(including, without limitation, CASC) shall be (a) liable for any action
lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in
connection with this Agreement (except for its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct), or (b) responsible in any manner to any
of the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties
made by the Company or any Subsidiary or any officer thereof contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate, report, statement or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in
connection with, this Agreement or for any failure of the Company or any
Subsidiary to perform its obligations hereunder. The Agent shall not be
under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the properties, books or

cablegram, telegram, facsimile transmission, telex or teletype message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Company), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent and CASC
may deem and treat the Bank specified in the Register with respect to any
amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a
written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have
been filed with the Agent in accordance with subsection 9.7. The Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
this Agreement unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Required Banks (or, if so specified in this Agreement, all of the
Banks) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense which
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. The Agent shall, in all cases, be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request
of the Required Banks (or, if so specified in this Agreement, all of the
Banks), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and all future holders of the
obligations owing by the Company hereunder.

8.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received notice from a Bank or the Company
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default
and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof to
the Banks, and, if such notice is received from a Bank, the Agent shall
give notice thereof to the Company and each other Bank. Subject to the
proviso contained in subsection 9.1, the Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed
by the Required Banks (or, if so specified in this Agreement, all of the
Banks); provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have received such
directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action,
or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event
of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks.

8.6 Non-Reliance on Agent, Other Banks and CASC. Each Bank
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates (including,
without limitation, CASC) has made any representations or warranties to it
and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the
affairs of the Company, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by the Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to each of the
Agent and CASC that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, any other Bank or CASC, and based on such documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation
into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Company and made its own decision to make its Loans
hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Bank or
CASC, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Company. Except for notices, reports
and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the
Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of the Company which may come into the possession of the
Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-
fact or affiliates.

8.7 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agent and
CASC (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company and without limiting the
obligation of the Company to do so), ratably according to the respective
amounts of their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on the date on
which indemnification is sought under this subsection 8.7 (or, if
indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall
have terminated, ratably in accordance with such Commitment Percentages
immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the
Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent or CASC in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent or CASC under or in
connection with any of the foregoing, provided that no Bank shall be liable
for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Agent's or CASC's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The agreements in this subsection 8.7 shall survive
the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

8.8 Agent in its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its
affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in
any kind of business with the Company as though the Agent was not the Agent
hereunder. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, the Agent
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any Bank and
may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Bank"
and "Banks" shall include the Agent in its individual capacity.

8.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 10
days' notice to the Banks and the Company, and may be removed at any time
with or without cause by the Required Banks. If the Agent shall resign or
be removed as Agent under this Agreement, then either (a) the Required
Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks,
which successor agent shall be approved by the Company, or (b) if a
successor agent shall not have been so appointed and approved within the
10-day period following the Agent's notice to the Banks or its removal as
Agent, the Agent shall then, with the consent of the Company, appoint a
successor agent who shall serve as Agent until such time, if any, as the
Required Banks appoint, and the Company approves, a successor agent as
provided in (a) above. Upon its appointment pursuant to either clause (a)
or (b) above, such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and
duties of the Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent
effective upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and
duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or
deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this
Agreement or any holders of the obligations owing by the Company hereunder.
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions
of this Section 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

8.10 The Co-Agents. No Co-Agent in its capacity as such shall
have any rights, duties or responsibilities hereunder, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into
this Agreement or otherwise exist against any Co-Agent in its capacity as
Co-Agent.

SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 Amendments and Waivers. With the written consent of the
Required Banks, the Agent and the Company may, from time to time, enter
into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto for the
purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or changing in any
manner the rights of the Banks or of the Company hereunder, and with the
written consent of the Required Banks the Agent on behalf of the Banks may
execute and deliver to the Company a written instrument waiving, on such
terms and conditions as the Agent may specify (with such consent) in such
instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or any Default or
Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such
waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall (a) extend
the maturity of any Loan, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment
of interest thereon, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the
amount or extend the time of payment of any facility fee hereunder, or
change the amount or terms of any Bank's Commitment, or amend, modify or
waive any provision of this subsection 9.1 or reduce the percentages
specified in the definition of Required Banks, or consent to the assignment
or transfer by the Company of any of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement or amend, modify or waive the provisions of subsection 9.8, in
each case without the prior written consent of each Bank directly affected
thereby; or (b) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 8 without
the prior written consent of the Agent; or (c) amend, modify or waive any
provision of subsection 8.10 without the prior written consent of each Co-
Agent. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification
shall apply equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding upon the
Company, the Banks, the Agent and all future holders of the obligations
owing by the Company hereunder. In the case of any waiver, the Company,
the Banks and the Agent shall be restored to their former position and
rights hereunder, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be
deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right
consequent thereon. No provision of this subsection 9.1 shall limit the
rights of any party hereto pursuant to subsections 2.16, 2.17, 2.18, 2.19,
2.20, 2.21, 9.8 and 9.9.

the Agent and CASC to cause such Bank's Clearing Account to be debited as
contemplated in subsections 2.2 and 2.3 and to cause to be created an
overdraft in such account if the balance in such Bank's Clearing Account on
a particular Borrowing Date is less than the amount of the Loan to be made

Agent and CASC to cause such Bank's Clearing Account to be credited, as
contemplated in subsection 2.15(a), with its ratable share of payments
received by the Agent from the Company. The Clearing Account of each Bank
shall be maintained at its own expense and free of charge to the Agent,
CASC and the Company.

(b) The Agent may at any time in its sole discretion, upon
notice to the Company and the Banks, discontinue the use of ACH procedures
in connection with Loans made pursuant hereto, and the Banks shall
thereafter fund each Loan required to be made by them hereunder by making
available the amount thereof to the Agent for the account of the Company at
the office of the Agent set forth in subsection 9.2 in funds immediately
available to the Agent.

9.4 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and
no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Bank, any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

9.5 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any document,
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

9.6 Payment of Expenses. The Company agrees:

(a) to pay or reimburse the Agent for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation
and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to or
waiver under, this Agreement and any other documents prepared in
connection herewith, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the administration of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, special counsel to the Agent and the
Banks;

(b) to pay or reimburse each Bank and the Agent for all costs
and expenses (other than legal fees and disbursements) incurred in
connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under
this Agreement and any such other documents, and the reasonable fees
and disbursements of one firm of special counsel to the Agent and the
Banks; and

(c) to (i) indemnify each Bank from and against liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements (other than legal fees and
disbursements) of any kind whatsoever (and, with respect to any
proceeding or related proceedings, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of one firm of special counsel to the relevant Banks in
connection with such proceeding(s)) which may at any time (including,
without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Loans) be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Bank in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any action taken or omitted by such Bank under or in
connection with any of the foregoing, provided that the Company shall
not be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from (x) the ordinary
course administration of this Agreement or such other documents by any
Bank or (y) any Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct or bad
faith and (ii) pay or reimburse (x) each Bank for any payments made by
such Bank to the Agent or CASC pursuant to the provisions of
subsection 8.7 and (y) the Agent and CASC for any and all liabilities,
expenses or disbursements incurred by any of them which pursuant to
the provisions of subsection 8.7 are the subject of indemnification
payments from the Banks to the extent that the Agent or CASC, for
whatever reason, did not receive such indemnification payments from
any Bank or Banks.

The agreements in this subsection 9.6 shall survive repayment of the Loans
and all other amounts payable hereunder.

9.7 Successors and Assigns. (a) This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns except that (a) the Company may not
assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior consent of all
of the Banks and (b) no assignment by a Bank of any of its rights or
obligations hereunder shall be effective unless (i) the assignee is a
Commercial Bank (unless otherwise agreed by the Company in its sole
discretion), (ii) the assignee shall have designated in writing to the
Agent an account at the office of a bank that is an ACH member to serve as
such assignee's "Clearing Account" hereunder, (iii) in the event of an
assignment of less than all of such Bank's obligations, (x) the principal
amount of such Bank's obligations so assigned shall be in an aggregate
amount of $10,000,000 or greater and (y) after giving effect to any such
assignment, the transferor Bank and the assignee (in each case together
with any Bank which is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or assignee,
respectively) shall each have obligations hereunder aggregating not less
than $25,000,000 (unless, in each case, at the Company's discretion, a
lesser amount is mutually agreed upon between the Company and such Bank or
assignee, as applicable), (iv) the Company and the Agent shall have
consented to the making of such assignment (which consent in each case
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (v) the transferor Bank,
the assignee, the Agent and the Company (if its consent to such assignment
is required hereunder) shall have executed and delivered an Assignment and
Acceptance substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1, and (vi) the
transferor Bank shall have paid to the Agent a registration and processing
fee of $2,500 (or such lesser amount as may be agreed to by the Agent);
provided, however, that no consent by the Company shall be required in the
case of assignments to a Commercial Bank controlled by, controlling or
under common control with an assignor Bank or pursuant to a merger or
consolidation of such Bank with another entity or a similar transaction
involving such Bank and provided further, that a Liquidity Facility Bank
may so assign all or a portion of such rights and obligations to a Person
that shall become a Liquidity Facility Bank hereunder only if notice of the
designation of such new Liquidity Facility Bank shall have been delivered
to the Agent prior to such assignment. Each Bank may sell participations
in its Commitment or in all or any part of any Loan made by it hereunder to
a Commercial Bank, in which event the participant shall not have any rights
under this Agreement (the participant's rights against such Bank in respect
of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by
such Bank in favor of the participant thereto) and all amounts payable by
the Company under Section 2 shall be determined as if such Bank had not
sold such participations; provided that (i) the terms of any participation
agreement or certificate relating to any such participation shall prohibit
any subparticipations by such participant; (ii) any such participation
agreement or certificate shall permit the Bank granting such participations
the right to consent to waivers, amendments or supplements to this
Agreement without the consent of such participant except in the case of (x)
waivers of any Default or Event of Default described in Section 7(a), and
(y) any amendment or modification extending the maturity of any Loan, or
reducing the interest rate in respect of any Loan, or reducing any facility
fee, or extending the time of payment of interest on any Loan or of any
facility fee, or reducing the principal amount of any Loan, in each case to
the extent such waiver, amendment or supplement directly affects such
participant and (iii) a participating interest of at least $10,000,000
shall be sold pursuant to any such participation (unless, at the Company's
discretion, a lesser amount is mutually agreed upon between the Company and
such Bank). 

(b) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Bank from pledging or
assigning all or any portion of its Loans to any Federal Reserve Bank in
accordance with applicable law. In order to facilitate such pledge or
assignment, the Company hereby agrees that, upon request of any Bank at any
time and from time to time after the Company has made its initial borrowing
hereunder, the Company shall provide to such Bank, at the Company's own
expense, a promissory note, substantially in the form of Exhibit E,
evidencing the Revolving Credit Loans or Liquidity Facility Loans owing to
such Bank.

(c) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
subsection 9.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and
a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses
of the Banks, the Commitments of the Banks, and the principal amount of
each Type of Loan owing to each Bank from time to time. The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of clearly demonstrable error,
and the Company, the Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name
is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Company or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Agent shall give prompt written
notice to the Company of the making of any entry in the Register or any
change in any such entry.

9.8 Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default and (b) with the consent of the Required
Banks, each Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any
time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank (including,
without limitation, its branches) to or for the credit or the account of
the Company against any and all of the obligations of the Company now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not
such Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the
Company after any such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
set-off and application. The rights of each Bank under this subsection are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation,
other rights of set-off) which such Bank may have.

9.9 Adjustments. If any Bank (a "benefitted Bank") shall at any
time receive any payment of all or part of its Revolving Credit Loans or
Liquidity Facility Loans, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in
respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant
to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in clause (f) of Section
7, or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such payment to, or any
collateral received by, any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other
Bank's Revolving Credit Loans or Liquidity Facility Loans, as the case may
be, or interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from
the other Banks or Liquidity Facility Banks, as the case may be, such
portion of each such other Bank's Revolving Credit Loans or Liquidity
Facility Loans, as the case may be, or shall provide such other Banks or
Liquidity Facility Banks, as the case may be, with the benefits of any such
collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral
or proceeds ratably with each of the Banks or Liquidity Facility Banks, as
the case may be; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted
Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits
returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The
Company agrees that each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's
Revolving Credit Loans or Liquidity Facility Loans, as the case may be, may
exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of
set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Bank were the
direct holder of such portion.

9.10 New Banks. Subject to the provisions of subsection 9.12,
during the term of this Agreement with the consent of the Company and upon
notification to the Agent, one or more additional Commercial Banks may
become a party to this Agreement by executing a New Bank Supplement hereto
with the Company and the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D-2,
whereupon such Commercial Bank (herein called a "New Bank") shall become a
Bank for all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party
hereto and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this
Agreement, and Schedule I hereto shall be deemed to be amended to add the
name and Commitment of such New Bank. Effective as of the date on which
any such New Bank becomes a Bank pursuant to the provisions of this
subsection 9.10, the aggregate Commitments shall be increased by the amount
of such New Bank's Commitment. If on the date upon which such New Bank
becomes a Bank pursuant to the provisions of this subsection 9.10, there is
an unpaid principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans, the Company shall
borrow Revolving Credit Loans from such New Bank through the Agent pursuant
to subsection 2.1, in an amount determined by multiplying the amount of
such New Bank's Commitment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the then unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and the
denominator of which shall be the aggregate Commitments of the Banks other
than the New Bank. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
there are Eurodollar Loans outstanding, a Commercial Bank that becomes a
New Bank will make Eurodollar Loans to the Company (pro rata according to
its Commitment Percentage) having Interest Periods corresponding to the
then unexpired portions of the respective Interest Periods of such
Eurodollar Loans and bearing interest at a rate equal to the respective
interest rates then applicable to such Eurodollar Loans. The Agent shall
advise the Banks of each addition of a New Bank hereunder, of the amount of
its Commitment and of the amount of any borrowing from it hereunder made
simultaneously upon its addition.

9.11 Increase in Commitments. Subject to the provisions of
subsection 9.12, during the term of this Agreement, with the consent of the
Company and upon notification to the Agent, any Bank may increase the
amount of its Commitment by executing a Commitment Increase Supplement
hereto with the Company and the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit
D-3, whereupon such Bank shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of
this Agreement with respect to the full amount of its Commitment as so
increased, and Schedule I hereto shall be deemed to be amended to add the
increased Commitment of such Bank. Effective as of the date on which any
such Bank increases its Commitment pursuant to the provisions of this
subsection 9.11, the aggregate Commitments shall be increased by the amount
of such Bank's additional Commitment. If on the date upon which such Bank
increases its Commitment pursuant to this subsection 9.11 there is an
unpaid principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans, the Company shall borrow
Revolving Credit Loans from such Bank through the Agent, in an amount
determined by multiplying the amount of the increase in such Bank's
Commitment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then unpaid
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and the denominator of which
shall be the aggregate Commitments of the Banks other than the amount of
the additional Commitment of such Bank. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if there are Eurodollar Loans outstanding, a Bank that
increases its Commitment pursuant to this subsection 9.11 will make
Eurodollar Loans to the Company (pro rata according to the amount of the
increase in such Bank's Commitment) having Interest Periods corresponding
to the then unexpired portions of the respective Interest Periods of such
Eurodollar Loans and bearing interest at a rate equal to the respective
interest rates then applicable to such Eurodollar Loans. The Agent shall
advise the Banks of such increase in the Commitment of a Bank and of the
amount of any borrowing from it hereunder made simultaneously upon such
increase.

9.12 Changing Designations of Liquidity Facility Banks. The
Company shall have the right to change the designation of a Bank or
Liquidity Facility Bank to (a) cause a Bank to become a Liquidity Facility
Bank or (b) cause a Liquidity Facility Bank to no longer be a Liquidity
Facility Bank, provided that no such change shall become effective unless
(i) the Bank affected thereby shall have agreed to such change and (ii)
prior written notification thereof shall have been delivered to the Agent.

9.13 Tax Forms. If any Bank which becomes a party to this
Agreement on any day after the date hereof pursuant to subsection 9.7 or
9.10 is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United
States or any state thereof, such Bank shall, on the date such Person
becomes a Bank, (i) represent to the transferor Bank (if applicable), the
Agent and the Company that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will
be required to be withheld by the Agent, the Company or the transferor Bank
(if applicable) with respect to any payments to be made to such Bank in
respect of the Loans hereunder, (ii) furnish to the transferor Bank (if
applicable), the Agent and the Company either U.S. Internal Revenue Service
Form 4224 or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 (wherein such Bank
claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax
on all interest payments hereunder) and (iii) agree (for the benefit of the
transferor Bank (if applicable), the Agent and the Company) to provide the
transferor Bank (if applicable), the Agent and the Company a new Form 4224
or Form 1001 upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously
delivered form and comparable statements in accordance with applicable U.S.
laws and regulations and amendments duly executed and completed by such
Bank, and to comply from time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and
regulations with regard to such withholding tax exemption.

9.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more
of the parties hereto on any number of separate counterparts and all of
said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the
parties shall be lodged with the Company and the Agent.

9.15 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

9.16 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Company hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally:

(a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
proceeding commenced by any party hereto relating to this Agreement,
or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof,
to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of New York, the courts of the United States of America for the
Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof;

(b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought
in such courts, and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court
or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court
and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

(c) agrees that services of process in any such action or
proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or
certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage
prepaid, to the Company at its address set forth in subsection 9.2 or
at such other address of which the Agent shall have been notified with
copies addressed as set forth in subsection 9.2; and

(d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit
the right to sue in any other jurisdiction.

9.17 Integration. This Agreement represents the agreement of
each party with respect to the subject matter hereof and there are no
promises or representations by the Agent or any Bank relative to the
subject matter hereof not reflected herein.

9.18 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE COMPANY, THE AGENT AND THE
BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND FOR ANY
COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement
to be duly executed and delivered by their proper and duly authorized
officers as of the day and year first above written.

SECTION 2. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF THE COMMITMENTS

2.1 The Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, each Bank severally agrees to make loans ("Loans") to the Company
from time to time during the Commitment Period in an aggregate principal
amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed such Bank's Transferred
Commitment at such time set opposite such Bank's name in the most recent
effective notice delivered by Chrysler pursuant to subsection 2.17 of the
Chrysler Agreement. During the Commitment Period, the Company may use such
Commitment by borrowing, prepaying or repaying the Loans of such Bank, in
whole or in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof.

(b) Loans hereunder may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans,
or part Base Rate Loans and part Eurodollar Loans, as determined by the
Company and notified to the Agent in accordance with subsection 2.2,
provided that no Eurodollar Loans shall be made after the date which is
seven days prior to the Termination Date.

2.2 Procedure for Borrowing. (a) The Company may borrow under
the Commitments during the Commitment Period on any Business Day, provided
that the Company shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must
be received by the Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, (i) three
Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, if all or any part of
the requested Loans are to be initially Eurodollar Loans, and (ii) one
Business Day prior to the requested Borrowing Date, otherwise) specifying
(A) the amount to be borrowed, (B) the requested Borrowing Date, (C)
whether the borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Loan or a Base Rate Loan or a
combination thereof, and (D) if such borrowing is to be entirely or partly
a Eurodollar Loan, the length of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar
Loan. Upon receipt of such notice, the Agent shall promptly notify each
Bank thereof. Not later than 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the
Borrowing Date specified in such notice, each Bank shall (subject to
subsection 9.3(b)) deposit in its Clearing Account an amount in immediately
available funds equal to the amount of the Loan to be made by such Bank. 
The Agent shall, pursuant to subsection 9.3(a), cause such amount to be
withdrawn from each such Clearing Account and shall make the aggregate
amount so withdrawn available to the Company by depositing the proceeds
thereof in the account of the Company with the Agent on the date such Loans
are made for transmittal by the Agent upon the Company's request. Each
borrowing pursuant to the Commitments shall be in an aggregate principal
amount of the lesser of (i) $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof or (ii) the then Available Transferred
Commitments, provided that, with respect to any borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans, after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.6 shall not have been
contravened.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank
prior to a Borrowing Date that such Bank will not make available to the
Agent such Bank's ratable portion of such borrowing through such Bank's
Clearing Account, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion
available to the Agent through such Bank's Clearing Account on the date of
such borrowing in accordance with subsection 2.2(a) and the Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company on such date a
corresponding amount. If the Agent does, in such circumstances, make
available to the Company such amount, such Bank shall within three Business
Days following such Borrowing Date make such ratable portion available to
the Agent, together with interest thereon for each day from and including
such Borrowing Date that such ratable portion was not made available, to
but excluding the date such Bank makes its share of such borrowing
available to the Agent, at the Effective Federal Funds Rate. If such
amount is so made available, such payment to the Agent shall constitute
such Bank's Loan on such Borrowing Date for all purposes of this Agreement. 
If such amount is not so made available to the Agent, then the Agent shall
notify the Company of such failure and on the fourth Business Day following
such Borrowing Date, the Company shall pay to the Agent such ratable
portion, together with interest thereon for each day that the Company had
the use of such ratable portion at the Effective Federal Funds Rate. 
Nothing contained in this subsection 2.2(b) shall relieve any Bank which
has failed to make available its ratable portion of any borrowing hereunder
from its obligation to do so in accordance with the terms hereof.

(c) The failure of any Bank to make the Loan to be made by it on
any Borrowing Date shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if
any, hereunder to make its Loan on such Borrowing Date, but no Bank shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be
made by such other Bank on such Borrowing Date.

2.3 Repayment of Outstanding Loans. The Company shall repay all
outstanding Loans (together with all accrued unpaid interest thereon) on
the Termination Date.

2.4 Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Bank shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of the Company to the appropriate lending office of such Bank
resulting from each Loan made by such lending office of such Bank from time
to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
to such lending office of such Bank from time to time under this Agreement.

(b) The Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to subsection
9.7(f), and a subaccount for each Bank, in which Register and subaccounts
(taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, the Type of each Loan made and the Interest Period (if any)
applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the Company to each Bank
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder
from the Company and each Bank's share thereof.

(c) The entries made in the Register and accounts maintained
pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection 2.4 shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations of the Company therein recorded;
provided, however, that the failure of any Bank or the Agent to maintain
such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error
therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to
repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Company by such Bank
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

2.5 Prepayments. The Company may, at any time and from time to
time, prepay the Loans hereunder, in whole or in part, without premium or
penalty, upon prior notice to the Agent (which notice must be received by
the Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time (i) three Business Days
prior to the repayment date in the case of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) one
Business Day prior to the repayment date otherwise) specifying the date and
amount of prepayment, and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans,
Base Rate Loans or a combination thereof, and, if a combination thereof,
the amount allocable to each, provided that, each prepayment of Eurodollar
Loans on a day other than the last day of the related Interest Period shall
require the payment of any amounts payable by the Company pursuant to
subsection 2.16. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Agent shall
promptly notify each Bank thereof. Any such notice shall be irrevocable
and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on
the date specified, together with accrued interest to such date on the
amount prepaid. Partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal
amount of $25,000,000 or a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and
after giving effect thereto subsection 2.6 shall not have been contravened.

2.6 Minimum Amount of Eurodollar Tranches. All borrowings,
payments, prepayments, continuations and conversions hereunder shall be in
such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving
effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans
comprising any Eurodollar Tranche shall not be less than $50,000,000.

2.7 Interest Rate and Payment Dates. (a) Each Eurodollar Loan
shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period therefor on
the unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the
Eurodollar Rate determined for such Interest Period in accordance with the
terms hereof plus the Applicable Eurodollar Margin.

(b) The Base Rate Loans shall bear interest for each day on the
unpaid principal amount thereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate
determined for such day plus the Applicable Base Rate Margin in effect for
such day.

(c) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan,
(ii) any interest payable thereon or (iii) any other amount payable
hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a
rate per annum which is (x) in the case of overdue principal, the rate that
would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions
of this subsection 2.7 plus 2% or (y) in the case of any overdue interest
or other amount, the rate described in subsection 2.7(b) plus 2%, in each
case from the date of such non-payment to (but excluding) the date on which
such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment).

(d) Interest shall be payable in arrears (i) with respect to
Eurodollar Loans having an Interest Period of three months or less, on the
last day of such Interest Period, (ii) with respect to Eurodollar Loans
having an Interest Period longer than three months, on each day which is
three months, or a whole multiple thereof, after the first day of such
Interest Period and the last day of such Interest Period, (iii) with
respect to Base Rate Loans, on the last day of each March, June, September
and December, and (iv) with respect to all Loans, upon each repayment,
prepayment or conversion thereof; provided that interest accruing pursuant
to paragraph (c) of this subsection shall be payable on demand. The amount
of interest on any Loans to be paid on any date as specified above shall in
each case be determined under the assumption that the Utilization for the
Utilization Period(s) during which such interest accrued was less than 33-
1/3%. On the first Business Day following the last day of each Excess
Utilization Period, the Company shall pay to the Agent, for the benefit of
the Banks, an additional amount of interest equal to the excess (if any) of
(i) the amount of interest which accrued during such Utilization Period
after giving effect to the actual Utilization for such Utilization Period
(whether or not such accrued interest was actually payable during such
Utilization Period) over (ii) the amount of interest which would have
accrued during such Utilization Period if the Utilization during such
Utilization Period had been less than 33-1/3%.

2.8 Mandatory Repayments. The Company, without notice or
demand, shall immediately repay the Loans hereunder to the extent that the
aggregate amount thereof exceeds the Commitments from time to time in
effect.

2.9 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) The Company may
elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to Base Rate Loans, by
giving the Agent at least two Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of
such election, provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may
only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. 
The Company may elect from time to time to convert Base Rate Loans to
Eurodollar Loans by giving the Agent at least three Business Days' prior
irrevocable notice of such election. Any such notice of conversion to
Eurodollar Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period or
Interest Periods therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice the Agent shall
promptly notify each Bank thereof. All or any part of outstanding
Eurodollar Loans and Base Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein,
provided that (i) no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan
when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent has
or the Required Banks have determined in its or their sole discretion that
such conversion is not appropriate, (ii) any such conversion may only be
made if, after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.6 shall not have been
contravened and (iii) no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar
Loan after the date that is seven days prior to the Termination Date.

(b) Any Eurodollar Loans may be continued as such upon the
expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the
Company giving irrevocable notice to the Agent, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in
subsection 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable
to such Loans, provided that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such
(i) when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent
has or the Required Banks have determined in its or their sole discretion
that such continuation is not appropriate, (ii) if, after giving effect
thereto, subsection 2.6 would be contravened or (iii) after the date that
is seven days prior to the Termination Date and provided, further, that if
the Company shall fail to give any required notice as described above in
this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the
preceding proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate
Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period.

2.10 Computation of Interest. (a) Interest (other than
interest calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate) shall be calculated on
the basis of a 360-day year, for the actual days elapsed. Interest
calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis
of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days
elapsed. The Agent shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Company and
the Banks of each determination of the Eurodollar Rate with respect to
Eurodollar Loans. Any change in the interest rate in respect of a Loan
resulting from a change in the Base Rate, the Applicable Base Rate Margin
or the Applicable Eurodollar Margin shall become effective as of the
opening of business on the day on which a change in the Base Rate shall
become effective or such Applicable Base Rate Margin or Applicable
Eurodollar Margin changes as provided herein, as the case may be. The
Agent shall notify the Company and the Banks of the effective date and the
amount of each such change in the Base Rate.

(b) Each determination, pursuant to and in accordance with any
provision of this Agreement, of an interest rate applicable to a Eurodollar
Loan for any Interest Period by the Agent, and each determination by a
Reference Bank of a rate with respect to a Eurodollar Loan for any Interest
Period to be notified to the Agent pursuant to the definition of
"Eurodollar Rate" shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and the
Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Agent shall, at the request of
the Company, deliver to the Company a statement showing any quotations
given by the Reference Banks and the computations used by the Agent in
determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 2.7(a).

(c) If any Reference Bank's Commitment shall terminate
(otherwise than on termination of all the Commitments), or, as the case may
be, Loans made by it hereunder are assigned, or prepaid or repaid
(otherwise than on the ratable prepayment or repayment of the Loans among
the Banks) for any reason whatsoever, such Reference Bank shall thereupon
cease to be a Reference Bank and, if as a result of the foregoing, there
shall be only one Reference Bank remaining, then the Agent (after
consultation with the Company and the Banks) shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, by notice to the Company and the Banks, designate another Bank
that is willing to act as a Reference Bank so that there shall at all times
be at least two Reference Banks. In acting to so designate another Bank to
serve as a Reference Bank, the Agent will use its best efforts to ensure
that one Reference Bank will, at all times, be a Bank that has its
headquarters office located outside the United States.

(d) If any of the Reference Banks shall be unable or shall
otherwise fail to provide notice of a rate to the Agent upon its request
with respect to a Eurodollar Loan, the Eurodollar Rate shall be determined
on the basis of rates provided in notices of the remaining Reference Banks.

2.11 Inability to Determine Eurodollar Rate. In the event that
(a) the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Company) that by reason of circumstances affecting the
relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate in respect of any Eurodollar Loans, or (b)
the Required Banks determine (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Company) and shall notify the Agent that the rates of
interest referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Rate" as the basis
upon which the rate of interest for Eurodollar Loans is to be determined do
not adequately cover the cost to the Banks of making or maintaining
Eurodollar Loans, in each case with respect to proposed Loans that the
Company has requested to be made as a Eurodollar Loan, the Agent shall
forthwith give facsimile transmission or other written notice of such
determination to the Company and the Banks at least one Business Day prior
to the requested Borrowing Date for such Eurodollar Loan. If such notice
is given, any requested borrowing of a Eurodollar Loan shall be made as a
Base Rate Loan. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Agent, no
further Eurodollar Loans shall be made.

2.12 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each borrowing
(except borrowings pursuant to subsection 2.13) by the Company from the
Banks and any reduction of the amount of the Commitments of the Banks
hereunder (except for the reduction or termination of a particular Bank's
Commitment pursuant to subsection 2.17) shall be made pro rata according to
the amounts of the then existing Commitments. Each payment (including each
prepayment) by the Company on account of principal and interest (except for
payments to a particular Bank pursuant to subsection 2.13, 2.14, 2.16, or
2.17), shall be made on a pro rata basis according to the amounts of the
then outstanding Loans of the Banks hereunder. All payments (including
prepayments) by the Company shall be made without setoff or counterclaim to
the Agent for the account of the Banks at the office of the Agent referred
to in subsection 9.2 in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The
Agent shall promptly distribute such payments to each Bank entitled to
receive a portion thereof by causing such Bank's portion of such payment to
be deposited in such Bank's Clearing Account. If any payment hereunder
(other than a payment in respect of a Eurodollar Loan) becomes due and
payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a
Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,
the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day
unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into
another calendar month in which event such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any
payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest
thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Company
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that
the Company will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that
the Company has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to
each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such
Bank. If and to the extent the Company shall not have so made such payment
in full to the Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon,
for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to such
Bank to but excluding the date such Bank repays such amount to the Agent at
the Effective Federal Funds Rate for each such day. Nothing contained in
this subsection 2.12(b) shall relieve the Company from its obligations to
make payments on all amounts due hereunder in accordance with the terms
hereof.

2.13 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if
any law, regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any Bank
to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a)
the commitment of such Bank hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans shall
forthwith be cancelled and (b) such Bank's Loans then outstanding as
Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall, if required by law and if such Bank so
requests, be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the date
specified by such Bank in such notice. To the extent that such affected
Eurodollar Loans are made as (or converted into) Base Rate Loans, all
payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such Eurodollar
Loans shall be applied instead to such Bank's Base Rate Loans. The Company
hereby agrees promptly to pay any Bank, upon its demand, any additional
amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for any costs incurred by such
Bank in making any conversion in accordance with this subsection 2.13,
including, but not limited to, any interest or fees payable by such Bank to
lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar
Loans hereunder (such Bank's notice of such costs, as certified to the
Company through the Agent, to be conclusive absent manifest error).

2.14 Increased Costs. (a) In the event that any law,
regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority enacted or made subsequent to
the date hereof:

(i) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank; or

(ii) does or shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank
of making, or maintaining advances or extensions of credit or to reduce any
amounts receivable hereunder (such increase in cost or reduction in amounts
receivable, "Increased Costs") then, in any such case, the Company shall
promptly pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank, upon the written
demand of such Bank to the Company (with a copy to the Agent), so long as
such Increased Costs are not otherwise included in the amounts required to
be paid to such Bank pursuant to subsection 2.13, 2.14(b), 2.16, or 2.17,
any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such Increased
Costs which such Bank deems to be material as determined by such Bank with
respect to its Eurodollar Loans. If a Bank becomes entitled to claim any
additional amounts pursuant to this subsection 2.14(a), it shall promptly
notify the Company, through the Agent, of the event by reason of which it
has become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by a Bank, through the Agent,
to the Company shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(b) Upon notice from any Affected Bank (as hereinafter defined),
the Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Affected Bank an
additional amount for each Eurodollar Loan of such Affected Bank, payable
on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, equal to

P X [[R / (1.00 - r)] - R] X [T / 360]

Where P = the principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan of such Bank;

R = the Eurodollar Rate (expressed as a decimal) for such Interest
Period;

T = the number of days in such Interest Period during which such Bank
was an "Affected Bank"; and

r = the aggregate of rates (expressed as a decimal) of reserve
requirements current on the date two Business Days prior to the
beginning of such Interest Period (including, without limitation,
basic, supplemental, marginal and emergency reserves) under any
regulations of the Federal Reserve Board or other Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction with respect thereto, as now and
from time to time hereafter in effect, dealing with reserve
requirements prescribed for eurocurrency funding (currently
referred to as "Eurocurrency liabilities" in Regulation D of the
Federal Reserve Board) maintained by a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System.

The term "Affected Bank" shall mean any Bank party to this
Agreement that is (i) organized under the laws of the United States or any
State thereof or (ii) a bank organized under laws other than those of the
United States of America or a State thereof that is funding its Eurodollar
Loans through a branch or agency located in the United States of America. 
Each Bank agrees to notify the Agent (A) by appropriate notification on its
Addendum in the case of each original Bank party hereto and (B) in the case
of each New Bank, and each Assignee (as defined in the Chrysler Agreement)
that is not already a Bank, upon its becoming a party hereto, whether or
not it is an Affected Bank, and of any subsequent change of status,
disclosing the effective date of such change.

2.15 Transfer of Eurodollar Loans. Upon the occurrence of any
of the events specified in subsection 2.13 or 2.14(a), each Bank whose
Eurodollar Loans are affected by any such event agrees that it will
transfer its Eurodollar Loans affected by any such event to another branch
office (or, if such Bank so elects, to an affiliate) of such Bank, provided
that such transfer shall be made only if such Bank shall have determined in
good faith (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties) that, (a) on the basis of existing
circumstances, such transfer will avoid such events and will not result in
any additional costs, liabilities or expenses to such Bank or to the
Company and (b) such transfer is otherwise consistent with the interests of
such Bank.

2.16 Indemnity. The Company agrees to indemnify each Bank and
to hold such Bank harmless from all losses or expenses (including, but not
limited to, any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable
by such Bank to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its
Eurodollar Loans hereunder, but excluding loss of the Applicable Eurodollar
Margin) which such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a)
failure by the Company in making any payment when due (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) of the principal amount of or interest on the
Eurodollar Loans of such Bank, (b) failure by the Company in making a
borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, or a conversion into or continuation of
Eurodollar Loans, after the Company has given a notice requesting or
accepting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c)
failure by the Company in making any prepayment after the Company has given
a notice in accordance with subsection 2.5 or (d) a prepayment of a
Eurodollar Loan on a day that is not the last day of the Interest Period
with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued
on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for
the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow,
convert or continue to the last day of the relevant Interest Period (or
proposed Interest Period), in each case at the applicable rate of interest
for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable
Eurodollar Margin) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by such Bank) which would have accrued to such Bank on such
amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with
leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. The agreements in this
subsection 2.16 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

2.17 Taxes. (a) In the event that the adoption of any law,
regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, in each case after the date hereof,
shall require any Taxes (as hereinafter defined) to be withheld or deducted
from any amount payable to any Bank under this Agreement, upon notice by
such Bank to the Company (with a copy to the Agent) to the effect that (i)
as a result of the adoption of such law, rule, regulation, treaty or
directive or a change therein or in the interpretation thereof, Taxes are
being withheld or deducted from amounts payable to such Bank under this
Agreement and (ii) such Bank has taken all action required to be taken by
it to avoid the imposition of such Taxes pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
subsection 2.17 prior to demanding indemnification under this paragraph
(a), the Company will pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank
additional amounts so that such additional amounts, together with amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement, will yield to such Bank, after
deduction from such increased amount of all Taxes required to be withheld
or deducted therefrom, the amount stated to be payable under this
Agreement. The term "Taxes" shall mean all net income, stamp or other
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings,
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any country (or by any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), excluding,
with respect to any Bank, net income and franchise taxes imposed with
respect to net income of any country (or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein) where such Bank is organized or, in
respect of such Bank's Eurodollar Loans, by the country (or any political
subdivision or tax authority thereof or therein) where such Bank's
Eurodollar Loans are booked and, in respect of such Bank's Base Rate Loans,
by the country (or any political subdivision or tax authority thereof or
therein) where such Bank's Base Rate Loans are booked. If the Company
fails to pay any Taxes when due following notification by any Bank as
provided above, the Company shall indemnify such Bank for any incremental
taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any Bank as a
result of any such failure by the Company to make such payment. The
Company may, upon payment by the Company to any Bank claiming
indemnification under this paragraph (a) of any amount payable by the
Company to such Bank, elect by not less than four Business Days' prior
written notice to such Bank to terminate the Commitment of such Bank and
prepay the Loans of such Bank outstanding hereunder on the next day upon
which a prepayment may be made pursuant to subsection 2.5.

(b) Each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver to
the Company and the Agent (i) two duly completed copies of United States
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 or any successor applicable
form, as the case may be, and (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or
W-9 or any successor form. Each such Bank also agrees to deliver to the
Company and the Agent two further copies of the said Form 1001 or 4224 and
Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable forms or other manner of
certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring
a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Company,
and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by
the Company or the Agent, unless in any such case an event (including,
without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred
prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required
which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank
from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and
such Bank so advises the Company and the Agent. Such Bank shall certify
(i) in the case of Form 1001 or 4224, that it is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes and (ii) in the case of a Form W-8 or 
W-9, that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup
withholding tax.

(c) No Bank may request indemnification for any Taxes from the
Company under paragraph (a) of this subsection 2.17 to the extent that such
Taxes would have been avoided or reduced by such Bank's transfer of its
Loans affected by such event to another office of such Bank (or to an
affiliate of such Bank), by such Bank's properly claiming the benefit of
any exemption from or reduction of such Taxes (whether provided by statute,
treaty or otherwise) including, without limitation, by delivering the forms
required by paragraph (b) of this subsection 2.17, or by such Bank's taking
any other action which in its judgment is reasonable to avoid or reduce
such Taxes, provided that such Bank shall not be required to (i) take any
action which in the reasonable judgment of such Bank could directly or
indirectly result in any increased cost or expense or in any loss of
opportunity to such Bank unless the Company shall have provided to such
Bank indemnity or reimbursement therefor in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such Bank or (ii) claim or apply any tax credit against
such Taxes.

(d) Within 30 days after the payment by the Company of any
income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions or withholdings, withheld or deducted from any amount payable to
any Bank under this Agreement, and irrespective of whether such Bank is
entitled to demand indemnification in respect thereof under paragraph (a)
above, the Company will furnish to such Bank (with a copy to the Agent),
the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

2.18 Transferred Commitment. (a) The Company and each Bank
agree that Chrysler may by giving four days' notice to the Agent, each Bank
and the Company (which notice shall, upon receipt by the Agent supersede
and cancel all prior notices hereunder), consent to the transfer to and
borrowing by the Company hereunder of such portion of the Available
Company/CFC Commitments (as such term is defined in the Chrysler Agreement)
as may be specified in such notice (as to each Bank, its "Transferred
Commitment"; collectively for all the Banks, the "Transferred
Commitments"). As of the Effective Date, the Transferred Commitments shall
be zero, unless Chrysler shall have delivered a notice pursuant to the
foregoing sentence at least four days prior to the Effective Date. Each
notice given pursuant to this subsection shall indicate the total
Transferred Commitments and as to each Bank, its pro rata Transferred
Commitment.

(b) The Company also agrees that Chrysler may, by giving thirty
days' written notice to the Agent, each Bank and the Company, withdraw any
consent to the transfer to and borrowing by the Company given in accordance
with subsection 2.18(a) in respect of any portion of the Transferred
Commitments not utilized by the Company as of the date of such notice.

2.19 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans hereunder shall
be used by the Company for general corporate purposes.

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 

In order to induce the Banks to enter into this Agreement and to
make the Loans herein provided for, the Company hereby represents and
warrants to each Bank that:

3.1 Financial Condition. The consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 1993 and the related
consolidated statements of net earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year
ended on such date, certified by Deloitte & Touche, copies of which have
been delivered to each Bank, present fairly the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal year
then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as at March 31, 1994 and the related consolidated
statements of net earnings and cash flows for the three-month period ended
on such date, certified by a Responsible Officer, copies of which have been
delivered to each Bank, present fairly the consolidated financial condition
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated
results of their operations for the three-month period then ended (subject
to normal year-end audit adjustments). Such financial statements,
including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP. As at March 31, 1994, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries had any asset, liability, contingent obligation, liability
for taxes, long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment
material to the financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, which was not reflected in the foregoing statements or in
the notes thereto.

3.2 No Change. Between December 31, 1993 and the Effective
Date, there has been no material adverse change in the business, operations
or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

3.3 Corporate Existence. The Company (a) is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Michigan, and (b) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do
business and is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which the
character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature
of business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except in
the case of this clause (b) to the extent that the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 

3.4 Corporate Authorization; No Violation. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement are within the
corporate powers of the Company, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and do not contravene any Requirement of Law or
Contractual Obligation of the Company, except to the extent that such
contravention would not have a material adverse effect on the business,
operations or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole or on the ability of the Company to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement or on the rights and remedies of the Agent and the
Banks hereunder.

3.5 Government Authorization. No authorization or approval or
other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required to be obtained or made by the Company for the due
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement.

3.6 Federal Regulations. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is principally engaged in the business of extending credit for
the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of
Regulation U, T, G or X issued by the Federal Reserve Board), and no
proceeds of any borrowing hereunder will be used to purchase or carry any
margin stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any margin stock.

3.7 Enforceable Obligations. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered on behalf of the Company, and this Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by principles of equity, whether considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law.

3.8 No Material Litigation. No litigation, investigation or
proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by or against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or against any of its or their respective
properties or revenues, in which there is a reasonable likelihood of an
adverse determination (a) with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, if such adverse determination would have
a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement or on the rights and remedies of the Agent
and the Banks hereunder or (b) which would, if adversely determined, have a
material adverse effect on the business, operations, property or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

3.9 Taxes. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed
or caused to be filed all material tax returns which to the knowledge of
the Company are required to be filed, and has paid all material taxes shown
to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments made against it
or any of its property and all other taxes, fees and other charges imposed
on it or any of its property by any Governmental Authority (other than
those the amount or validity of which is currently being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in
conformity with GAAP, if any, have been provided on the books of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be).

3.10 ERISA. No Prohibited Transaction or Accumulated Funding
Deficiency (other than those that have been waived by the Internal Revenue
Service) has occurred since July 1, 1974 with respect to any Plan and no
Reportable Event has occurred since July 1, 1974 with respect to any Plan
which could in either case subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to any tax, penalty or other liabilities in the aggregate material in
relation to the business, operations, property or financial or other
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The
projected benefit obligations with respect to all benefits, both vested and
nonvested, under all Single Employer Plans (based on the most recently
available actuarial information and computed in accordance with Statement
of Accounting Standards No. 87) maintained by the Company or a Commonly
Controlled Entity did not exceed, at December 31, 1993, the fair value of
the assets of such Plans by more than $2,500,000,000.

3.11 Investment Company Act; Other Regulations. The Company is
not an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment
company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended. The Company is not subject to regulation under any Federal or
state statute or regulation which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

3.12 Ownership of Property; Liens. The Company and its U.S.
Subsidiaries have good title in fee simple to or valid leasehold interests
in their respective property that is material to the operation of their
respective businesses, subject to defects in title and leasehold and other
interests which are not material to the business, operations and financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and none of
such property is subject to any Lien other than Liens excepted under
subsection 6.7.

proceedings and reserves in conformity with GAAP with respect thereto have

may be, and except for delinquent obligations which do not materially
adversely affect the financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

and will cause each Subsidiary to, preserve, renew and keep in full force
and effect its corporate existence and take all reasonable action to
maintain all rights, privileges and franchises necessary or desirable in

franchises the loss of which would not in the aggregate in the reasonable
business judgment of the Company have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations, property or financial or other condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and except as otherwise
permitted by subsection 6.6; and keep all property useful and necessary in

such notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Responsible Officer
specifying the nature of such event, the period of existence thereof, and
the action that the Company or the relevant Finance Subsidiary proposes to
take with respect thereto), (c) of any litigation, proceeding,
investigation or dispute which may exist at any time between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any Governmental Authority or any other Person
which might have a materially adverse effect upon the business, operations,
assets or condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (d) of any change in the ownership by Chrysler of shares of

addition to such notice, deliver to the Agent whichever of the following
may be applicable: (A) a certificate of a Responsible Officer setting
forth details as to such Reportable Event and the action that the Company
or Commonly Controlled Entity proposes to take with respect thereto,
together with a copy of any notice of such Reportable Event that may be
required to be filed with PBGC, or (B) any notice delivered by PBGC
evidencing its intent to institute such proceedings or any notice to PBGC
that such Plan is to be terminated, as the case may be.

SECTION 6. NEGATIVE COVENANTS

The Company hereby covenants and agrees that so long as the
Commitments remain in effect, any Loan made hereunder remains outstanding
and unpaid or any other amount is owing to any Bank or the Agent hereunder:

6.1 Limitation on Indebtedness and Guaranties. The Company will
not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, create, assume or incur, or
become, remain or be liable on any Indebtedness or Guaranty other than

(i) in the case of the Company,

(A) Senior Debt or Guaranties of the Company to the extent
permitted by the proviso to this subsection 6.1;

(B) Subordinated Debt, and

(C) Capital Notes; and

(ii) in the case of any Subsidiary (other than any Finance
Subsidiary which is a U.S. Subsidiary), Indebtedness and Guaranties of
such Subsidiary to the extent permitted by the proviso to this
subsection 6.1;

provided, however, that the Company will not permit the sum, without double
counting, of (x) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Senior Debt
and of Indebtedness of Subsidiaries and (y) the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of obligations entitled to the benefits of any Guaranty by
the Company or any Subsidiary, in each case as of the last day of any
calendar month, to exceed 650% of the Capital Base as of such last day (or
675% of the Capital Base as of the last day of any three consecutive
calendar months immediately succeeding six consecutive calendar months in
which such aggregate outstanding principal amount did not exceed 650% of
the Capital Base as of the last day of each such month).

6.2 Consolidated Tangible Net Worth. The Company will not
permit Consolidated Tangible Net Worth to be less than $1,500,000,000.

6.3 Fixed Charges Coverage Ratio. The Company will not permit
its "net earnings available for fixed charges" to be less than 110% of its
"fixed charges" for any fiscal year of the Company, or for the portion of
any fiscal year of the Company ending with the last day of each calendar
quarter therein. For the purposes of this subsection 6.3, "net earnings
available for fixed charges" and "fixed charges" shall be determined for
the Company and for the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis.

For the purposes of this subsection 6.3:

(a) "Net earnings available for fixed charges" shall mean net
income after deducting operating and maintenance expenses, taxes other
than federal, state and other income taxes, except to the extent
stated below in the case of consolidated subsidiaries, depreciation
and depletion, but excluding extraordinary nonrecurring items of
income or expense appearing in the regular consolidated financial
statements of the Company.

(b) "Fixed charges" shall mean interest on debt, amortization of
debt discount, and rentals for leased properties, except rentals under
leases having a term of one year or less.

(c) In determining net earnings and fixed charges on a
consolidated basis, all intercompany items and the portions of
earnings allocable to minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries
shall be eliminated, provision for or refund of income taxes of
consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company owns directly or
indirectly less than ninety percent of all classes of voting stock
shall be deducted or added, and fixed charges shall include fixed
charges and preferred dividends of consolidated subsidiaries that are
not intercompany items.

(d) Earnings attributable to assets or institutions acquired by
merger, consolidation, reorganization, succession, organization,
purchase or otherwise may be included for that part of the test period
which precedes such acquisition, provided that (i) if less than
substantially all assets of any other institution (or all or less than
all assets of any other type of business enterprise) is acquired, such
earnings may be included to the extent they are certified by an
independent accountant to be attributable to such assets and (ii) if
an institution (or substantially all of its assets) is acquired, such
earnings may be included if they are included in financial statements
of such institution prepared under generally accepted accounting
principles. Fixed charges and preferred dividends for the period of
such inclusion shall either include any additional fixed charges and
preferred dividends properly attributable to such acquisition as
certified by an independent accountant, or be the fixed charges and
preferred dividends with respect to debt and stock outstanding
immediately after such acquisition.

6.4 Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. The Company
will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, engage in any transaction
with an Affiliate (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) on terms
substantially less favorable to the Company or such Subsidiary than would
be obtainable at the time in comparable transactions of the Company or such
Subsidiary with Persons not Affiliates.

6.5 Limitation on Amendments to Income Maintenance Agreement. 
The Company will not amend, modify, terminate or grant any waiver under the
Income Maintenance Agreement, provided that the Company may enter into a
waiver, amendment or modification of the Income Maintenance Agreement which
is solely for the purposes of (a) extending the term thereof or relaxing or
lessening the restrictions on, or duties of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries thereunder or (b) conforming the provisions thereof relating
to the fixed charge coverage ratio to the provisions of subsection 6.3.

6.6 Limitation on Fundamental Change. (a) The Company will
not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, merge or consolidate with or
into any other Person, nor will the Company or any Subsidiary enter into
any Material Asset Disposition (as hereinafter defined) except that:

(i) the Company may merge or consolidate with or into any other
Person, provided that (A) the Company shall be the continuing or
surviving corporation, and (B) immediately after such merger or
consolidation, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing;

(ii) any Subsidiary may merge or consolidate (A) with or into the
Company (provided that the Company shall be the continuing or
surviving corporation), (B) with or into any one or more wholly-owned
Subsidiaries (provided that a wholly-owned Subsidiary shall be the
continuing or surviving corporation), (C) with or into any other
Person, if such Subsidiary shall be the continuing or surviving
corporation, shall continue to be a Subsidiary of the Company and
immediately after such merger or consolidation, no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or (D) with or into any
other Person, if the disposition of the stock of such Subsidiary by
its parent corporation does not constitute a Material Asset
Disposition; and

(iii) any Subsidiary may enter into any Material Asset Disposition
by which its assets are transferred to the Company or a wholly-owned
Subsidiary.

For purposes of this subsection 6.6, the term "Material Asset
Disposition" shall mean any transaction (not including a transaction (1) by
which a Lien is created, which is permitted by subsection 6.7, (2)
consisting of a sale of Receivables, or any interest therein, by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or (3) consisting of a lease of assets entered
into in the ordinary course of business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) consisting of the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition
of assets having a book value at the time of such transaction equal to or
greater than the Maximum Disposition Amount, and any group of related
sales, leases, transfers or other dispositions made within any period of
six consecutive calendar months commencing on or after the Effective Date
shall be treated as one transaction for purposes of determining whether the
same is a Material Asset Disposition, provided, that a sale of any of the
stock of, or any of the assets of, Chrysler First or any subsidiary
thereof, or the sale of any of the stock of, or any of the assets of,
Chrysler Capital, or any subsidiary thereof, shall not constitute a
"Material Asset Disposition". 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries will not engage in any
business other than the Finance Business, the Finance-Related Insurance
Business and the other businesses in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
are engaged as of the date hereof, and other than businesses in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be involved in connection with or
related to any workout, liquidation, foreclosure or other realization on or
disposition of assets in which it has a security interest, or any other
exercise of rights or remedies pursuant to a workout in connection with any
financing (whether equity or debt) provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person.

6.7 Limitation on Liens. (a) The Company will not, and will
not permit any Finance Subsidiary to, create, assume or incur, or suffer to
be created, assumed or incurred or to exist, any Lien in respect of any
property of any character of the Company or such Finance Subsidiary,
whether heretofore or hereafter acquired; excluding, however, from the
operation of this covenant:

Canadian Corporation securing obligations of such Subsidiary;

judgment or decree, or in connection with other proceedings or actions
at law or in equity by or against the Company or any of its Finance
Subsidiaries;

(iii) Liens created by any Finance Subsidiary in favor of the

(iv) any deposits to secure public or statutory obligations of
the Company or any of its Finance Subsidiaries, other than any such
deposit made as a result of or in connection with the occurrence of
any of the events described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of
subsection 7(g);

(v) any purchase money Liens in respect of fixed assets or other
physical or real properties heretofore or hereafter acquired by the

respect of such property at the time of acquisition thereof; provided,
however, that no such Lien shall extend to or cover any other property
of the Company or such Finance Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(vi) any Liens which are (A) in respect of fixed assets or other
physical properties of a corporation which is not a Finance Subsidiary
as of the date hereof, and (B) in existence at the time such
corporation becomes a Finance Subsidiary;

by paragraphs (i) through (v) above in respect of the same property
theretofore subject thereto or the extension, renewal or replacement
(without increase of principal amount) of the indebtedness secured
thereby;

(viii) Liens for taxes not yet due or which are being contested in
good faith and by appropriate proceedings if adequate reserves with
respect thereto are maintained on the books of the Company or such

materialmen's, repairmen's or other like Liens arising in the
ordinary course of business (A) which are not overdue for a period of
more than 60 days or (B) which are being contested in good faith and
by appropriate proceedings if adequate reserves with respect thereto

as the case may be, in accordance with GAAP;

(x) easements, rights-of-way, zoning and similar restrictions
and other similar encumbrances or title defects incurred in the
ordinary course of business which, in the aggregate, are not
substantial in amount, and which do not in any case materially detract
from the value of the property subject thereto or interfere with the
ordinary conduct of the business of the Company or its Finance
Subsidiaries;

(xi) any attachment or judgment lien, unless the judgment it
secures shall not, within 30 days after the entry thereof have been
discharged or execution thereof stayed pending appeal, or shall not
have been discharged within 30 days after the expiration of any such
stay; 

(xii) Liens granted on assets in connection with leveraged leases
and project financings entered into in the ordinary course of the
Finance Business; and

(xiii) Liens to secure Indebtedness and other obligations of the
Company or any of its Finance Subsidiaries not otherwise permitted by

of Indebtedness and other obligations secured thereby does not at any
time exceed $100,000,000.

(b) The Company will not permit any Domestic Subsidiary that is
not a Finance Subsidiary to create, assume or incur, or suffer to be
created, assumed or incurred or to exist, any Lien in respect of any
property of any character of such Domestic Subsidiary, whether heretofore
or hereafter acquired, excluding, however, from the operation of this
covenant:

Finance Subsidiary;

(ii) Liens on property of such Domestic Subsidiary that are
incurred in the ordinary course of the Finance Business or the Real
Estate Business of such Domestic Subsidiary; and

purpose of holding title to such property and engages in no activities
other than those related to holding title to such property.

will not permit any Commonly Controlled Entity to, withdraw from any

of which adequate reserve has been made by the Company or a Commonly
Controlled Entity) would exceed $10,000,000.

(b) The Company will not merge or consolidate any Plan in
respect of which it is the "employer" as defined in Section 3(5) of ERISA
with any Plan in respect of which Chrysler is the "employer" as so defined.

(a) the Company shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan made
hereunder when due in accordance with the terms hereof; or to pay any
interest on any Loan made hereunder or any other amount payable

maturity; or

SECTION 8. THE AGENT

8.1 Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints Chemical as the Agent of such Bank under this Agreement, and each
Bank hereby irrevocably authorizes Chemical as Agent for such Bank, to take
such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to
the Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Agent shall not have any duties
or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any
fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into
this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agent.

8.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. Without limiting the foregoing, the Agent may appoint CASC as
its agent to perform the functions of the Agent hereunder relating to the
advancing of funds to the Company and distribution of funds to the Banks
and to perform such other related functions of the Agent hereunder as are
reasonably incidental to such functions.

8.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agent, nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates
(including, without limitation, CASC) shall be (a) liable for any action
lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in
connection with this Agreement (except for its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct), or (b) responsible in any manner to any
of the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties
made by the Company or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or
provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this
Agreement or for any failure of the Company to perform its obligations
hereunder. The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Bank to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect
the properties, books or records of the Company.

8.4 Reliance by Agent and CASC. The Agent and CASC shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
cablegram, telegram, facsimile transmission, telex or teletype message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Company), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent and CASC
may deem and treat the Bank specified in the Register with respect to any
amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a
written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have
been filed with the Agent in accordance with subsection 9.7. The Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
this Agreement unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Required Banks (or, if so specified in this Agreement, all of the
Banks) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense which
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. The Agent shall, in all cases, be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request
of the Required Banks (or, if so specified in this Agreement, all of the
Banks), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and all future holders of the
obligations owing by the Company hereunder.

8.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
unless the Agent has received notice from a Bank or the Company referring
to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating
that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks,
and, if such notice is received from a Bank, the Agent shall give notice
thereof to the Company and each other Bank. Subject to the proviso
contained in the first sentence of subsection 9.1, the Agent shall take
such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
reasonably directed by the Required Banks (or, if so specified in this
Agreement, all of the Banks), provided that, unless and until the Agent
shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in
the best interests of the Banks.

8.6 Non-Reliance on Agent, Other Banks and CASC. Each Bank
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent, nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates (including,
without limitation, CASC) has made any representations or warranties to it
and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the
affairs of the Company, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by the Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the Agent and
CASC that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any
other Bank or CASC, and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Company and made its own decision to make its Loans
hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Bank or
CASC, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Company. Except for notices, reports
and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the
Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of the Company which may come into the possession of the
Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-
fact or affiliates.

8.7 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agent and
CASC (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company and without limiting the
obligation of the Company to do so), ratably according to the respective
amounts of their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on the date on
which indemnification is sought under this subsection 8.7 (or, if
indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall
have terminated, ratably in accordance with such Commitment Percentages
immediately prior to such date) from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the
Loans made hereunder) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Agent or CASC in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by the
Agent or CASC under or in connection with any of the foregoing, provided
that no Bank shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's or
CASC's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this
subsection 8.7 shall survive the payment of the Loans made hereunder and
all other amounts payable hereunder.

8.8 Agent in its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its
affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in
any kind of business with the Company as though the Agent were not the
Agent hereunder. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, the
Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any
Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent and the
terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include the Agent in its individual
capacity.

8.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent, upon 10
days' notice to the Banks and the Company, and may be removed at any time
with or without cause by the Required Banks. If the Agent shall resign or
be removed as Agent under this Agreement, then either (a) the Required
Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks,
which successor agent shall be approved by the Company, or (b) if a
successor agent shall not have been so appointed and approved within the
ten-day period following the Agent's notice to the Banks or its removal as
Agent, the Agent shall then, with the consent of the Company, appoint a
successor agent who shall serve as Agent until such time, if any, as the
Required Banks appoint, and the Company approves, a successor agent as
provided in (a) above. Upon its appointment pursuant to either clause (a)
or (b) above, such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and
duties of the Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent
effective upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and
duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or
deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this
Agreement or any holders of the obligations owing by the Company hereunder.
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions
of this Section 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 Amendments and Waivers. With the written consent of the
Required Banks, the Agent and the Company may, from time to time, enter
into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto for the
purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or changing in any
manner the rights of the Banks or of the Company hereunder, and with the
consent of the Required Banks, the Agent on behalf of the Banks may execute
and deliver to the Company a written instrument waiving, on such terms and
conditions as the Agent may specify (with such consent) in such instrument,
any of the requirements of this Agreement or any Default or Event of
Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no
such amendment, supplement or modification shall (a) extend the maturity of
any Loan, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
thereon, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or change the amount or
terms of any Bank's Commitment, or amend, modify or waive any provision of
this subsection 9.1 or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
Required Banks, or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Company of
any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or amend, modify or
waive the provisions of subsection 9.8, in each case without the prior
written consent of each Bank directly affected thereby, or (b) amend,
modify or waive any provision of Section 8 without the prior written
consent of the Agent. Each Bank hereby consents to the inclusion in this
Agreement of each and every amendment, revision, addition, change, waiver
or other modification to Section 5, Section 6 and/or the definitions of
"Applicable Base Rate Margin", "Applicable Eurodollar Margin", "Base Rate",
"Eurodollar Rate" and "Status" (including each defined term referred to in
the definition of "Status") of the Revolving Credit Agreement made after
the Effective Date (except to the extent relating to any provision
contained in such Sections on the Effective Date as to which there is no
comparable provision herein on the Effective Date) and each and every such
amendment, revision, addition, change, waiver or other modification thereof
is hereby incorporated, as in effect from time to time, into this Agreement
with the same effect as if fully set forth in Section 5, Section 6 and/or
the definitions of "Applicable Base Rate Margin", "Applicable Eurodollar
Margin", "Base Rate", "Eurodollar Rate" and "Status" (including each
defined term referred to in the definition of "Status") of this Agreement,
as appropriate, provided that for purposes of this Agreement if the
Revolving Credit Agreement is terminated such Sections 5 and 6 and such
definitions of "Applicable Base Rate Margin", "Applicable Eurodollar
Margin", "Base Rate" and "Eurodollar Rate" shall remain in effect for
purposes of this Agreement in the form in which they shall be in effect on
the date of such termination; provided, further, that for purposes of this
Agreement if the Revolving Credit Agreement is amended so as to remove the
covenant set forth in subsection 6.7 of the Revolving Credit Agreement,
subsection 6.7 hereof shall not be so amended, and if any provision of
subsection 6.7 of the Revolving Credit Agreement is amended or waived so as
to grant to the financial institutions under the Revolving Credit Agreement
a Lien on any assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, the obligations of
the Company hereunder shall be secured, and the Company shall take such
action and execute such security documents as the Agent may reasonably
request to further effect the security of such obligations, equally and
ratably with its obligations to the financial institutions under the
Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company will advise the Agent promptly of
any amendment to or termination of the Revolving Credit Agreement. Any
such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply
equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding upon the Company, the
Banks, the Agent and all future holders of the obligations owing by the
Company hereunder. In the case of any waiver, the Company, the Banks and
the Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder
and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and
not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon. No
provision of this subsection 9.1 shall limit the rights of any party hereto
pursuant to subsections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 9.8 and 9.9.

the Agent and CASC to cause such Bank's Clearing Account to be debited as
contemplated in subsection 2.2 and to cause to be created an overdraft in

the office of the Agent set forth in subsection 9.2 in funds immediately
available to the Agent.

9.4 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and
no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Bank, any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

9.5 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any document,
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

9.6 Payment of Expenses. The Company agrees:

(a) to pay or reimburse the Agent for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation
and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to,
this Agreement and any other documents prepared in connection
herewith, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and the administration of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett, special counsel to the Agent and the Banks;

(b) to pay or reimburse each Bank and the Agent for all costs
and expenses (other than legal fees and disbursements) incurred in
connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under
this Agreement and any such other documents and the reasonable fees
and disbursements of one firm of special counsel to the Agent and the
Banks; and

(c) to (i) indemnify each Bank from and against liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements (other than legal fees and
disbursements) of any kind whatsoever (and, with respect to any
proceeding or related proceedings, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of one firm of special counsel to the relevant Banks in
connection with such proceeding(s)) which may at any time (including,
without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Loans
made hereunder) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such
Bank in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by
such Bank under or in connection with any of the foregoing, provided
that the Company shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from (x)
the ordinary course administration of this Agreement or such other
documents by any Bank or (y) any Bank's gross negligence or willful
misconduct or bad faith and (ii) pay or reimburse (x) each Bank for
any payments made by such Bank to the Agent or CASC pursuant to the
provisions of subsection 8.7 and (y) the Agent and CASC for any and
all liabilities, expenses or disbursements incurred by any of them
which pursuant to the provisions of subsection 8.7 are the subject of
indemnification payments from the Banks to the extent that the Agent
or CASC, for whatever reason, did not receive such indemnification
payments from any Bank or Banks.

The agreements in this subsection 9.6 shall survive the repayment
of the Loans made hereunder and all other amounts payable hereunder.

9.7 Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments.
(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, the Banks and the Agent, and their respective successors and
assigns, except that the Company may not assign or transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of each Bank.

(b) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to
one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating
interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any Commitment of such Bank or
any other interest of such Bank hereunder. In the event of any such sale
by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, such Bank's
obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any Loan made by
it for all purposes under this Agreement, and the Company and the Agent
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection
with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, provided,
that the terms of any participation agreement or certificate relating to
any such participation shall prohibit any subparticipations by such
participant and provided, further any such participation agreement or
certificate shall permit the Bank granting such participations the right to
consent to waivers, amendments or supplements to this Agreement without the
consent of such participant except in the case of (a) waivers of any
Default or Event of Default described in Section 7(a), and (b) any
amendment or modification extending the maturity of any Loan, or reducing
the rate or extending the time of payment of interest thereof, or reducing
the principal amount thereof. The Company agrees that if amounts
outstanding under this Agreement are due or unpaid, or shall have been
declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of
setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this
Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest
were owing directly to it as a Bank under this Agreement, provided that, in
purchasing such participating interest, such Participant shall be deemed to
have agreed to share with the Banks the proceeds thereof as provided in
subsection 9.9 as fully as if it were a Bank hereunder. All amounts
payable by the Company under Section 2 shall be determined as if such Bank
had not sold such participations.

(c) Any Bank may assign to any Bank or additional bank or
financial institution or any Federal Reserve Bank all or any part of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement on the terms and conditions set
forth in subsection 9.6(c), (d), (e) and (g) of the Chrysler Agreement, the
provisions of which (including the definitions of defined terms used
therein) are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully herein;
provided, however, that in no event shall any such assignment by any Bank
to any assignee (other than any pledge or assignment of Loans to a Federal
Reserve Bank) be permitted hereunder unless contemporaneously therewith
such Bank shall assign to such assignee a percentage interest in such
Bank's rights and obligations under the Chrysler Agreement and the
promissory notes issued thereunder that is equal to the percentage interest
then being assigned hereunder. 

(d) The Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any
Participant or Assignee (as defined in the Chrysler Agreement) (each, a
"Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all financial
information in such Bank's possession concerning the Company and its
Affiliates which has been delivered to such Bank by or on behalf of the
Company pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Bank
by or on behalf of the Company in connection with such Bank's credit
evaluation of the Company and its affiliates prior to becoming a party to
this Agreement.

(e) In order to facilitate any pledge or assignment to any
Federal Reserve Bank of any Loans made by any Bank hereunder, the Company
hereby agrees that, upon request of any Bank at any time and from time to
time after the Company has made its initial borrowing hereunder, the
Company shall provide to such Bank, at the Company's own expense, a note,
substantially in the form of Exhibit F, evidencing the Loans owing to such
Bank.

(f) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
subsection 9.2 a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Banks, the Commitments of the Banks, and the principal
amount of each Type of Loan owing to each Bank from time to time. The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of clearly
demonstrable error, and the Company, the Agent and the Banks may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan
recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Company or any Bank at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Agent shall give
prompt written notice to the Company of the making of any entry in the
Register or any change in any such entry.

9.8 Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default and (b) with the consent of the Required
Banks, each Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any
time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank (including,
without limitation, its branches) to or for the credit or the account of
the Company against any and all of the obligations of the Company now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not
such Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the
Company after any such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
set-off and application. The rights of each Bank under this subsection are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation,
other rights of set-off) which such Bank may have.

9.9 Adjustments. If any Bank (a "benefitted Bank") shall at any
time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans made hereunder, or
interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether
voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings
of the nature referred to in clause (f) of Section 7, or otherwise) in a
greater proportion than any such payment to, or any collateral received by,
any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's Loans, or interest
thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the other Banks
such portion of each such other Bank's Loans, or shall provide such other
Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as
shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Bank to share the excess
payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the
Banks; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment
or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Bank, such
purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned,
to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Company agrees
that each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's Loans may exercise
all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off)
with respect to such portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct
holder of such portion.

9.10 New Banks. During the term of this Agreement with the
consent of the Company and upon notification to the Agent, one or more
additional financial institutions may become a party to this Agreement by
executing a supplement hereto with the Company and the Agent, substantially
in the form of Exhibit B, whereupon such financial institution (herein
called a "New Bank") shall become a Bank for all purposes and to the same
extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and entitled
to the benefits of this Agreement, provided that any such New Bank has also
become a New Bank under the Chrysler Agreement pursuant to subsection 9.10
thereof. Effective as of the date on which any such New Bank becomes a
Bank pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the Agent, each Bank
and the Company shall receive a notice from Chrysler of each Bank's
Commitment and the aggregate Commitments pursuant to subsection 2.17 of the
Chrysler Agreement. If on the date upon which such New Bank becomes a Bank
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection 9.10, there is an unpaid
principal amount of the Loans outstanding hereunder, the Company shall
borrow from such New Bank through the Agent, in an amount determined by
multiplying the amount of such New Bank's Commitment by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the then unpaid principal amount of the Loans
outstanding hereunder and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate
Commitments of the Banks other than the New Bank. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if there are Eurodollar Loans outstanding, a
financial institution that becomes a New Bank will make Eurodollar Loans to
the Company (pro rata according to its Commitment Percentage) having
Interest Periods corresponding to the then unexpired portions of the
respective Interest Periods of such Eurodollar Loans and bearing interest
at a rate equal to the respective interest rates then applicable to such
Eurodollar Loans. The Agent shall advise the Banks of each addition of a
New Bank hereunder, of the amount of its Commitment and of the amount of
any borrowing from it hereunder made simultaneously upon its addition.

9.11 Increase in Commitments. During the term of this
Agreement, upon any Bank increasing its Commitment under the Chrysler
Agreement and Chrysler giving the notice required by subsection 2.17(c) of
the Chrysler Agreement, such Bank shall be deemed to have increased its
Commitment hereunder as set forth in such notice, whereupon such Bank shall
be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement with respect to
the full amount of its Commitment as so increased. Effective as of the
date on which any such Bank increases its Commitment pursuant to the
provisions of this subsection 9.11, the Agent, each Bank and the Company
shall receive a notice from Chrysler of each Bank's Commitment and the
aggregate Commitments pursuant to subsection 2.17 of the Chrysler
Agreement. If on the date upon which such Bank increases its Commitment
pursuant to this subsection 9.11 there is an unpaid principal amount of the
Loans hereunder, the Company shall borrow from such Bank through the Agent,
in an amount determined by multiplying the amount of the increase in such
Bank's Commitment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then
unpaid principal amount of the Loans outstanding hereunder and the
denominator of which shall be the aggregate Commitments of the Banks other
than the amount of the additional Commitment of such Bank. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if there are Eurodollar Loans outstanding,
a Bank that increases its Commitment pursuant to this subsection 9.11 will
make Eurodollar Loans to the Company (pro rata according to the amount of
the increase in such Bank's Commitment) having Interest Periods
corresponding to the then unexpired portions of the respective Interest
Periods of such Eurodollar Loans and bearing interest at a rate equal to
the respective interest rates then applicable to such Eurodollar Loans. 
The Agent shall advise the Banks of such increase in the Commitment of a
Bank and of the amount of any borrowing from it hereunder made
simultaneously upon such increase.

9.12 Tax Forms. If any Bank which becomes a party to this
Agreement on any day after the date hereof pursuant to subsection 9.7 or
9.10 is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United
States or any state thereof, such Bank shall on such day (i) represent to
the transferor Bank (if applicable), the Agent and the Company that under
applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required to be withheld by the
Agent, the Company or the transferor Bank (if applicable) with respect to
any payments to be made to such Bank in respect of the Loans hereunder,
(ii) furnish to the transferor Bank (if applicable), the Agent and the
Company either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or U.S. Internal
Revenue Service Form 1001 (wherein such Bank claims entitlement to complete
exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments
hereunder) and (iii) agree (for the benefit of the transferor Bank (if
applicable), the Agent and the Company) to provide the transferor Bank (if
applicable), the Agent and the Company a new Form 4224 or Form 1001 upon
the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form and
comparable statements in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and
regulations and amendments duly executed and completed by such Bank, and to
comply from time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with
regard to such withholding tax exemption.

9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or
more of the parties hereto on any number of separate counterparts and all
of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and
the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all
the parties shall be lodged with the Company and the Agent.

9.14 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

9.15 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Company hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally:

(a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
proceeding commenced by any party hereto relating to this Agreement,
or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof,
to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of New York, the courts of the United States of America for the
Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof;

(b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought
in such courts, and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court
or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court
and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

(c) agrees that service of process in any such action or
proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or
certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage
prepaid, to the Company at its address set forth in subsection 9.2 or
at such other address of which the Agent shall have been notified with
copies addressed as set forth in subsection 9.2; and

(d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit
the right to sue in any other jurisdiction.

9.16 Integration. This Agreement represents the agreement of
each party with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no
promises or representations by the Agent or any Bank relative to the
subject matter hereof not reflected herein.

9.17 Restatement. It is the intention of each of the parties
hereto that all indebtedness of the Company under the Third Amended and
Restated Commitment Transfer Agreement be continued hereunder, and that the
Third Amended and Restated Commitment Transfer Agreement be amended and
restated in its entirety to reflect such continuation.

9.18 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE COMPANY, THE AGENT AND THE
BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND FOR ANY
COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

by the Borrower to the respective Guaranteed Parties or which remain owing
and unpaid to the respective Guaranteed Parties.

ARTICLE III

PAYMENT

Section 3.01 - Payment

(a) The Guarantor agrees to make immediate payment to the Agent on
behalf of the Guaranteed Parties of all Guaranteed Liabilities owing or
payable to the respective Guaranteed Parties upon receipt of a demand for

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any Taxes or

ARTICLE IV

OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE

Guarantor as a primary obligor and principal debtor in respect thereof.

ARTICLE V

OBLIGATIONS CONTINUING

discharged by any intermediate payment or satisfaction of the whole or any
part of the principal, interest, fees and other monies or amounts which 
may at any time be or become owing or payable under or by virtue of or
otherwise in connection with the Credit Agreement.

(b) The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall continue to be
effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any
payment which would otherwise have reduced the obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder (whether such payment shall have been by or on behalf of the
Borrower or by or on behalf of the Guarantor) is rescinded or reclaimed
from any of the Guaranteed Parties upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or the Guarantor

The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected
or impaired by any act, omission, matter or thing whatsoever, occurring
before, upon or after any demand for payment hereunder (and whether or not
known to the Guarantor or any of the Guaranteed Parties) which, but for
this provision, might constitute a whole or partial defence to a claim
against the Guarantor hereunder or might operate to release or otherwise 
exonerate the Guarantor from any of its obligations hereunder or otherwise
affect such obligations, whether occasioned by default of any of the
Guaranteed Parties or otherwise, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably
waives any such defence it may now or hereafter have in any way relating to
any of the foregoing, including:

(a) any limitation of status or power, disability, incapacity or
other circumstance relating to the Borrower or any other Person, including
any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment,

respect of any indebtedness or other obligation of the Borrower or any
other Person under the Credit Agreement or any other document or
instrument;

part, to perform or comply with any of the provisions of the Credit
Agreement or to give notice thereof to the Guarantor;

(d) the taking or enforcing or exercising or the refusal or neglect
to take or enforce or exercise any right or remedy from or against the
Borrower or any other Person or their respective assets or the release or
discharge of any such right or remedies;

(e) the granting of time, renewals, extensions, compromises,
concessions, waivers, releases, discharges and other indulgences to the
Borrower or any other Person;

(f) any amendment, variation, modification, supplement or replacement
of the Credit Agreement or any other document or instrument;

(g) any change in the ownership, control, name, objects, businesses,

(h) any merger or amalgamation of the Borrower or the Guarantor with
any Person or Persons;

(i) the occurrence of any change in the laws, rules, regulations or
ordinances of any jurisdiction or by any present or future action of any
Governmental Authority or court amending, varying, reducing or otherwise
affecting, or purporting to amend, vary, reduce or otherwise affect, any of
the Guaranteed Liabilities or the obligations of the Guarantor under this
Guarantee; and

(j) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any
existence of or reliance upon any representation by the Agent, any Co-Agent
or any Lender, but excluding complete, irrevocable payment) that might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defence of the
Borrower under the Credit Agreement or of the Guarantor in respect of its
guarantee hereunder.

Section 6.02 - Waiver

Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 6.01
hereof, the Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance hereof, notice of
any liability of the Guarantor hereunder, notice or proof of reliance by
the Guaranteed Parties upon the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder, and
diligence, presentment, demand for payment on the Borrower, protest, notice
of dishonour or non-payment of any of the Guaranteed Liabilities, or other
notice or formalities to the Borrower of any kind whatsoever. The

protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any
property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against
the Borrower or any other Person or entity or any collateral.

Section 6.03 - No Obligation to Take Action Against Borrower

Neither the Agent nor any of the other Guaranteed Parties shall
have any obligation to enforce any rights or remedies or to take any other
steps against the Borrower or any other Person or any property of the
Borrower or any other Person before the Agent is entitled to demand
payment and performance by the Guarantor of its liabilities and obligations
under this Guarantee, and the Guarantor hereby waives all benefit of
discussion. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are independent of
the Guaranteed Liabilities and a separate action or actions may be brought
and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guarantee,
irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Borrower or
whether the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.

Section 6.04 - Dealing with the Borrower and Others

waivers, releases, discharges and other indulgences to the Borrower or any
other Person;

(b) take or abstain from taking securities or collateral from the
Borrower or from perfecting securities or collateral of the Borrower;

the Borrower or any third party with respect to the obligations or matters
contemplated by the Credit Agreement;

(d) accept compromises or arrangements from the Borrower;

(e) apply all monies at any time received from the Borrower or from
securities upon such part of the Guaranteed Liabilities as the Guaranteed
Parties may see fit or change any such application in whole or in part from
time to time as the Guaranteed Parties may see fit; and

(f) otherwise deal with, or waive or modify their right to deal with,
the Borrower and all other Persons and securities as the Guaranteed Parties
may see fit.

Section 6.05 - Acknowledgement

the Credit Agreement and of all the provisions therein contained and

ARTICLE VII

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Section 7.01 - Representations and Warranties

The Guarantor represents and warrants to the Guaranteed Parties
on and as of the Effective Date as follows and acknowledges and confirms
that the Guaranteed Parties are relying upon such representations and
warranties in entering into the Credit Agreement and in making each
Borrowing available thereunder:

(a) the Guarantor and each of its Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation, amalgamation or continuance, as the case
may be, and (ii) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business
and is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which the character
of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of business
transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except in the case of
this clause (ii) to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the business,
operations or financial condition of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole;

(b) the Guarantor and each of its Significant Subsidiaries has the
corporate power and authority to own its respective properties and to carry
on its business as now conducted; the Guarantor has full power and
authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Guarantee
and this Guarantee has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Guarantor and, to the best of the knowledge of
the Guarantor, this Guarantee is not in violation of any Applicable Law; 

(c) neither the execution and delivery of this Guarantee nor
compliance with the terms and provisions hereof as of the Effective Date
(i) conflicts with, violates, or results in a breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Applicable Law applicable to the Guarantor
or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or, (ii) conflicts with, violates,
results in a breach of, or constitutes a default under, any restated
articles of incorporation or by-law provision of the Guarantor or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries or of any loan agreement, indenture, trust
deed or any other agreement or instrument to which the Guarantor or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them is
bound;

(d) this Guarantee has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of
the Guarantor, and this Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance
with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by principles
of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. No
authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required for the due execution,
delivery and performance by the Guarantor of this Guarantee;

(e) no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Guarantor, threatened by or against the Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries or against any of its or their respective properties or
revenues, in which there is reasonable likelihood of an adverse
determination (i) with respect to this Guarantee, if such adverse
determination would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
Guarantor to fulfil its obligations under this Guarantee or on the rights
and remedies of the Guaranteed Parties thereunder or (ii) which would, if
adversely determined, have a material adverse effect on the business,
operations, property or financial condition of the Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

(f) neither the Guarantor nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is
in breach of any term of its incorporating instruments or of its by-laws
and, to the best of the knowledge of the Guarantor, neither the Guarantor
nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is in breach of any material
mortgage, franchise, licence, which breach could materially and adversely
affect the financial condition of the Guarantor and its Significant
Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

(g) to the best of the Guarantor's knowledge, no Event of Default
under the Credit Agreement has occurred and is continuing and no other
event has occurred and is continuing which, with the giving or receipt of
notice or the lapse of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default
under the Credit Agreement;

(h) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries as at December 31, 1993, and the related audited consolidated
statements of net earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year ended on such
date, certified by Deloitte & Touche, copies of which have been delivered
to the Agent, present fairly the consolidated financial position of the
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended. 
The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries as at March 31, 1994, and the related consolidated statements
of net earnings and cash flows for the three-month period ended on such
date, copies of which have been delivered to the Agent, present fairly the
consolidated financial condition of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries as
at such date, and the consolidated results of their operations for the
three-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments). Such financial statements, including the related schedules
and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. As at March
31, 1994, neither the Guarantor nor any of its Subsidiaries had any asset,
liability, contingent obligation, liability for taxes, long-term lease or
unusual forward or long-term commitment material to the financial condition
of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, which was not
reflected in the foregoing unaudited statements or in the notes thereto;

(i) the information, exhibits and reports furnished by the Guarantor
to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders contain no material

NEGATIVE COVENANTS

Section 8.01 - Affirmative Covenants

The Guarantor covenants and agrees that so long as any Lender's
Commitment remains in effect under the Credit Agreement or any Guaranteed
Liabilities remain outstanding and unpaid:

(a) Maintenance of Ownership Interest

The Guarantor will maintain ownership of 100% of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Borrower which are
entitled to vote under all circumstances for the election of the
board of directors of the Borrower.

The Guarantor shall furnish to the Agent in sufficient numbers
for each Lender concurrently with the financial statements for
each quarterly accounting period and for each fiscal year of the
Borrower furnished pursuant to subparagraphs 10.01(1)(a)(i) and
10.01(1)(a)(ii) of the Credit Agreement, (A) a certificate in the
form and substance set out in Exhibit "A" of the Chairman of the

prepared and certified by such officer of the Borrower of the
covenant contained in Section 8.02(b) of this Guarantee and (C)
the analysis prepared, certified and delivered by an officer of
CFC to its bankers pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(iii) of the U.S.
Credit Agreement or any substitution or replacement thereof.

(c) Information to be Provided

Upon written request by any Lender through the Agent, the
Guarantor shall furnish promptly to such Lender copies of (i) all
such reports, if any, of the type a publicly held corporation
would generally make available to its shareholders as the
Guarantor shall make available to Chrysler Corporation, and (ii)
all regular and periodic reports which the Guarantor or any of
its Subsidiaries may be required to file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any similar or corresponding government
department, commission, board, bureau or agency, or with any
securities exchange.

Section 8.02 - Negative Covenants

The Guarantor covenants and agrees that so long as any Lender's
Commitment remains in effect under the Credit Agreement or any Guaranteed
Liabilities remain outstanding and unpaid:

(a) No Impairment of Borrower

The Guarantor will not cause or do any act, the effect of which
would be to impair the ability of the Borrower to perform its
obligations under the Credit Agreement.

(b) Fixed Charges Coverage Ratio

The Guarantor will not permit its "net earnings available for
fixed charges" to be less than 110% of its "fixed charges" for
any fiscal year of the Guarantor, or for the portion of any
fiscal year of the Guarantor ending with the last day of each
calendar quarter therein; "net earnings available for fixed
charges" and "fixed charges" being determined for the Guarantor
and for the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis. For the purposes of this Section 8.02(b):

(i) "Net earnings available for fixed charges" shall mean
net income after deducting operating and maintenance
expenses, taxes other than federal, state and other
income taxes, except to the extent stated below in the
case of consolidated subsidiaries, depreciation and
depletion, but excluding extraordinary nonrecurring
items of income or expense appearing in the regular
consolidated financial statements of the Guarantor;

(ii) "Fixed charges" shall mean interest on debt,
amortization of debt discount and rentals for leased
properties, except rentals under leases having a term
of one year or less;

(iii) In determining net earnings and fixed charges on a
consolidated basis, all intercompany items and the
portions of earnings allocable to minority interests in
consolidated subsidiaries shall be eliminated,
provision for or refund of income taxes of consolidated
subsidiaries in which the Guarantor owns directly or
indirectly less than ninety percent of all classes of
voting stock shall be deducted or added, and fixed
charges shall include fixed charges and preferred
dividends of consolidated subsidiaries that are not
intercompany items; and

(iv) Earnings attributable to assets or institutions
acquired by merger, consolidation, reorganization,
succession, organization, purchase or otherwise may be
included for that part of the test period which
precedes such acquisition, provided that (A) if less
than substantially all assets of any other institution
(or all or less than all assets of any other type of
business enterprise) is acquired, such earnings may be
included to the extent they are certified by an
independent accountant to be attributable to such
assets and (B) if an institution (or substantially all
of its assets) is acquired, such earnings may be
included if they are included in financial statements
of such institution prepared under generally accepted
accounting principles. Fixed charges and preferred
dividends for the period of such inclusion shall either
include any additional fixed charges and preferred
dividends properly attributable to such acquisitions as
certified by an independent accountant, or be the fixed
charges and preferred dividends with respect to debt
and stock outstanding immediately after such
acquisition.

(c) Limitation on Liens

(1) The Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Finance
Subsidiary to, create, assume or incur, or suffer to be created, assumed or
incurred or to exist, any Lien in respect of any property of any character

hereafter acquired; excluding, however, from the operation of this
covenant:

(i) Liens on assets of any Finance Subsidiary which is a
Canadian Corporation securing obligations of such
Finance Subsidiary;

judgment or decree, or in connection with other
proceedings or actions at law or in equity by or
against the Guarantor or any of its Finance
Subsidiaries;

(iii) Liens created by any Finance Subsidiary in favour of

(iv) any deposits to secure public or statutory obligations
of the Guarantor or any of its Finance Subsidiaries,
other than any such deposit made as a result of or in
connection with the occurrence of any of the following
events or circumstances: (A) any Person shall engage
in any Prohibited Transaction involving any Plan, (B)
any Accumulated Funding Deficiency, whether or not
waived, shall exist with respect to any Plan, (C) a
Reportable Event shall occur with respect to, or
proceedings shall commence to have a trustee appointed,
or a trustee shall be appointed, to administer or to
terminate, any Single Employer Plan, which Reportable
Event or institution of proceedings is likely to result
in the termination of such Plan for purposes of Title
IV of ERISA, and, in the case of a Reportable Event,
the continuance of such Reportable Event unremedied for
ten days after notice of such Reportable Event pursuant
to Section 4043(a), (c) or (d) of ERISA is given or the
continuance of such proceedings for ten days after
commencement thereof, as the case may be, or (D) any
Single Employer Plan shall terminate for purposes of
Title IV of ERISA;

(v) any purchase money Liens in respect of fixed assets or
other physical or real properties heretofore or
hereafter acquired by the Guarantor or any of its
Finance Subsidiaries, or any Liens existing in respect
of such property at the time of acquisition thereof;
provided, however, that no such Lien shall extend to or
cover any other property of the Guarantor or such
Finance Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(vi) any Liens which are (A) in respect of fixed assets or
other physical properties of a Corporation which is not
a Finance Subsidiary as of the date hereof, and (B) in
existence at the time such corporation becomes a
Finance Subsidiary;

(vii) the extension, renewal or replacement of any Lien
permitted by paragraphs (i) through (v) above in
respect of the same property theretofore subject
thereto or the extension, renewal or replacement
(without increase of principal amount) of the
indebtedness secured thereby;

(viii) Liens for taxes not yet due or which are being
contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings
if adequate reserves with respect thereto are
maintained on the books of the Guarantor or such
Finance Subsidiary, as the case may be, in accordance
with GAAP;

(ix) carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics', landlords',
materialmen's, repairmen's or other like Liens arising
in the ordinary course of business (A) which are not
overdue for a period of more than 60 days or (B) which
are being contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings if adequate reserves with respect thereto
are maintained on the books of the Guarantor or such
Finance Subsidiary, as the case may be, in accordance
with GAAP;

(x) easements, rights-of-way, zoning and similar
restrictions and other similar encumbrances or title
defects incurred in the ordinary course of business
which, in the aggregate, are not substantial in amount,
and which do not in any case materially detract from
the value of the property subject thereto or interfere
with the ordinary conduct of the business of the
Guarantor or its Finance Subsidiary;

(xi) any attachment or judgment lien, unless the judgment it
secures shall not, within 30 days after the entry
thereof, have been discharged or execution thereof
stayed pending appeal, or shall not have been
discharged within 30 days after the expiration of any
such stay;

(xii) Liens granted on assets in connection with leveraged
leases and project financing entered into in the
ordinary course of the Finance Business; and 

(xiii) Liens to secure Indebtedness and other obligations of
the Guarantor or any of its Finance Subsidiaries not
otherwise permitted by this Section 8.02(c), but only
to the extent that the aggregate amount of Indebtedness
and other obligations secured thereby does not at any
time exceed US$100,000,000. 

(2) The Guarantor will not permit any Domestic Subsidiary that is not
a Finance Subsidiary to create, assume or incur, or suffer to be created,
assumed or incurred or to exist, any Lien in respect of any property of any
character of such Domestic Subsidiary, whether heretofore or hereafter
acquired, excluding, however, from the operation of this covenant:

(i) Liens on property of such Domestic Subsidiary that
would be permitted under Section 8.02(c)(1) if such
Domestic Subsidiary were a Finance Subsidiary;

(ii) Liens on property of such Domestic Subsidiary that are
incurred in the ordinary course of the Finance Business
or the Real Estate Business of such Domestic
Subsidiary; and 

(iii) Liens on any property of such Domestic Subsidiary if
such Domestic Subsidiary is a "single purpose" entity
formed for the purpose of holding title to such
property and engages in no activities other than those
related to holding title to such property.

(3) Nothing in this Section 8.02(c) shall allow the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries to create, assume or incur or suffer to be created, assumed or
incurred or to exist any Lien not permitted by the provisions of the Credit
Agreement.

all the Guaranteed Parties, on behalf of the Guaranteed Parties. 

Section 10.02 - Assignment, Transfer and Participation

(a) The Guarantor hereby consents to any assignment or transfer of,
or any grant of the participation in, any rights, benefits or obligations
of, a Lender in respect of this Guarantee so long as the participation or
assignment of such Lender's interest in the Credit Agreement is effected in
accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.02(a), the Guarantor
shall upon request made by an assignee from a Lender, execute and deliver
such assurances as may be reasonably requested by such assignee to confirm
its entitlement to the rights and benefits hereunder so assigned and
transferred to it and the liability of the Guarantor to the assignee
hereunder.

Section 10.03 - Acknowledgement by CFC re: Increased Commitments

The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any Lender which
increases its Commitment pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.06 of the
Credit Agreement shall also be entitled to the benefit of this Guarantee in
respect of the increased amount of its Commitment and the obligations of
the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall in no way be varied or diminished
by virtue of such increase in Commitment; and the Guarantor further
acknowledges and agrees that this Guarantee shall extend to all
Obligations, including any Borrowings under the Credit Agreement after any
increase in the Total Commitment resulting from the increase in a Lender's
Commitment pursuant to Section 17.06 of the Credit Agreement.

Section 10.04 - Acknowledgement by CFC re: New Lenders

The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any Chartered Bank
which becomes a New Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.05 of
the Credit Agreement shall be entitled to the benefit of this Guarantee as
if such New Lender had been a Lender as at the time of execution of the
Guarantee and the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall
in no way be varied or diminished by virtue of the addition of such New
Lenders; and the Guarantor further acknowledges and agrees that this
Guarantee shall extend to all Obligations including any Borrowings under
the Credit Agreement after any increases in the Total Commitment resulting
from the addition of New Lenders pursuant to Section 17.05 of the Credit
Agreement.

Section 10.05 - Exchange of Information

The Guarantor agrees that the Agent and each Lender may disclose
to any prospective assignee or participant, on a confidential basis, such
information concerning the financial condition of the Guarantor or any
Subsidiary which the Borrower or Guarantor is required to provide to the
Agent or the Lenders under the Credit Agreement or this Guarantee.

Section 10.06 - Successor Agent

In the event that the Agent for the time being under the Credit
Agreement shall resign or be removed and a successor agent thereafter shall
be appointed in accordance with Section 14.07 of the Credit Agreement, then
upon such successor agent agreeing in writing to be bound by the provisions
of this Guarantee as Agent hereunder, all references herein to Agent in

with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or
removed Agent and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from
its further duties and obligations as Agent under this Guarantee.

Section 10.07 - Judgment Currency

If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court in any
jurisdiction with respect to this Guarantee, it becomes necessary to
convert into the currency of such jurisdiction (herein called the "Judgment
Currency") any amount due hereunder in any currency other than the Judgment
Currency, then conversion shall be made at the rate of exchange prevailing
on the Business Day before the day on which judgment is given. For this
purpose, "rate of exchange" means the rate at which the Agent would, on the
relevant date at or about 12:00 noon (Toronto time), be prepared to sell a
similar amount of such currency in Toronto against the Judgment Currency. 
In the event that there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing
between the Business Day before the day on which the judgment is given and
the date of payment of the amount due, the Guarantor will, on the date of
payment, pay such additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure
that the amount paid on such date is the amount in the Judgment Currency
which when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of
payment is the amount then due under this Guarantee in such other currency. 
Any additional amount due from the Guarantor under this Section 10.07 will
be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by judgment being
obtained for any other sums due under or in respect of this Guarantee.

Section 10.08 - Applicable Law

This Guarantee shall be conclusively deemed to be a contract made
under, and shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed and
interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the Province of Ontario and the
federal laws of Canada applicable therein in effect from time to time
without prejudice to or limitation of any other rights or remedies
available under the laws of any jurisdiction where property or assets of
the Guarantor may be found.

Section 10.09 - Jurisdiction

(a) The Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that any suits, actions
or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guarantee
(collectively "Proceedings") may be brought in any Michigan State Court or
any U.S. Federal Court sitting in the State of Michigan or any court in the
Province of Ontario and submits and attorns to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court.

(b) The Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objections which it
may have now or hereafter to the laying of the venue of any Proceedings in
any court referred to in paragraph (a) and any claim that any such
Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum and further
irrevocably agrees that a judgment in any Proceedings brought in any such
court shall be conclusive and binding upon the Guarantor and may be
enforced in any courts to the jurisdiction of which such parties may be
subject by Proceedings upon such judgment.

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 10.09 shall limit the right of
the Agent or any other Guaranteed Party to take Proceedings against the
Guarantor in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking
of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of
Proceedings in any other jurisdiction, whether concurrently or not.

(d) The Guarantor hereby irrevocably: 

(i) appoints the Borrower at its address for service or
delivery of notice in the Credit Agreement as its agent
for service of process in the Province of Ontario in
connection with any Proceedings in the Province of
Ontario and consents to process being served in any
Proceedings in the Province of Ontario by delivering or
transmitting a true copy thereof to the Borrower at
such address;

(ii) agrees that service in accordance with the provisions
of clause 10.9(d)(i) shall be deemed in every respect
effective service of process upon the Guarantor in any
such Proceedings and shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, be taken and be held to be valid
personal service upon and personal delivery to the
Guarantor; and 

(iii) consents generally to the fullest extent permitted by
law in respect of any Proceedings to the giving of any
relief and the issue of any process in connection with
such Proceedings including the making, enforcement or
execution against any property whatsoever
(irrespective of its use or intended use) of any order
or judgment which may be made or given in such
Proceedings.

(e) Each of the Guarantor and the Guaranteed Parties hereby
irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or
counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of
or relating to the Credit Agreement or this Guarantee, the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the actions of the Guarantor or any
Guaranteed party in the negotiation, administration, performance or
enforcement hereof or thereof.

Section 10.10 - Costs and Expenses

The Guarantor agrees, on demand, to pay or reimburse each
Guaranteed Party for all costs, fees and expenses (other than legal fees
and disbursements) incurred in connection with the enforcement or
preservation of any rights under this Guarantee and under any other
documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the reasonable
fees and disbursements of one firm of counsel to the Guaranteed Parties.

Section 10.11 - No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies

No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of
the Agent or the other Guaranteed Parties, any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder or under the Credit Agreement, shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the Credit Agreement preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges
herein and under the Credit Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

Section 10.12 - Waiver of Rights of Subrogation, Reimbursement, Etc.

The Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any claim or other rights
that it may now or hereafter acquire against the Borrower that arise from
the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Guaranteed
Liabilities under this Guarantee or the Credit Agreement, including,
without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim
or remedy of any Guaranteed Party against the Borrower or any collateral,
whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under
contract, statute or common law, including the right to take or receive
from the Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by
set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such
claim, remedy or right. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in
violation of the preceding sentence at any time prior to the later of the
payment in full of the Guaranteed Liabilities and all other amounts payable
under this Guarantee and the termination of the Commitments, such amount
shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and shall
forthwith be paid to the Agent to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed
Liabilities and all other amounts payable under this Guarantee, whether
matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement,
or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed Liabilities or other amounts
payable under this Guarantee thereafter arising. The Guarantor
acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the
financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Agreement and that the
waiver set forth in this Section 10.12 is knowingly made in contemplation
of such benefits.

Section 10.13 - Survival of Obligations; No Set-off

Without prejudice to the survival of the other obligations of the
Guarantor hereunder, the obligations of the Guarantor under Section 3.01(b)
and (c) shall survive payment in full of the Guaranteed Liabilities.

All payments to be made by or on behalf of the Guarantor
hereunder shall be made without giving effect to any defence or right of
set-off or counterclaim which may be asserted by the Borrower or the
Guarantor. 

Section 10.14 - Guarantee in Addition to Other Obligations

The obligations of the Guarantor under this Agreement are in
addition to and not in substitution for any other obligations to the Agent
or to any of the Guaranteed Parties in relation to the Credit Agreement and
any guarantees or security at any time held by or for the benefit of any of
them.

Section 10.15 - Entire Agreement

This Guarantee, including all documents contemplated hereby,
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter and supersedes all prior negotiations, undertakings,
representations and understandings.

Section 10.16 - Severability

Any provision of this Guarantee which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate the remaining
provisions and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

Section 10.17 - Successors and Assignees

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Guarantor and the Agent and the other Guaranteed Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assignees, except that the Guarantor
may not assign any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 10.18 - Counterparts

This Guarantee and the acceptance thereof may be executed in any
number of separate counterparts and all said counterparts taken together
shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

(e) If the Borrower shall fail to repay any Prime Loan or Short-Term

by the acceptance thereof by each of the Lenders at their respective

written notice (or such other method of notification as may be

current Libor Interest Period. If the Borrower fails to so
notify the Agent and so select a Libor Interest Period or to
repay the same as provided in Section 4.02(c), the Borrower shall
be deemed to have notified the Agent that it wishes to reborrow
such Libor Loans as a Borrowing by way of Libor Loans with a
Libor Interest Period of approximately one (1) month commencing

the current Libor Loans.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.02(b) and subject to
the other terms of this Agreement, each Borrowing by way of Libor
Loans must be repaid on the last day of the Libor Interest Period
therefor (a "Libor Repayment Date"). If the Borrower intends to
repay any Borrowing by way of Libor Loans, it shall give
irrevocable telephone or written notice (or such other method of
notification as may be agreed between the Agent and the Borrower)

telephone notice, by written confirmation electronically
transmitted to the Agent on the same day. The Borrower shall,
upon giving such notice, be obligated to repay such Borrowing on
such Libor Repayment Date.

(d) Each Libor Loan shall be hedged by the purchase by the Borrower
of a forward contract for US Dollars with a counterparty
satisfactory to the Agent or in such other manner reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent in an amount equal to 100% of such
Libor Loan and for a like term as such Libor Loan. The Borrower
shall provide the Agent upon request with particulars of the
hedging arrangements for each Libor Loan outstanding.

Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, each Borrowing
under the Tranche B Facility shall be made available by the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Lenders' Proportions, in the case of Prime
Loans and Libor Loans through the Agent's Account for Payments and in the
case of Bankers' Acceptances at the respective Lenders' Branches of
Account. Each Lender's Commitment is several, and a Lender shall not be
responsible for the commitment of any other Lender to make available
Borrowings under the Tranche B Facility. The failure of a Lender to make
available a Borrowing in accordance with its obligations hereunder shall
not release any other Lender from its obligations hereunder.

Section 4.04 - Repayment of Tranche A Facility Borrowings Using Tranche B
Facility

If on any Drawdown Date or Conversion Date with respect to the
Tranche B Facility, the sum of (i) a Lender's Proportion of the Borrowings
to be advanced on such Drawdown Date or Conversion Date pursuant to the
Tranche B Facility, (ii) the Borrowings from such Lender under the Tranche
A Facility, and (iii) the Borrowings from such Lender under the Tranche B
Facility, would exceed such Lender's Commitment, then the proceeds of the
Borrowing to be advanced by such Lender on such Drawdown Date or Conversion
Date pursuant to the Tranche B Facility shall be applied by such Lender to
repay the Borrowings from such Lender under the Tranche A Facility to the
extent required to permit such Lender to advance its Lender's Proportion of
the Borrowings to be advanced by such Lender pursuant to the Tranche B
Facility on such Drawdown Date or Conversion Date. In such event, the
Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for any loss or expense suffered or
incurred by such Lender as a result of repayment of any Short-Term Fixed
Rate Loan made by such Lender.

Section 4.05 - Repayment under the Tranche B Facility

So long as this Agreement is in effect, the Borrower may repay,
on a pro rata basis, the Borrowings under the Tranche B Facility in minimum
aggregate amounts of $5,000,000 in the case of Prime Loans, US$10,000,000

the Lenders at the Agent's Branch of Account prior irrevocable telephone or
written notice within the notice period and in the form which would be
required to be given to the Agent in respect of the type of Borrowing into
which the outstanding Borrowing is to be converted in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 4.02(a)(i) and 7.02, as applicable, followed by
written confirmation on the same day in the form and substance set out in

Cdn$10,000,000 (and whole multiples of Cdn$100,000 in
excess thereof) and each conversion to a Borrowing by way
of Prime Loans shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of
Cdn$5,000,000,

(iii) a Borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptances may be converted

(iv) a conversion into a Borrowing by way of Bankers'

Borrower may revoke the authority of such Persons so authorized by
notifying the Agent in writing, which notice shall be effective upon its
actual receipt by the Agent. Any instructions given to the Agent or any
Lender prior to the time such notice becomes effective shall remain
effective for the purposes of this Agreement.

Section 6.01 - Payment of Interest on Prime Loans

The Borrower shall pay at or before 2:00 p.m. on each Interest
Date, interest on each Prime Loan made by a Lender,

(i) under the Tranche A Facility, to such Lender at such
Lender's Branch of Account (except to the extent it is
otherwise payable to the Agent for such Lender's account
pursuant to Section 6.04), and

(ii) under the Tranche B Facility, to the Agent at the Agent's
Account for Payments for the account of such Lender,

calculated at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Prime Rate in effect
from time to time and the Prime Rate Margin. Such interest shall be
payable in arrears on each Interest Date and shall be computed on a daily
basis and on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of
365 days or 366 days, as applicable.

Section 6.02 - Payment of Interest on Short-Term Fixed Rate Borrowings

The Borrower shall pay at or before 2:00 p.m. on the maturity
date of each Short-Term Fixed Rate Loan, interest on such Short-Term Fixed
Rate Loan made by a Lender calculated at the rate per annum equal to the
sum of the rate quoted by such Lender at the time such Short-Term Fixed
Rate Loan was made and the Short-Term Fixed Rate Margin, such payment to be
made at such Lender's Branch of Account except to the extent it is
otherwise payable to the Agent for such Lender's account pursuant to
Section 6.04. Such interest shall be computed on a daily basis and on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 days or 366
days, as applicable.

Section 6.03 - Payment of Interest on Libor Loans

The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of each
Lender at or before 2:00 p.m. on each Libor Interest Date in each Libor
Interest Period applicable to a Libor Loan made by such Lender, interest
accrued on such Libor Loan during such Libor Interest Period calculated at
a rate per annum equal to the sum of the relevant Libor plus the applicable
Libor Margin. Such interest shall be payable in arrears on each Libor
Interest Date during such Libor Interest Period for the period from and
including the first day of such Libor Interest Period or the last Libor
Interest Date in such Libor Interest Period, as applicable, to but not
including such Libor Interest Date, computed on a daily basis and on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such Libor Interest
Period (excluding such Libor Interest Date) in a year of 360 days.

Section 6.04 - Utilization

The amount of interest on Prime Loans, Short-Term Fixed Rate
Loans and Libor Loans to be paid on any date as specified in Section 6.01,
6.02 or 6.03 (each, an "Interest Payment Date") shall be the amount which
would be due and payable if the Utilization for the period for which such
interest is paid was less than 33-1/3%, provided that, in the case of Libor
Loans and Short-Term Fixed Rate Loans, the amount of any portion of the
interest payable in respect thereof on any Interest Payment Date which
accrued during a Utilization Period ending prior to such Interest Payment
Date shall be determined on the basis of the actual Utilization for such
Utilization Period. On the first Business Day following the last day of
each fiscal quarter of the Borrower and on the Final Date, the Borrower
shall pay to the Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, an
additional amount of interest equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the
amount of interest which would have been payable during such fiscal quarter
(a "Quarterly Utilization Period") (or, in the case of the payment due on
the Final Date, the portion thereof (the "Final Utilization Period") ending
on such date) after giving effect to the actual Utilization during such
Utilization Period over (ii) the amount of interest which actually was paid
during such Utilization Period.

On the first Business Day following the last day of each
Utilization Period, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the ratable
benefit of the Lenders an additional amount on account of Acceptance Fees
in respect of each Bankers' Acceptance outstanding during such Utilization
Period equal to an amount calculated by multiplying:

(i) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
the term of the Bankers' Acceptance in such Utilization
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the term of the Bankers' Acceptance; by

(ii) the excess (if any) of (A) the amount of Acceptance Fees
which would have been payable in respect of such Bankers'
Acceptance had the Utilization at the time of the issuance
of such Bankers' Acceptance been the same as the actual
Utilization during such Utilization Period, over (B) the
amount of Acceptance Fees which actually were paid in
respect of such Bankers' Acceptance.

Section 6.05 - Default Interest and Indemnity

Interest shall be payable on all overdue interest, fees and other
amounts payable hereunder, (i) if the overdue amount is denominated in
Canadian Dollars, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Prime Rate in
effect from time to time and two percent (2%) per annum, and (ii) if the
overdue amount is denominated in US Dollars, at a rate per annum equal to
the sum of the US Base Rate in effect from time to time and two percent
(2%) per annum. In each case, interest shall be computed from the date
such amount becomes due and payable for so long as such amount remains
unpaid, and, such interest shall be payable on demand and shall be
compounded monthly on the first Business Day of each calendar month on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 days or 366
days, as applicable.

All interest provided for in this Agreement shall be payable both
before and after maturity, default and judgment.

The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Agent
against any actual loss or expense which such Lender or the Agent may
sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any failure of the Borrower to
effect a Borrowing as specified in any notice of Borrowing delivered
pursuant to this Agreement or (b) the default by the Borrower in the
payment of any sum due by the Borrower under this Agreement.

Section 6.06 - Facility Fee

The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of each
Lender, a facility fee for each day from and including the Effective Date
to but excluding the later of (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date on
which all Borrowings shall have been repaid in full (such later date, the
"Final Date"). Such facility fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on
(a) the first Business Day of each of January, April, July and October (for
the three-month period (or portion thereof) ended on the last day of the
immediately preceding month) and (b) on the Final Date (for the period
ended on such date for which no payment has been received pursuant to
clause (a) above) and shall be computed for each day during such period at
a rate per annum equal to the Facility Fee Rate in effect on such day on
the Total Commitment in effect on such day (or if the Commitments shall
have been terminated, on the aggregate outstanding Borrowings on such day)
and on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 days
or 366 days, as applicable.

Section 6.07 - Agency Fee

The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent an agency fee for its
sole account to the Agent's Account for Payments at the times and in the
amounts agreed in writing by the Borrower and the Agent.

Section 6.08 - Computation of Interest for Interest Act Purposes

The annual rates of interest to which the rates determined in
accordance with Section 6.03 of this Article VI are equivalent for purposes
of the Interest Act (Canada) are the rates so determined multiplied by the
number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by 360. 

Section 6.09 - Limit on Rate of Interest

(a) Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be obliged to make any payments of interest or other
amounts payable to a Lender hereunder in excess of the amount or rate which
would be prohibited by Applicable Laws or would result in the receipt by a
Lender of interest at a criminal rate (as such terms are construed under
the Criminal Code (Canada)).

(b) In the event that any such payments are limited or prohibited as
provided in this Section 6.09, such payments of interest and other amounts
hereunder shall be made at the highest rate permitted.

Section 6.10 - Increased Costs

In the event that any Applicable Law or any change therein or in
the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with
any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority enacted or made subsequent to
the date hereof:

(i) does or shall subject such Lender to any Tax, or change
the basis of taxation or increase any existing Tax, on
payments of principal, interest or other amounts payable by
the Borrower to such Lender (except for taxes on the
overall net income of such Lender imposed by the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or resident or
from which it is acting for the purposes of this Agreement,
but including taxes on capital or other similar taxes);

(ii) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other
liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by,
or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of
funds by, any office of such Lender; or

(iii) does or shall impose on such Lender any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Lender of making, or maintaining advances or extensions of credit or to
reduce any amounts receivable hereunder (such increase in costs or
reduction in amounts receivable, "Increased Costs") then, in any such case,
the Borrower shall promptly pay to the Agent for the account of such
Lender, upon the written demand of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy
to the Agent), so long as such Increased Costs are not otherwise included
in the amounts required to be paid to such Lender pursuant to Section 6.11, 
6.12 or 6.14, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender
for such Increased Costs which such Lender deems to be material as
determined by such Lender with respect to its Libor Loans, Bankers'
Acceptances or Short-Term Fixed Rate Loans. If a Lender becomes entitled
to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly
notify the Borrower, through the Agent, of the event by reason of which it
has become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by a Lender, through the
Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error.

Section 6.11 - Changes in Capital Requirements

(a) In the event that, in the opinion of counsel for any Lender
(which may, in the discretion of such Lender, be such Lender's
internal counsel), compliance with any law, rule, regulation or
guideline, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request
or directive from any central bank or Governmental Authority
(whether or not such requirement has the force of law) enacted or
made subsequent to the date hereof shall affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or
any corporation controlling such Lender and the amount of such
capital that is required or expected to be maintained is
increased by or based upon the Commitment of such Lender under
this Agreement or any participation agreement entered into
pursuant to Section 15.01, as applicable (such event, a "Change
in Capital Requirement"), such affected Lender shall so notify
the Borrower and the Agent within one hundred and eighty (180)
days after such affected Lender shall have obtained actual
knowledge of the costs associated with its compliance with such
Change in Capital Requirement (but in no event later than 365
days after such Lender is first required to comply with such
Change in Capital Requirement).

At the time of such notification such affected Lender shall
provide the Borrower with a written statement setting forth the
amount that would adequately compensate such affected Lender for
the costs associated with its compliance with such Change in
Capital Requirement and setting forth in reasonable detail the
assumptions upon which such affected Lender calculated such
amount, and a copy of the opinion of counsel referred to in the
preceding sentence. Such affected Lender shall allocate to the
Borrower the costs associated with such Change in Capital
Requirement in such a way that the proportion of (i) such costs
that are allocated to the Borrower to (ii) the total of such
costs of such affected Lender associated with such Change in
Capital Requirement as it relates to all commitments of such
Lender to its customers of a similar creditworthiness as the
Borrower, is substantially the same as the proportion of (i) the
Commitment of such affected Lender under this Agreement or such
participation agreement to (ii) the total of all commitments by
such affected Lender to its customers of similar creditworthiness
as the Borrower. 

The Borrower and such affected Lender shall thereafter negotiate
in good faith an agreement to increase that portion of the
facility fees payable to such affected Lender under Section 6.06
of this Agreement, which, in the opinion of such affected Lender,
will adequately compensate such affected Lender for such costs. 
If such increase is approved in writing by the Borrower within
ninety (90) days from the date of the notice to the Borrower from
such affected Lender, the facility fees payable by the Borrower
shall, effective from the date the affected Lender is first
required to comply with such Change in Capital Requirement (but
subject to the second last sentence of this Section 6.11(a))
include the amount of such agreed increase, and the Borrower will
so notify the Agent. If the Borrower and such affected Lender
are unable to agree on such an increase within ninety (90) days
from the date of the notice to the Borrower from such affected
Lender, the Borrower shall by written notice to such affected
Lender within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of
the aforesaid notice to the Borrower from such affected Lender,
elect either to (i) terminate the Commitment of such affected
Lender (each such Lender, a "Terminated Lender") (subject to the
second last sentence of this Section 6.11(a)) or (ii) (subject to
the second last sentence of this Section 6.11(a)) increase the
facility fees payable to such affected Lender by the amount
requested by such affected Lender and the Borrower will so notify
the Agent. Without limiting the foregoing, if the Borrower
elects to take the action described in clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence, it may simultaneously therewith reduce the
Commitment of such affected Lender by an amount chosen by the
Borrower. If the Borrower fails to provide notice to such
affected Lender as described in the second preceding sentence by
such one hundred twentieth day, the Borrower shall be deemed to
have taken the action described in clause (ii) of such second
preceding sentence without reduction of the Commitment of such
affected Lender. 

The Borrower (A) may from time to time after such one hundred
twentieth day reduce the compensation to be received pursuant to
the preceding provisions of this Section 6.11(a) by any affected
Lender as a result of any Change in Capital Requirement, to the
average compensation (the "Average Compensation") the Borrower
has agreed, as provided above, to pay the affected Lenders as a
result of such Change in Capital Requirement (such average
compensation to be measured by a percentage of the aggregate
Commitments of such affected Lenders) and (B) shall pay to each
Terminated Lender on the day the Commitment of such Terminated
Lender is terminated, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(i) the lesser of (I) the aggregate facility fee that would have
been payable to such Terminated Lender from the date of such
Terminated Lender's notice to the Borrower pursuant to this
Section 6.11(a) to the date the Commitment of such Terminated
Lender is terminated had such facility fee been determined by
reference to the Average Compensation, and (II) the aggregate
facility fee that would have been payable to such Terminated
Lender during such period had such facility fee been increased by
an amount necessary to adequately compensate such Terminated
Lender (as determined by such Terminated Lender in accordance
with the applicable provisions of this Section 6.11(a)) for the
costs attributable to the relevant Change in Capital Requirement,
over (ii) the aggregate facility fee actually paid to such
Terminated Lender during such period. 

On the day the Commitment of a Terminated Lender is terminated
pursuant to this Section 6.11(a), the Borrower shall (i) repay
all Loans and other amounts (including accrued interest and
facility fees) owing to such Terminated Lender, (ii) be liable to
such Terminated Lender under Section 6.14 if any Libor Loans or
Short-Term Fixed Rate Loans owing to such Terminated Lender shall
be repaid other than on the last day of the Libor Interest Period
relating to such Libor Loan or the maturity date relating to such
Short-Term Fixed Rate Loan, and (iii) pay to such Terminated
Lender an amount equal to the maximum aggregate amount of the
Borrower's obligations pursuant to any Bankers' Acceptance
accepted by such Terminated Lender, which amount shall be held by
such Terminated Lender in an interest bearing account as
collateral security for the Borrower's obligations to such
Terminated Lender with respect to such Borrowings, and the
Borrower shall execute in favour of such Terminated Lender a cash
collateral agreement (or such alternate arrangement as may be
agreed upon by the Borrower and such Terminated Lender) in form
and substance satisfactory to such Terminated Lender in respect
of such amount.

(b) Upon the occurrence of any Change in Capital Requirement, each
Lender whose Commitment hereunder is affected by such Change in
Capital Requirement shall transfer its Commitment to another
branch office (or, if such Lender so elects, to an Affiliate) of
such Lender, provided that such transfer shall be made only if
such Lender shall have determined in good faith (which
determination shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive
and binding upon all parties) that (i) on the basis of existing
circumstances, such transfer will avoid the increased costs
resulting from such Change in Capital Requirement and will not
result in any additional costs, liabilities or expenses to such
Lender (unless the Borrower agrees to pay such additional costs,
liabilities or expenses of such Lender) and (ii) such transfer is
otherwise consistent with the interests of such Lender. A
transfer of a Lender's Commitment pursuant to this Section
6.11(b) shall be effected pursuant to the provisions of Section
15.01, provided that no consent to such assignment shall be
required from the Borrower or the Agent.

Section 6.12 - Illegality

If the introduction of or any change in applicable law,
regulation, treaty or official directive, or regulatory requirement
(whether or not having the force of law), or the interpretation or
application thereof by any court or by any Governmental Authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, makes it unlawful or
prohibited for any Lender (as determined by such Lender in its sole and
absolute discretion) to make, fund or maintain any Borrowing or any portion
thereof or to perform its obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
may, by written notice to the Borrower through the Agent, terminate its
obligations under this Agreement to make, fund or maintain such Borrowings
or perform such obligations and the Borrower shall prepay such Lender's
Proportion thereof forthwith (or at the end of such period as such Lender
in its sole and absolute discretion may determine), together with all
accrued but unpaid interest, fees and costs as may be applicable to the
date of payment or conversion and may reborrow by notice to the Agent such
Borrowing on another basis of borrowing available under this Agreement.

Section 6.13 - Substitute Basis of Libor Borrowing

If, at any time before the first day of any Libor Interest
Period, any Lender determines in its sole and absolute discretion (which
determination is final, conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that:

(a) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Libor
for any Libor Loan for such Libor Interest Period;

(b) Libor for any Libor Loan for such Libor Interest Period does not
accurately reflect the effective cost to such Lender of making,
funding or maintaining such Libor Loan or such cost is increased
or the income actually received or receivable by such Lender is
reduced in respect of any such Libor Loan;

(c) the making or deemed re-Borrowing of any Libor Loan or any
portion of any Libor Loan for such Libor Interest Period by such
Lender has become impracticable by reason of circumstances which
materially and adversely affect the London interbank market; or

(d) deposits in US Dollars are not available to such Lender in the
London interbank market in sufficient amounts in the ordinary
course of business for such Libor Interest Period to make, fund
or maintain any Libor Loan during such Libor Interest Period, 

then such Lender shall promptly notify the Agent and the Agent shall
promptly notify the Borrower in writing of such determination setting forth
the basis for such determination, whereupon such Lender shall be released
of its obligation to make the relevant Borrowing by way of Libor Loans for
such Libor Interest Period. If the same occurs with respect to any Libor
Loan which is already outstanding, then such Libor Loan shall be treated,
effective on the date of notice to the Borrower from the Agent, as a
Borrowing by way of a Prime Loan pursuant to the Tranche B Facility in an
Equivalent Amount for all purposes under this Agreement. Such Lender will
not be obligated to make any further Libor Loans available pursuant to this
Agreement so long as the circumstances referred to in clauses (a), (b), (c)
or (d) of this Section 6.13 continue.

Section 6.14 - Indemnity for Libor Loans and Short-Term Fixed Rate Loans

If the Borrower repays any Borrowing by way of Libor Loans or
Short-Term Fixed Rate Loans on a day other than the last day of the Libor
Interest Period of such Libor Loans or the maturity date of such Short-Term
Fixed Rate Loans, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender for any loss or
expense suffered or incurred by such Lender, including, without limitation,
any expense such Lender suffers or incurs by reason of the liquidation or
redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to maintain
its Libor Loan or Short-Term Fixed Rate Loan or any increased interest or
other charges payable to lenders of funds borrowed in order to maintain
such Libor Loan or Short-Term Fixed Rate Loan together with any other
costs, charges or expenses incurred by such Lender with respect thereto. A
certificate of such Lender setting out the basis for the determination of
the amount necessary to indemnify such Lender, together with reasonable
details of any calculations used in such determination shall be conclusive
and binding on the Borrower for the purposes of payment and constitute
prima facie evidence of the amount of such indemnity, absent manifest
error.

Section 6.15 - Replacement of Lenders

The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender which (a)
requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 6.10 or 6.11,
(b) is affected in the manner described in Section 6.12 and as a result
thereof any of the actions described in said Section is required to be
taken, (c) defaults in its obligation to make Loans or accept Bankers'
Acceptances hereunder, or (d) is an Affiliate of a Bank (as defined in the
CFC 1994 Credit Agreement) whose commitment under the CFC 1994 Credit
Agreement is terminated, with a replacement Chartered Bank provided that 

(i) such replacement does not conflict with any Applicable Law,

(ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
at the time of such replacement,

(iii) the Borrower shall repay (or the replacement Lender shall
purchase, at par) all Loans and other amounts (including
accrued interest) owing to such replaced Lender
concurrently with such replacement,

(iv) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under
Section 6.14 if any Libor Loans or Short-Term Fixed Rate
Loans owing to such replaced Lender shall be repaid (or
purchased) other than on the last day of the Libor Interest
Period relating to such Libor Loan or the maturity date
relating to such Short-Term Fixed Rate Loan,

(v) the Borrower shall pay to such replaced Lender an amount
equal to the maximum, aggregate amount of the Borrower's
obligations pursuant to any Bankers' Acceptance accepted by
such replaced Lender, which amount shall be held by such
replaced Lender in an interest bearing account as
collateral security for the Borrower's obligations to such
replaced Lender with respect to such Borrowings, and the
Borrower shall execute in favour of such replaced Lender a
cash collateral agreement (or such alternate arrangement as
may be agreed upon by the Borrower and such replaced
Lender) in form and substance satisfactory to such replaced
Lender in respect of such amount,

(vi) the replacement Lender, if not already a Lender, and the
terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Agent,

(vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such
replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section
15.01 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay
the registration and processing fee referred to therein),

(viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated,
the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any)
required pursuant to Section 6.10 or 6.11, as the case may
be, and 

(ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of
any rights which the Borrower, the Agent or any other
Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.

ARTICLE VII

BANKERS' ACCEPTANCES

Section 7.01 - Issue of Bankers' Acceptances

The Borrower may issue Bankers' Acceptances denominated in
Canadian Dollars, each in accordance with the provisions of this Article
VII.

For the purposes of this Agreement, the full face value of a
Bankers' Acceptance, without discount, shall be used when calculations are
made to determine the amount of Borrowings.

Section 7.02 - Conditions Applicable to Bankers' Acceptances

(a) Notice: The Borrower shall notify the Agent at the Agent's
Branch of Account by irrevocable written notice (which notice
shall be in the form and substance set out in Schedule "B") by
10:00 a.m. one (1) Business Day prior to the Drawdown Date in
respect of any Borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptances.

(b) Minimum Borrowing: Each Borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptances
shall be in a minimum aggregate face amount of $10,000,000.

(c) Face Amounts: The face amount of any Bankers' Acceptance shall
be $100,000 or any integral multiple thereof.

(d) Term: Bankers' Acceptances shall be issued and shall mature on a
Business Day. Each Bankers' Acceptance shall have a term of at
least thirty (30) days and not more than three hundred and
sixty-five (365) days excluding days of grace and shall mature on
or before the Maturity Date and shall be in form and substance
satisfactory to such Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, Bankers' Acceptances may from time to time be issued
for a term of seven (7) days if each Lender agrees at such time
to accept Bankers' Acceptances with such term in the amount
determined by the Agent in respect of such Lender in accordance
with Section 7.02(g); provided, however, that the failure of any
Lender to so agree shall not constitute a default by such Lender
under this Agreement for purposes of Section 6.15 or otherwise.

(e) Bankers' Acceptances in Blank: To facilitate the acceptance of
Bankers' Acceptances under this Agreement, the Borrower shall,
upon execution of this Agreement and from time to time as
required, provide to the Agent drafts, in form satisfactory to
the Agent, duly executed and endorsed in blank by the Borrower in
quantities sufficient for each Lender to fulfil its obligations
hereunder. Each Lender is hereby authorized to issue such
Bankers' Acceptances endorsed in blank in such face amounts as
may be determined by such Lender provided that the aggregate
amount thereof is equal to the aggregate amount of Bankers'
Acceptances required to be accepted by such Lender. No Lender
shall be responsible or liable for its failure to accept a
Bankers' Acceptance if the cause of such failure is, in whole or
in part, due to the failure of the Borrower to provide duly
executed and endorsed drafts to the Agent on a timely basis nor
shall any Lender be liable for any damage, loss or other claim
arising by reason of any loss or improper use of any such
instrument except loss or improper use arising by reason of the
gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Lender, its
officers, employees, agents or representatives. Each Lender
shall maintain a record with respect to Bankers' Acceptances (i)
received by it from the Agent in blank hereunder, (ii) voided by
it for any reason, (iii) accepted by it hereunder, (iv) purchased
by it hereunder and (v) cancelled at their respective maturities. 
Each Lender further agrees to retain such records in the manner
and for the statutory periods provided in the various provincial
or federal statutes and regulations which apply to such Lender.

(f) Execution of Bankers' Acceptances: Drafts of the Borrower to be
accepted as Bankers' Acceptances hereunder shall be duly executed
on behalf of the Borrower. Notwithstanding that any person whose
signature appears on any Bankers' Acceptance as a signatory for
the Borrower may no longer be an authorized signatory for the
Borrower at the date of issuance of a Bankers' Acceptance, such
signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all
purposes as if such authority had remained in force at the time
of such issuance and any such Bankers' Acceptance so signed shall
be binding on the Borrower.

(g) Issuance of Bankers' Acceptances: Promptly following receipt of
a notice of Borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptances, the Agent
shall so advise the Lenders and shall advise each Lender of the
face amount of each Bankers' Acceptance to be accepted by it and
the term thereof. The aggregate face amount of Bankers'
Acceptances to be accepted by a Lender shall be determined by the
Agent by reference to the respective Commitments of the Lenders,
except that, if the face amount of a Bankers' Acceptance, which
would otherwise be accepted by a Lender, would not be $100,000 or
an integral multiple thereof, such face amount shall be increased
or reduced by the Agent in its sole and unfettered discretion to
the nearest integral multiple of $100,000.

(h) Acceptance of Bankers' Acceptances: Each Bankers' Acceptance to
be accepted by a Lender shall be accepted at such Lender's Branch
of Account. 

(i) Purchase of Bankers' Acceptances: The Borrower may require any
Lender to purchase promptly, and in any event no later than one
(1) Business Day following written notice by the Borrower to such
Lender and the Agent, from the Borrower at such Lender's BA
Discount Rate any Bankers' Acceptance accepted by it and provide
to the Agent the BA Discount Proceeds for the account of the
Borrower. The Acceptance Fee payable by the Borrower to such
Lender under Section 7.04 in respect of each Bankers' Acceptance
accepted and purchased by such Lender may, at the option of such
Lender, be set off against the BA Discount Proceeds payable by
such Lender under this Section 7.02(i).

(j) Sale of Bankers' Acceptances: Each Lender may at any time and
from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise dispose of
any or all Bankers' Acceptances accepted and purchased by it.

(k) Waiver of Presentment and Other Conditions: The Borrower waives
presentment for payment and any other defence to payment of any
amounts due to a Lender in respect of a Bankers' Acceptance
accepted by it pursuant to this Agreement which might exist
solely by reason of such Bankers' Acceptance being held, at the
maturity thereof, by such Lender in its own right and the
Borrower agrees not to claim any days of grace if such Lender as
holder sues the Borrower on the Bankers' Acceptances for payment
of the amount payable by the Borrower thereunder. 

Section 7.03 - Repayment of Bankers' Acceptances

With respect to each Borrowing which is outstanding hereunder as
a Bankers' Acceptance, the Borrower shall give irrevocable telephone or
written notice (or such other method of notification as may be agreed upon
between the Agent and the Borrower) to the Agent at or before 2:00 p.m.
three (3) Business Days prior to the maturity date of such Bankers'
Acceptance followed by written confirmation electronically transmitted to
the Agent on the same day, of the Borrower's intention to issue Bankers'

Except to the extent that a Lender has set off its Acceptance Fee

in advance an Acceptance Fee forthwith upon the issuance of a Bankers'
Acceptance to be accepted by such Lender calculated at the rate per annum

applicable to a Bankers' Acceptance accepted by a Lender shall be received

condition, event or act would constitute an Event of Default, and in
addition to any other rights or remedies of any Lender and the Agent
hereunder, any Lender or the Agent as and by way of collateral security (or
such alternate arrangement as may be agreed upon by the Borrower and such
Lender or the Agent, as applicable) shall be entitled to deposit and retain
in an account to be maintained by the Agent (bearing interest at the
Agent's rates as may be applicable in respect of other deposits of similar
amounts for similar terms) amounts which are received by such Lender or the
Agent from the Borrower hereunder or as proceeds of the exercise of any
rights or remedies of any Lender or the Agent hereunder against the
Borrower, to the extent such amounts may be required to satisfy any
contingent or unmatured obligations or liabilities of the Borrower to the

ARTICLE VIII

PAYMENTS AND EVIDENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS

Section 8.01 - Place and Currency of Payment

Payments of principal, interest and fees payable by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid in the currency in which the
particular Borrowing is denominated and all other payments made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be paid in Canadian Dollars, all such payments to be
for value at or before 2:00 p.m. on the day such payment is due. If such
day is not a Business Day, such amount shall be deemed for all purposes of
this Agreement to be due on the Business Day next following such day and
any such extension of time shall be included for purposes of the
computation of interest or fees payable under this Agreement. Until such
time as the Borrowings shall have been declared to be due and payable, all
payments shall be made at the Agent's Account for Payments, unless
otherwise explicitly provided for elsewhere in this Agreement. If the
Borrowings are declared to be immediately due and payable, all payments,
after such demand, shall be made at the Agent's Branch of Account,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.

Section 8.02 - Application of Payments Prior to an Event of Default

All payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement prior to an Event of Default shall be made to (i) the
Lenders in the case of the Tranche A Facility and (ii) the Agent on behalf
of the Lenders in the case of the Tranche B Facility and, in each case,
shall be applied in each instance in the following order:

(i) firstly, in payment of any amounts due and payable as and
by way of agency fees and recoverable expenses hereunder;

(ii) secondly, in payment of any amounts due and payable as and
by way of facility fees referred to in Section 6.06; 

(iii) thirdly, in payment of any interest or default interest or
Acceptance Fees then due and payable on or in respect of
the Borrowings;

(iv) fourthly, in repayment of any principal amounts of the
Borrowings; and

(v) fifthly, in payment of any other amounts then due and
payable by the Borrower hereunder.

Section 8.03 - Manner of Payment and Taxes

All payments to be made by or on behalf of the Borrower under or
in connection with this Agreement are to be made without deduction or
withholding for or on account of any Tax in respect of the payment. If any
Tax is deducted or withheld from any payment, the Borrower shall promptly
remit to the Agent at the Agent's Account for Payment on behalf of each
affected Lender, in the currency in which such payment is to be made, the
equivalent of the amount so deducted or withheld together with relevant
official receipts or other evidence satisfactory to each such affected
Lender evidencing payment to the appropriate taxing authority of each such
Tax by the Borrower on behalf of each such affected Lender. If the
Borrower is prevented by operation of law or otherwise from paying, causing
to be paid or remitting such Tax, the interest payable under this Agreement
shall be increased to such rates as are necessary to yield and remit to
each such affected Lender the principal sum advanced together with interest
at the rates specified in this Agreement after provision for payment of
such Tax. From time to time at the request of the Agent on behalf of each
such affected Lender, the Borrower shall execute and deliver any and all
further instruments necessary or advisable to give full force and effect to
such increase in the rates of interest as are necessary to yield to a
Lender interest at the specified rates. The Borrower shall also indemnify
each such affected Lender in respect of the delay or failure of the
Borrower to make any such payment, including penalties relating thereto or
interest thereon.

Section 8.04 - No Set-Off

All payments to be made by or on behalf of the Borrower shall be
made without set-off or counterclaim.

Section 8.05 - Evidence of Indebtedness

With respect to the Tranche A Facility, each Lender shall open
and maintain on the books of such Lender's Branch of Account, accounts and
records evidencing the Borrowings made available by such Lender under this
Agreement. Each Lender shall record therein the amount of each Borrowing
made available by way of Prime Loans or Short-Term Fixed Rate Loans under
the Tranche A Facility, each payment of principal on account thereof and
interest becoming due to the Lender in respect of such Loans, and all
payments on account thereof. Such accounts and records maintained by each
of the Lenders will constitute, in the absence of manifest error, prima
facie evidence of the indebtedness of the Borrower owing to such Lender in
respect of Loans under the Tranche A Facility pursuant to this Agreement,
the date of each Borrowing made available by the Lender under the Tranche A
Facility and the amount thereof, and the amounts and the dates on which the
Borrower has made payments to the Lender from time to time on account of
the principal thereof and interest thereon.

With respect to amounts owing under this Agreement other than
Loans under the Tranche A Facility, the Agent shall open and maintain on
the books of the Agent at the Agent's Branch of Account, accounts and
records evidencing the Borrowings by each Lender made available by way of
Prime Loans and Libor Loans under the Tranche B Facility and each payment
of principal on account thereof, and shall record the Bankers' Acceptances
accepted and cancelled by each Lender, and all other amounts becoming
payable to the Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement other than Loans
under the Tranche A Facility, and all payments on account thereof. Such
accounts and records maintained by the Agent will constitute, in the
absence of manifest error, prima facie evidence of the indebtedness of the
Borrower owing to the Agent and each Lender pursuant to this Agreement
(other than in respect of Loans under the Tranche A Facility), the date of
each Borrowing under the Tranche B Facility made available by each Lender
and the amount thereof, and the amounts and the dates on which the Borrower
has made payments through the Agent on account of the principal of and
interest on the Borrowings under the Tranche B Facility, fees payable and
other amounts owing hereunder. 

The Agent shall maintain at the Agent's Branch of Account a
register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names of the Lenders,
the Commitments of the Lenders, the principal amount of each Loan owing to
each Lender from time to time, the aggregate face amount of Bankers'
Acceptances accepted by each Lender from time to time and the rates of
interest applicable to each outstanding Loan from time to time. Within two
(2) Business Days after the end of each month during the term of this
Agreement, the Agent shall provide a copy of the Register to the Borrower.

compliance with any term, covenant, condition or agreement herein

Agent by its terms, together with all powers reasonably incidental thereto. 
As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or the
Guarantee, the Agent is not required to exercise any discretion or to take
any action, but is required to act or to refrain from acting (and is fully
protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Majority Lenders. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
Guarantee notwithstanding, the Agent shall never be required to take any
action which exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is contrary
to this Agreement, the Guarantee or Applicable Laws. Except in respect of
the Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, no Lender shall have any
right of action whatsoever against the Agent as a result of the Agent
acting or refraining from acting hereunder or thereunder in accordance with
the terms of this Article XIV.

Section 14.02 - Arrangements for Tranche B Facility Borrowings

The Agent shall give notice to each Lender promptly in writing
upon receipt by the Agent of any request for a Borrowing under the Tranche
B Facility.

The Agent shall advise each Lender of the amount, date and
details of each such Borrowing and of each Lender's participation in each
such Borrowing. At or before 12:00 noon on the Drawdown Date or Conversion
Date, as applicable, each Lender will make its participation available to
the Borrower (i) if by way of Prime Loans and Libor Loans, through the
Agent's Account for Payments and (ii) if by way of the acceptance of

Prior to any acceleration of the Borrowings made pursuant to
Section 12.02 of this Agreement, upon receipt by the Agent of payments from
the Borrower on account of principal, interest, Acceptance Fees, facility
fees or any other payment made to the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, the
Agent shall pay over to each Lender the amount to which it is entitled
under this Agreement. Such payment shall be made promptly following
receipt and, in any event, the Agent shall use its best efforts to pay to
each Lender such amount on the same Business Day as received by the Agent.

Following any acceleration of the Borrowings pursuant to Section
12.02 of this Agreement, the Lenders shall share any payments subsequently
received in accordance with Section 12.04 of this Agreement. Each Lender
agrees to be bound by a decision of the Majority Lenders with respect to
any direction given to the Agent pursuant to Section 12.02 of this
Agreement. Each Lender shall, subject to Applicable Law, do all such acts
and things as may be necessary or convenient to enable the Agent to act
pursuant to any such direction.

Section 14.04 - Repayment by Lenders to Agent

(a) Unless the Agent has been notified in writing by the Borrower at
least one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which any payment
to be made by the Borrower hereunder is due that the Borrower
does not intend to remit such payment, the Agent may, at its
discretion, assume that the Borrower has remitted such payment
when so due and the Agent may, at its discretion and in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to each Lender on such
payment date an amount equal to such Lender's Proportion or such
other amount of such assumed payment. If the Borrower does not
in fact remit such payment to the Agent, the Agent shall promptly
notify each Lender and each Lender shall forthwith on demand
repay to the Agent the amount of such assumed payment made
available to such Lender, together with interest thereon until
the date of repayment thereof at a rate determined by the Agent
(such rate to be conclusive and binding on such Lender) in
accordance with the Agent's usual banking practice for advances
to financial institutions of like standing to such Lender.

(b) Unless the Agent has been notified in writing by a Lender at
least one (1) Business Day prior to a Drawdown Date or Conversion
Date that such Lender does not intend to make available its
Lender's Proportion of Prime Loans or Lender's Proportion or such
other amount of Libor Loans to be made available on such Drawdown
Date or Conversion Date, the Agent may, at its discretion, assume
that each Lender has remitted funds in an amount equal to its
Lender's Proportion of such Borrowing to the Agent and the Agent
may, at its discretion and in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower on such Drawdown Date or Conversion
Date an amount equal to such Lender's Proportion of such
Borrowing. If a Lender does not in fact remit such funds to the
Agent, the Agent shall promptly notify such Lender and such
Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Agent the amount made
available by the Agent on behalf of such Lender, together with
interest thereon until the date of payment thereof at a rate
determined by the Agent (such rate to be conclusive and binding
on such Lender) in accordance with the Agent's usual banking
practice for advances to financial institutions of like standing
to such Lender.

Section 14.05 - Disclaimer of Agent

validity, sufficiency or enforceability of any documents, papers, materials
or other information furnished by the Borrower, CFC or any other Person to

referred to herein. The Agent shall incur no liability to the Lenders
under or in respect of this Agreement or any documents delivered hereunder

reasonable exercise of its judgment or which may seem to it to be necessary
or desirable in the circumstances, except for its gross negligence or
wilful misconduct.

Chrysler Corporation and accordingly each Lender confirms to the Agent that
it has not relied, and will not hereafter rely on the Agent:

(a) to check or enquire on its behalf into the adequacy, accuracy or
completeness of any information provided by the Borrower, CFC,
Chrysler Canada or Chrysler Corporation in connection with this
Agreement (whether or not such information has been or is
hereafter circulated to such Lender by the Agent);

(b) to inquire as to the performance by the Borrower or CFC of their
respective obligations under this Agreement or the Guarantee; or

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor agent as
provided in this Section 14.07, the Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, and the Agent may
be removed at any time for cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a successor agent with the approval of the Borrower (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld). Any successor agent appointed under this
Section 14.07 shall be a Lender which has an office in Toronto, Ontario. 
If no successor agent shall have been appointed by the Majority Lenders and
shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the
retiring agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders'
removal of the retiring agent, then the retiring agent may, on behalf of
the Lenders and with the approval of the Borrower (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld), appoint a successor agent. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent by a successor agent, such successor agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring agent, and the retiring agent shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After
any retiring agent's resignation or removal hereunder as the Agent, the
provisions of this Agreement shall continue in effect for its benefit and
for the benefit of the Lenders in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by the retiring agent while it was acting as the Agent.

Each Lender may deal with the Borrower or CFC in all transactions
and generally do any banking business with either of them without having

same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent at the Agent's Branch of
Account.

and the Agent's duties hereunder and the Agent shall incur no liability to
the Borrower or any Lender by reason of relying on such document or acting
on such advice.

Agreement) which may be incurred or made by the Agent in connection with
the making, performance and enforcement of this Agreement for which the

Section 12.02 or after the cancellation or termination of the
Total Commitment, they will at any time or from time to time upon
the request of any Lender through the Agent purchase portions of
the Borrowings made available by the other Lenders which remain
outstanding (excluding any Borrowings under the Tranche A
Facility), and make any other adjustments which may be necessary
or appropriate, in order that the amounts of the Borrowings made
available by the respective Lenders which remain outstanding
(excluding any Borrowings under the Tranche A Facility), as
adjusted pursuant to this Section 14.17, will be in the same
proportions as the amounts of the Commitments of the respective
Lenders immediately prior to the cancellation or termination
thereof.

(b) The Lenders agree that, after an acceleration pursuant to Section

termination thereof.

under the Tranche A Facility and the Tranche B Facility
immediately prior to any acceleration pursuant to Section 12.02

respect of this Agreement or the Guarantee; provided that no Lender shall
be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Agent may refrain from exercising any right, power or
discretion or taking any action to protect or enforce the rights of any
Lender under this Agreement until it has been indemnified and/or secured to

(including legal fees) which it would or might sustain or incur as a result

or pursuant to an amalgamation, merger or consolidation of such Lender with
another entity or a similar transaction involving such Lender. The
Borrower shall upon request of the Agent or an assignee pursuant to this
Section 15.01 execute and deliver a form of undertaking for such assignee
in the form and substance set out in Schedule "J". 

Each Lender may sell participations to another Chartered Bank in
its Commitment or in all or any part of any Borrowing made available by it
hereunder, in which event, the participant shall not have any rights under
this Agreement or any document evidencing the Borrowing (the participant's
rights against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set
forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in favour of the participant
thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be
determined as if such Lender had not sold such participations, provided
that (a) the terms of any participation agreement or certificate relating
to any such participation shall prohibit any subparticipations by such
participant; (b) any such participation agreement or certificate shall
permit the Lender granting such participations the right to consent to
waivers, amendments or supplements to this Agreement without the consent of
such participant except in the case of (i) waivers of any Default or Event
of Default described in Section 12.01(a) or (b), and (ii) any amendment or
modification extending the maturity of any Borrowing, or reducing the
interest rate, Acceptance Fee or the facility fee, or extending the time of
payment of interest thereon, or reducing the principal amount thereof, in
each case to the extent such waiver, amendment or supplement directly
affects such participant; and (c) a participating interest of at least
$5,000,000 shall be sold pursuant to any such participation (unless, at the
Borrower's discretion, a lesser amount is mutually agreed upon between the
Borrower and such Lender).

Section 15.02 - Judgment Currency

If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court in any
jurisdiction with respect to this Agreement it becomes necessary to convert
into the currency of such jurisdiction (herein called the "Currency") any
amount due hereunder in any currency other than the Currency, then
conversion shall be made at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Business
Day before the day on which judgment is given. For this purpose "rate of
exchange" means the rate at which the Agent will, on the relevant date,
sell such currency in Toronto against the Currency. In the event that
there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Business
Day before the day on which the judgment is given and the date of payment
of the amount due, the Borrower will, on the date of payment, pay such
additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount
paid on such date is the amount in the Currency which when converted at the
rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment is the amount then due
under this Agreement in such other currency. Any additional amount due
from the Borrower under this Section 15.02 will be due as a separate debt
and shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sums due
under or in respect of this Agreement.

Section 15.03 - Governing Law

The parties agree that this Agreement is conclusively deemed to
be made under, and for all purposes to be governed by and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the Province of Ontario and of Canada
applicable therein without reference to its conflict of laws provisions,
and the obligations, rights and remedies of the parties hereunder shall be
determined in accordance with such laws.

Section 15.04 - Submission to Jurisdiction

The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits for
itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding commenced by any
party hereto relating to this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement
of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the Province of Ontario. The Borrower consents to any such
action or proceeding being brought in such courts, and waive any objection
that they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or
proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought
in an inconvenient court and agree not to plead or claim the same. The
Borrower agrees that service or process in any such action or proceeding
may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail
(or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the
Borrower at its address set forth on the signature pages hereto or at such
other address of which the Agent shall have been notified as set forth in
Section 16.01.

ARTICLE XVII

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 17.01 - Severability

Any provision of this Agreement which is or becomes prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, does not invalidate, affect or impair
the remaining provisions hereof in such jurisdiction and any such
prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction does not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 17.02 - Counterparts

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which when executed and delivered is an original but all of which
taken together constitute one and the same instrument; any party may
execute this Agreement by signing any counterpart of it.

Section 17.03 - Further Assurances

The Borrower shall from time to time promptly upon the request of
the Agent take such action, and execute and deliver such further documents,
as shall be reasonably required in order to fully perform the terms of, and
carry out the intention of, this Agreement.

Section 17.04 - Term of Agreement

This Agreement shall terminate on the later of the termination of
the Total Commitment and payment in full of all the Obligations.

Section 17.05 - New Lenders

During the term of this Agreement with the consent of the
Borrower, one or more additional Chartered Banks may become a party to this
Agreement by executing a supplement hereto with the Borrower, substantially
in the form and substance set out in Schedule "L" and, upon written
notification thereof to the Agent, such Chartered Bank (herein called a
"New Lender") shall become a Lender for all purposes from the date of such
supplement and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this
Agreement and the Guarantee, and the signature pages of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be amended to add the name, Commitment and Branch of
Account of such New Lender. Effective as of the date on which any New
Lender becomes a Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17.05,
the Total Commitment shall be increased by the amount of such New Lender's
Commitment. If, on the date of such written notification to the Agent,
there are Borrowings outstanding under the Tranche B Facility, the New
Lender on that date shall make available its Lender's Proportion of such
Borrowings by payment thereof on that date, or as soon thereafter as the
Agent determines it is practicable to do so, to the Agent for the
Borrower's account. Forthwith after receipt by the Agent from the New
Lender of its said Lender's Proportion, the Agent shall make available to
each Lender other than the New Lender on such payment date an amount equal
to such Lender's Proportion (based upon a Total Commitment exclusive of the
New Lender's Commitment) of such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, a Chartered Bank cannot become a New Lender when there are Libor
Loans or Bankers' Acceptances outstanding under the Tranche B Facility. 
The Borrower shall forthwith deliver an executed copy of the supplement to
the Agent which shall, in turn, advise the Lenders of each addition of a
New Lender hereunder, of the amount of its Commitment and of the amount of
any Borrowings from it hereunder made simultaneously upon its addition. 
The Borrower shall upon request of the Agent or a New Lender execute and
deliver a form of undertaking for such New Lender in the form and substance
set out in Schedule "J".

Section 17.06 - Increase in Commitments

During the term of this Agreement, with the consent of the
Borrower, any Lender may increase the amount of its Commitment by executing
a supplement hereto with the Borrower, in the form and substance set out in
Schedule "M", and upon written notification thereof to the Agent such
Lender shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and
the Guarantee with respect to the full amount of its Commitment as so
increased from the date of such supplement and the signature pages hereto
shall be deemed to be amended to add the increased Commitment of such
Lender. On and from the effective date upon which such Lender increases
its Commitment pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17.06, the Total
Commitment shall be increased by the amount of such Lender's additional
Commitment. If, on the date of such written notification to the Agent,
there are Borrowings outstanding under the Tranche B Facility such Lender
on that date shall adjust its Lender's Proportion of such Borrowings, after
giving effect to the increase in its Commitment, by payment of such
adjusting amount on that date, or as soon thereafter as the Agent
determines it is practicable to do so, to the Agent for the Borrower's
account. Forthwith after receipt by the Agent from such Lender of the
amount required to adjust its Lenders' Proportion, the Agent shall make
available to each other Lender on such payment date an amount equal to such
other Lender's Proportion (based upon a Total Commitment exclusive of the
increase in the Lender's Commitment) of such payment. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, a Lender cannot increase its Commitment
when there are Libor Loans or Bankers' Acceptances outstanding under the
Tranche B Facility. The Borrower shall forthwith deliver an executed copy
of the supplement to the Agent which shall, in turn, advise the Lenders of
such increase in the Commitment of a Lender and of the amount of any
Borrowings from it hereunder made simultaneously upon such increase.

Section 17.07 - Conflict

If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement
and the provisions of any document contemplated hereby or if the provisions
of any document contemplated hereby are inconsistent with the provisions of
this Agreement, then the provisions of this Agreement shall have priority
over and shall override the provisions of such other documents.

SECTION 2. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF SHORT TERM COMMITMENTS

2.1 Short Term Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, during the period from the Effective Date to and including the
Short Term Commitment Termination Date, each Bank severally agrees to
purchase from the Retail Sellers (each such purchase, a "Retail Purchase")
undivided participating interests in Retail Pooled Property and to purchase
from the Wholesale Seller (each such purchase, a "Wholesale Purchase")
undivided participating interests in Wholesale Trust Assets in amounts such
that at any one time such Bank's Invested Amount shall not exceed the
amount of such Bank's Short Term Commitment, provided that the Wholesale
Aggregate Senior Invested Amount shall not, after giving effect to any
proposed Wholesale Purchase, exceed the Wholesale Senior Certificate
Sublimit.

2.2 Related Documents. (a) Retail Purchases shall be made
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Short Term Retail PSA, and each
Bank's undivided participating interest in the Retail Pooled Property shall
be evidenced by a Retail Senior Certificate issued to such Bank pursuant to

(b) Wholesale Purchases shall be made pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Short Term Wholesale Series Supplement, and each Bank's
undivided participating interest in the Wholesale Trust Assets shall be
evidenced by a Wholesale Senior Certificate issued to such Bank pursuant to
the Short Term Wholesale Series Supplement.

2.3 Procedure for Purchase. The Sellers may utilize the Short
Term Commitment of each Bank during the period from the Effective Date to
and including the Short Term Commitment Termination Date on any
Distribution Date or any other Business Day, provided that the Company
shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must
be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City
time, (a) three Business Days prior to the requested Purchase Date, if all
or any part of the requested Purchase is to initially bear interest at a
rate based on the LIBO Rate or (b) one Business Day prior to the requested
Purchase Date, otherwise), specifying (i) the amount to be purchased, (ii)
the requested Purchase Date, (iii) whether the Purchase is to be a Retail
Purchase, a Wholesale Purchase or a combination thereof, (iv) if the
Purchase is to be entirely or partly a Wholesale Purchase and is made on a
Wholesale Distribution Date, the respective amounts of such Wholesale
Purchase which shall initially bear interest at a rate based on the LIBO
Rate and at a rate based on the Base Rate and (v) if any amount of such
Purchase shall bear interest based on the LIBO Rate, the date of the
succeeding Distribution Date; it being understood that (A) any Wholesale
Purchase made on a day other than a Wholesale Distribution Date shall bear
interest based on the Base Rate until the following Wholesale Distribution
Date and thereafter shall bear interest based on the LIBO Rate or the Base
Rate, as selected pursuant to the Short Term Wholesale Series Supplement,
and (B) any Retail Purchase made on a day other than a Retail Distribution
Date shall bear interest based on the Base Rate until the following Retail
Distribution Date and thereafter shall bear interest based on the LIBO
Rate. On each Purchase Date the Purchases under the Short Term Commitments
shall be in an aggregate amount equal to at least $100,000,000. Upon
receipt of any such notice from the Company, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Bank shall (subject to subsection
9.7(b)) deposit in its Clearing Account an amount in immediately available
funds equal to the amount of its pro rata share of each Purchase prior to
11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Purchase Date requested by the
Company. The Agent shall, pursuant to subsection 9.7(a), cause such amount
to be withdrawn from each such Clearing Account and shall make the
aggregate amount so withdrawn available to the Company for the benefit of
the Sellers by depositing the proceeds thereof in the account of the
Company with the Agent.

2.4 Fees. 

(a) CCC agrees to pay to the Agent, for the ratable account of
the Banks, a facility fee for each day from and including the Effective
Date to but excluding the later of (i) the last day of the Short Term
Commitment Period and (ii) the date on which the Aggregate Invested Amount
shall have been reduced to zero (such later date, the "Final Fee Payment
Date"). Such fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on (A) the first
Business Day of each January, April, July and October (for the three-month
period (or portion thereof) ended on the last day of the immediately
preceding month) and (B) on the Final Fee Payment Date (for the period
ended on such date for which no payment has been received pursuant to
clause (A) above) and shall be computed for each day during such period at
a rate per annum equal to 0.1500 of 1% of the Short Term Aggregate
Commitment Amount in effect on such day (or, if the Short Term Commitments
shall have been terminated, on the Aggregate Invested Amount on such day).

(b) Facility fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- or
366-day year, as the case may be, for actual days elapsed. Facility fees
that are not paid when due shall bear interest, payable on demand, from the
date when due until paid in full (both before and after judgment) at the
Default Rate.

(c) CCC agrees to pay the Administrative Agent a fee of $2000
per month with respect to each calendar month during which the Aggregate
Invested Amount exceeds zero at any time occurring during the period from
the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which
the Effective Date occurs until the Aggregate Invested Amount is zero and
the Short Term Commitments have terminated, payable in arrears on the last
Business Day of each such month.

(d) If any Bank becomes an "affected Purchaser" under Section
11.3(f)(i) of the Short Term Retail PSA or an "affected Bank Series
Certificateholder" under Section 8.5(i) of the Short Term Wholesale Series
Supplement following any "Change in Law" (as defined therein), CCC shall
thereafter increase that portion of the facility fee payable to such
affected Bank under paragraph (a) of this subsection 2.4 to a level, which,
in the opinion of such affected Bank, will adequately compensate such
affected Bank for the costs referred to in such agreements. The Company
may from time to time reduce the compensation to be received pursuant to
this paragraph (d) by any affected Bank as a result of any Change in Law,
to the average compensation (the "Average Compensation") the Company has
agreed, as provided above, to pay the affected Banks as a result of such
Change in Law (such average compensation to be measured by a percentage of
the aggregate Short Term Commitments of such affected Banks).

2.5 Termination or Reduction of Short Term Commitments. The
CFC Parties shall have the right, upon not less than five Business Days'
notice to the Agent, to terminate the Short Term Commitments or, from time
to time, to reduce the amount of Short Term Commitments. Any such
reduction shall be in an amount equal to $100,000,000 or a whole multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall reduce permanently the Short Term
Commitments then in effect.

2.6 Interest. (a) Each Retail Senior Certificate shall bear
interest as set forth in the Short Term Retail PSA.

(b) Each Wholesale Senior Certificate shall bear interest as set
forth in the Short Term Wholesale Series Supplement.

2.7 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each Purchase
hereunder, each payment by CCC on account of any facility fee hereunder and
any reduction of the Short Term Commitments of the Banks shall be made pro
rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the Banks. All
payments (including prepayments) by the Sellers on the Certificates and
with respect to fees shall be made without setoff or counterclaim to the
Agent for the account of the Banks at the office of the Agent referred to
in subsection 9.2 in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Agent
shall promptly distribute such payments to each Bank entitled to receive a
portion thereof by causing such Bank's portion of such payment to be
deposited in such Bank's Clearing Account.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have been notified in writing by any
Bank prior to a Purchase Date that such Bank will not make the amount that
would constitute its Commitment Percentage of the Purchase on such date
available to the Agent, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such
amount available to the Agent on such Purchase Date, and the Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company a
corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the Agent on a
date after such Purchase Date, such Bank shall pay to the Agent on demand
an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Effective Federal
Funds Rate during such period, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's
Commitment Percentage of such Purchase, times (iii) a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including
such Purchase Date to the date on which such Bank's Commitment Percentage
of such Purchase shall have become immediately available to the Agent and
the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Agent submitted to
any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Bank's Commitment
Percentage of such Purchase is not in fact made available to the Agent by
such Bank within three Business Days of such Purchase Date, the Agent shall
be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the Base Rate
on demand, from the Company.

2.8 Addition of Retail Sellers. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, from time to time a special purpose subsidiary of CFC
may become an additional Retail Seller party hereto by executing an
Additional Seller Supplement hereto and to the Short Term Retail PSA. From
and after the Retail Addition Date with respect to each additional Retail
Seller through but excluding the Retail Addition Date with respect to any
successive additional Retail Seller, all Retail Purchases shall be made
with the Retail Seller which last became party hereto and all other Retail
Sellers shall be party hereto and to the Short Term Retail PSA solely with
respect to Retail Pooled Property in which they previously sold
participating interests.

2.9 Additional Commitments. The Company may, with the consent
of the Agent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), (a) add any
additional Commercial Bank as a Bank pursuant to a New Bank Supplement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit F, duly executed and delivered by the
Company, the Agent and such Commercial Bank, whereupon such Commercial Bank
(herein called a "New Bank") shall become a Bank for all purposes and to
the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and
entitled to the benefits of this Short Term RPA and the Related Documents,
Schedule I hereto shall be deemed to be amended to add the name and Short
Term Commitment of such New Bank and the Short Term Aggregate Commitment
Amount shall be increased by the amount of such New Bank's Short Term
Commitment, effective as of the date on which any such New Bank becomes a
Bank pursuant to the provisions of this subsection 2.9(a), or (b) enable an
existing Bank to increase its Short Term Commitment pursuant to a Short
Term Commitment Increase Supplement, substantially in the form of Exhibit
G, duly executed and delivered by the Company, the Agent and such Bank,
whereupon such Bank shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this
Short Term RPA and the Related Documents with respect to the full amount of
its Short Term Commitment as so increased, Schedule I hereto shall be
deemed to be amended to add the increased Short Term Commitment of such
Bank, and the Short Term Aggregate Commitment Amount shall be increased by
the amount of such Bank's additional Short Term Commitment, effective as of
the date on which any such Bank increases its Short Term Commitment
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection 2.9. The CFC Parties shall
promptly execute and deliver appropriate Retail Senior Certificates and
Wholesale Series Certificates to each New Bank and, upon surrender of its
old Certificates, to each Bank increasing its Short Term Commitment.

the Short Term Commitments shall immediately terminate without notice of
any kind, which is hereby waived by the CFC Parties and (B) if such event
is any other Commitment Termination Event, so long as such Commitment
Termination Event shall be continuing, with the consent of the Required
Banks, the Agent may, or upon the request of the Required Banks, the Agent
shall, by notice to the Company declare the Short Term Commitments to be
terminated forthwith, whereupon the Short Term Commitments shall
immediately terminate.

SECTION 8. THE AGENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

8.1 Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints Chemical Bank as the Agent and as the Administrative Agent of such
Bank under this Short Term RPA and the Related Documents and each such Bank
irrevocably authorizes Chemical Bank, as the Agent and as Administrative
Agent for such Bank, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions
of this Short Term RPA and the Related Documents and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent or
the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, by the terms of this Short
Term RPA and the Related Documents, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary elsewhere in this Short Term RPA, neither the Agent nor the
Administrative Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except
those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any
Bank, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Short Term RPA or any
Related Document or otherwise exist against the Agent or the Administrative
Agent.

8.2 Delegation of Duties. Each of the Agent and the
Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Short Term
RPA and the Related Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. Neither the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys
in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

8.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agent, the
Administrative Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i) liable for
any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under
or in connection with this Short Term RPA or any Related Document (except
for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or
(ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any recitals,
statements, representations or warranties made by any CFC Party or any
officer thereof contained in this Short Term RPA or any Related Document or
in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or
provided for in, or received by the Agent or the Administrative Agent under
or in connection with, this Short Term RPA or any Related Document or for
the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency of this Short Term RPA or any Related Document or for any
failure of any CFC Party to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. Neither the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall be under
any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance
or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of,
this Short Term RPA or any Related Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records of any CFC Party.

8.4 Reliance by Agent and Administrative Agent. The Agent and
the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or
teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or
made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to any CFC Party),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent or the
Administrative Agent. The Agent and the Administrative Agent shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Short
Term RPA or any Related Document unless it shall first receive such advice
or concurrence of the Required Banks, or, if required under this Short Term
RPA, all the Banks, as it deems appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability
and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing
to take any such action. The Agent and the Administrative Agent shall in
all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
this Short Term RPA and the Related Documents in accordance with a request
of the Required Banks, or, if required under this Short Term RPA, all the
Banks, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and all future holders of the
Certificates.

8.5 Notice of Default. Neither the Agent nor the Administrative
Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any
Commitment Termination Event hereunder unless the Agent or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, has received notice from a Bank
or a CFC Party referring to this Short Term RPA, describing such Commitment
Termination Event and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". 
In the event that the Agent or the Administrative Agent receives such a
notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks. The Agent shall
take such action with respect to such Commitment Termination Event as shall
be reasonably directed by the Required Banks, or, if required under this
Short Term RPA, all the Banks; provided that unless and until the Agent
shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Commitment Termination Event as it shall deem advisable in
the best interests of the Banks.

8.6 Non-Reliance on Agent, Administrative Agent and Other Banks. 
Each Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent, the Administrative
Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties
to it and that no act by the Agent or the Administrative Agent hereinafter
taken, including any review of the affairs of the CFC Parties, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent or the
Administrative Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the Agent and
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the CFC Parties, the
Wholesale Master Trust, the Retail Pooled Property and the Wholesale Trust
Assets and made its own decision to make its Purchases hereunder and enter
into this Short Term RPA and the other Related Documents to which it is a
party. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Short Term RPA and the Related
Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the CFC Parties, the Wholesale Master
Trust, the Retail Pooled Property and the Wholesale Trust Assets. Except
for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished
to the Banks by the Agent or the Administrative Agent hereunder, neither
the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the CFC Parties, the Wholesale
Master Trust, the Retail Pooled Property and the Wholesale Trust Assets
which may come into the possession of the Agent or the Administrative Agent
or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

8.7 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify each of the
Agent and the Administrative Agent in their respective capacities as such
(to the extent not reimbursed by the CFC Parties and without limiting the
obligation of the CFC Parties to do so), ratably according to the
respective amounts of their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on
the date on which indemnification is sought under this subsection 8.7 (or,
if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Short Term
Commitments shall have terminated, ratably in accordance with such
Commitment Percentages immediately prior to such date) from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever
which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following
the payment of the Certificates) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agent or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in any
way relating to or arising out of this Short Term RPA, any of the Related
Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or
omitted by the Agent or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, under
or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Bank shall be
liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting solely from the Agent's or the Administrative
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this
subsection shall survive the payment of the Certificates and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

8.8 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in
any kind of business with the CFC Parties as though the Agent were not the
Agent hereunder and under the Related Documents. With respect to any
interest in Retail Pooled Property or Wholesale Trust Assets the Agent may
from time to time hold, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers
under this Short Term RPA and the Related Documents as any Bank and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Bank" and
"Banks" shall include the Agent in its individual capacity.

8.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 10
days' notice to the Banks. If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this
Short Term RPA and the Related Documents, then the Required Banks shall
appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks, which
successor agent shall be approved by the Company, whereupon such successor
agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent, and the
term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its
appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent
shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part
of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Short Term RPA or any
holders of the Certificates. After any retiring Agent's resignation as
Agent, the provisions of this subsection shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under
this Short Term RPA and the Related Documents.

8.10 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
may resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Agent. If
the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this
Short Term RPA and the Related Documents, then the Agent shall appoint a
successor administrative agent for the Banks, which successor agent shall
be approved by the Company, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to
the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term
"Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its
appointment, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and
duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any
of the parties to this Short Term RPA or any holders of the Certificates. 
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative
Agent, the provisions of this subsection shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative
Agent under this Short Term RPA and the Related Documents.

SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Short Term RPA, any
Related Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended,
supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this
subsection. With the written consent of the Required Banks, the Agent and
the CFC Parties may, from time to time, enter into written amendments,
supplements or modifications hereto and to the Related Documents for the
purpose of adding any provisions to this Short Term RPA or the Related
Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Banks or of the CFC
Parties hereunder or thereunder or waiving, on such terms and conditions as
the Agent may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this
Short Term RPA or the Related Documents or any Commitment Termination Event
and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such
amendment, supplement or modification shall (a) reduce the amount or extend
the maturity of any Certificate or any installment thereof, or reduce the
rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any fee
payable to any Bank hereunder, or change the amount of any Bank's Short
Term Commitment, in each case without the consent of each Bank directly
affected thereby, or (b) amend, modify or waive any provision of this
subsection or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
Banks or waive any of the provisions of subsection 4.3 or change the
definition of Short Term Commitment Termination Date or reduce the

Term Retail PSA or amend Sections 5.5 through 5.9 of the Short Term
Wholesale Series Supplement, in each case without the written consent of
all the Banks, or (c) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 8
without the written consent of the then Agent and Administrative Agent or
(d) amend the Short Term Wholesale Series Supplement without the
satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition (as defined in the Wholesale
PSA), if so required by the Wholesale PSA. Any such waiver and any such
amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the
Banks and shall be binding upon the CFC Parties, the Banks, the Agent, the
Administrative Agent and all future holders of the Certificates. In the
case of any waiver, the CFC Parties, the Banks, the Agent and the
Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights
hereunder and under the Related Documents, and any Commitment Termination
Event waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Commitment Termination
Event, or impair any right consequent thereon. Any amendment hereof or of
the Related Documents can be effected without the Administrative Agent
being a party thereto.

for all its out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the development, preparation and execution of, and any amendment,
supplement or modification to, this Short Term RPA, the Related

to the Agent and the Administrative Agent, 

(b) to pay or reimburse each Bank, the Administrative Agent and

preservation of any rights under this Short Term RPA, the Related
Documents and any such other documents, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of one firm of special counsel to the Agent, the

respect to any proceeding or related proceedings, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of one firm of special counsel in connection with
such proceeding(s)) with respect to the execution, delivery,
enforcement, performance and administration of this Short Term RPA,
the Related Documents and any such other documents (all the foregoing,
collectively, the "indemnified liabilities"), provided, that the
Company shall have no obligation hereunder to the Agent, the
Administrative Agent or any Bank with respect to indemnified
liabilities arising from (i) the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any such Bank or
(ii) the ordinary course administration of this Short Term RPA, the
Related Documents or such other documents by the Agent, the
Administrative Agent or any such Bank.

(e) The agreements in this subsection 9.5 shall survive payment
of the Certificates and all other amounts payable hereunder.

9.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations; Purchasing Banks. 
(a) This Short Term RPA shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the CFC Parties, the Banks, the Agent, the Administrative Agent, all future
holders of the Certificates, and their respective successors and assigns,
except that no CFC Party may assign or transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Short Term RPA without the prior written consent of
the Required Banks (other than in connection with the addition of an
additional Retail Seller pursuant to the terms hereof).

(b) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to
one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating
interests in any Certificate held by such Bank, the Short Term Commitment
of such Bank or any other interest of such Bank hereunder. In the event of
any such sale by a Bank of participating interests to a Participant, such
Bank's obligations under this Short Term RPA to the other parties to this
Short Term RPA shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely
responsible for the performance thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder
of any such Certificate for all purposes under this Short Term RPA and the
Company and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Short
Term RPA. No Participant shall have any rights under any Certificate (the
Participant's rights against such Bank in respect of such participation to
be those set forth in the agreement executed by such Bank in favor of the
Participant thereto) and all amounts payable with respect to the
Certificates shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold such
participations provided that (i) the terms of any participation agreement
or certificate relating to any such participation shall prohibit any
subparticipations by such participant; (ii) any such participation
agreement or certificate shall permit the Bank granting such participations
the right to consent to waivers, amendments or supplements to this Short
Term RPA and the Related Documents without the consent of such participant
except in the case of (a) waivers of any Commitment Termination Event
described in Section 7(a), and (b) any amendment or modification reducing
the amount or extending the maturity of any Certificate or any installment
thereof, or reducing the rate or extending the time of payment of interest
thereon, or reducing any fee payable to such Bank hereunder, in each case
to the extent such waiver, amendment or supplement directly affects such
participant and (ii) a participating interest of at least $5,000,000 shall
be sold pursuant to any such participation (unless, at the Company's
discretion, a lesser amount is agreed upon between the Company and such
Bank).

(c) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to
any Bank, and, with the consent of the Company and the Agent (which in each
case shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to one or more
additional Commercial Banks ("Purchasing Banks") all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Short Term RPA, the Related Documents and
the Certificates, pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, executed by
such Purchasing Bank, such transferor Bank and the Agent (and, in the case
of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank, by the Company), and
delivered to the Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register,
provided that (i) prior to the termination of the Short Term Commitments
(whether on the Short Term Commitment Termination Date or otherwise), any
such sale shall include a proportionate share of each of such transferor
Bank's Short Term Commitment, interests in Retail Pooled Property and
interests in Wholesale Trust Assets and, after any such termination, any
such sale may be of any combination of interests in Retail Pooled Property
and interests in Wholesale Trusts Assets, (ii) in the event of an
assignment of less than all of such Bank's obligations, (x) the principal
amount of such Bank's Short Term Commitment so sold (or, if no Short Term
Commitment is outstanding, the principal amount of interests in Retail
Pooled Property and Wholesale Trust Assets so sold) shall be in an
aggregate amount of $6,000,000 or more and (y) after giving effect to any
such assignment, the transferor Bank and the Purchasing Bank (in each case
together with any Bank which is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or
such Purchasing Bank, respectively) shall each have obligations hereunder
and under the Related Documents aggregating not less than $6,000,000
(unless, in each case, at the Company's discretion, a lesser amount is
agreed upon between the Company and such transferor Bank or Purchasing
Bank, respectively), and (iii) no assignment hereunder shall be effective
unless and until the Agent shall be given written notice of the Clearing
Account of the Purchasing Bank; provided, further, however, that no consent
by the Company shall be required in the case of assignments to a Commercial
Bank controlled by, controlling or under common control with an assignor
Bank or pursuant to a merger or consolidation of such Bank with another
entity or a similar transaction involving such Bank. Upon such execution,
delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date
determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the Purchasing
Bank thereunder shall be a party hereto and the Related Documents and, to
the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
obligations of a Bank hereunder with a Short Term Commitment as set forth
therein, and (y) the transferor Bank thereunder shall, to the extent
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under this Short Term RPA (and, in the case of an Assignment
and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor Bank's
rights and obligations under this Short Term RPA and the Related Documents,
such transferor Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Such Assignment
and Acceptance shall be deemed to amend this Short Term RPA to the extent,
and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such
Purchasing Bank and the resulting adjustment of Commitment Percentages
arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Bank of all or a portion of
the rights and obligations of such transferor Bank under this Short Term
RPA and the Related Documents. On or prior to the effective date
determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, each Seller, at its
own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the
surrendered Retail Senior Certificate and Wholesale Senior Certificate a
new Retail Senior Certificate and Wholesale Senior Certificate issued in
the name of such Purchasing Bank pursuant to the Short Term Retail PSA and
the Short Term Wholesale Series Supplement and, if the transferor Bank has
a retained Short Term Commitment hereunder, new Retail Senior Certificate
and Wholesale Senior Certificate issued in the name of the transferor Bank.

(d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
subsection 9.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and
a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names, addresses and
Clearing Accounts of the Banks and the Short Term Commitment of, and
principal amount of the interests in Retail Pooled Property and Wholesale
Trust Assets sold to, each Bank from time to time. The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the CFC
Parties, the Agent, the 
Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the interests in Retail Pooled
Property and Wholesale Trust Assets recorded therein for all purposes of
this Short Term RPA. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
CFC Parties or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. The Agent shall give prompt written notice to the
Company of the making of any entry in the Register or any change in any
such entry. 

(e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by
a transferor Bank and a Purchasing Bank (and, in the case of a Purchasing
Bank that is not then a Bank or an affiliate thereof, by the Company and
the Agent), together with payment to the Agent of a registration and
processing fee of $2,500 (or such lesser amount as may be agreed to by the
Agent), the Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance
and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto record the
information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such
acceptance and recordation to the Banks and the Company. 

(f) Each CFC Party authorizes each Bank to disclose to any
Participant or Purchasing Bank (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Bank's possession
concerning such CFC Party and its affiliates which has been delivered to
such Bank by or on behalf of such CFC Party pursuant to this Short Term RPA
or which has been delivered to such Bank by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with such Bank's credit evaluation of such CFC Party and its
affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Short Term RPA.

(g) If, pursuant to this subsection 9.6, any interest in this
Short Term RPA or any Certificate is transferred to any Transferee which is
organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States
or any State thereof, the transferor Bank shall cause such Transferee,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to represent to
the transferor Bank (for the benefit of the transferor Bank, the Agent and
the CFC Parties) that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be
required to be withheld by the Agent, the CFC Parties or the transferor
Bank with respect to any payments to be made to such Transferee in respect
of the Certificates, (ii) to furnish to the transferor Bank (and, in the
case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Agent and the
CFC Parties) either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 (wherein such Transferee claims
entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all
interest payments hereunder) and (iii) to agree (for the benefit of the
transferor Bank, the Agent and the CFC Parties) to provide the transferor
Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register,
the Agent and the CFC Parties) a new Form 4224 or Form 1001 upon the
expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form and comparable
statements in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and
amendments duly executed and completed by such Transferee, and to comply
from time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with regard
to such withholding tax exemption.

9.7 Clearing Accounts. (a) Each Bank irrevocably authorizes
the Agent and the Administrative Agent to cause such Bank's Clearing
Account to be debited as contemplated in subsection 2.3 and to cause to be
created an overdraft in such account if the balance in such Bank's Clearing
Account on a particular date is less than the amount of the Purchase to be
made by such Bank on such day. In addition each Bank irrevocably
authorizes the Agent and the Administrative Agent to cause such Bank's
Clearing Account to be credited, as contemplated in subsection 2.7(a), with
its ratable share of payments received by the Agent from the Sellers. The
Clearing Account of each Bank shall be maintained at its own expense and
free of charge to the Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Company.

(b) The Agent may at any time in its sole discretion, upon
notice to the Company and the Banks, discontinue the use of ACH procedures
in connection with Purchases made pursuant hereto, and the Banks shall
thereafter fund each Purchase required to be made by them hereunder by
making available the amount thereof to the Agent for the account of the
Sellers at the office of the Agent set forth in subsection 9.2 in funds
immediately available to the Agent.

9.8 Adjustments; Set-off.

(a) If any Bank (a "benefitted Bank") shall at any time receive
any payment of all or part of its investments in Retail Pooled Property or
Wholesale Trust Assets, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in
respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant
to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 7(d), or
otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral
received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's
investments in Retail Pooled Property or Wholesale Trust Assets, or
interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the
other Banks such portion of each such other Bank's investments in Retail
Pooled Property or Wholesale Trust Assets, or shall provide such other
Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as
shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Bank to share the excess
payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the

appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any
other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case
whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured,
at any time held or owing by such Bank or any branch or agency thereof to

set-off and application.

to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this

Addition Date, all Purchases shall be made with the Active Seller.

SECTION 2.4 Warranties as to Each Receivable. On each Transfer
Date, the Active Seller hereby makes the following warranties as to each
Receivable and the Related Property transferred on such date, on which the
Agent, the Administrative Agent and each Purchaser shall rely in accepting
such Receivable and such Related Property transferred on such date. 

(a) Individual Characteristics of the Receivables. Each
Receivable and, where applicable, the related Contract (i) has been
originated in the United States of America by a Dealer in a retail
sale of a Financed Vehicle in the ordinary course of such Dealer's
business, has been fully and properly executed by the parties thereto,
has been validly assigned to CCC by such Dealer and by CCC to CFC and
has been purchased by, and validly assigned to, the Active Seller from
CFC and has been validly sold, transferred and assigned by the Active
Seller to the Purchasers in accordance with its terms and the terms of
the Purchase Agreement and this Short Term Retail PSA, (ii) is secured
by a perfected, valid, subsisting and enforceable first priority
security interest in favor of CCC in the related Financed Vehicle,
which security interest is assignable, and has been so assigned, by
CCC to CFC, by CFC to the Active Seller and by the Active Seller to
the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers,
(iii) contains customary and enforceable provisions such that the
rights and remedies of the holder of such security interest are
adequate for realization against the collateral of the benefits of the
security, (iv) provides for level monthly payments which fully
amortize the Amount Financed over the original term (except for the
last payment of any Fixed Value Receivable) and provides for interest
at the related APR set forth in such related Contract and (v) has a
next Scheduled Payment not more than one month after the related
Cutoff Date.

(b) Schedule of Contracts; Calculations. The information set
forth in the supplements to Schedules I and II setting forth the
Standard Receivables and Fixed Value Receivables transferred by the
Active Seller on such date is true and correct as of the close of
business on the related Cutoff Date. The Principal Balance of each
Receivable has been accurately and correctly calculated.

(c) Compliance with Law. Each Contract with respect to any
Receivable and the sale of the related Financed Vehicle complied at
the time it was originated or made, and complies as of the date such
warranty is made, in all material respects with all requirements of
applicable federal, state, and local laws, and regulations thereunder,
including usury laws, the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, Federal Reserve
Board Regulations B, AA and Z, state adaptations of the National
Consumer Act and of the Uniform Consumer Act and of the Uniform
Consumer Credit Code, and any other consumer credit, equal opportunity
and disclosure laws.

(d) Binding Obligation. Each Contract with respect to any
Receivable constitutes the genuine, legal, valid, and binding payment
obligation in writing of the Obligor, enforceable in accordance with
its terms.

(e) Contracts in Force. No Contract with respect to any
Receivable has been satisfied, subordinated, or rescinded, and the
Financed Vehicle has not been released from the Lien granted by such
Contract in whole or in part.

(f) No Amendment or Waiver. No provision of any Contract with
respect to any Receivable has been amended, waived, altered or
modified in any respect, except pursuant to a document, instrument or
written notation included in the Receivable File and no such amendment
or waiver causes such Contract not to conform to the other warranties
contained in this Section.

(g) No Defenses. No Contract with respect to any Receivable is
subject to any right of rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense,
including the defense of usury, and the operation of any of the terms
of such Contract, or the exercise of any right thereunder, will not
render such Contract unenforceable in whole or in part or subject to
any right of rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense, including
the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission, setoff,
counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto.

(h) No Liens. There are no liens or claims, including liens for
work, labor or materials relating to, or the storage of, the Financed
Vehicle, that are liens prior or equal to, the Lien granted by the
Contract with respect to any Receivable.

(i) No Default. Except for delinquent payments of not more than
90 days on any Contract, (i) no default, breach, violation, or event
permitting acceleration under the terms of a Contract with respect to
any Receivable exists, (ii) no continuing condition that with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default, breach,
violation, or event permitting acceleration under the terms of a
Contract with respect to any Receivable has arisen and (iii) the
Active Seller has not waived any of the foregoing.

(j) Insurance. As of the execution of the Contract with respect
to any Receivable, a physical damage insurance policy covering the
Financed Vehicle securing such Receivable was in full force and
effect, in accordance with the Servicer's customary servicing
procedures.

(k) Valid Transfer. No Receivable has been sold, assigned,
pledged or otherwise conveyed by the Active Seller to any Person other
than the Purchasers pursuant hereto, and, immediately prior to the
transfer and assignment herein contemplated, the Active Seller had
good title to each Receivable free and clear of any Lien or other
right or interest of any other Person, was the sole owner thereof and
had full right and power to transfer and assign such Receivable to the
Purchasers. This Short Term Retail PSA constitutes a valid sale,
transfer and assignment to the Purchasers of all right, title and
interest of the Active Seller in and to the Receivables and all
proceeds (as defined in the UCC in effect in the State of New York)
thereof (other than the right, title and interest thereof which will
be retained by the Active Seller and evidenced by the Subordinated
Certificate), free and clear of any Lien or other right or interest of
any other Person.

(l) Lawful Assignment. No Receivable has been originated in or
is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction under which the sale,
transfer and assignment of such Receivable hereunder, or pursuant to
any issuance or transfer of the Senior Certificates, is unlawful,
void, or voidable.

(m) All Filings Made. All filings, including UCC filings,
necessary in any jurisdiction to give the Administrative Agent for the
benefit of the Purchasers a first priority perfected ownership
interest in each Receivable and the Related Property have been made
and Schedule IV sets forth the only locations where UCC filings are to
be made to give such a first priority perfected ownership interest.

(n) Valid Security Interest. On such Transfer Date, there shall
exist a valid, subsisting and enforceable first priority perfected
security interest in the Financed Vehicle securing the Receivable
related to such Financed Vehicle (subject to any statutory lien
arising by operation of law after such date which is prior to such
security interest) and, at such time as enforcement of such security
interest is sought, there shall exist a valid, subsisting and
enforceable first priority perfected security interest in the Financed
Vehicle in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Purchasers (subject to any statutory lien arising by operation of law
after such date which is prior to such interest).

(o) Capacity of Parties. All parties to each Contract with
respect to any Receivable had capacity to execute such Contract.

(p) Obligations; No Impairment. Each of the Active Seller, CCC,
CFC and the Dealer party to a Contract with respect to any Receivable
has duly fulfilled all obligations on its part to be fulfilled under,
or in connection with, such Contract and has done nothing to impair
the rights of the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser in
such Contract or the proceeds thereof.

(q) No Fraud or Misrepresentation. No Contract with respect to
any Receivable was originated by a Dealer and sold by such Dealer to
CCC, by CCC to CFC, and by CFC to the Active Seller with any conduct
constituting fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such Person.

(r) Possession; One Original. For each Contract with respect to
any Receivable, there is only one original executed Contract, which on
such date will, together with the related Receivable File, be conveyed
hereunder by the Active Seller to the Purchasers and, pursuant to this
Short Term Retail PSA, will be held by the Servicer as bailee of the
Administrative Agent and the Purchasers. No other custodial
agreements are in effect other than as contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement.

(s) Bulk Transfer Laws. The transfer, assignment and conveyance
of each Receivable and the related Receivable File by the Active
Seller pursuant to this Short Term Retail PSA is not subject to the
bulk transfer or any similar statutory provisions in effect in any
applicable jurisdiction.

SECTION 2.5 Warranties as to the Receivables in the Aggregate
and Actions of the Seller. On each Transfer Date, the Active Seller
warrants that:

(a) Aggregate Principal Balance. The aggregate Principal
Balance of the Receivables Group transferred on such date is
accurately set forth in the related Assignment. The information set
forth in the Schedule of Anticipated Collections with respect to the
Receivables Group transferred on such date is true and accurate as of
the close of business on the related Cutoff Date.

(b) Additional Characteristics of the Receivables. The
Contracts with respect to any Receivable being transferred on such
date have the following characteristics: (i) each Contract had an
original maturity of not more than 73 months and a remaining maturity
of not more than 65 months; (ii) the final scheduled payment date on
each Contract is no later than the Scheduled Maturity Date; (iii) each
Contract had a remaining gross balance of not less than $1,000; (iv)
no Contract was more than 90 days past due as of the related Cutoff
Date; (v) no Financed Vehicle had been repossessed, without
reinstatement of the related Contract, as of the related Cutoff Date;
(vi) no Obligor on any Contract was the subject of a bankruptcy
proceeding as of the related Cutoff Date; (vii) the Obligor on each
Contract is not the United States of America or any State or any
agency, department or instrumentality of any of the foregoing; (viii)
each Contract is covered by insurance in accordance with CCC's
customary servicing procedures; and (ix) with respect to the
Receivables Group transferred on such date, the aggregate Principal
Balance of the Receivables with respect to such Receivables Group
which are financed at CCC's used vehicle rate is not more than 50% of
the aggregate Principal Balance of all the Receivables with respect to
such Receivables Group.

(c) Selection Criteria. The Receivables purchased from CFC were
selected from among the receivables in CFC's portfolio that met the
criteria set forth in Sections 2.4 and 2.5(b) utilizing selection
procedures that were not adverse to the Purchasers.

(d) Computer Tape. The Computer Tape as prepared by the
Servicer and made available by the Seller on such date was complete
and accurate as of the related Cutoff Date and includes a description
of the same Receivables that are described in the supplements to
Schedules I and II, as delivered by the Active Seller by such date.

(e) Marking Records. By such Transfer Date, the Active Seller
has caused the Servicer to mark clearly and unambiguously the portions
of any electronic ledger relating to the Receivables transferred on
such date to show that such Receivables constitute part of the Pooled
Property and are owned by the Certificateholders in accordance with
the terms of this Short Term Retail PSA.

(f) Receivable File. Each document or instrument described in
paragraphs (a) through (d) of Section 2.7 as part of a Receivable File
is contained in each such Receivable File on such date.

(g) No Assignment. The Active Seller has not taken any action
to convey any right to any Person that would result in such Person
having a right to payments received under the Insurance Policies or
payments due in respect of the Receivables transferred on such date.

SECTION 2.6 Repurchase Upon Breach. Each Seller and the
Servicer shall inform each such other Person and each of the Agent and the
Administrative Agent promptly in writing upon the discovery of any breach
by such Seller of the warranties made by such Seller pursuant to Sections
2.4 or 2.5 and the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit a copy of
such writing to the Purchasers. Unless the breach shall have been cured by
the second Determination Date immediately succeeding the date on which such
Seller becomes aware of, or is informed in writing of, such breach, such
Seller shall repurchase any Receivable materially and adversely affected by
any such breach as of such Determination Date; provided that in the event
of a breach with respect to any Receivable of a warranty made by such
Seller pursuant to Sections 2.4(h), 2.4(k) or 2.4(n), such Seller shall
repurchase such Receivable on the next succeeding Determination Date, but
only to the extent that it has become aware of or been informed in writing
of such breach by such time. In consideration of the repurchase of a
Receivable hereunder, the related Seller shall remit the Repurchase Amount
of such Receivable, no later than the close of business on the date
determined according to the preceding sentence and in the manner specified
in Section 5.5. Except with respect to the representation and warranty set
forth in Section 2.4(c), the sole remedy of the Agent, the Administrative
Agent or any Purchaser with respect to a breach of the warranties made by
any Seller pursuant to Sections 2.4 or 2.5 shall be to require such Seller
to repurchase Receivables pursuant to this Section 2.6.

SECTION 2.7 Custody of Receivable Files. To assure uniform
quality in servicing the Receivables and to reduce administrative costs,
the Administrative Agent, the Agent and each Certificateholder, upon such
Person's execution and delivery of this Short Term Retail PSA, revocably
appoints the Servicer as agent, and the Servicer as agent for each such
Person accepts such appointment, to act as custodian on behalf of each such
Person of the following documents or instruments with respect to the
Receivables transferred on any Transfer Date (collectively, a "Receivable
File"), which will as of such Transfer Date be constructively delivered to
the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Certificateholders:

(a) the original Contracts in respect of the Standard
Receivables and Fixed Value Receivables transferred on such date;

(b) the original credit applications, in respect of such
Receivables, fully executed by the respective Obligors;

(c) the original certificates of title or such documents that
CCC or CFC shall keep on file, in accordance with its customary
procedures, evidencing the security interest of CFC in the Financed
Vehicles which secure such Receivables; and

(d) any and all other documents that CCC or the Active Seller
shall keep on file, in accordance with its customary procedures,
relating to the Standard Receivables or Fixed Value Receivables, the
Obligors or the Financed Vehicles.

Neither the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall be obligated
to review any Receivable File to determine that each item referred to in
this Section 2.7 is contained therein. 

SECTION 2.8 Duties of Servicer as Custodian. (a) Safekeeping. 
The Servicer, in its capacity as custodian, shall hold the Receivable Files
on behalf of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of all present and
future Certificateholders, and maintain such accurate and complete
accounts, records, and computer systems pertaining to each Receivable as
shall enable the Servicer, the Agent and the Administrative Agent to comply
with the terms and provisions of this Short Term Retail PSA applicable to
it. In performing its duties as custodian hereunder, the Servicer shall
act with reasonable care, using that degree of skill and attention that the
Servicer exercises with respect to the receivable files relating to all
comparable automotive receivables that the Servicer services for itself or
others. The Servicer shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, periodic
audits of the Receivable Files held by it under this Short Term Retail PSA
and of the related accounts, records and computer systems, in such a manner
as shall enable the Administrative Agent to verify the accuracy of the
Servicer's record keeping. The Servicer shall promptly report to the
Administrative Agent any failure on its part to hold the Receivable Files
and maintain its accounts, records and computer systems as herein provided
and promptly take appropriate action to remedy any such failure. Nothing
herein shall be deemed to require an initial review or any periodic review
by the Administrative Agent or the Agent of the Receivable Files.

(b) Maintenance of and Access to Records. The Servicer shall
maintain each Receivable File at one of its offices specified in Schedule 3
to this Short Term Retail PSA or at such other office as shall be specified
to the Administrative Agent and the Agent by written notice, which notice
shall state any change in such location and shall be received on or prior
to the date on which such location is changed. The Servicer shall make
available to the Administrative Agent and the Agent or their respective
duly authorized representatives, attorneys or auditors a list of locations
of the Receivable Files and the related accounts, records and computer
systems maintained by the Servicer at such times as the Administrative
Agent or the Agent shall instruct.

(c) Release of Documents. Upon written instructions from the
Administrative Agent, the Servicer shall release any Receivable File to the
Administrative Agent or its respective agents or designees at such place or
places as the Administrative Agent may designate, as soon thereafter as is
practicable. 

(d) Title to Receivables. The Servicer agrees that, in respect
of any Receivable held by the Servicer as custodian hereunder, the Servicer
will not at any time have or in any way attempt to assert any interest in
such Receivable or the related Receivable File, except that the Servicer
may assert an interest in such Receivable solely for the purpose of
collecting or enforcing the Receivable for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Certificateholders. The entire equitable
interest in such Receivable and the related Receivable File shall at all

ARTICLE IV

Administration and Servicing of the Pooled Property

SECTION 4.1 Duties of Servicer; Delegations. (a) The Seller,
the Administrative Agent, the Agent and each Purchaser hereby revocably
appoints CCC as Servicer for the Receivables and the Related Property and
CCC hereby accepts such appointment. The Servicer, as agent for the
Administrative Agent, the Agent and the Certificateholders, shall manage,
service, administer and make collections on the Receivables (other than
Repurchased Receivables) with reasonable care, using that degree of skill
and attention that the Servicer exercises with respect to all comparable
automotive receivables that it services for itself or others. The
Servicer's duties shall include collection and posting of all payments,
responding to inquiries of Obligors on such Receivables, investigating
delinquencies, sending payment coupons to Obligors, reporting tax
information to Obligors, accounting for collections, furnishing monthly and
annual statements to the Administrative Agent, the Agent and the
Certificateholders and making Advances pursuant to Section 5.4. Subject to
the provisions of Section 4.2, the Servicer shall follow its customary
standards, policies and procedures in performing its duties as Servicer. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer is
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself, the
Administrative Agent, the Agent and the Certificateholders or any of them,
any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or partial or full
release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to
such Receivables or to the Financed Vehicles securing such Receivables. If
the Servicer shall commence a legal proceeding to enforce a Receivable, the
Certificateholders (in the case of a Receivable other than a Repurchased
Receivable) shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically assigned,
solely for the purpose of collection, such Receivable to the Servicer. If
in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it shall be held that the
Servicer may not enforce a Receivable on the ground that it shall not be a
real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce such Receivable the
Required Purchasers shall, on behalf of the Certificateholders and at the
Servicer's expense, take steps to enforce such Receivable, including
bringing suit in the name of the Servicer, the Seller, the Administrative
Agent, the Agent or the Certificateholders. Each of the Agent, the
Administrative Agent and the Certificateholders shall upon the written
request of the Servicer furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney
and other documents reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable the
Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.

(b) In the event of any delegation of servicing authority or the
appointment of any subservicer by the Servicer, and notwithstanding the
provisions of any agreement permitting such subservicing or delegation, the
Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Administrative Agent, the
Agent and the Certificateholders for the servicing and administering of the
Receivables and the Related Property in accordance with the provisions of
this Short Term Retail PSA without diminution of such obligation or
liability by virtue of such subservicing or delegation agreements or
arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from a subservicer, to the
same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer
alone were servicing and administering the Receivables and the Related
Property. 

SECTION 4.2 Collection and Allocation of Receivable Payments. 
The Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to collect all payments called
for under the terms and provisions of the Receivables as and when the same
shall become due and shall follow such collection procedures as it follows
with respect to all comparable automotive receivables that it services for
itself or others. The Servicer shall allocate collections between
principal and interest in accordance with the customary servicing
procedures it follows with respect to all comparable automotive receivables
that it services for itself or others. The Servicer may grant extensions,
rebates or adjustments on a Standard Receivable or Fixed Value Receivable,
which shall not, for the purposes of this Short Term Retail PSA, modify the
original due dates or amounts of the Scheduled Payments on a Precomputed
Receivable or the original due dates or amounts of the originally scheduled
payments of interest on Simple Interest Receivables; provided, however,
that if the Servicer extends the date for final payment by the Obligor of
any Receivable beyond the Scheduled Maturity Date, it shall promptly
repurchase the Receivable from the Purchasers in accordance with the terms
of Section 4.7. The Servicer may in its discretion waive any late payment
charge or any other fees that may be collected in the original course of
servicing a Receivable. The Servicer shall not agree to any alteration of
the interest rate on any Receivable or of the amount of any Scheduled
Payment on Precomputed Receivables or the originally scheduled payments on
Simple Interest Receivables.

SECTION 4.3 Realization Upon Receivables. The Servicer, on
behalf of the Administrative Agent and the Certificateholders, shall use
its best efforts, consistent with its customary servicing procedures, to
repossess or otherwise acquire the ownership of the Financed Vehicle
securing any Receivable as to which the Servicer shall have determined
eventual payment in full is unlikely. To realize upon such Receivables,
the Servicer shall use such procedures as it follows with respect to all
comparable automotive receivables that it services for itself or others,
which may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any recourse to
Dealers and selling the Financed Vehicle at public or private sale. The
foregoing shall be subject to the provision that, in any case in which the
Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the Servicer shall not expend
funds in connection with the repair or the repossession of such Financed
Vehicle unless it shall determine in its discretion that such repair and/or
repossession will increase the Liquidation Proceeds by an amount greater
than the amount of such expenses.

SECTION 4.4 Physical Damage Insurance. The Servicer shall, in
accordance with its customary servicing procedures, require that each
Obligor shall have obtained physical damage insurance covering the Financed
Vehicle as of the execution of the Standard Receivable or the Fixed Value
Receivable.

SECTION 4.5 Maintenance of Security Interests in Financed
Vehicles. The Servicer shall, in accordance with its customary servicing
procedures, take such steps as are necessary to maintain perfection of the
security interest created by each Standard Receivable and Fixed Value
Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. The Servicer is hereby
authorized to take such steps as are necessary to re-perfect such security
interest on behalf of the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers in the
event of the relocation of a Financed Vehicle or for any other reason. If
there has been a Service Default (or the occurrence of an event of the type
described in Section 9.1(a)(vi) or (vii) with respect to the Active Seller
if CCC is the Servicer), upon the request of the Required Purchasers, each
of the Servicer and the Sellers, at their expense, shall promptly and duly
execute and deliver such documents and instruments, and take such other
actions as may be necessary, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel
delivered to the Administrative Agent (addressed to the Administrative
Agent, the Agent and each Purchaser), to perfect the Administrative Agent's
interest in the Receivables and the Related Property against all other
Persons, including, without limitation, the delivery of the Receivable
Files to the Administrative Agent, its agent or its designee, the
endorsement and delivery of the Insurance Policies or the notification of
the insurers thereunder, the execution of transfer instruments and the
endorsement to the Administrative Agent and the delivery of the
certificates of title to the Financed Vehicles to the appropriate motor
vehicle department (or other appropriate governmental agency).

SECTION 4.6 Covenants of Servicer. The Servicer shall not (a)
release the Financed Vehicle securing any Receivable from the security
interest granted by such Receivable in whole or in part except in the event
of payment in full by the Obligor thereunder or repossession, (b) impair
the rights of the Certificateholders in such Receivables, (c) increase the
number of scheduled payments due under a Standard Receivable or Fixed Value
Receivable and (d) change in any material respect its current credit and
collection policies (including, without limitation, its policy in respect
of the timing of charging off Receivables as uncollectible) so as to have a
material adverse effect on the Purchasers without the prior written consent
of the Required Purchasers.

SECTION 4.7 Purchase by Servicer Upon Breach. The Active Seller
or the Servicer shall inform each such other Person and each of the Agent
and the Administrative Agent promptly in writing upon the discovery of any
breach by the Servicer of its covenants under Sections 4.2, 4.5 or 4.6, and
the Administrative Agent shall give a copy of such writing to the
Purchasers. Unless the breach shall have been cured by the second
Determination Date immediately succeeding the date on which the Servicer
becomes aware of, or is informed in writing of, such breach, the Servicer
shall purchase any Receivable materially and adversely affected by any such
breach as of such Determination Date; provided that in the event of a
breach with respect to any Receivable of a covenant made by the Servicer
pursuant to Section 4.6(a) or 4.6(c), the Servicer shall purchase such
Receivable on the next succeeding Determination Date, but only to the
extent that it has become aware of or been informed in writing of such
breach by such time. If the Servicer takes any action pursuant to Section
4.2 that impairs the rights of the Certificateholders in any Receivable or
as otherwise provided in Section 4.2, the Servicer shall purchase such
Receivable. In consideration of the purchase of any such Receivable
pursuant to either of the two preceding sentences, the Servicer shall remit
the Repurchase Amount in the manner specified in Section 5.5. For purposes
of this Section, the Repurchase Amount shall consist, in part, of a release
by the Servicer of all rights of reimbursement with respect to Outstanding
Precomputed Advances and Outstanding Simple Interest Advances on the
Receivable. The sole remedy of the Agent, the Administrative Agent or the
Certificateholders against the Servicer with respect to a breach pursuant
to Sections 4.2, 4.5 or 4.6 shall be to require the Servicer to purchase
Receivables pursuant to this Section.

SECTION 4.8 Servicing Compensation; Servicer Expenses. (a) The
Servicer shall be entitled to a fee (the "Servicing Fee") with respect to
an Accrual Period which shall be an amount equal to the product of 1/12 of
1% and the Pool Balance on the first day of such Accrual Period. The
Servicing Fee shall be payable to the Servicer monthly in arrears on each
Distribution Date, but only to the extent that funds are available therefor
in accordance with Section 5.6. The Servicer shall also be entitled to all
late fees, prepayment charges, including, in the case of a Receivable that
provides for payments according to the "Rule of 78s" and that is prepaid in
full, the difference between the Principal Balance of such Receivable (plus
accrued interest to the date of prepayment) and the principal balance of
such Receivable computed according to the "Rule of 78s", and other
administrative fees or similar charges allowed by applicable law with
respect to Receivables, collected (from whatever source) on the
Receivables.

(b) The Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred
by or on behalf of it in connection with its activities hereunder
(including (i) fees, disbursements and expenses of the Administrative Agent
and the Agent (including fees and disbursements of counsel to the
Administrative Agent and the Agent), any custodian appointed by the
Administrative Agent and independent accountants), (ii) taxes imposed on
the Servicer and (iii) expenses incurred in connection with distributions
and reports to the Agent, the Administrative Agent and the
Certificateholders) except expenses incurred in connection with realizing
upon Receivables under Section 4.3.

SECTION 4.9 Servicer's Certificate. On each Determination Date,
the Servicer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (which shall forward
a copy thereof on the related Distribution Date to each Purchaser) an
Officer's Certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto (a
"Servicer's Certificate"), containing all information necessary to make the
distributions and deposits pursuant to Sections 5.6 and 5.7 (including, if
required, withdrawals from or deposits to the Payahead Account and Advances
by the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.4) for the Collection Period
preceding the date of such Servicer's Certificate. Receivables to be
purchased by the Servicer or to be repurchased by the Seller shall be
identified by the Servicer by account number with respect to such
Receivable (as specified in Schedules I or II). The Administrative Agent
agrees to furnish the Servicer with information available to the
Administrative Agent necessary to complete the Servicer's Certificate with
respect to the Purchasers and amounts on deposit in the Certificate
Account, the Reserve Account and the Yield Account. Delivery of the
Servicer's Certificate shall constitute a representation and warranty by
the Servicer that the information contained therein is accurate in all
material respects on and as of such Determination Date.

SECTION 4.10 Quarterly and Annual Statements as to Compliance;
Notice of Service Default.

offices of the Servicer. Nothing in this Section shall affect the

SECTION 5.1 Establishment of Bank Accounts. (a) On or prior to
the Effective Date the Administrative Agent shall establish with the Agent
an account into which the Servicer shall deposit collections on account of
the Receivables and the Related Property during each Collection Period (the
"Collection Account"). The Collection Account shall be established and
maintained as a segregated trust account in the corporate trust office of
the Agent in the name of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Purchasers. The Administrative Agent shall direct the Agent (or other
Person where the Collection Account is then maintained) to invest funds on
deposit in the Collection Account in Eligible Investments as from time to
time are specified by the Administrative Agent which, in any case, shall
mature not later than the next succeeding Deposit Date. All monies
deposited in or credited to the Collection Account (including net
investment earnings on Eligible Investments) shall be a part of the Pooled
Property.

(b) On or prior to the Effective Date the Administrative Agent
shall establish with the Agent an account into which (i) the Servicer shall
transfer collections on account of the Pooled Property on each Deposit
Date, (ii) the Seller and the Servicer shall transfer collections on
account of the Pooled Property and make deposits in respect of their
obligations hereunder and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall deposit
amounts withdrawn from the Reserve Account or the Yield Account pursuant
hereto (the "Certificate Account"). The Certificate Account shall be
established and maintained as a segregated trust account in the corporate
trust department of the Agent in the name of the Administrative Agent on
behalf of the Purchasers. Funds on deposit in the Certificate Account
shall be invested by the Administrative Agent in Eligible Investments which
mature not later than the next succeeding Deposit Date. All monies
deposited in or credited to the Certificate Account (including net
investment earnings on Eligible Investments) shall be a part of the Pooled
Property.

(c) On or prior to the Effective Date the Administrative Agent
shall establish with the Agent an account into which Reallocated Payments
and Reserve Account Deposits may be deposited (the "Reserve Account"). The
Reserve Account shall be established and maintained as a segregated trust
account in the corporate trust office of the Agent in the name of the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Purchasers. Funds on deposit in the
Reserve Account shall be invested in Eligible Investments which mature not
later than the next succeeding Deposit Date. All monies deposited in or
credited to the Reserve Account (including net investment earnings on
Eligible Investments) shall be part of the Pooled Property.

(d) On or prior to the Effective Date the Administrative Agent
shall establish with the Agent an account into which a Seller will, if the
APR Increment is greater than zero with respect to any Transfer Date,
deposit a Yield Deposit on such Transfer Date, which deposit will be used
in calculating the Adjusted Weighted Average APR on such date (the "Yield
Account"). The Yield Account shall be established and maintained as a
segregated trust account in the corporate trust office of the Agent in the
name of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Purchasers. Funds on
deposit in the Yield Account shall be invested in Eligible Investments
which mature not later than the next succeeding Deposit Date. All monies
deposited in or credited to the Yield Account (including net investment
earnings on Eligible Investments) shall be part of the Pooled Property.

(e) On or prior to the Effective Date, the Administrative Agent
shall establish with the Agent an account into which the Servicer shall,
in accordance with Section 5.3(a), deposit all Payaheads received in
respect of Precomputed Receivables (the "Payahead Account"; collectively
with the Collection Account, the Certificate Account, the Reserve Account
and the Yield Account, the "Trust Accounts"). The Payahead Account shall
be established and maintained as a segregated trust account in the
corporate trust office of the Agent in the name of the Administrative Agent
on behalf of the Purchasers. Funds on deposit in the Payahead Account
shall be invested in Eligible Investments which mature not later than the
next succeeding Deposit Date. All monies deposited in or credited to the
Payahead Account (including net investment earnings on Eligible
Investments) shall be part of the Pooled Property. If Chemical Bank ceases
to be the Agent, each of the Trust Accounts shall promptly be established
or maintained as a segregated trust account in the name of the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Purchasers in the corporate trust
office of one or more Eligible Institutions.

SECTION 5.2 Collections. The Servicer shall as promptly as
practicable deposit into the Collection Account (but in no event later than
two Business Days following the receipt thereof) all payments by or on
behalf of the Obligors with respect to the Receivables (other than
Repurchased Receivables and not including Fixed Value Payments) and all
Liquidation Proceeds, both as collected during any Collection Period,
provided, that, with the prior written consent of the Required Purchasers,
so long as no Service Default is continuing and CCC remains the Servicer
hereunder, the Servicer need not make such daily deposits but may make a
single deposit into the Collection Account in same day funds not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding
the Distribution Date in a net amount equal to the amount which would have
been on deposit with respect to the immediately preceding Collection Period
in the Collection Account. Prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on each
Deposit Date, the Administrative Agent shall remit all such amounts to the
Certificate Account. For purposes of this Article V the phrase "payments
by or on behalf of Obligors" shall mean payments made with respect to the
Receivables by persons other than the Servicer, the Sellers or CFC.

SECTION 5.3 Application of Collections. (a) All collections
for the Collection Period shall be applied by the Servicer as follows (in
the following order of priority):

(i) Repayments of Advances. With respect to each Receivable
(other than a Repurchased Receivable), payments by or on behalf of the
Obligor shall be applied, in the case of Precomputed Receivables, to
reduce Outstanding Precomputed Advances as described in Section 5.4(a)
and, in the case of Simple Interest Receivables, to reduce Outstanding
Simple Interest Advances to the extent described in Section 5.4(b).

(ii) Payments in Respect of Receivables. Any excess shall be
applied, in the case of Precomputed Receivables, to the Scheduled
Payment and, in the case of Simple Interest Receivables, to interest
and principal in accordance with the Simple Interest Method.

(iii) Excess to Payahead Account. With respect to Precomputed
Receivables, any remaining excess shall be added to the Payahead
Balance, and shall be applied to prepay the Precomputed Receivable,
but only if the sum of such excess and the previous Payahead Balance
shall be sufficient to prepay the Receivable in full. Otherwise, any
such remaining excess payments shall constitute a Payahead and shall
increase the Payahead Balance.

(b) All Liquidation Proceeds and any subsequent Recoveries with
respect to any Fixed Value Receivable shall be applied first to the related
Receivable and only after the payment in full of the Principal Balance
thereof plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall any such Liquidation
Proceeds or Recoveries be applied to, or constitute, the related Fixed
Value Payment.

SECTION 5.4 Advances.

(a) Advances on Precomputed Receivables. As of the close of
business on the last day of each Collection Period, if the payments by or
on behalf of the Obligor on a Precomputed Receivable (other than a
Precomputed Receivable which has become a Repurchased Receivable in such
Collection Period) shall be less than the Scheduled Payment with respect to
such Precomputed Receivable, the Servicer shall take the following actions
(in the following order of priority):

(i) the Payahead Balance shall be applied by the Servicer to the
extent of the shortfall and such Payahead Balance shall be reduced
accordingly;

(ii) the Servicer shall advance the amount equal to any remaining
shortfall (such amount a "Precomputed Advance"), to the extent that
the Servicer, at its sole discretion, shall determine that the
Precomputed Advance shall be recoverable from any of the Obligor, the
Repurchase Amount, Liquidation Proceeds or proceeds of any other
Precomputed Receivables.

Any Precomputed Advance made by the Servicer shall increase Outstanding
Precomputed Advances, which Outstanding Precomputed Advances shall be
reduced by any subsequent payments by or on behalf of the Obligor,
collections of Liquidation Proceeds in respect of Precomputed Receivables
or payments of the Repurchase Amount. If the Servicer shall determine that
an Outstanding Precomputed Advance with respect to any Precomputed
Receivable shall not be recoverable in accordance with the preceding
sentence, the Servicer shall be reimbursed from any collections made on
other Precomputed Receivables which are included in the Pooled Property and
Outstanding Precomputed Advances with respect to such Precomputed
Receivables shall be reduced accordingly.

(b) Advances on Simple Interest Receivables. As of the close of
business on the last day of each Collection Period, the Servicer shall
advance an amount equal to the amount of interest due on the Simple
Interest Receivables at their respective APRs for the related Collection
Period (assuming the Simple Interest Receivables pay on their respective
due dates) minus the amount of interest actually received on the Simple
Interest Receivables during the related Collection Period (such amount, a
"Simple Interest Advance"). With respect to each Simple Interest
Receivable, the Simple Interest Advance shall increase Outstanding Simple
Interest Advances. If such calculation results in a negative number, an
amount equal to such negative number shall be paid to the Servicer and the
amount of Outstanding Simple Interest Advances shall be reduced by such
amount. In addition, in the event that a Simple Interest Receivable
becomes a Liquidated Receivable, Liquidation Proceeds with respect to a
Simple Interest Receivable attributable to accrued and unpaid interest
thereon (but not including interest for the then current Collection Period)
shall be paid to the Servicer to reduce Outstanding Simple Interest
Advances but only to the extent of any Outstanding Simple Interest
Advances. The Servicer shall not make any advance with respect to
principal of Simple Interest Receivables.

SECTION 5.5 Additional Deposits. (a) The Servicer shall
deposit in the Certificate Account the aggregate Advances pursuant to
Section 5.4. To the extent that the Servicer fails to make a Simple
Interest Advance pursuant to Section 5.4(b) on the date required, the
Servicer shall notify the Administrative Agent to withdraw such amount (or,
if determinable, such portion of such amount as does not represent advances
for delinquent interest) from the Reserve Account and deposit such amount
in the Certificate Account. The Servicer and the Seller shall deposit or
cause to be deposited in the Certificate Account the aggregate Repurchase
Amount with respect to Repurchased Receivables. The Servicer shall deposit
therein all amounts to be paid under Section 10.2. The Seller shall
deposit therein any amounts paid to it under each Interest Rate Cap
Agreement. The Servicer shall direct the Administrative Agent to make any
Monthly Yield Account Withdrawal and deposit the amount so withdrawn in the
Certificate Account. All deposits pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) shall be
made on the Deposit Date.

(b) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall cause to be
transferred from the Payahead Account to the Certificate Account, in
immediately available funds, the aggregate previous Payaheads to be applied
to Scheduled Payments on Precomputed Receivables for the related Collection
Period or prepayments for the related Collection Period, pursuant to
Sections 5.3 and 5.4, in the amounts set forth in the Servicer's
Certificate for such Distribution Date. A single, net transfer may be
made.

SECTION 5.6 Distributions. On each Distribution Date, the
Administrative Agent shall make the following distributions of amounts on
deposit in the Certificate Account with respect to the related Collection
Period, as shown from the Servicer's Certificate delivered on the preceding
Determination Date, in the following order of priority (to the extent of
amounts available therefor):

(a) Shortfall Interest. To each Purchaser, in accordance with
its Purchase Percentage, as a payment of Certificate Interest due on
any prior Distribution Date which was not paid on such prior
Distribution Date as a result of insufficient amounts on deposit in
the Certificate Account from the sources described herein for the
payment therefor at such or any later Distribution Date ("Shortfall
Interest"), plus interest on such Shortfall Interest; any such
Shortfall Interest shall bear interest at the Default Rate and shall
be payable, to the extent of funds available therefor, from (i)
Interest Distribution Amounts for the Collection Period preceding such
Distribution Date, (ii) if necessary after application of amounts
pursuant to clause (i), the Applicable Subordinated Percentage of the
Principal Distribution Amount for such Collection Period, (iii) if
necessary after application of amounts pursuant to clause (ii),

if necessary after application of amounts pursuant to clause (iii),
from the Applicable Senior Percentage of the Principal Distribution
Amount for such Collection Period (clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv),
collectively, "Available Amounts"; provided that any determination and
application of Available Amounts shall be made in the order of the
priority established by the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv)); and provided, further, that the calculation of Available
Amounts with respect to each distribution under this Section 5.6
(other than distributions under Sections 5.6(e) and (j)) shall not
include any amounts on account of Realized Losses.

(b) Shortfall Principal. To each Purchaser as payment of all or
that portion of the Applicable Senior Percentage of the Principal
Distribution Amounts due on any prior Distribution Date which was not
paid on such prior Distribution Date as a result of insufficient
amounts of principal collections on deposit in the Certificate Account
at such Distribution Date, payable, to the extent of funds available
therefor, from Available Amounts.

(c) Reimbursement of Advances. To the Servicer, the aggregate
amount of Advances, which, prior to such Distribution Date, have not
been reimbursed pursuant to this Section, payable, to the extent of
funds available therefor, from Available Amounts.

(d) Senior Certificate Interest. To each Purchaser, Certificate
Interest payable on such Purchaser's Purchase Percentage of the Senior
Amount at the Certificate Rate applicable to the Accrual Period to
which such Distribution Date relates, payable, to the extent of funds
available therefor, from Available Amounts.

(e) Senior Certificate Principal. To each Purchaser, in
reduction of the Senior Amount, Certificate Principal to such
Purchaser in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the product of such
Purchaser's Purchase Percentage and the then outstanding Senior Amount
and (b) the product of (i) such Purchaser's Purchase Percentage and
(ii) the Applicable Senior Percentage of the Principal Distribution
Amount for the Accrual Period preceding such Distribution Date,
payable, to the extent of funds available therefor, from Available
Amounts.

(f) Servicing Fee. To the Servicer as payment of the Servicing
Fee for the Accrual Period to which such Distribution Date relates,
payable, to the extent of funds available therefor, from Available
Amounts.

(g) Reserve Account Deposit. To the Reserve Account to the
extent necessary to cause the Specified Reserve Account Balance to
equal the Minimum Reserve Account Balance, payable, to the extent of
funds available therefor, from Available Amounts.

(h) Increased Costs. To any Senior Certificateholder (or the
Administrative Agent or the Agent pursuant to Section 11.3) which has
submitted a demand for Increased Costs during any preceding Collection
Period pursuant to Section 11.3, payment of (i) interest, payable at a
rate per annum equal to the Default Rate, on Increased Costs due on
any prior Distribution Date which were not paid on such prior
Distribution Date as a result of insufficient amounts being available
for the payment therefor at such Distribution Date and (ii) the amount
of such Increased Costs as so demanded, payable, in each case, from
Available Amounts of the type described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
definition of such term.

(i) Subordinated Certificate Interest. To the holder of the
Subordinated Certificate as Certificate Interest payable on the
Subordinated Certificate at the Certificate Rate for the related
Accrual Period, from the remaining Interest Distribution Amounts.

(j) Subordinated Certificate Principal. To the Seller as
Certificate Principal payable on and as a reduction of the
Subordinated Certificate for the preceding Accrual Period, payable, to
the extent of funds available therefor, from the Applicable
Subordinated Percentage of the Principal Distribution Amount for the
related Collection Period.

(k) Remaining Amounts to Seller. To the Seller, all remaining
Interest Distribution Amounts and any other amounts remaining in the
Certificate Account.

Distributions to any Purchaser pursuant to any of the foregoing
paragraphs shall be made to such Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.7 of the
Short Term RPA. The Servicer shall, in its sole discretion, allocate among
the Sellers any amounts due and payable to the Sellers hereunder and
neither the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall have any obligation to
make such allocation. Any distributions to the Servicer or the Sellers
shall be made on a net basis to such Persons, to the extent that the
Servicer or such Seller shall have failed to make a deposit or payment
required hereunder.

SECTION 5.7 Subordination; Reserve Account.

(a) The rights of each of the Sellers to receive distributions
in respect of the Subordinated Certificate and any payments in respect of
any Seller Subordinated Note shall be and hereby are subordinated, and made
junior, to the rights of the Purchasers to receive distributions in respect
of the Senior Certificates. Such subordination shall be effected pursuant
to the priority of payments set forth in Section 5.6.

(b) In order to effect the subordination provided for herein and
to provide for the prompt payment to the Purchasers pursuant to Section
5.6, the Seller as holder of the Subordinated Certificate, on behalf of
itself and its successors and assigns, sells, conveys and transfers to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers all of the Seller's
right, title and interest in and to the Reserve Account, all amounts on
deposit therein from time to time and all proceeds thereof. Neither the
Seller nor the Servicer shall have any right to withdraw amounts from the
Reserve Account.

(c) If at any time the Specified Reserve Account Balance is less
than the Minimum Reserve Account Balance, then on the first succeeding
Distribution Date thereafter, and on each succeeding Distribution Date
thereafter so long as the Specified Reserve Account Balance is less than
the Minimum Reserve Account Balance, any distributions that would be made
if the Servicer is CCC, to the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.6(c) (such
amounts, "Reallocated Payments") (or such lesser amounts as may be
necessary to cause the Specified Reserve Account Balance to at least equal
the Minimum Reserve Account Balance) shall be deposited by the
Administrative Agent into the Reserve Account, and held as set forth in
Section 5.1 and this Section 5.7.

(d) If on any Determination Date the distributions to be made
from Available Amounts exceed such Available Amounts of the type described
in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of such term, as shown from the
Servicer's Certificate for such Determination Date, the Administrative
Agent on the following Distribution Date shall withdraw from the Reserve
Account an amount equal to such excess, if then on deposit in the Reserve
Account (or, if a lesser amount is on deposit, such lesser amount), and
deposit such amount in the Certificate Account.

(e) If the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.4 determines on any
Determination Date that it is required to make an Advance and does not do
so from its own funds, the Servicer shall instruct the Administrative Agent
to withdraw funds from the Reserve Account and deposit them in the
Certificate Account to cover any shortfall. Such payment shall be deemed
to have been made by the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.4 for purposes of
making distributions pursuant to this Short Term Retail PSA, but shall not
otherwise satisfy the Servicer's obligation to deliver the amount of the
Advances, and the Servicer shall within two Business Days replace any funds
in the Reserve Account so used.

(f) If on any Deposit Date (after giving effect to distributions
to be made to the Purchasers on the next succeeding Distribution Date), the
sum of the amounts on deposit in the Reserve Account and the Yield Account
equals or exceeds the Senior Amount (plus any other amounts due and payable
to the Purchasers under this Short Term Retail PSA) on such date, the
Administrative Agent shall withdraw such amounts from the Reserve Account
and the Yield Account and deposit such withdrawal in the Certificate
Account to pay to each of the Purchasers, on the related Distribution Date,
an amount equal to such Purchaser's Purchase Percentage of the then
outstanding Senior Amount (plus any such other amounts owing to such
Purchaser hereunder).

(g) If on any date the Senior Amount has been reduced to zero,
any amounts then on deposit in the Reserve Account and the Yield Account,
after giving effect to the distributions made on the Scheduled Maturity
Date, shall be distributed to the Active Seller, on the Business Day
following the Scheduled Maturity Date.

SECTION 5.8 Interest Rate Cap Agreements. If, on any
Distribution Date, the aggregate notional amount under an Interest Rate Cap
Agreement shall exceed the then outstanding aggregate Principal Balance of
the related Receivables Group by an amount which shall be specified in such
Interest Rate Cap Agreement, then the Administrative Agent shall give
notice to each Cap Provider thereunder to reassign such excess of the
aggregate notional amount under such Interest Rate Cap Agreement to the
related Seller on such Distribution Date.

ARTICLE VI

The Certificates; Transfers of Purchase Commitments

SECTION 6.1 The Certificates. The Senior Certificates and the
Subordinated Certificate shall be substantially in the forms of Exhibits A
and B, respectively, with, in the case of each Senior Certificate,
appropriate insertions as to the Purchaser and its Purchase Commitment and
Purchase Percentage. Each Purchaser is hereby authorized to record (a)
with respect to each Purchase, the Transfer Date and its pro rata share of
the Purchase Price and (b) the date and amount of each payment or
prepayment of principal hereunder on the schedule annexed to and
constituting a part of its Senior Certificate and any such recordation
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information so
recorded, provided that the failure so to record the amount of any such pro
rata portion of a Purchase Price or any error in so recording such amount
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Sellers
hereunder.

SECTION 6.2 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates. 
If (a) any mutilated Certificate shall be surrendered to the Active Seller
or (b) the Active Seller shall receive evidence satisfactory in its
reasonable discretion of the destruction, loss, or theft of any Certificate
and a certificate of an authorized officer of the Holder named in the
Register certifying as to such destruction, loss or theft, the Active
Seller shall execute and deliver to the Holder named in such Certificate
or, in the case of a Senior Certificate, to the Administrative Agent for
delivery to such Holder, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like stated
amount (as indicated from the Register). Any tax or other governmental
charge which may be imposed in connection with the issuance of any new
Certificate under this Section 6.2 shall be for the account of the
Servicer. Any replacement Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 6.2
shall constitute conclusive evidence of the undivided participating
ownership of the Pooled Property, as if originally issued, whether or not
the lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

SECTION 6.3 Transfer and Exchange of Certificates. (a) The
Administrative Agent shall maintain, or cause to be maintained a register
(the "Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may
prescribe, the Administrative Agent shall provide for the recordation of
the names and addresses of, and the Purchase Commitment and Purchase
Percentage of, the Purchasers. The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Seller, the Servicer,
CFC, the Agent, the Administrative Agent and each Purchaser may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the Holder of the
Certificate recorded therein for all purposes of this Short Term Retail
PSA. The Administrative Agent shall also maintain at such address copies
of each Commitment Transfer Supplement delivered to it.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.1, the
Subordinated Certificate shall be held by the Active Seller, on behalf of
itself and all the other Sellers, and shall not be transferable.

(c) Any Purchaser may sell participations in, or sell all or a
portion of, the rights and obligations of such Purchaser hereunder and
under its Senior Certificate in accordance with the terms of Section 9.6 of
the Short Term RPA.

SECTION 6.4 Persons Deemed Owners. Each of the Agent and the
Administrative Agent may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate
shall be recorded in the Register as the owner of such Certificate for the
purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to Section 5.6 and for all
other purposes, and neither the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall be
bound by any notice to the contrary. The Administrative Agent shall
furnish or cause to be furnished to the Servicer, within fifteen days after
receipt by the Administrative Agent of a request therefor from the
Servicer, in such form as the Servicer may reasonably require, a list of
the names and addresses of the Senior Certificateholders as of the most
recent Record Date.

misfeasance, bad faith, or negligence in the performance of its duties
hereunder or by reason of reckless disregard of the obligations and duties
hereunder, (ii) any action taken, or failed to be taken, by such Seller in
respect of any portion of the Pooled Property or (iii) any breach of the

from Persons other than such Seller, such Person shall immediately upon
receipt thereof repay such amounts to such Seller, without interest.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, amounts
required to be paid by any Seller as indemnification under this Section 7.2
shall be limited to amounts received by such Seller on account of the
Subordinated Certificate.

this Short Term Retail PSA to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal
action that shall be unrelated to its respective obligations under this
Short Term Retail PSA and that in its respective opinions may involve it in
any expense or liability.

the terms and provisions of, nor constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time) a default under, the certificate or articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the Servicer, or any indenture, agreement
or other instrument to which the Servicer is a party or by which it
shall be bound; nor result in the creation or imposition of any Lien

have made any indemnity payments to any Person indemnified under this

may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Short Term Retail PSA
and the rights and duties of the parties to this Short Term Retail PSA and
the interests of the Certificateholders under this Short Term Retail PSA.

9.2.

ARTICLE IX

Service Defaults

SECTION 9.1 Service Defaults.

(a) If any one of the following events ("Service Defaults")
shall occur and be continuing:

(i) Any failure by the Servicer (or, for so long as CCC is the
Servicer, the Active Seller) to make or to cause to be made any
required payment or deposit, which shall continue unremedied for a
period of two Business Days following the due date therefor;

(ii) Any failure by the Servicer to deliver to the Administrative
Agent the Servicer's Certificate for any Collection Period required
hereunder within five Business Days from the date on which such
Servicer's Certificate shall be due to be delivered; 

(iii) Except for the transfer of the Transferred Property by the
Servicer to CFC, the Servicer shall have assigned, transferred,
pledged or otherwise conveyed such Transferred Property (or any
portion thereof) to any other Person;

(iv) Failure on the part of the Servicer (or, for so long as CCC
is the Servicer, the Active Seller) to duly observe or to perform in
any material respect any other covenants or agreements set forth in
the Certificates or in this Short Term Retail PSA, which failure
continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which
written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied,
shall have been given to the Servicer (or, for so long as the CCC is
the Servicer, the Active Seller) by the Agent, the Administrative
Agent and the Required Purchasers; 

(v) If, at any date, there shall exist a material
misrepresentation with respect to any representation or warranty made
by the Servicer hereunder or in the Purchase Agreement (other than a
material misrepresentation in respect of a Repurchased Receivable),
which continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on
which written notice of such misrepresentation, requiring the same to
be remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer (or, for so long as
CCC is the Servicer, the Seller) by the Agent, the Administrative
Agent or the Required Purchasers;

(vi) The entry of a decree or order by a court or agency or
supervisory authority of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a conservator, receiver, liquidator or trustee for any of the
Servicer, CFC or Chrysler Corporation in any bankruptcy, insolvency,
readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities, or
similar proceedings, or for the winding up or liquidation of its
affairs, and any such decree or order continues unstayed and in effect
for a period of 60 consecutive days; 

(vii) The consent by any of the Servicer, CFC or Chrysler
Corporation to the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator
or trustee in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt,
marshalling of assets and liabilities, or similar proceedings of or
relating to such Person or relating to substantially all of its
property, the admission in writing by such Person of its inability to
pay its debts generally as they become due, the filing by such Person
of a petition to take advantage of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization statute, the making by such Person of an
assignment for the benefit of its creditors or the voluntary
suspension by such Person of payment of its obligations; 

then, and in each and every case and so long as a Service Default shall not
have been remedied, the Administrative Agent, the Agent and the Required
Purchasers by notice then given in writing to the Servicer, may terminate
all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Short Term
Retail PSA. On or after the receipt by the Servicer of such written
notice, all authority and power of the Servicer under this Short Term
Retail PSA, whether with respect to the Certificates or the Pooled Property
or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the Administrative Agent
pursuant to this Section 9.1; and thereupon the Administrative Agent shall
be authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other
instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether
to complete the transfer and endorsement of the Receivable Files or the
Insurance Policies, the certificates of title to the Financed Vehicles, or
otherwise. The Servicer shall cooperate with the Administrative Agent or
such successor Servicer in effecting the termination of its
responsibilities and rights as Servicer under this Short Term Retail PSA,
including the transfer to the Administrative Agent or such successor
Servicer for administration of all cash amounts that are at the time held
by the Servicer for deposit, shall have been deposited by the Servicer in
the Certificate Account, or thereafter shall be received with respect to a
Receivable, all Receivable Files and all information or documents that the
Administrative Agent or such successor Servicer may require. In addition,
the Servicer shall transfer or cause to be transferred all electronic
records relating to the Receivables to the successor Servicer in such
electronic form as the successor Servicer may reasonably request, and shall
make available or cause to be made available to the successor Servicer such
personnel having knowledge of such electronic records for such period of
time as the successor Servicer shall reasonably require.

(b) If any of the foregoing Service Defaults occur, neither the
Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall have any obligation to notify
Certificateholders or any other Person of such occurrence prior to the
continuance of such event through the end of any cure period specified in
Section 9.1(a).

SECTION 9.2 Administrative Agent to Act; Appointment of
Successor Servicer. Upon the Servicer's resignation pursuant to Section
8.4 or upon the Servicer's receipt of notice of termination as Servicer
pursuant to Section 9.1, the Administrative Agent shall be the successor in
all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as Servicer under this Short
Term Retail PSA, and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties
and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and
provisions of this Short Term Retail PSA; provided, that, if the
Administrative Agent shall be acting as such successor Servicer, it shall
not be responsible for the payment of any reasonable amounts required to be
paid with respect to the expenses of the Servicer pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 4.8(b) (to the extent that such successor Servicer
would not otherwise be reimbursed for such amounts) which payments, in each
case, shall instead be paid monthly in arrears from Available Amounts
subsequent to distributions under Section 5.6(e) but prior to distributions
under Section 5.6(f). As compensation therefor, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to such compensation (whether payable out of the
Certificate Account or otherwise) as the Servicer would have been entitled
to under this Short Term Retail PSA if no such notice of termination or
resignation had been given. Notwithstanding the above, the Administrative
Agent may, if it shall be unwilling or legally unable so to act, appoint,
or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, an Eligible
Servicer as the successor to the terminated Servicer under this Short Term
Retail PSA. The Administrative Agent and such successor shall take such
action, consistent with this Short Term Retail PSA, as shall be necessary
to effectuate any such succession. No Servicer shall resign or be relieved
of its duties under this Short Term Retail PSA until a newly appointed
Servicer shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the
terminated Servicer under this Short Term Retail PSA. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any successor Servicer shall have any liability
for any failure to perform servicing obligations hereunder due to the
timeliness, accuracy or completeness of information supplied by any
predecessor Servicer.

SECTION 9.3 Effect of Servicing Transfer.

(a) After the transfer of servicing hereunder, the
Administrative Agent or successor Servicer shall notify Obligors to make
directly to the successor Servicer payments that are due under the
Receivables after the effective date of such transfer.

(b) After the transfer of servicing hereunder, the outgoing
Servicer shall have no further obligations with respect to the management,
administration, servicing, custody or collection of the Receivables and the
successor Servicer shall have all of such obligations, except that the
outgoing Servicer shall transmit or cause to be transmitted directly to the
successor Servicer for its own account, promptly on receipt and in the same
form in which received, any amounts held by the outgoing Servicer (properly
endorsed where required for the successor Servicer to collect any such
items) received as payments upon or otherwise in connection with the
Receivables and the outgoing Servicer shall continue to cooperate with the
successor Servicer by providing information and in the enforcement of the
Receivables and the Insurance Policies.

(c) A transfer of servicing hereunder shall not affect the
rights and duties of the parties hereunder (including the obligations and
indemnities of any Seller pursuant to Sections 2.6, 7.1 and 7.2 or, with
respect to obligations and indemnities arising prior to, or concurrently
with, a transfer of servicing hereunder, the outgoing Servicer pursuant to
Sections 4.7, 8.1 or 8.2) other than those relating to the management,
administration, servicing, custody or collection of the Receivables and the
other Pooled Property. The successor Servicer shall, upon its appointment
pursuant to Section 9.2 and as part of its duties and responsibilities
under this Short Term Retail PSA, promptly take all action it deems
necessary or appropriate so that the outgoing Servicer (in whatever
capacity) is paid or reimbursed all amounts it is entitled to receive under
this Short Term Retail PSA on each Distribution Date subsequent to the date
on which it is terminated as Servicer hereunder.

SECTION 9.4 Notification to Certificateholders. Upon any notice
of a Service Default or upon any termination of, or appointment of a
successor to, the Servicer pursuant to this Article IX, the Administrative
Agent shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Agent and to the
Purchasers of record at the preceding Record Date at their respective
addresses of record.

ARTICLE X

Termination

SECTION 10.1 Termination of this Short Term Retail PSA. (a) 
The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Sellers, the
Servicer, the Agent and the Administrative Agent hereunder shall terminate
(except as otherwise expressly provided herein) upon the earliest of: (i)
the Distribution Date immediately succeeding the repurchase by the Sellers
of the Pooled Property pursuant to Section 10.2, (ii) the payment to the
Purchasers of the Senior Amount, interest thereon and any fees required to
be paid to them pursuant to this Short Term Retail PSA or (iii) the
Distribution Date next succeeding the month which is six months after the
maturity or the liquidation of the last Receivable held as part of the
Pooled Property and the disposition of any amounts received upon
liquidation of any property remaining as part of the Pooled Property. The
Servicer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Agent of
any prospective termination pursuant to this Section 10.1 prior to the
Scheduled Maturity Date and the Administrative Agent, promptly upon its
receipt of such notice, shall notify each Purchaser.

(b) Notice of any termination, specifying the Distribution Date
upon which the Purchasers may surrender the Senior Certificates to the
Administrative Agent for payment of the final distribution and
cancellation, shall be given promptly by letter from the Administrative
Agent to the Agent, the Purchasers and the Sellers mailed not earlier than
the 15th day and not later than the 25th day of the month immediately
preceding the specified Distribution Date, stating the aggregate amount of
any such final payment, that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such
Distribution Date is not applicable, that instead payments will be made
only upon presentation and surrender of the Senior Certificates at the
office of the Administrative Agent therein specified. Upon presentation
and surrender of the Senior Certificates, the Administrative Agent shall
cause to be distributed to Purchasers amounts distributable on such
Distribution Date pursuant to Sections 5.6 and 5.7 and, after payment of
Certificate Principal and Certificate Interest on the Senior Certificates,
any Increased Costs claimed by any Purchaser.

(c) In the event that all of the Purchasers shall not surrender
their Senior Certificates for cancellation within six months after the date
specified in the written notice delivered in accordance with Section
10.1(b), the Administrative Agent shall give a second written notice to the
remaining Purchasers to surrender their Senior Certificates for
cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If
within one year after the second notice all the Senior Certificates shall
not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Servicer may take
appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to
contact the remaining Purchasers concerning surrender of their
Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds and other
assets that shall remain subject to this Short Term Retail PSA. Any funds
remaining as part of the Pooled Property (whether in the Trust Accounts or
otherwise) after exhaustion of such remedies shall be distributed by the
Administrative Agent to the Active Seller.

SECTION 10.2 Repurchases of Pooled Property. If on any
Distribution Date the outstanding Senior Amount on such date is equal to or
less than 10% of the largest Senior Amount ever previously outstanding
under this Short Term Retail PSA (after giving effect to distributions to
the Purchasers on such Distribution Date), the Sellers may, at their
option, repurchase the Pooled Property by giving the Administrative Agent
irrevocable notice no later than the first Business Day of the following
calendar month. The Sellers shall pay the aggregate Repurchase Amount for
the Receivables on the Determination Date following the date of its notice. 
The payment shall be made in the manner specified in Section 5.5 and shall
be distributed pursuant to Section 5.6. On such Distribution Date after
giving effect to the distribution to the Purchasers required by Section
5.6, the Sellers shall again succeed to and own all interests in and to the
Pooled Property. 

SECTION 10.3 Sale of Pooled Property. (a) Mandatory Sale. The
Administrative Agent or the Agent with the consent of the Required
Purchasers may, or the Administrative Agent or the Agent at the direction
of the Required Purchasers shall, sell the Pooled Property to pay the
Purchasers any outstanding Senior Amount and any other amounts payable to
the Purchasers under this Short Term Retail PSA and the Senior Certificates
if (a) an event of the type described in Section 9.1(a)(vi) or (a)(vii)
occurs with respect to any Seller, (b) any Senior Amount is outstanding on
the Scheduled Maturity Date (after giving effect to distributions on such
date) or (c) at any date, the Senior Amount as of such date is not less
than the Pool Balance as of such date.

(b) Optional Sale. The Agent may at any time offer to sell the
Purchasers' interest in all or any portion of the Receivables for cash (i)
if the Senior Amount (plus accrued interest, fees and Increased Costs to
the date of such sale), after giving effect to such sale, will be reduced
to zero and (ii) if after giving effect thereto, no Service Default or
Retail Portfolio Termination Event shall be continuing. Proceeds of such
sale shall be treated as collections in respect of the repurchased
Receivables and applied in accordance with Section 5.6. Following the
receipt of a bona fide offer to purchase the Purchasers' interest in all or
any portion of the Receivables from any Person other than the Active
Seller, the Active Seller shall have a right of first refusal to purchase
such interest for an amount equal to the amount stated in such Person's
offer to purchase. The Sellers will be under no obligation to make such
purchase hereunder.

(c) Terms of Mandatory Sale. Any such sale or sales shall be
for cash or upon such other terms as the Agent or the Administrative Agent
shall, in its sole discretion, deem acceptable. Any of the Sellers, the
Servicer or CFC may purchase any of the Pooled Property for cash in any
such sale; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Agent
shall be under any obligation to, and none of the Sellers, the Servicer or
CFC shall be deemed to have any right to require that the Administrative
Agent or the Agent, offer the Pooled Property to the Sellers, the Servicer
or CFC before soliciting any other offers or engaging in negotiations with
respect to the Pooled Property. The proceeds of any such sale shall be
first, applied against the costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) of the Administrative Agent or the Agent in
consummating such sale, second, applied against distributions required to
be made by paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (e) of Section 5.6, third, applied
against any Increased Costs for which a demand has been made, fourth,
applied against any distribution required to be made by paragraph (i) of
Section 5.6 and fifth, to the extent of any proceeds remaining, turned over
to the Sellers.

ARTICLE XI

SECTION 11.1 Protection of Rights in Pooled Property. (a) The
Servicer shall execute and file such financing statements and cause to be
executed and filed such continuation statements, all in such manner and in
such places as may be required by law fully to preserve, maintain and
protect the interest of the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers under
this Short Term Retail PSA in the Pooled Property. The Servicer shall
deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Administrative Agent file-stamped
copies of, or filing receipts for, any document filed as provided in the
foregoing sentence as soon as available following such filing. In the
event that the Servicer fails to perform its obligations under this
Section, the Administrative Agent or the Agent may do so at the expense of
the Servicer.

(b) Neither the Servicer nor any Seller shall change its name,
identity, or corporate structure in any manner that would, could, or might
make any financing statement or continuation statement filed pursuant to
Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 11.1(a) seriously misleading within the meaning of
sect. 9-402(7) of the UCC as in effect from time to time in the State of
Michigan, unless it shall have given each of the Administrative Agent and
the Agent written notice thereof no later than 15 days after such change.

(c) Each Seller and the Servicer shall give the Administrative
Agent and the Agent at least 60 days' prior written notice of any
relocation of its principal executive office if, as a result of such
relocation, the applicable provisions of the UCC would require the filing
of any amendment of any previously filed financing or continuation
statement or of any new financing statement. Each Seller and the Servicer
shall at all times maintain each office from which it shall service
Contracts, and its principal executive office, within the United States of
America.

(d) The Servicer shall maintain or cause to be maintained
accounts and records as to each Receivable accurately and in sufficient
detail to permit (i) the reader thereof to know at any time the status of
such Receivable, including payments and Liquidation Proceeds made and
payments owing (and the nature of each), and (ii) reconciliation between
payments or Liquidation Proceeds on (or with respect to) each Receivable
and the amounts from time to time deposited in the Certificate Account in
respect of such Receivable.

(e) The Servicer shall maintain or cause to be maintained
computer systems so that, from and after the time of sale under this Short
Term Retail PSA of the Receivables to the Certificateholders, the
Servicer's computer records (including archives) that shall refer to a
Receivable indicate clearly that such Receivable is owned by the
Certificateholders. Indication of the Certificateholders' undivided
participating ownership of a Receivable shall be deleted from or modified
on any such computer systems when, and only when, the Receivable shall
become a Repurchased Receivable.

(f) If at any time any Seller or the Servicer shall propose to
sell, grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer any interest in
motor vehicle receivables to any prospective purchaser, lender or other
transferee, such Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, shall give to
such prospective purchaser, lender, or other transferee computer tapes,
records, or print-outs (including any restored from archives) that, if they
shall refer in any manner whatsoever to any Receivable, shall indicate
clearly that such Receivable has been sold and is owned by the
Certificateholders.

(g) Upon request, the Servicer, at its expense, shall furnish to
the Administrative Agent, within ten Business Days, a list of all
Receivables then held as part of the Pooled Property, together with a
reconciliation of such list to the schedules of such Receivables previously
delivered and to each of the Servicer's Certificates furnished pursuant to
Section 4.9 indicating removal of Receivables from the Pooled Property.

SECTION 11.2 Limitation on Rights of Certificateholders. 
Nothing set forth in this Short Term Retail PSA, or contained in the terms
of the Certificates, shall be construed so as to constitute the Holders as
partners or members of an association. No Purchaser shall have any right
by virtue or by availing itself of any provisions of this Short Term Retail
PSA to institute any suit, action, or proceeding in equity or at law upon
or under or with respect to this Short Term Retail PSA, unless such
Purchaser previously shall have given to the Administrative Agent and the
Agent a written notice of default and of the continuance thereof and unless
the Required Purchasers shall have made written request upon the
Administrative Agent to institute such action, suit, or proceeding in its
own name as Administrative Agent under the Short Term Retail PSA and shall
have offered to the Administrative Agent such reasonable indemnity as it
may require against the costs, expenses, and liabilities to be incurred
therein or thereby, and the Administrative Agent shall have refused to
institute any such action, suit or proceeding; provided that, if the
Administrative Agent has not responded to such request within 60 days after
its receipt of such notice, request and offer, the Administrative Agent
shall be deemed to have refused to institute any such action. No one or
more Purchasers shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or
by availing itself or themselves of any provisions of this Short Term
Retail PSA to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other
Purchasers, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to
any other such Purchaser or to enforce any right, under this Short Term
Retail PSA, except in the manner provided in this Short Term Retail PSA and
for the equal, ratable, and common benefit of all Purchasers. For the
protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section 11.2, each
Purchaser and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to such relief as
can be given either at law or in equity.

SECTION 11.3 Increased Costs. The Active Seller agrees that it
shall pay all amounts (such amounts, "Increased Costs") which arise in the
event that any of the following costs or events occur:

(a) Reemployment Costs. The Sellers agree to indemnify each
Purchaser and to hold each Purchaser harmless from any loss or expense,
including, but not limited to, any such loss or expense arising from
interest or fees payable by such Purchaser to lenders of funds obtained by
it to purchase or maintain that portion of its Purchases hereunder with
respect to which Certificate Interest is determined by reference to the
LIBO Rate as a consequence of (i) default by such Seller in the performance
of its obligations hereunder, (ii) the occurrence of a Service Default or
an event which would, with the giving of notice or the passage of time,
constitute a Service Default, (iii) the occurrence of an event referred to
in Section 11.3(b) or 11.3(c), (iv) default by such Seller in selling a
Receivables Group on any Transfer Date after having given notice of such
sale, or (v) any reduction of the Senior Amount prior to the termination of
an Accrual Period for which Certificate Interest is scheduled to be paid to
the Purchasers. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by any Purchaser to such
Seller shall be conclusive absent manifest error. This covenant shall
survive termination of this Short Term Retail PSA. 

(b) Inability to Determine LIBO Rate. In the event that (a) the
Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Sellers) that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits
referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" are not being provided in the
relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for the purposes of
determining rates of interest for the Purchases hereunder as provided
herein, or (b) the Required Purchasers determine (which determination shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Sellers) and shall notify the Agent that
the rates of interest referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" as the
basis upon which the rate of interest for Purchases hereunder is to be
determined do not adequately cover the cost to the Purchasers of making or
maintaining such Purchases, the Agent shall forthwith give telex notice of
such determination, confirmed in writing, to the Active Seller and the
Purchasers, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Active Seller and the
Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no
longer exist, the Certificate Rate shall thereafter be calculated by
reference to the Base Rate.

(c) Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if
any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any
Purchaser to make or maintain its interest in its Senior Certificate
because Certificate Interest on such Senior Certificate is based on the
LIBO Rate and such Purchaser shall notify the Agent, the Administrative
Agent and the Active Seller, then the portion of the Senior Amount
applicable to such Purchaser shall thereafter bear interest at a rate
determined by reference to the Base Rate. If any such change in the method
of calculating interest occurs on a day which is not the last day of the
Accrual Period, the Active Seller shall pay to the Agent for the account of
such Purchaser the amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to
subsection 11.3(a).

(d) Additional Costs. In the event that any law, regulation,
treaty or directive or any change therein or in the interpretation or
application thereof or compliance by any Purchaser with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority enacted or made subsequent to the date hereof:

(i) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, any office of such Purchaser; or

(ii) does or shall impose on such Purchaser any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Purchaser of purchasing or maintaining its portion of the Senior Amount
hereunder (such increase in cost, "Additional Costs") then, in any such
case, the Active Seller shall promptly pay to the Agent for the account of
such Purchaser, upon the written demand of such Purchaser to such Active
Seller (with a copy to the Agent), so long as such Additional Costs are not
otherwise included in the amounts required to be paid to such Purchaser
pursuant to any other paragraph under this Section 11.3, any additional
amounts necessary to compensate such Purchaser for such Additional Costs
which such Purchaser deems to be material as determined by such Purchaser. 
If a Purchaser becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to
this subsection 11.3(d), it shall promptly notify the Active Seller,
through the Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so
entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to
the foregoing sentence submitted by a Purchaser, through the Agent, to the
Active Seller shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(e) Transfer of Commitments. Upon the occurrence of any of the
events specified in subsections 11.3(c) or 11.3(d), each Purchaser whose
Short Term Commitments are affected by any such event agrees that it will
transfer such Short Term Commitments affected by any such event to another
branch office (or, if such Purchaser so elects, to an Affiliate) of such
Purchaser, provided that such transfer shall be made only if such Purchaser
shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall, absent
manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) that,
(a) on the basis of existing circumstances, such transfer will avoid such
events and will not result in any additional costs, liabilities or expenses
to such Purchaser or to the Active Seller and (b) such transfer is
otherwise consistent with the interests of such Purchaser.

(f) Changes in Capital Requirements. (i) In the event that, in
the opinion of counsel for any Purchaser (which may, in the discretion of
such Purchaser, be such Purchaser's internal counsel), compliance with any
law, rule, regulation or guideline, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Purchaser with
any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
central bank or Governmental Authority enacted or made subsequent to the
date hereof shall affect the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by such Purchaser or any corporation controlling such Purchaser
and the amount of such capital that is required or expected to be
maintained is increased by or based upon the Short Term Commitment of such
Purchaser under this Short Term Retail PSA or any participation agreement
entered into pursuant to subsection 9.6 of the Short Term RPA, as
applicable (such event, a "Change in Law"), such affected Purchaser shall
notify the Active Seller and the Agent within 90 days after such affected
Purchaser shall first be required to comply with such Change in Law. At
the time of such notification such affected Purchaser shall provide the
Active Seller with a written statement setting forth the amount that would
adequately compensate such affected Purchaser for the costs associated with
its compliance with such Change in Law and setting forth in reasonable
detail the assumptions upon which such affected Purchaser calculated such
amount, and a copy of the opinion of counsel referred to in the preceding
sentence. Such affected Purchaser shall allocate to the Active Seller the
costs associated with such Change in Law in such a way that the proportion
of (i) such costs that are allocated to the Active Seller to (ii) the total
of such costs of such affected Purchaser associated with such Change in Law
as it relates to all commitments of such Purchaser to its customers of
similar creditworthiness as the Active Seller, is substantially the same as
the proportion of (i) the Short Term Commitment of such affected Purchaser
under this Short Term Retail PSA or such participation agreement to (ii)
the total of all commitments by such affected Purchaser to its customers of
similar creditworthiness as the Active Seller.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of any Change in Law, each Purchaser
whose Short Term Commitment hereunder is affected by such Change in Law
shall transfer its Short Term Commitment to another branch office (or, if
such Purchaser so elects, to an Affiliate) of such Purchaser, provided that
such transfer shall be made only if such Purchaser shall have determined in
good faith (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties) that, (i) on the basis of existing
circumstances, such transfer will avoid or reduce the additional payments
resulting from such Change in Law and will not result in any additional
costs, liabilities or expenses to such Purchaser (unless the Active Seller
agrees to pay such additional costs, liabilities or expenses of such
Purchaser) and (ii) such transfer is otherwise consistent with the
interests of such Purchaser.

(g) Taxes. (i) In the event that the adoption of any law,
regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, in each case after the date hereof,
shall require any Taxes (as hereinafter defined) to be withheld or deducted
from any amount payable to the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any
Purchaser under this Short Term Retail PSA, upon notice by such Person to
the Active Seller (with a copy to the Agent) to the effect that (A) as a
result of the adoption of such law, rule, regulation, treaty or directive
or a change therein or in the interpretation thereof, Taxes are being
withheld or deducted from amounts payable to such Person under this Short
Term Retail PSA and (B) such Purchaser has taken all action required to be
taken by it to avoid the imposition of such Taxes pursuant to clause (iii)
below prior to demanding indemnification under this clause (i), the Active
Seller will pay to the Agent for the account of such Person additional
amounts so that such additional amounts, together with amounts otherwise
payable under this Short Term Retail PSA, will yield to such Person, after
deduction from such increased amount of all Taxes required to be withheld
or deducted therefrom, the amount stated to be payable under this Short
Term Retail PSA. The term "Taxes" shall mean all net income, stamp or
other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
country (or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein), excluding, with respect to any Purchaser, net income and
franchise taxes imposed with respect to net income of any country (or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) where such
Person is organized or where such Person's credit commitments are booked. 
If the Active Seller fails to pay any Taxes when due following notification
by the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser as provided above,
the Active Seller shall indemnify such Person for any incremental taxes,
interest or penalties that may become payable by any such Person as a
result of any such failure by the Active Seller to make such payment.

(ii) Each Purchaser that is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver
to the Active Seller and the Agent (A) two duly completed copies of United
States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 or successor applicable
form, as the case may be, and (B) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or
W-9 or successor form. Each such Purchaser also agrees to deliver to the
Active Seller and the Agent two further copies of the said Form 1001 or
4224 and Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable forms or other manner of
certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring
a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Active
Seller, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be
requested by the Active Seller or the Agent, unless in any such case an
event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or
regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which
would prevent such Purchaser from duly completing and delivering any such
form with respect to it and such Purchaser so advises the Active Seller and
the Agent. Such Purchaser shall certify (X) in the case of Form 1001 or
4224, that it is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes and (Y)
in the case of a Form W-8 or W-9, that it is entitled to an exemption from
United States backup withholding tax.

(iii) No Purchaser may request indemnification for any Taxes from
the Active Seller under clause (i) above to the extent that such Taxes
would have been avoided or reduced by such Purchaser's transfer of its
Short Term Commitments affected by such event to another office of such
Purchaser (or to an Affiliate of such Purchaser), by such Purchaser's
properly claiming the benefit of any exemption from or reduction of such
Taxes (whether provided by statute, treaty or otherwise), including,
without limitation, by delivering the forms required by clause (ii) above,
or by such Purchaser's taking any other action which in its judgment is
reasonable to avoid or reduce such Taxes, provided that such Purchaser
shall not be required to (A) take any action which in the reasonable
judgment of such Purchaser could directly or indirectly result in any
increased cost or expense or in any loss of opportunity to such Purchaser
unless the Active Seller shall have provided to such Purchaser indemnity or
reimbursement therefor in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
such Purchaser or (B) claim or apply any tax credit against such Taxes.

(iv) Within 30 days after the payment by the Active Seller of any
income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions or withholdings, withheld or deducted from any amount payable to
the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser under this Short Term
Retail PSA and irrespective of whether such Person is entitled to demand
indemnification in respect thereof under clause (i) above, the Active
Seller will furnish to such Person (with a copy to the Agent), the original
or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

SECTION 11.4 Payment of Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The Servicer
agrees to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Agent for all
their reasonable and customary out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and any
amendment, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of, this Short Term
Retail PSA and any other document executed and delivered in connection
herewith, including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of
counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Agent.

(b) The Servicer agrees to pay, indemnify, and hold each
Purchaser, the Agent and the Administrative Agent harmless from and against
any and all actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of
any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery,
performance, administration or enforcement of this Short Term Retail PSA
(the "indemnified liabilities"), except with respect to indemnified
liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Person. The agreements in this subsection shall survive repayment of the
Senior Amount and all other amounts payable hereunder.

CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THE
OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS, AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS SHORT TERM
RETAIL PSA SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAW.

the covenants, provisions or terms of this Short Term Retail PSA shall be
for any reason whatsoever held invalid, then such covenants, provisions or
terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, provisions or
terms of this Short Term Retail PSA, and shall in no way affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Short Term
Retail PSA or of the Certificates or the rights of the Holders thereof.

SECTION 11.8 Intention of Parties. (a) The execution and
delivery of this Short Term Retail PSA shall constitute an acknowledgement
by the Sellers, the Agent, the Administrative Agent and each
Certificateholder that they do not intend to establish (for Federal tax
purposes) an association taxable as a corporation. The powers granted and
obligations undertaken in this Short Term Retail PSA shall be construed so
as to further such intent.

(b) It is the intent of the Sellers and the Purchasers that, for
federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes, the Senior
Certificates will be evidence of indebtedness of the Sellers secured by the
Pooled Property. Each Seller, by entering into this Short Term Retail PSA,
and each Purchaser by the acceptance of its Senior Certificate, agrees to
treat the Senior Certificates for federal, state and local income and
franchise tax purposes as indebtedness of the Sellers, except as otherwise
required by law or any tax authorities.

delivery of this Short Term Retail PSA and the Certificates.

error. Any change in monthly interest payable hereunder resulting from a
change in the Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of
business on the day on which such change is announced.

Determination Date); and

(ii) on each Deposit Date with respect to the Revolving Period,
an amount equal to the Available Seller's Principal Collections for

SECTION 5.2. Determination of Monthly Interest. (a)(i) The
amount of monthly interest ("Monthly Interest") with respect to the Short
Term Bank Series Certificates on any Distribution Date shall be an amount
equal to the sum of (A) with respect to that portion of the Aggregate Bank
Invested Amount allocated to the LIBO Tranche, an amount equal to the
product of (I) the number of days in the preceding Accrual Period divided

to that portion of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount not allocated to the
LIBO Tranche, an amount ("Monthly Base Rate Interest") equal to the sum of
each Daily Base Rate Interest Expense determined by the Administrative
Agent for each day of the Accrual Period with respect to such Distribution
Date, provided, however, if any Increase shall be made during the period
from and including the first calendar day of any month to but excluding the
Distribution Date occurring during such month, the amount of Daily Base
Rate Interest Expense calculated with respect to such Increase during such
period shall not be included in the Monthly Interest determined for the
Accrual Period with respect to such Distribution Date, but instead shall be
included in the Monthly Interest determined for the Accrual Period with
respect to the next succeeding Distribution Date.

(ii) In the event the Base Rate changes during the period between
any Determination Date and the following Distribution Date and a portion of
the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount is not allocated to the LIBO Tranche,
the Servicer and the Administrative Agent shall cooperate on the date of
such change in modifying the Distribution Date Statement to reflect the
adjustment in the Monthly Interest for the then current Accrual Period
caused by such change and any consequent adjustments, including adjustment
to the Deficiency Amount, if any. Any such modification, including any
adjustment to the Deficiency Amount shall be completed by 10:00 a.m. on
such Distribution Date.

(b) On the Determination Date preceding each Distribution Date,
the Servicer shall determine the amount, if any (the "Interest Shortfall"),
by which (i) the Monthly Interest for the Accrual Period with respect to
such Distribution Date is greater than (ii) the amount which will be
available to be distributed to the Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholders on such Distribution Date in respect thereof pursuant to
this Short Term Supplement. If the Interest Shortfall with respect to any
Distribution Date is greater than zero, an additional amount ("Additional
Interest") equal to the product of (A) the number of days in the related
Accrual Period divided by 365 (or 366, as determined in accordance with
subsection 3.4), (B) the Default Rate and (C) such Interest Shortfall (or
the portion thereof which has not been paid to the Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholders) shall be payable as provided herein with respect to the
Short Term Bank Series Certificates on each Distribution Date following
such Distribution Date to and including, the Distribution Date on which
such Interest Shortfall is paid to Short Term Bank Series Certificate-
holders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Additional
Interest shall be payable or distributed to the Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholders only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

(c) On each Distribution Date the Seller may, subject to
subsection 5.2(d), elect to allocate or continue to allocate all or any
part of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount to the LIBO Tranche by giving
the Administrative Agent irrevocable written or telephonic (confirmed in
writing) notice thereof, which notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City time) three
Business Days prior to such Distribution Date. Such notice shall specify
(i) the applicable Distribution Date, (ii) the date of the succeeding
Distribution Date and (iii) the portion of the Aggregate Bank Invested
Amount being allocated to the LIBO Tranche. Promptly upon receipt of each
such notice the Administrative Agent shall notify each Short Term Bank
Series Certificateholder of the contents thereof. If the Administrative
Agent shall not have received timely notice as aforesaid with respect to
all or any portion of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount, the Monthly
Interest on the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount for the succeeding Accrual
Period shall be calculated by reference to the Base Rate.

(d) Anything contained in this Section 5.2 to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) the portion of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount
allocable to the LIBO Tranche must be an amount equal to $50,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) after the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Early Amortization Event, the
Seller may not elect to allocate all or any portion of the Aggregate Bank
Invested Amount to the LIBO Tranche.

SECTION 5.3. Determination of Monthly Principal. The amount of
monthly principal ("Monthly Principal") distributable with respect to the

to an Early Amortization Period shall be equal to the sum of (i) the
Available Bank Principal Collections with respect to such Distribution Date
and (ii) the Available Seller's Principal Collections allocated pursuant to
subsection 5.7(d)(ii); provided, however, that Monthly Principal shall not
exceed the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount.

SECTION 5.4. Establishment of Reserve Account. The Servicer,
for the benefit of the Short Term Bank Series Certificateholders, shall
cause to be established and maintained in the name of the Trust an Eligible
Deposit Account (the "Reserve Account") bearing a designation clearly
indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholders. On the Effective Date, the
Seller shall cause to be deposited in the Reserve Account the Initial
Reserve Account Deposit Amount. The Trustee shall possess all right, title
and interest in all funds from time to time on deposit in, and all Eligible
Investments credited to, the Reserve Account and in all proceeds thereof. 
The Reserve Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of the
Trustee for the benefit of the Short Term Bank Series Certificateholders. 
If, at any time, the Reserve Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit
Account, the Servicer shall establish a substitute Eligible Deposit Account
as the Reserve Account, transfer any cash and/or any Eligible Investments
to such new Reserve Account and from the date any such substitute account
is established, such account shall be the "Reserve Account". Neither the
Seller nor the Servicer, nor any person or entity claiming by, through or
under the Seller or Servicer, shall have any right, title or interest in,
or any right to withdraw any amount from, the Reserve Account, except as
expressly provided herein. Pursuant to the authority granted to the
Servicer in Section 3.01 of the Wholesale PSA, the Servicer shall have the
power, revocable by the Trustee, to instruct the Trustee to make
withdrawals and payments from the Reserve Account for the purposes of
carrying out the Servicer's or the Trustee's duties specified in the
Wholesale PSA and this Short Term Supplement.

All Eligible Investments in the Reserve Account shall be held by
the Trustee for the benefit of the Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholders. Funds on deposit in the Reserve Account shall at the
direction of the Servicer be invested by the Trustee solely in Eligible
Investments that will mature so that such funds will be available at the
close of business on or before the Business Day next preceding the
following Distribution Date (or on or before 10:00 a.m. on such following
Distribution Date in the case of Eligible Investments in respect of which
the Trustee is the obligor). As of each Determination Date, all interest
and other investment earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) on
funds on deposit in the Reserve Account received with respect to such
Determination Date shall be credited to the Collection Account for the
benefit of the Short Term Bank Series (together with earnings on the
Pre-Accrual Period Deposit and an amount equal to the Short Term Bank
Series Allocation Percentage of the interest and other investment earnings
on funds held in the Collection Account credited to the Collection Account
pursuant to Section 4.02 of the Wholesale PSA with respect to such
Determination Date, "Investment Proceeds"). Schedule 1, which is hereby
incorporated into and made part of this Short Term Supplement, identifies
the Reserve Account by setting forth the account number of such account,
the account designation of such account and the name of the institution
with which such account has been established. If a substitute Reserve
Account is established pursuant to this Section, the Servicer shall provide
to the Trustee an amended Schedule 1, setting forth the relevant
information for such substitute Reserve Account.

SECTION 5.5. Deficiency Amount. With respect to each
Distribution Date, on the related Determination Date, the Servicer shall
determine the amount (the "Deficiency Amount"), if any, by which (a) the

for such Distribution Date, (vi) the amount of Investor Charge-Offs which
have not previously been reimbursed, (vii) the Short Term Bank Series

be deposited in the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.09(a) of the
Wholesale PSA with respect to the related Collection Period that has not
been so deposited as of such Determination Date and (viii) any Section 8
Costs, exceeds (b) the sum of (i) Bank Non-Principal Collections and
Available Seller Non-Principal Collections deposited in the Collection
Account during the Collection Period preceding such Distribution Date plus
any Investment Proceeds plus any Pre-Accrual Period Deposit made during the
Accrual Period preceding the Accrual Period with respect to such
Distribution Date plus (ii) the amount of funds in the Reserve Account
which are available pursuant to Section 5.7(a) to cover any portion of the
Deficiency Amount. The lesser of the Deficiency Amount and the Available
Subordinated Amount on the related Determination Date shall be the
"Required Subordination Draw Amount".

SECTION 5.6. Application of Bank Non-Principal Collections,
Available Seller Non-Principal Collections, and Available Bank Principal
Collections. The Servicer shall cause the Trustee to apply, on each
Distribution Date, Bank Non-Principal Collections, Available Seller
Non-Principal Collections, Investment Proceeds and Available Bank Principal

previously due but not distributed to the Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholders on a prior Distribution Date, plus the amount
of any Additional Interest for such Distribution Date and any
Additional Interest previously due but not distributed to the
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholders on a prior Distribution

Distribution Date shall be treated as a portion of Bank Principal
Collections for such Distribution Date;

(iv) an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Investor
Charge-Offs which have not previously been reimbursed shall be
treated as a portion of Bank Principal Collections for such
Distribution Date;

(v) an amount equal to the sum of (A) Section 8 Costs for
such Distribution Date and (B) any Section 8 Costs not paid on
any preceding Distribution Date shall be paid to the Agent for
the account of the applicable Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholders; and

(vi) the balance, if any, shall constitute Excess Servicing
and shall be allocated and distributed as set forth in Section
5.9.

(b) (i) On each Distribution Date during the Revolving Period
with respect to which the Seller has notified the Administrative Agent
a Decrease will occur, an amount of Available Bank Principal
Collections deposited in the Collection Account for the related
Collection Period equal to such Decrease will be distributed to the
Administrative Agent to be distributed by the Administrative Agent for
the ratable benefit of the Short Term Bank Series Certificateholders. 
The Aggregate Bank Invested Amount shall be reduced by the amount of
Available Bank Principal Collections so distributed. Any such
remaining Available Bank Principal Collections shall be treated as
Excess Principal Collections and applied in accordance with Section
4.04 of the Wholesale PSA.

(ii) On each Distribution Date during the Revolving Period
with respect to which the Servicer has not notified the Administrative
Agent it will be making a Decrease an amount equal to any remaining
Available Bank Principal Collections shall be treated as Excess
Principal Collections and applied in accordance with Section 4.04 of
the Wholesale PSA.

(c) On each Distribution Date with respect to an Early
Amortization Period, an amount equal to the sum of (i) Available Bank
Principal Collections and (ii) Available Seller's Principal
Collections allocated pursuant to subsection 5.7(d)(ii) will be
distributed in the following priority: (i) an amount equal to Monthly
Principal for such Distribution Date shall be distributed to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Short Term Bank
Series Certificateholders and (ii) after giving effect to the
distribution referred to in clause (i), an amount equal to the
balance, if any, of such Available Bank Principal Collections shall be
treated as Excess Principal Collections and applied in accordance with
Section 4.04 of the Wholesale PSA.

SECTION 5.7. Application of Reserve Account and Available
Subordinated Amount. (a) If the portion of Bank Non-Principal
Collections, Available Seller's Non-Principal Collections, any Pre-Accrual
Period Deposit and Investment Proceeds allocated to the Short Term Bank
Series Certificateholders on any Distribution Date pursuant to Section
5.6(a) is not sufficient to make the entire distributions required on such
Distribution Date by Section 5.6(a)(i) through (v), the Servicer shall
cause the Trustee to withdraw funds from the Reserve Account to the extent
available therein, and apply such funds to complete the distributions
pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(i) through (v).

(b) If there is a Required Subordination Draw Amount for such
Distribution Date, the Servicer shall apply or cause the Trustee to apply
the Available Seller's Principal Collections on deposit in the Collection
Account on such Distribution Date, but only up to the amount of the
Required Subordination Draw Amount, to make the distributions required by
Section 5.6(a)(i) through (v) that have not been made through the
application of funds from the Reserve Account in accordance with the
preceding paragraph. Any such Available Seller's Principal Collections
remaining after the application thereof pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall be treated as a portion of Bank Principal Collections for such
Distribution Date, but only up to the amount of unpaid Adjustment Payments
allocated to the Short Term Bank Series as described in Section
5.5(a)(vii). The amount of the Available Seller's Principal Collections
applied in accordance with the two preceding sentences shall reduce the
Available Subordinated Amount as described in clause (c) of the definition
thereof. If the Required Subordination Draw Amount exceeds Available
Seller's Principal Collections for such Distribution Date, the Available
Subordinated Amount shall be further reduced by the amount of such excess,
but not by more than the sum of (x) the Investor Default Amount and (y) the
amount of unpaid Adjustment Payments allocated to the Short Term Bank
Series as described in Section 5.5(a)(vii).

(c) If, after giving effect to the allocations of, distributions
from, and deposits in, the Reserve Account made pursuant to Section 13.2,
Sections 5.1(c), 5.4, and Section 5.7(a) and (d), (i) during the Revolving
Period, the amount in the Reserve Account is greater than the Reserve
Account Required Amount for the related Distribution Date, the Servicer
shall cause the Trustee to distribute such excess amount to the Seller;
provided that the Seller's Participation Amount (determined after giving
effect to any Principal Receivables transferred to the Trust on such
Distribution Date) exceeds the Trust Available Subordinated Amount for the
immediately preceding Determination Date or (ii) the amount in the Reserve
Account is less than such Reserve Account Required Amount, then the Trustee
shall deposit any remaining Available Seller's Principal Collections on
deposit in the Collection Account for such Distribution Date into the
Reserve Account until either (x) the amount in the Reserve Account is equal
to such Reserve Account Required Amount (and the Available Subordinated
Amount shall be reduced by the amount of Available Seller's Principal
Collections so applied) or (y) the Available Subordinated Amount shall have
been reduced to the Required Available Subordinated Amount. On the
Termination Date, any funds in the Reserve Account will be treated as
Available Bank Principal Collections. After the earlier of the payment in
full of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount and the Termination Date, any
funds remaining on deposit in the Reserve Account shall be paid to the
Seller.

(d) The balance of Available Seller's Principal Collections on
any Distribution Date, after giving effect to any distributions thereof
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 5.7 shall (i) during the

Receivables transferred to the Trust on such Distribution Date) exceeds the

Determination Date and (ii) during an Early Amortization Period, be treated
as a portion of Bank Principal Collections and distributed pursuant to
Section 5.6(c).

SECTION 5.8. Investor Charge-offs. If, on any Distribution Date
on which the Available Subordinated Amount on the preceding Determination
Date (after giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals
and deposits to be made on such Distribution Date) is zero and the
Deficiency Amount for such Distribution Date is greater than zero, the
Aggregate Bank Invested Amount shall be reduced by the amount of the excess
of such Deficiency Amount over any remaining Available Subordinated Amount
on such Determination Date, but not by more than the Investor Default

Trustee to apply, on each Distribution Date, Excess Servicing with respect
to such Distribution Date, to make the following distributions in the

ARTICLE VIII

Change In Circumstances

SECTION 8.1. Reemployment Costs. The Seller agrees to indemnify
each Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder and to hold each Short Term
Bank Series Certificateholder harmless from any loss or expense, including
any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by such
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder to lenders of funds obtained by it
to purchase or maintain that portion of its Bank Invested Amount hereunder
with respect to which Monthly Interest is determined by reference to the
LIBO Rate as a consequence of (a) default by the Seller in the performance
of its obligations hereunder or under the Wholesale PSA, (b) the occurrence
of a Service Default or an event which would, with the giving of notice or
the passage of time, constitute a Service Default, (c) the occurrence of an
event referred to in Section 8.2 or 8.3, (d) default by the Seller in
selling an Increase in the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount on an Increase
Date after having given notice of such Increase, or (e) any reduction of
the LIBO Tranche prior to the termination of the Accrual Period for such
LIBO Tranche. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant
to the foregoing sentence submitted by any Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder to the Seller shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
This covenant shall survive termination of this Short Term Supplement and
the Wholesale PSA. 

SECTION 8.2. Inability to Determine LIBO Rate. In the event
that (a) the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Short Term Bank Series Certificateholders) that quotations
of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition
of "LIBO Rate" are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the
relevant maturities for the purposes of determining rates of interest for
the LIBO Tranche hereunder as provided herein, or (b) the Required Short
Term Bank Series Certificateholders determine (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Short Term Bank Series Certificateholders)
and shall notify the Agent that the rates of interest referred to in the
definition of "LIBO Rate" as the basis upon which the rate of interest for
the LIBO Tranche hereunder is to be determined do not adequately cover the
cost to the Short Term Bank Series Certificateholders of making or
maintaining their investments in Short Term Bank Series Certificates at
such time as any of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount is allocated to the
LIBO Tranche, the Agent shall forthwith give telex or telecopy notice of
such determination, confirmed in writing, to the Seller and the Trustee,
whereupon until the Agent notifies the Seller and the Trustee that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, none of the
Aggregate Bank Invested Amount shall be allocated to the LIBO Tranche.

SECTION 8.3. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision
herein, if any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein
or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for
any Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder to purchase or maintain its
interest in its Short Term Bank Series Certificate in any LIBO Tranche and
such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder shall notify the
Administrative Agent, the Agent, the Trustee and the Seller, then interest
payable in respect of the portion of each LIBO Tranche applicable to such
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder shall thereafter be calculated by
reference to the Base Rate. If any such change in the method of
calculating interest occurs on a day which is not the last day of the
Accrual Period with respect to any LIBO Tranche, the Seller shall pay to
the Agent for the account of such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder
the amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 8.1.

SECTION 8.4. Increased Costs. (a) In the event that any law,
regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Short Term Bank
Series Certificateholder with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority enacted or made subsequent to the date hereof:

(A) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, any office of such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder; or

(B) does or shall impose on such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder of purchasing or maintaining its
portion of the Short Term Bank Series Certificateholders' Interest
hereunder (such increase in cost, "Increased Costs"), then, in any such
case, the Seller shall promptly pay to the Agent for the account of such
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder, upon the written demand of such
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder to the Seller (with a copy to the
Agent), so long as such Increased Costs are not otherwise included in the
amounts required to be paid to such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder pursuant to any other paragraph under this Section 8, any
additional amounts necessary to compensate such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder for such Increased Costs which such Short Term Bank
Series Certificateholder deems to be material as determined by such Short
Term Bank Series Certificateholder. If a Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant
to this Section 8.4, it shall promptly notify the Seller, through the
Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. A
certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing
sentence submitted by a Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder, through
the Agent, to the Seller shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error.

(b) Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in
subsections 8.3 or 8.4(a), each Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder
whose Commitments are affected by any such event agrees that it will
transfer such Commitments affected by any such event to another branch
office (or, if such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder so elects, to
an Affiliate) of such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder, provided
that such transfer shall be made only if such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder shall have determined in good faith (which determination
shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all
parties) that, (a) on the basis of then existing circumstances, such
transfer will avoid such events and will not result in any additional
costs, liabilities or expenses to such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder, to the Seller or to the Trust and (b) such transfer is
otherwise consistent with the interests of such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder.

SECTION 8.5. Changes in Capital Requirements. (i) In the event
that, in the opinion of counsel for any Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder (which may, in the discretion of such Short Term Bank
Series Certificateholder, be such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder's internal counsel), compliance with any law, rule,
regulation or guideline, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
application thereof or compliance by any Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) from any central bank or Governmental Authority enacted or
made subsequent to the date hereof shall affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder or any corporation controlling such Short Term Bank
Series Certificateholder and the amount of such capital that is required or
expected to be maintained is increased by or based upon the Commitments of
such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder under this Short Term
Supplement or the Wholesale PSA or any participation agreement entered into
pursuant to subsection 9.6 of the Short Term RPA, as applicable (such
event, a "Change in Law"), such affected Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder shall notify the Seller and the Agent within 90 days
after such affected Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder shall first be
required to comply with such Change in Law. At the time of such
notification such affected Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder shall
provide the Seller with a written statement setting forth the amount that
would adequately compensate such affected Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder for the costs associated with its compliance with such
Change in Law and setting forth in reasonable detail the assumptions upon
which such affected Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder calculated
such amount, and a copy of the opinion of counsel referred to in the
preceding sentence. Such affected Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder
shall allocate to the Seller the costs associated with such Change in Law
in such a way that the proportion of (i) such costs that are allocated to
the Seller to (ii) the total of such costs of such affected Short Term Bank
Series Certificateholder associated with such Change in Law as it relates
to all commitments of such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder to its
customers of similar creditworthiness as the Seller, is substantially the
same as the proportion of (i) the aggregate Commitments of such affected
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder under this Short Term Supplement
or the Wholesale PSA or such participation agreement to (ii) the total of
all commitments by such affected Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder
to its customers of similar creditworthiness as the Seller.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of any Change in Law, each Short Term
Bank Series Certificateholder whose Commitment hereunder is affected by
such Change in Law shall transfer its Commitment to another branch office
(or, if such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder so elects, to an
Affiliate) of such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder, provided that
such transfer shall be made only if such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder shall have determined in good faith (which determination
shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all
parties) that, (i) on the basis of then existing circumstances, such
transfer will avoid or reduce the additional payments resulting from such
Change in Law and will not result in any additional costs, liabilities or
expenses to such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder (unless the
Seller agrees to pay such additional costs, liabilities or expenses of such
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder), the Seller or the Trust and (ii)
such transfer is otherwise consistent with the interests of such Short Term
Bank Series Certificateholder.

SECTION 8.6. Taxes. (a) In the event that the adoption of any
law, regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, in each case after the date hereof,
shall require any Taxes (as hereinafter defined) to be withheld or deducted
from any amount payable to the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Short
Term Bank Series Certificateholder under this Wholesale PSA, upon notice by
such Person to the Seller (with a copy to the Agent) to the effect that (i)
as a result of the adoption of such law, rule, regulation, treaty or
directive or a change therein or in the interpretation thereof, Taxes are
being withheld or deducted from amounts payable to such Person under this
Wholesale PSA and (ii) such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder has
taken all action required to be taken by it to avoid the imposition of such
Taxes pursuant to clause (c) below prior to demanding indemnification under
this clause (a), the Seller will pay to the Agent for the account of such
Person additional amounts so that such additional amounts, together with
amounts otherwise payable under this Wholesale PSA, will yield to such
Person, after deduction from such increased amount of all Taxes required to
be withheld or deducted therefrom, the amount stated to be payable under
this Wholesale PSA. The term "Taxes" shall mean all net income, stamp or
other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
country (or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein), excluding, with respect to any Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder, net income and franchise taxes imposed with respect to
net income by any country (or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein) where such Person is organized or where such Person's
credit commitments are booked. If the Seller fails to pay any Taxes when
due following notification by the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder as provided above, the Seller
shall indemnify such Person for any incremental taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by any such Person as a result of any
such failure by the Seller to make such payment.

(b) Each Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder that is not
incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state
thereof agrees that it will deliver to the Seller and the Agent (i) two
duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001
or 4224 or successor applicable form, as the case may be, and (ii) an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor form. Each such
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder also agrees to deliver to the
Seller and the Agent two further copies of the said Form 1001 or 4224 and
Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable forms or other manner of
certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring
a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Seller,
and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by
the Seller or the Agent, unless in any such case an event (including any
change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on
which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such
forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder from duly completing and delivering any such form with
respect to it and such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder so advises
the Seller and the Agent. Such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder
shall certify (i) in the case of Form 1001 or 4224, that it is entitled to
receive payments under this Wholesale PSA without deduction or withholding
of any United States federal income taxes and (ii) in the case of a Form
W-8 or W-9, that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup
withholding tax.

(c) No Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder may request
indemnification for any Taxes from the Seller under clause (a) above to the
extent that such Taxes would have been avoided or reduced by such Short
Term Bank Series Certificateholder's transfer of its Commitments affected
by such event to another office of such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder (or to an Affiliate of such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder), by such Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder's
properly claiming the benefit of any exemption from or reduction of such
Taxes (whether provided by statute, treaty or otherwise), including by
delivering the forms required by clause (b) above, or by such Short Term
Bank Series Certificateholder's taking any other action which in its
judgment is reasonable to avoid or reduce such Taxes, provided that such
Short Term Bank Series Certificateholder shall not be required to (i) take
any action which in the reasonable judgment of such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder could directly or indirectly result in any increased cost
or expense or in any loss of opportunity to such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder unless the Seller shall have provided to such Short Term
Bank Series Certificateholder indemnity or reimbursement therefor in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder or (ii) claim or apply any tax credit against such Taxes.

(d) Within 30 days after the payment by the Seller of any
income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions or withholdings, withheld or deducted from any amount payable to
the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Short Term Bank Series
Certificateholder under this Wholesale PSA and irrespective of whether such
Person is entitled to demand indemnification in respect thereof under
clause (a) above, the Seller will furnish to such Person (with a copy to
the Agent), the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
payment thereof.

SECTION 8.7. Section 8 Costs. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Short Term Supplement to the contrary, Section 8 Costs shall be paid
by the Seller only to the extent of funds available therefor pursuant to
subsection 5.6(a)(v).

ARTICLE IX

shall have the option to purchase the entire Short Term Bank Series

seller of receivables under the Wholesale PSA referred to below (in such
capacity, the "Wholesale Seller"), AMERICAN AUTO RECEIVABLES COMPANY, a

commercial banks from time to time parties to this Long Term RPA (the
"Banks") and CHEMICAL BANK, a New York banking corporation, as agent for
the Banks hereunder (in such capacity, the "Agent") and as administrative

W I T N E S S E T H :

WHEREAS, CFC, CCC, the Wholesale Seller and the Retail Seller
have requested that the Banks agree to purchase undivided participating
interests in Retail Pooled Property and in Wholesale Trust Assets (each, as
hereinafter defined);

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Banks
are willing to make such purchases;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the
mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 Defined Terms. The capitalized terms used herein which are
defined in, or by reference in, Annex 1 hereto shall have the meanings
specified therein.

1.2 Other Definitional Provisions. (a) Unless otherwise
specified therein, all terms defined in this Long Term RPA shall have the
defined meanings when used in the Related Documents or any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto.

(b) As used herein and in the Related Documents, and any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto, accounting
terms relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries not defined in
subsection 1.1 and accounting terms partly defined in subsection 1.1, to
the extent not defined, shall have the respective meanings given to them
under GAAP.

(c) The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Long Term RPA shall refer to this Long
Term RPA as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Long Term
RPA, and Section, subsection, Schedule and Exhibit references are to this
Long Term RPA unless otherwise specified.

(d) The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms. 

SECTION 2. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF LONG TERM COMMITMENTS

2.1 Long Term Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, during the Long Term Commitment Period each Bank severally agrees
to purchase from the Retail Sellers (each such purchase, a "Retail
Purchase") undivided participating interests in Retail Pooled Property and
to purchase from the Wholesale Seller (each such purchase, a "Wholesale
Purchase") undivided participating interests in Wholesale Trust Assets in
amounts such that at any one time such Bank's Commitment Percentage of the
Aggregate Invested Amount shall not exceed the amount of such Bank's Long
Term Commitment, provided that the Wholesale Aggregate Senior Invested
Amount shall not, after giving effect to any proposed Wholesale Purchase,
exceed the Wholesale Senior Certificate Sublimit.

2.2 Related Documents. (a) Retail Purchases shall be made
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Long Term Retail PSA, and each
Bank's undivided participating interest in the Retail Pooled Property shall
be evidenced by a Retail Senior Certificate issued to such Bank pursuant to
the Long Term Retail PSA.

(b) Wholesale Purchases shall be made pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Long Term Wholesale Series Supplement, and each Bank's
undivided participating interest in the Wholesale Trust Assets shall be
evidenced by a Wholesale Senior Certificate issued to such Bank pursuant to
the Long Term Wholesale Series Supplement.

2.3 Procedure for Purchase. The Sellers may utilize the Long
Term Commitments during the Long Term Commitment Period on any Distribution
Date or any other Business Day, provided that the Company shall give the
Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by
the Administrative Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, (a) three
Business Days prior to the requested Purchase Date, if all or any part of
the requested Purchase is to initially bear interest at a rate based on the
LIBO Rate or (b) one Business Day prior to the requested Purchase Date,
otherwise), specifying (i) the amount to be purchased, (ii) the requested
Purchase Date, (iii) whether the Purchase is to be a Retail Purchase, a
Wholesale Purchase or a combination thereof, (iv) if the Purchase is to be
entirely or partly a Wholesale Purchase and is made on a Wholesale
Distribution Date, the respective amounts of such Wholesale Purchase which
shall initially bear interest at a rate based on the LIBO Rate and at a
rate based on the Base Rate and (v) if any amount of such Purchase shall
bear interest based on the LIBO Rate, the date of the succeeding
Distribution Date; it being understood that (A) any Wholesale Purchase made
on a day other than a Wholesale Distribution Date shall bear interest based
on the Base Rate until the following Wholesale Distribution Date and
thereafter shall bear interest based on the LIBO Rate or the Base Rate, as
selected pursuant to the Long Term Wholesale Series Supplement, and (B) any
Retail Purchase made on a day other than a Retail Distribution Date shall
bear interest based on the Base Rate until the following Retail
Distribution Date and thereafter shall bear interest based on the LIBO
Rate. On each Purchase Date the Purchases under the Long Term Commitments
shall be in an aggregate amount equal to at least $100,000,000. Upon
receipt of any such notice from the Company, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Bank shall (subject to subsection
9.7(b)) deposit in its Clearing Account an amount in immediately available
funds equal to the amount of its pro rata share of each Purchase prior to
11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Purchase Date requested by the
Company. The Agent shall, pursuant to subsection 9.7(a), cause such amount
to be withdrawn from each such Clearing Account and shall make the
aggregate amount so withdrawn available to the Company for the benefit of
the Sellers by depositing the proceeds thereof in the account of the
Company with the Agent.

2.4 Fees. 

(a) CCC agrees to pay to the Agent, for the ratable account of
the Banks, a facility fee for each day from and including the Effective
Date to but excluding the later of (i) the last day of the Long Term
Commitment Period and (ii) the date on which the Aggregate Invested Amount
shall have been reduced to zero (such later date, the "Final Fee Payment
Date"). Such fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on (A) the first
Business Day of each January, April, July and October (for the three-month
period (or portion thereof) ended on the last day of the immediately
preceding month) and (B) on the Final Fee Payment Date (for the period
ended on such date for which no payment has been received pursuant to
clause (A) above) and shall be computed for each day during such period at
a rate per annum equal to 0.1875 of 1% of the Long Term Aggregate
Commitment Amount in effect on such day (or, if the Long Term Commitments
shall have been terminated, on the Aggregate Invested Amount on such day).

(b) Facility fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- or
366-day year, as the case may be, for actual days elapsed. Facility fees
that are not paid when due shall bear interest, payable on demand, from the
date when due until paid in full (both before and after judgment) at the
Default Rate.

(c) CCC agrees to pay the Administrative Agent a fee of $2000
per month with respect to each calendar month during which the Aggregate
Invested Amount exceeds zero at any time occurring during the period from
the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which
the Effective Date occurs until the Aggregate Invested Amount is zero and
the Long Term Commitments have terminated, payable in arrears on the last
Business Day of each such month.

(d) If any Bank becomes an "affected Purchaser" under Section
11.3(f)(i) of the Long Term Retail PSA or an "affected Bank Series
Certificateholder" under Section 8.5(i) of the Long Term Wholesale Series
Supplement following any "Change in Law" (as defined therein), CCC shall
thereafter increase that portion of the facility fee payable to such
affected Bank under paragraph (a) of this subsection 2.4 to a level, which,
in the opinion of such affected Bank, will adequately compensate such
affected Bank for the costs referred to in such agreements. The Company
may from time to time reduce the compensation to be received pursuant to
this paragraph (d) by any affected Bank as a result of any Change in Law,
to the average compensation (the "Average Compensation") the Company has
agreed, as provided above, to pay the affected Banks as a result of such
Change in Law (such average compensation to be measured by a percentage of
the aggregate Long Term Commitments of such affected Banks).

2.5 Termination or Reduction of Long Term Commitments. The CFC
Parties shall have the right, upon not less than five Business Days' notice
to the Agent, to terminate the Long Term Commitments or, from time to time,
to reduce the amount of Long Term Commitments. Any such reduction shall be
in an amount equal to $100,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof and shall reduce permanently the Long Term Commitments then
in effect.

2.6 Interest. (a) Each Retail Senior Certificate shall bear
interest as set forth in the Long Term Retail PSA.

(b) Each Wholesale Senior Certificate shall bear interest as set
forth in the Long Term Wholesale Series Supplement.

2.7 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each Purchase
hereunder, each payment by CCC on account of any facility fee hereunder and
any reduction of the Long Term Commitments of the Banks shall be made pro
rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the Banks. All
payments (including prepayments) by the Sellers on the Certificates and
with respect to fees shall be made without setoff or counterclaim to the
Agent for the account of the Banks at the office of the Agent referred to
in subsection 9.2 in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Agent
shall promptly distribute such payments to each Bank entitled to receive a
portion thereof by causing such Bank's portion of such payment to be
deposited in such Bank's Clearing Account.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have been notified in writing by any
Bank prior to a Purchase Date that such Bank will not make the amount that
would constitute its Commitment Percentage of the Purchase on such date
available to the Agent, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such
amount available to the Agent on such Purchase Date, and the Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company a
corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the Agent on a
date after such Purchase Date, such Bank shall pay to the Agent on demand
an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Effective Federal
Funds Rate during such period, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's
Commitment Percentage of such Purchase, times (iii) a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including
such Purchase Date to the date on which such Bank's Commitment Percentage
of such Purchase shall have become immediately available to the Agent and
the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Agent submitted to
any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Bank's Commitment
Percentage of such Purchase is not in fact made available to the Agent by
such Bank within three Business Days of such Purchase Date, the Agent shall
be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the Base Rate
on demand, from the Company.

2.8 Addition of Retail Sellers. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, from time to time a special purpose subsidiary of CFC
may become an additional Retail Seller party hereto by executing an
Additional Seller Supplement hereto and to the Long Term Retail PSA. From
and after the Retail Addition Date with respect to each additional Retail
Seller through but excluding the Retail Addition Date with respect to any
successive additional Retail Seller, all Retail Purchases shall be made
with the Retail Seller which last became party hereto and all other Retail
Sellers shall be party hereto and to the Long Term Retail PSA solely with
respect to Retail Pooled Property in which they previously sold
participating interests.

2.9 Additional Commitments. The Company may, with the consent of
the Agent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), (a) add any
additional Commercial Bank as a Bank pursuant to a New Bank Supplement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit F, duly executed and delivered by the
Company, the Agent and such Commercial Bank, whereupon such Commercial Bank
(herein called a "New Bank") shall become a Bank for all purposes and to
the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and
entitled to the benefits of this Long Term RPA and the Related Documents,
Schedule I hereto shall be deemed to be amended to add the name and Long
Term Commitment of such New Bank and the Long Term Aggregate Commitment
Amount shall be increased by the amount of such New Bank's Long Term
Commitment, effective as of the date on which any such New Bank becomes a
Bank pursuant to the provisions of this subsection 2.9(a), or (b) enable an
existing Bank to increase its Long Term Commitment pursuant to a Long Term
Commitment Increase Supplement, substantially in the form of Exhibit G,
duly executed and delivered by the Company, the Agent and such Bank,
whereupon such Bank shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this
Long Term RPA and the Related Documents with respect to the full amount of
its Long Term Commitment as so increased, Schedule I hereto shall be deemed
to be amended to add the increased Long Term Commitment of such Bank, and
the Long Term Aggregate Commitment Amount shall be increased by the amount
of such Bank's additional Long Term Commitment, effective as of the date on
which any such Bank increases its Long Term Commitment pursuant to the
provisions of this subsection 2.9(b). The CFC Parties shall promptly
execute and deliver appropriate Retail Senior Certificates and Wholesale
Series Certificates to each New Bank and, upon surrender of its old
Certificates, to each Bank increasing its Long Term Commitment.

to perform and observe all of the terms, conditions, covenants, agreements
and indemnities of CCC under this Long Term RPA and the Related Documents
strictly in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof and that if for
any reason whatsoever CCC shall fail to so perform and observe such terms,
conditions, covenants, agreements and indemnities, the Company will duly
and punctually perform and observe the same.

(b) The liabilities and obligations of the Company under this
subsection 6.1 shall be absolute and unconditional under all circumstances
and shall be performed by the Company regardless of (i) whether the Banks
shall have taken any steps to collect from CCC any of the amounts payable
by CCC to the Banks under this Long Term RPA or the Related Documents or
shall have otherwise exercised any of their rights or remedies under this
Long Term RPA against CCC, (ii) the validity, legality or enforceability of
this Long Term RPA or of any of the Related Documents, or the disaffirmance
of any thereof in any insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings
relating to CCC, (iii) any law, regulation or decree now or hereafter in
effect which might in any manner affect any of the terms or provisions of
this Long Term RPA or any Related Document or any of the rights of the
Banks as against CCC or which might cause or permit to be invoked any
alteration in the time, amount, manner or payment or performance of this
Long Term RPA or any Related Document, (iv) the merger or consolidation of
CCC into or with any corporation or any sale or transfer by CCC of all or
any part of its property, or (v) any other circumstances whatsoever (with
or without a notice to or knowledge of the Company) which may or might in
any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company, or might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or
guarantor; it being the purpose and intent of the Company that the
liabilities and obligations of the Company under this subsection 6.1 shall
be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances, and shall
not be discharged except by payment and performance as in this Long Term
RPA provided.

(c) Without in any way affecting or impairing the liabilities
and obligations of the Company under this subsection 6.1, the Banks may at
any time and from time to time in their discretion, without the consent of,
or notice to the Company, (i) extend or change the time, manner, place or
terms of payment of any or all of the amounts payable by CCC to the Banks
under this Long Term RPA or the Related Documents or amend, supplement,
waive, extend or otherwise modify any of the terms of this Long Term RPA or
the Related Documents or (ii) settle or compromise any of the amounts
payable by CCC to the Banks under this Long Term RPA or the Related
Documents or subordinate the same to the claims of others.

(d) The provisions of this subsection 6.1 shall continue to be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment of
any of the amounts payable by CCC to the Banks under this Long Term RPA or
the Related Documents is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or
returned by the Banks upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of
CCC, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. The
Company hereby waives (i) notice of the occurrence of any default
hereunder, (ii) any requirement of diligence or promptness on the part of
the Banks in making demand, commencing suit or exercising any other right
or remedy under this Long Term RPA or the Related Documents, or otherwise,

amounts payable by CCC to the Banks under this Long Term RPA or any Related
Document remains unpaid, the Company will maintain ownership of not less
than 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of each class of capital
stock of CCC that is entitled to vote generally for the election of
directors; provided that nothing in this subsection 6.1 shall prevent the
merger or consolidation of the Company and CCC in accordance with
subsection 5.2 hereof.

(a) (i) any Wholesale Non-Portfolio Early Amortization Event or

(b) Any representation or warranty made by the Company herein or
in any other Related Document or which is contained in any

composition or other relief with respect to it or its debts, or (B)
seeking appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar
official for it or for all or any substantial part of its assets, or

any other Commitment Termination Event, so long as such Commitment
Termination Event shall be continuing, with the consent of the Required
Banks, the Agent may, or upon the request of the Required Banks, the Agent
shall, by notice to the Company declare the Long Term Commitments to be
terminated forthwith, whereupon the Long Term Commitments shall immediately
terminate.

SECTION 8. THE AGENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

8.1 Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints Chemical Bank as the Agent and as Administrative Agent of such
Bank under this Long Term RPA and the Related Documents, and each such Bank
irrevocably authorizes Chemical Bank, as the Agent and as Administrative
Agent for such Bank, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions
of this Long Term RPA and the Related Documents and to exercise such powers
and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, by the terms of this Long Term
RPA and the Related Documents, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary elsewhere in this Long Term RPA, neither the Agent nor the
Administrative Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except
those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any
Bank, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Long Term RPA or any
Related Document or otherwise exist against the Agent or the Administrative
Agent.

8.2 Delegation of Duties. Each of the Agent and the
Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Long Term RPA
and the Related Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. Neither the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys
in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

8.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agent, the
Administrative Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i) liable for
any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under
or in connection with this Long Term RPA or any Related Document (except
for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or
(ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any recitals,
statements, representations or warranties made by any CFC Party or any
officer thereof contained in this Long Term RPA or any Related Document or
in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or
provided for in, or received by the Agent or the Administrative Agent under
or in connection with, this Long Term RPA or any Related Document or for
the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency of this Long Term RPA or any Related Document or for any
failure of any CFC Party to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. Neither the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall be under
any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance
or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of,
this Long Term RPA or any Related Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records of any CFC Party.

8.4 Reliance by Agent and Administrative Agent. The Agent and
the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or
teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or
made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to any CFC Party),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent or the
Administrative Agent. The Agent and the Administrative Agent shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Long
Term RPA or any Related Document unless it shall first receive such advice
or concurrence of the Required Banks, or, if required under this Long Term
RPA, all the Banks, as it deems appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability
and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing
to take any such action. The Agent and the Administrative Agent shall in
all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
this Long Term RPA and the Related Documents in accordance with a request
of the Required Banks, or, if required under this Long Term RPA, all the
Banks, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and all future holders of the
Certificates.

8.5 Notice of Default. Neither the Agent nor the Administrative
Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any
Commitment Termination Event hereunder unless the Agent or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, has received notice from a Bank
or a CFC Party referring to this Long Term RPA, describing such Commitment
Termination Event and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". 
In the event that the Agent or the Administrative Agent receives such a
notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks. The Agent shall
take such action with respect to such Commitment Termination Event as shall
be reasonably directed by the Required Banks, or, if required under this
Long Term RPA, all the Banks; provided that unless and until the Agent
shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Commitment Termination Event as it shall deem advisable in
the best interests of the Banks.

8.6 Non-Reliance on Agent, Administrative Agent and Other Banks. 
Each Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent, the Administrative
Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties
to it and that no act by the Agent or the Administrative Agent hereinafter
taken, including any review of the affairs of the CFC Parties, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent or the
Administrative Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the Agent and
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the CFC Parties, the
Wholesale Master Trust, the Retail Pooled Property and the Wholesale Trust
Assets and made its own decision to make its Purchases hereunder and enter
into this Long Term RPA and the other Related Documents to which it is a
party. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Long Term RPA and the Related
Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the CFC Parties, the Wholesale Master
Trust, the Retail Pooled Property and the Wholesale Trust Assets. Except
for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished
to the Banks by the Agent or the Administrative Agent hereunder, neither
the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the CFC Parties, the Wholesale
Master Trust, the Retail Pooled Property and the Wholesale Trust Assets
which may come into the possession of the Agent or the Administrative Agent
or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

8.7 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify each of the
Agent and the Administrative Agent in their respective capacities as such
(to the extent not reimbursed by the CFC Parties and without limiting the
obligation of the CFC Parties to do so), ratably according to the
respective amounts of their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on
the date on which indemnification is sought under this subsection 8.7 (or,
if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Long Term
Commitments shall have terminated, ratably in accordance with such
Commitment Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever
which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following
the payment of the Certificates) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agent or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in any
way relating to or arising out of this Long Term RPA, any of the Related
Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or
omitted by the Agent or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, under
or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Bank shall be
liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting solely from the Agent's or the Administrative
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this
subsection shall survive the payment of the Certificates and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

8.8 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in
any kind of business with the CFC Parties as though the Agent were not the
Agent hereunder and under the Related Documents. With respect to any
interest in Retail Pooled Property or Wholesale Trust Assets the Agent may
from time to time hold, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers
under this Long Term RPA and the Related Documents as any Bank and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Bank" and
"Banks" shall include the Agent in its individual capacity.

8.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 10
days' notice to the Banks. If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this
Long Term RPA and the Related Documents, then the Required Banks shall
appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks, which
successor agent shall be approved by the Company, whereupon such successor
agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent, and the
term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its
appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent
shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part
of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Long Term RPA or any
holders of the Certificates. After any retiring Agent's resignation as
Agent, the provisions of this subsection shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under
this Long Term RPA and the Related Documents.

8.10 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
may resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Agent. If
the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this
Long Term RPA and the Related Documents, then the Agent shall appoint a
successor administrative agent for the Banks, which successor agent shall
be approved by the Company, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to
the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term
"Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its
appointment, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and
duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any
of the parties to this Long Term RPA or any holders of the Certificates. 
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative
Agent, the provisions of this subsection shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative
Agent under this Long Term RPA and the Related Documents.

SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Long Term RPA, any
Related Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended,
supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this
subsection. With the written consent of the Required Banks, the Agent and
the CFC Parties may, from time to time, enter into written amendments,

Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Banks or of the CFC
Parties hereunder or thereunder or waiving, on such terms and conditions as
the Agent may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this
Long Term RPA or the Related Documents or any Commitment Termination Event

the maturity of any Certificate or any installment thereof, or reduce the

all future holders of the Certificates. In the case of any waiver, the CFC
Parties, the Banks, the Agent and the Administrative Agent shall be
restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the
Related Documents, and any Commitment Termination Event waived shall be
deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other Commitment Termination Event, or impair any right
consequent thereon. Any amendment hereof or of the Related Documents can
be effected without the Administrative Agent being a party thereto.

Bank of participating interests to a Participant, such Bank's obligations
under this Long Term RPA to the other parties to this Long Term RPA shall
remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such
Certificate for all purposes under this Long Term RPA and the Company and
the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in
connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Long Term
RPA. No Participant shall have any rights under any Certificate (the
Participant's rights against such Bank in respect of such participation to
be those set forth in the agreement executed by such Bank in favor of the
Participant thereto) and all amounts payable with respect to the
Certificates shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold such
participations provided that (i) the terms of any participation agreement
or certificate relating to any such participation shall prohibit any
subparticipations by such participant; (ii) any such participation
agreement or certificate shall permit the Bank granting such participations
the right to consent to waivers, amendments or supplements to this Long
Term RPA and the Related Documents without the consent of such participant
except in the case of (a) waivers of any Commitment Termination Event
described in Section 7(a), and (b) any amendment or modification reducing
the amount or extending the maturity of any Certificate or any installment
thereof, or reducing the rate or extending the time of payment of interest
thereon, or reducing any fee payable to such Bank hereunder, in each case
to the extent such waiver, amendment or supplement directly affects such
participant and (iii) a participating interest of at least $5,000,000 shall
be sold pursuant to any such participation (unless, at the Company's
discretion, a lesser amount is mutually agreed upon between the Company and
such Bank).

(c) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to
any Bank, and, with the consent of the Company and the Agent (which in each
case shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to one or more
additional Commercial Banks ("Purchasing Banks") all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Long Term RPA, the Related Documents and
the Certificates, pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, executed by
such Purchasing Bank, such transferor Bank and the Agent (and, in the case
of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank, by the Company), and
delivered to the Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register,
provided that (i) prior to the termination of the Long Term Commitments
(whether on the Long Term Commitment Termination Date or otherwise), any
such sale shall include a proportionate share of each of such transferor
Bank's Long Term Commitment, interests in Retail Pooled Property and
interests in Wholesale Trust Assets and, after any such termination, any
such sale may be of any combination of interests in Retail Pooled Property
and interests in Wholesale Trusts Assets, (ii) in the event of an
assignment of less than all of such Bank's obligations, (x) the principal
amount of such Bank's Long Term Commitment so sold (or, if no Long Term
Commitment is outstanding, the principal amount of interests in Retail
Pooled Property and Wholesale Trust Assets so sold) shall be in an
aggregate amount of $6,000,000 or more and (y) after giving effect to any
such assignment, the transferor Bank and the Purchasing Bank (in each case
together with any Bank which is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or
such Purchasing Bank, respectively) shall each have obligations hereunder
and under the Related Documents aggregating not less than $6,000,000
(unless, in each case, at the Company's discretion, a lesser amount is
agreed upon between the Company and such transferor Bank or Purchasing
Bank, respectively), and (iii) no assignment hereunder shall be effective
unless and until the Agent shall be given written notice of the Clearing
Account of the Purchasing Bank; provided, further, however, that no consent
by the Company shall be required in the case of assignments to a Commercial
Bank controlled by, controlling or under common control with an assignor
Bank or pursuant to a merger or consolidation of such Bank with another
entity on a similar transaction involving such Bank. Upon such execution,
delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date
determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the Purchasing
Bank thereunder shall be a party hereto and the Related Documents and, to
the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
obligations of a Bank hereunder with a Long Term Commitment as set forth
therein, and (y) the transferor Bank thereunder shall, to the extent
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under this Long Term RPA (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor Bank's
rights and obligations under this Long Term RPA and the Related Documents,
such transferor Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Such Assignment
and Acceptance shall be deemed to amend this Long Term RPA to the extent,
and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such
Purchasing Bank and the resulting adjustment of Commitment Percentages
arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Bank of all or a portion of
the rights and obligations of such transferor Bank under this Long Term RPA
and the Related Documents. On or prior to the effective date determined
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, each Seller, at its own
expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the
surrendered Retail Senior Certificate and Wholesale Senior Certificate a
new Retail Senior Certificate and Wholesale Senior Certificate issued in
the name of such Purchasing Bank pursuant to the Long Term Retail PSA and
the Long Term Wholesale Series Supplement and, if the transferor Bank has a
retained Long Term Commitment hereunder, new Retail Senior Certificate and
Wholesale Senior Certificate issued in the name of the transferor Bank.

(d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
subsection 9.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and
a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names, addresses and
Clearing Accounts of the Banks and the Long Term Commitment of, and
principal amount of the interests in Retail Pooled Property and Wholesale
Trust Assets sold to, each Bank from time to time. The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the CFC
Parties, the Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the interests
in Retail Pooled Property and Wholesale Trust Assets recorded therein for
all purposes of this Long Term RPA. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the CFC Parties or any Bank at any reasonable time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Agent shall give prompt
written notice to the Company of the making of any entry in the Register or
any change in any such entry. 

(e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by
a transferor Bank and a Purchasing Bank (and, in the case of a Purchasing
Bank that is not then a Bank or an affiliate thereof, by the Company and
the Agent), together with payment to the Agent of a registration and
processing fee of $2,500 (or such lesser amount as may be agreed to by the
Agent), the Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance
and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto record the
information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such
acceptance and recordation to the Banks and the Company. 

(f) Each CFC Party authorizes each Bank to disclose to any
Participant or Purchasing Bank (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Bank's possession
concerning such CFC Party and its affiliates which has been delivered to
such Bank by or on behalf of such CFC Party pursuant to this Long Term RPA
or which has been delivered to such Bank by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with such Bank's credit evaluation of such CFC Party and its
affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Long Term RPA.

(g) If, pursuant to this subsection 9.6, any interest in this
Long Term RPA or any Certificate is transferred to any Transferee which is
organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States
or any State thereof, the transferor Bank shall cause such Transferee,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to represent to
the transferor Bank (for the benefit of the transferor Bank, the Agent and
the CFC Parties) that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be
required to be withheld by the Agent, the CFC Parties or the transferor
Bank with respect to any payments to be made to such Transferee in respect
of the Certificates, (ii) to furnish to the transferor Bank (and, in the
case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Agent and the
CFC Parties) either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 (wherein such Transferee claims
entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all
interest payments hereunder) and (iii) to agree (for the benefit of the
transferor Bank, the Agent and the CFC Parties) to provide the transferor
Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register,
the Agent and the CFC Parties) a new Form 4224 or Form 1001 upon the
expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form and comparable
statements in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and
amendments duly executed and completed by such Transferee, and to comply
from time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with regard
to such withholding tax exemption.

9.7 Clearing Accounts. (a) Each Bank irrevocably authorizes
the Agent and the Administrative Agent to cause such Bank's Clearing
Account to be debited as contemplated in subsection 2.3 and to cause to be
created an overdraft in such account if the balance in such Bank's Clearing
Account on a particular date is less than the amount of the Purchase to be
made by such Bank on such day. In addition each Bank irrevocably
authorizes the Agent and the Administrative Agent to cause such Bank's
Clearing Account to be credited, as contemplated in subsection 2.7(a), with
its ratable share of payments received by the Agent from the Sellers. The
Clearing Account of each Bank shall be maintained at its own expense and
free of charge to the Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Company.

(b) The Agent may at any time in its sole discretion, upon
notice to the Company and the Banks, discontinue the use of ACH procedures
in connection with Purchases made pursuant hereto, and the Banks shall
thereafter fund each Purchase required to be made by them hereunder by
making available the amount thereof to the Agent for the account of the
Sellers at the office of the Agent set forth in subsection 9.2 in funds
immediately available to the Agent.

9.8 Adjustments; Set-off.

(a) If any Bank (a "benefitted Bank") shall at any time receive
any payment of all or part of its investments in Retail Pooled Property or
Wholesale Trust Assets, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in
respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant
to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 7(d), or
otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral
received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's
investments in Retail Pooled Property or Wholesale Trust Assets, or
interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the
other Banks such portion of each such other Bank's investments in Retail
Pooled Property or Wholesale Trust Assets, or shall provide such other
Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as
shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Bank to share the excess
payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the
Banks; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment
or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Bank, such
purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned,
to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each CFC Party
agrees that each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's investments
in Retail Pooled Property or Wholesale Trust Assets may exercise all rights
of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect
to such portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct holder of such
portion.

(b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided
by law, each Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to any CFC
Party, any such notice being expressly waived by each CFC Party to the
extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and
payable by such CFC Party hereunder or under the Related Documents (whether
at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set off and
appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any
other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case
whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured,
at any time held or owing by such Bank or any branch or agency thereof to
or for the credit or the account of such CFC Party, provided, however, that
no Bank which maintains any bank account for the benefit of the Wholesale
Master Trust or the Wholesale Trustee shall exercise any right of set-off
or counterclaim or similar right with respect to amounts on deposit in such
bank account. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Company and the
Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
set-off and application.

9.9 Counterparts. This Long Term RPA may be executed by one or
more of the parties to this Long Term RPA on any number of separate
counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed
to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this
Long Term RPA signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Company
and the Agent.

9.10 Severability. Any provision of this Long Term RPA which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and
any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

9.11 Integration. This Long Term RPA represents the agreement
of the CFC Parties, the Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Banks with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by the Agent or any Bank
relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to
herein or in the Related Documents.

9.12 GOVERNING LAW. THIS LONG TERM RPA AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS LONG TERM RPA SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,

irrevocably and unconditionally:

proceeding relating to this Long Term RPA and the Related Documents to
which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any

(c) agrees that service of process in any such action or
proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or
certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage
prepaid, to such Person at its address set forth in subsection 9.2 or
at such other address of which the Agent shall have been notified
pursuant thereto; 

(d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit
the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and 

(e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any
right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or
proceeding referred to in this subsection any special, exemplary,
punitive or consequential damages.

relationship to such Person, and the relationship between Agent and

SECTION 2.4 Warranties as to Each Receivable. On each Transfer
Date, the Active Seller hereby makes the following warranties as to each
Receivable and the Related Property transferred on such date, on which the
Agent, the Administrative Agent and each Purchaser shall rely in accepting
such Receivable and such Related Property transferred on such date. 

(a) Individual Characteristics of the Receivables. Each
Receivable and, where applicable, the related Contract (i) has been
originated in the United States of America by a Dealer in a retail
sale of a Financed Vehicle in the ordinary course of such Dealer's
business, has been fully and properly executed by the parties thereto,
has been validly assigned to CCC by such Dealer and by CCC to CFC and
has been purchased by, and validly assigned to, the Active Seller from
CFC and has been validly sold, transferred and assigned by the Active
Seller to the Purchasers in accordance with its terms and the terms of
the Purchase Agreement and this Long Term Retail PSA, (ii) is secured
by a perfected, valid, subsisting and enforceable first priority
security interest in favor of CCC in the related Financed Vehicle,
which security interest is assignable, and has been so assigned, by
CCC to CFC, by CFC to the Active Seller and by the Active Seller to
the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers,
(iii) contains customary and enforceable provisions such that the
rights and remedies of the holder of such security interest are
adequate for realization against the collateral of the benefits of the
security, (iv) provides for level monthly payments which fully
amortize the Amount Financed over the original term (except for the
last payment of any Fixed Value Receivable) and provides for interest
at the related APR set forth in such related Contract and (v) has a
next Scheduled Payment not more than one month after the related
Cutoff Date.

(b) Schedule of Contracts; Calculations. The information set
forth in the supplements to Schedules I and II setting forth the
Standard Receivables and Fixed Value Receivables transferred by the
Active Seller on such date is true and correct as of the close of
business on the related Cutoff Date. The Principal Balance of each
Receivable has been accurately and correctly calculated.

(c) Compliance with Law. Each Contract with respect to any
Receivable and the sale of the related Financed Vehicle complied at
the time it was originated or made, and complies as of the date such
warranty is made, in all material respects with all requirements of
applicable federal, state, and local laws, and regulations thereunder,
including usury laws, the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, Federal Reserve
Board Regulations B, AA and Z, state adaptations of the National
Consumer Act and of the Uniform Consumer Act and of the Uniform
Consumer Credit Code, and any other consumer credit, equal opportunity
and disclosure laws.

(d) Binding Obligation. Each Contract with respect to any
Receivable constitutes the genuine, legal, valid, and binding payment
obligation in writing of the Obligor, enforceable in accordance with
its terms.

(e) Contracts in Force. No Contract with respect to any
Receivable has been satisfied, subordinated, or rescinded, and the
Financed Vehicle has not been released from the Lien granted by such
Contract in whole or in part.

(f) No Amendment or Waiver. No provision of any Contract with
respect to any Receivable has been amended, waived, altered or
modified in any respect, except pursuant to a document, instrument or
written notation included in the Receivable File and no such amendment
or waiver causes such Contract not to conform to the other warranties
contained in this Section.

(g) No Defenses. No Contract with respect to any Receivable is
subject to any right of rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense,
including the defense of usury, and the operation of any of the terms
of such Contract, or the exercise of any right thereunder, will not
render such Contract unenforceable in whole or in part or subject to
any right of rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense, including
the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission, setoff,
counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto.

(h) No Liens. There are no liens or claims, including liens for
work, labor or materials relating to, or the storage of, the Financed
Vehicle, that are liens prior or equal to, the Lien granted by the
Contract with respect to any Receivable.

(i) No Default. Except for delinquent payments of not more than
90 days on any Contract, (i) no default, breach, violation, or event
permitting acceleration under the terms of a Contract with respect to
any Receivable exists, (ii) no continuing condition that with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default, breach,
violation, or event permitting acceleration under the terms of a
Contract with respect to any Receivable has arisen and (iii) the
Active Seller has not waived any of the foregoing.

(j) Insurance. As of the execution of the Contract with respect
to any Receivable, a physical damage insurance policy covering the
Financed Vehicle securing such Receivable was in full force and
effect, in accordance with the Servicer's customary servicing
procedures.

(k) Valid Transfer. No Receivable has been sold, assigned,
pledged or otherwise conveyed by the Active Seller to any Person other
than the Purchasers pursuant hereto, and, immediately prior to the
transfer and assignment herein contemplated, the Active Seller had
good title to each Receivable free and clear of any Lien or other
right or interest of any other Person, was the sole owner thereof and
had full right and power to transfer and assign such Receivable to the
Purchasers. This Long Term Retail PSA constitutes a valid sale,
transfer and assignment to the Purchasers of all right, title and
interest of the Active Seller in and to the Receivables and all
proceeds (as defined in the UCC in effect in the State of New York)
thereof (other than the right, title and interest thereof which will
be retained by the Active Seller and evidenced by the Subordinated
Certificate), free and clear of any Lien or other right or interest of
any other Person.

(l) Lawful Assignment. No Receivable has been originated in or
is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction under which the sale,
transfer and assignment of such Receivable hereunder, or pursuant to
any issuance or transfer of the Senior Certificates, is unlawful,
void, or voidable.

(m) All Filings Made. All filings, including UCC filings,
necessary in any jurisdiction to give the Administrative Agent for the
benefit of the Purchasers a first priority perfected ownership
interest in each Receivable and the Related Property have been made
and Schedule IV sets forth the only locations where UCC filings are to
be made to give such a first priority perfected ownership interest.

(n) Valid Security Interest. On such Transfer Date, there shall
exist a valid, subsisting and enforceable first priority perfected
security interest in the Financed Vehicle securing the Receivable
related to such Financed Vehicle (subject to any statutory lien
arising by operation of law after such date which is prior to such
security interest) and, at such time as enforcement of such security
interest is sought, there shall exist a valid, subsisting and
enforceable first priority perfected security interest in the Financed
Vehicle in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Purchasers (subject to any statutory lien arising by operation of law
after such date which is prior to such interest).

(o) Capacity of Parties. All parties to each Contract with
respect to any Receivable had capacity to execute such Contract.

(p) Obligations; No Impairment. Each of the Active Seller, CCC,
CFC and the Dealer party to a Contract with respect to any Receivable
has duly fulfilled all obligations on its part to be fulfilled under,

of a breach with respect to any Receivable of a warranty made by such
Seller pursuant to Sections 2.4(h), 2.4(k) or 2.4(n), such Seller shall

shall keep on file, in accordance with its customary procedures,
relating to the Standard Receivables or Fixed Value Receivables, the

to review any Receivable File to determine that each item referred to in
this Section 2.7 is contained therein. 

SECTION 2.8 Duties of Servicer as Custodian. (a) Safekeeping. 
The Servicer, in its capacity as custodian, shall hold the Receivable Files
on behalf of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of all present and
future Certificateholders, and maintain such accurate and complete
accounts, records, and computer systems pertaining to each Receivable as
shall enable the Servicer, the Agent and the Administrative Agent to comply
with the terms and provisions of this Long Term Retail PSA applicable to
it. In performing its duties as custodian hereunder, the Servicer shall
act with reasonable care, using that degree of skill and attention that the
Servicer exercises with respect to the receivable files relating to all
comparable automotive receivables that the Servicer services for itself or
others. The Servicer shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, periodic
audits of the Receivable Files held by it under this Long Term Retail PSA
and of the related accounts, records and computer systems, in such a manner
as shall enable the Administrative Agent to verify the accuracy of the
Servicer's record keeping. The Servicer shall promptly report to the
Administrative Agent any failure on its part to hold the Receivable Files
and maintain its accounts, records and computer systems as herein provided
and promptly take appropriate action to remedy any such failure. Nothing
herein shall be deemed to require an initial review or any periodic review
by the Administrative Agent or the Agent of the Receivable Files.

(b) Maintenance of and Access to Records. The Servicer shall
maintain each Receivable File at one of its offices specified in Schedule
III to this Long Term Retail PSA or at such other office as shall be
specified to the Administrative Agent and the Agent by written notice,
which notice shall state any change in such location and shall be received
on or prior to the date on which such location is changed. The Servicer
shall make available to the Administrative Agent and the Agent or their
respective duly authorized representatives, attorneys or auditors a list of
locations of the Receivable Files and the related accounts, records and
computer systems maintained by the Servicer at such times as the
Administrative Agent or the Agent shall instruct.

(c) Release of Documents. Upon written instructions from the
Administrative Agent, the Servicer shall release any Receivable File to the
Administrative Agent or its respective agents or designees at such place or
places as the Administrative Agent may designate, as soon thereafter as is
practicable. 

(d) Title to Receivables. The Servicer agrees that, in respect
of any Receivable held by the Servicer as custodian hereunder, the Servicer
will not at any time have or in any way attempt to assert any interest in
such Receivable or the related Receivable File, except that the Servicer
may assert an interest in such Receivable solely for the purpose of
collecting or enforcing the Receivable for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Certificateholders. The entire equitable
interest in such Receivable and the related Receivable File shall at all
times be vested in the Certificateholders.

SECTION 2.9 Instructions; Authority to Act. The Servicer shall
be deemed to have received proper instructions with respect to the
Receivable Files upon its receipt of written instructions signed by an
assistant vice president or vice president of the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 2.10 Custodian's Indemnification. The Servicer, in its
capacity as custodian, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, the
Administrative Agent and each Purchaser from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, compensatory damages, payments, costs or
expenses of any kind whatsoever (including, without limitation, fees and
expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation) that may be imposed on,
incurred, or asserted against such Person as the result of any act or
omission by the Servicer relating to the maintenance and custody of the
Receivable Files; provided that the Servicer shall not be liable to any
Person hereunder to the extent, but only the extent, that such liabilities,
obligations, losses, compensatory damages, payments, costs or expenses
result from the willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence of such
Person.

SECTION 2.11 Effective Period and Termination. The Servicer's
appointment as custodian shall be deemed to be effective as of the initial
Cutoff Date and shall continue in full force and effect until terminated
pursuant to this Section 2.11. If CCC shall resign as Servicer under
Section 8.4 or if all of the rights and obligations of CCC, as Servicer,
shall have been terminated under Section 9.1, the appointment of the
Servicer as custodian hereunder shall be deemed terminated by the
Administrative Agent and the Certificateholders on the effective date of
such resignation or termination pursuant to Sections 8.4 or 9.1,
respectively. As soon as practicable after any such termination, the
Servicer shall deliver or cause to be delivered the Receivable Files to the
Administrative Agent or its agent or designee at such place or places as
the Administrative Agent shall designate.

ARTICLE IV

Administration and Servicing of the Pooled Property

SECTION 4.1 Duties of Servicer; Delegations. (a) The Seller,
the Administrative Agent, the Agent and each Purchaser hereby revocably
appoints CCC as Servicer for the Receivables and the Related Property and
CCC hereby accepts such appointment. The Servicer, as agent for the
Administrative Agent, the Agent and the Certificateholders, shall manage,
service, administer and make collections on the Receivables (other than
Repurchased Receivables) with reasonable care, using that degree of skill
and attention that the Servicer exercises with respect to all comparable
automotive receivables that it services for itself or others. The
Servicer's duties shall include collection and posting of all payments,
responding to inquiries of Obligors on such Receivables, investigating
delinquencies, sending payment coupons to Obligors, reporting tax
information to Obligors, accounting for collections, furnishing monthly and
annual statements to the Administrative Agent, the Agent and the
Certificateholders and making Advances pursuant to Section 5.4. Subject to
the provisions of Section 4.2, the Servicer shall follow its customary
standards, policies and procedures in performing its duties as Servicer. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer is
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself, the
Administrative Agent, the Agent and the Certificateholders or any of them,
any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or partial or full
release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to
such Receivables or to the Financed Vehicles securing such Receivables. If
the Servicer shall commence a legal proceeding to enforce a Receivable, the
Certificateholders (in the case of a Receivable other than a Repurchased
Receivable) shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically assigned,
solely for the purpose of collection, such Receivable to the Servicer. If
in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it shall be held that the
Servicer may not enforce a Receivable on the ground that it shall not be a
real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce such Receivable the
Required Purchasers shall, on behalf of the Certificateholders and at the
Servicer's expense, take steps to enforce such Receivable, including
bringing suit in the name of the Servicer, the Seller, the Administrative
Agent, the Agent or the Certificateholders. Each of the Agent, the
Administrative Agent and the Certificateholders shall upon the written
request of the Servicer furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney
and other documents reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable the
Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.

(b) In the event of any delegation of servicing authority or the
appointment of any subservicer by the Servicer, and notwithstanding the
provisions of any agreement permitting such subservicing or delegation, the
Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Administrative Agent, the
Agent and the Certificateholders for the servicing and administering of the
Receivables and the Related Property in accordance with the provisions of
this Long Term Retail PSA without diminution of such obligation or
liability by virtue of such subservicing or delegation agreements or
arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from a subservicer, to the
same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer
alone were servicing and administering the Receivables and the Related
Property. 

SECTION 4.2 Collection and Allocation of Receivable Payments. 
The Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to collect all payments called
for under the terms and provisions of the Receivables as and when the same
shall become due and shall follow such collection procedures as it follows
with respect to all comparable automotive receivables that it services for
itself or others. The Servicer shall allocate collections between
principal and interest in accordance with the customary servicing
procedures it follows with respect to all comparable automotive receivables
that it services for itself or others. The Servicer may grant extensions,
rebates or adjustments on a Standard Receivable or Fixed Value Receivable,
which shall not, for the purposes of this Long Term Retail PSA, modify the
original due dates or amounts of the Scheduled Payments on a Precomputed
Receivable or the original due dates or amounts of the originally scheduled
payments of interest on Simple Interest Receivables; provided, however,
that if the Servicer extends the date for final payment by the Obligor of
any Receivable beyond the Scheduled Maturity Date, it shall promptly
repurchase the Receivable from the Purchasers in accordance with the terms
of Section 4.7. The Servicer may in its discretion waive any late payment
charge or any other fees that may be collected in the original course of
servicing a Receivable. The Servicer shall not agree to any alteration of
the interest rate on any Receivable or of the amount of any Scheduled
Payment on Precomputed Receivables or the originally scheduled payments on
Simple Interest Receivables.

SECTION 4.3 Realization Upon Receivables. The Servicer, on
behalf of the Administrative Agent and the Certificateholders, shall use
its best efforts, consistent with its customary servicing procedures, to
repossess or otherwise acquire the ownership of the Financed Vehicle
securing any Receivable as to which the Servicer shall have determined
eventual payment in full is unlikely. To realize upon such Receivables,
the Servicer shall use such procedures as it follows with respect to all
comparable automotive receivables that it services for itself or others,
which may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any recourse to
Dealers and selling the Financed Vehicle at public or private sale. The
foregoing shall be subject to the provision that, in any case in which the
Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the Servicer shall not expend
funds in connection with the repair or the repossession of such Financed
Vehicle unless it shall determine in its discretion that such repair and/or
repossession will increase the Liquidation Proceeds by an amount greater
than the amount of such expenses.

SECTION 4.4 Physical Damage Insurance. The Servicer shall, in
accordance with its customary servicing procedures, require that each
Obligor shall have obtained physical damage insurance covering the Financed
Vehicle as of the execution of the Standard Receivable or the Fixed Value
Receivable.

SECTION 4.5 Maintenance of Security Interests in Financed
Vehicles. The Servicer shall, in accordance with its customary servicing
procedures, take such steps as are necessary to maintain perfection of the
security interest created by each Standard Receivable and Fixed Value
Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. The Servicer is hereby
authorized to take such steps as are necessary to re-perfect such security
interest on behalf of the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers in the
event of the relocation of a Financed Vehicle or for any other reason. If
there has been a Service Default (or the occurrence of an event of the type
described in Section 9.1(a)(vi) or (vii) with respect to the Active Seller
if CCC is the Servicer), upon the request of the Required Purchasers, each
of the Servicer and the Sellers, at their expense, shall promptly and duly
execute and deliver such documents and instruments, and take such other
actions as may be necessary, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel
delivered to the Administrative Agent (addressed to the Administrative
Agent, the Agent and each Purchaser), to perfect the Administrative Agent's
interest in the Receivables and the Related Property against all other
Persons, including, without limitation, the delivery of the Receivable
Files to the Administrative Agent, its agent or its designee, the
endorsement and delivery of the Insurance Policies or the notification of
the insurers thereunder, the execution of transfer instruments and the
endorsement to the Administrative Agent and the delivery of the
certificates of title to the Financed Vehicles to the appropriate motor
vehicle department (or other appropriate governmental agency).

SECTION 4.6 Covenants of Servicer. The Servicer shall not (a)
release the Financed Vehicle securing any Receivable from the security
interest granted by such Receivable in whole or in part except in the event
of payment in full by the Obligor thereunder or repossession, (b) impair
the rights of the Certificateholders in such Receivables, (c) increase the
number of scheduled payments due under a Standard Receivable or Fixed Value
Receivable and (d) change in any material respect its current credit and
collection policies (including, without limitation, its policy in respect
of the timing of charging off Receivables as uncollectible) so as to have a
material adverse effect on the Purchasers without the prior written consent
of the Required Purchasers.

SECTION 4.7 Purchase by Servicer Upon Breach. The Active Seller
or the Servicer shall inform each such other Person and each of the Agent
and the Administrative Agent promptly in writing upon the discovery of any
breach by the Servicer of its covenants under Sections 4.2, 4.5 or 4.6, and
the Administrative Agent shall give a copy of such writing to the
Purchasers. Unless the breach shall have been cured by the second
Determination Date immediately succeeding the date on which the Servicer
becomes aware of, or is informed in writing of, such breach, the Servicer
shall purchase any Receivable materially and adversely affected by any such
breach as of such Determination Date; provided that in the event of a
breach with respect to any Receivable of a covenant made by the Servicer
pursuant to Sections 4.6(a) or 4.6(c), the Servicer shall purchase such
Receivable on the next succeeding Determination Date, but only to the
extent that it has become aware of or been informed in writing of such
breach by such time. If the Servicer takes any action pursuant to Section
4.2 that impairs the rights of the Certificateholders in any Receivable or
as otherwise provided in Section 4.2, the Servicer shall purchase such
Receivable. In consideration of the purchase of any such Receivable
pursuant to either of the two preceding sentences, the Servicer shall remit
the Repurchase Amount in the manner specified in Section 5.5. For purposes
of this Section, the Repurchase Amount shall consist, in part, of a release
by the Servicer of all rights of reimbursement with respect to Outstanding
Precomputed Advances and Outstanding Simple Interest Advances on the
Receivable. The sole remedy of the Agent, the Administrative Agent or the
Certificateholders against the Servicer with respect to a breach pursuant
to Sections 4.2, 4.5 or 4.6 shall be to require the Servicer to purchase
Receivables pursuant to this Section.

SECTION 4.8 Servicing Compensation; Servicer Expenses. (a) The
Servicer shall be entitled to a fee (the "Servicing Fee") with respect to
an Accrual Period which shall be an amount equal to the product of 1/12 of
1% and the Pool Balance on the first day of such Accrual Period. The
Servicing Fee shall be payable to the Servicer monthly in arrears on each
Distribution Date, but only to the extent that funds are available therefor
in accordance with Section 5.6. The Servicer shall also be entitled to all
late fees, prepayment charges, including, in the case of a Receivable that
provides for payments according to the "Rule of 78s" and that is prepaid in
full, the difference between the Principal Balance of such Receivable (plus
accrued interest to the date of prepayment) and the principal balance of
such Receivable computed according to the "Rule of 78s", and other
administrative fees or similar charges allowed by applicable law with
respect to Receivables, collected (from whatever source) on the
Receivables.

(b) The Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred
by or on behalf of it in connection with its activities hereunder
(including (i) fees, disbursements and expenses of the Administrative Agent
and the Agent (including fees and disbursements of counsel to the
Administrative Agent and the Agent), any custodian appointed by the
Administrative Agent and independent accountants), (ii) taxes imposed on
the Servicer and (iii) expenses incurred in connection with distributions
and reports to the Agent, the Administrative Agent and the
Certificateholders) except expenses incurred in connection with realizing
upon Receivables under Section 4.3.

SECTION 4.9 Servicer's Certificate. On each Determination Date,
the Servicer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (which shall forward
a copy thereof on the related Distribution Date to each Purchaser) an
Officer's Certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto (a
"Servicer's Certificate"), containing all information necessary to make the
distributions and deposits pursuant to Sections 5.6 and 5.7 (including, if
required, withdrawals from or deposits to the Payahead Account and Advances
by the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.4) for the Collection Period
preceding the date of such Servicer's Certificate. Receivables to be
purchased by the Servicer or to be repurchased by the Seller shall be
identified by the Servicer by account number with respect to such
Receivable (as specified in Schedules I or II). The Administrative Agent
agrees to furnish the Servicer with information available to the
Administrative Agent necessary to complete the Servicer's Certificate with
respect to the Purchasers and amounts on deposit in the Certificate
Account, the Reserve Account and the Yield Account. Delivery of the
Servicer's Certificate shall constitute a representation and warranty by
the Servicer that the information contained therein is accurate in all
material respects on and as of such Determination Date.

SECTION 4.10 Quarterly and Annual Statements as to Compliance;
Notice of Service Default.

(a) Within 60 days of the end of a calendar quarter ending on
March 31st, June 30th and September 30th of any year, so long as the Senior
Amount was greater than zero at any time during such calendar quarter, the
Servicer shall deliver to the Agent, the Administrative Agent and each
Purchaser of record on the Record Date preceding such required delivery
date an Officer's Certificate, dated as of the last day of such calendar
quarter, stating that (i) a review of the activities of the Servicer during
the preceding calendar quarter and of its performance of its obligations
under this Long Term Retail PSA has been made under such officer's

has fulfilled all its obligations under this Long Term Retail PSA
throughout such quarter, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment
of any such obligation, specifying each such default known to such officer
and the nature and status thereof.

(b) On or before April 30th of each year, so long as the Senior
Amount was greater than zero at any time during such year, the Servicer
shall deliver to the Agent, the Administrative Agent and each Purchaser of
record on the Record Date preceding such required delivery date an
Officer's Certificate, dated as of December 31 of the preceding year,
stating that (i) a review of the activities of the Servicer during the
preceding calendar year and of its performance of its obligations under
this Long Term Retail PSA has been made under such officer's supervision
and (ii) to the best of such officer's knowledge, based on such review, the
Servicer has fulfilled all its obligations under this Long Term Retail PSA
throughout such year), or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment
of any such obligation, specifying each such default known to such officer
and the nature and status thereof.

(c) Promptly upon having knowledge thereof, but in no event
later than five days thereafter, the Servicer shall deliver to the Agent
and the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly transmit a copy thereof
to each Purchaser of record on the preceding Record Date, written notice in
an Officer's Certificate of any event which constitutes or, with the giving
of notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute or become, a Service
Default under Section 9.1.

SECTION 4.11 Independent Certified Public Accountant's Reports. 
The Servicer shall cause a firm of independent certified public accountants
acceptable to the Agent (who may also render other services to CFC, CCC and
the Sellers) to deliver to the Agent and the Administrative Agent, which
shall promptly transmit a copy thereof to each Purchaser of record on the
preceding Record Date, on or before April 30 of each year, so long as the
Senior Amount was greater than zero at any time during such year, a report
addressed to the Board of Directors of the Servicer and to the Agent, the
Administrative Agent and each such Purchaser with respect to the previous
calendar year to the effect that such firm has examined the financial
statements of CFC and issued its report thereon and that such examination

accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other
auditing procedures as such firm considered necessary in the circumstances;
(b) included tests relating to automotive loans serviced for others in
accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Single Audit Program for
Mortgage Bankers (the "Program"), to the extent the procedures in such
program are applicable to the servicing obligations set forth in this Long
Term Retail PSA; and (c) except as described in the report, disclosed no
exceptions or errors in the records relating to automobile and light truck
loans serviced for others that, in the firm's opinion, paragraph four of
such Program requires such firm to report.

Such report will also indicate that the firm is independent of
the Servicer within the meaning of the Code of Professional Ethics of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

SECTION 4.12 Access to Certain Documentation and Information
Regarding Receivables; Required Purchaser's Right to Request an Audit. (a) 
The Servicer shall provide to the Certificateholders access to the
Receivable Files in such cases where the Certificateholders shall be
required by applicable statutes or regulations to review such
documentation. Access shall be afforded without charge, but only upon
reasonable request and during the normal business hours at the respective
offices of the Servicer. Nothing in this Section shall affect the
obligation of the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting
disclosure of information regarding the Obligors and the failure of the
Servicer to provide access to information as a result of such obligation
shall not constitute a breach of this Section.

(b) The Administrative Agent may, at any time during the
Servicer's normal business hours, and shall, at the written direction of
the Required Purchasers, be allowed to audit, or to cause a third party to
audit, the Receivable Files and any other documents or information related
to the Receivables within the Servicer's possession (including, without
limitation, access to any personnel of the Servicer who has responsibility
with respect to the Receivables), which audit shall be for the expense of
the Servicer.

SECTION 5.1 Establishment of Bank Accounts. (a) On or prior to
the Effective Date the Administrative Agent shall establish with the Agent
an account into which the Servicer shall deposit collections on account of
the Receivables and the Related Property during each Collection Period (the
"Collection Account"). The Collection Account shall be established and
maintained as a segregated trust account in the corporate trust office of
the Agent in the name of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Purchasers. The Administrative Agent shall direct the Agent (or other
Person where the Collection Account is then maintained) to invest funds on
deposit in the Collection Account in Eligible Investments as from time to
time are specified by the Administrative Agent which, in any case, shall
mature not later than the next succeeding Deposit Date. All monies
deposited in or credited to the Collection Account (including net
investment earnings on Eligible Investments) shall be a part of the Pooled
Property.

(b) On or prior to the Effective Date the Administrative Agent
shall establish with the Agent an account into which (i) the Servicer shall
transfer collections on account of the Pooled Property on each Deposit
Date, (ii) the Seller and the Servicer shall transfer collections on
account of the Pooled Property and make deposits in respect of their
obligations hereunder and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall deposit
amounts withdrawn from the Reserve Account or the Yield Account pursuant
hereto (the "Certificate Account"). The Certificate Account shall be
established and maintained as a segregated trust account in the corporate
trust department of the Agent in the name of the Administrative Agent on
behalf of the Purchasers. Funds on deposit in the Certificate Account
shall be invested by the Administrative Agent in Eligible Investments which
mature not later than the next succeeding Deposit Date. All monies
deposited in or credited to the Certificate Account (including net
investment earnings on Eligible Investments) shall be a part of the Pooled
Property.

(c) On or prior to the Effective Date the Administrative Agent
shall establish with the Agent an account into which Reallocated Payments
and Reserve Account Deposits may be deposited (the "Reserve Account"). The
Reserve Account shall be established and maintained as a segregated trust
account in the corporate trust office of the Agent in the name of the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Purchasers. Funds on deposit in the
Reserve Account shall be invested in Eligible Investments which mature not
later than the next succeeding Deposit Date. All monies deposited in or
credited to the Reserve Account (including net investment earnings on
Eligible Investments) shall be part of the Pooled Property.

(d) On or prior to the Effective Date the Administrative Agent
shall establish with the Agent an account into which a Seller will, if the
APR Increment is greater than zero with respect to any Transfer Date,
deposit a Yield Deposit on such Transfer Date, which deposit will be used
in calculating the Adjusted Weighted Average APR on such date (the "Yield
Account"). The Yield Account shall be established and maintained as a
segregated trust account in the corporate trust office of the Agent in the
name of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Purchasers. Funds on
deposit in the Yield Account shall be invested in Eligible Investments
which mature not later than the next succeeding Deposit Date. All monies

in accordance with Section 5.3(a), deposit all Payaheads received in
respect of Precomputed Receivables (the "Payahead Account"; collectively
with the Collection Account, the Certificate Account, the Reserve Account
and the Yield Account, the "Trust Accounts"). The Payahead Account shall
be established and maintained as a segregated trust account in the
corporate trust office of the Agent in the name of the Administrative Agent
on behalf of the Purchasers. Funds on deposit in the Payahead Account
shall be invested in Eligible Investments which mature not later than the
next succeeding Deposit Date. All monies deposited in or credited to the
Payahead Account (including net investment earnings on Eligible
Investments) shall be part of the Pooled Property. If Chemical Bank ceases
to be the Agent, each of the Trust Accounts shall promptly be established
or maintained as a segregated trust account in the name of the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Purchasers in the corporate trust
office of one or more Eligible Institutions.

SECTION 5.2 Collections. The Servicer shall as promptly as
practicable deposit into the Collection Account (but in no event later than
two Business Days following the receipt thereof) all payments by or on
behalf of the Obligors with respect to the Receivables (other than
Repurchased Receivables and not including Fixed Value Payments) and all
Liquidation Proceeds, both as collected during any Collection Period,
provided, that, with the prior written consent of the Required Purchasers,
so long as no Service Default is continuing and CCC remains the Servicer
hereunder, the Servicer need not make such daily deposits but may make a
single deposit into the Collection Account in same day funds not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding
the Distribution Date in a net amount equal to the amount which would have
been on deposit with respect to the immediately preceding Collection Period
in the Collection Account. Prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on each
Deposit Date, the Administrative Agent shall remit all such amounts to the
Certificate Account. For purposes of this Article V the phrase "payments
by or on behalf of Obligors" shall mean payments made with respect to the
Receivables by persons other than the Servicer, the Sellers or CFC.

SECTION 5.3 Application of Collections. (a) All collections
for the Collection Period shall be applied by the Servicer as follows (in
the following order of priority):

(i) Repayments of Advances. With respect to each Receivable
(other than a Repurchased Receivable), payments by or on behalf of the
Obligor shall be applied, in the case of Precomputed Receivables, to
reduce Outstanding Precomputed Advances as described in Section 5.4(a)
and, in the case of Simple Interest Receivables, to reduce Outstanding
Simple Interest Advances to the extent described in Section 5.4(b).

(ii) Payments in Respect of Receivables. Any excess shall be
applied, in the case of Precomputed Receivables, to the Scheduled
Payment and, in the case of Simple Interest Receivables, to interest
and principal in accordance with the Simple Interest Method.

(iii) Excess to Payahead Account. With respect to Precomputed
Receivables, any remaining excess shall be added to the Payahead
Balance, and shall be applied to prepay the Precomputed Receivable,
but only if the sum of such excess and the previous Payahead Balance
shall be sufficient to prepay the Receivable in full. Otherwise, any
such remaining excess payments shall constitute a Payahead and shall
increase the Payahead Balance.

(b) All Liquidation Proceeds and any subsequent Recoveries with
respect to any Fixed Value Receivable shall be applied first to the related
Receivable and only after the payment in full of the Principal Balance
thereof plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall any such Liquidation
Proceeds or Recoveries be applied to, or constitute, the related Fixed
Value Payment.

SECTION 5.4 Advances.

(a) Advances on Precomputed Receivables. As of the close of
business on the last day of each Collection Period, if the payments by or
on behalf of the Obligor on a Precomputed Receivable (other than a
Precomputed Receivable which has become a Repurchased Receivable in such
Collection Period) shall be less than the Scheduled Payment with respect to
such Precomputed Receivable, the Servicer shall take the following actions
(in the following order of priority):

(i) the Payahead Balance shall be applied by the Servicer to the
extent of the shortfall and such Payahead Balance shall be reduced
accordingly;

(ii) the Servicer shall advance the amount equal to any remaining
shortfall (such amount a "Precomputed Advance"), to the extent that
the Servicer, at its sole discretion, shall determine that the
Precomputed Advance shall be recoverable from any of the Obligor, the
Repurchase Amount, Liquidation Proceeds or proceeds of any other
Precomputed Receivables.

Any Precomputed Advance made by the Servicer shall increase Outstanding
Precomputed Advances, which Outstanding Precomputed Advances shall be
reduced by any subsequent payments by or on behalf of the Obligor,
collections of Liquidation Proceeds in respect of Precomputed Receivables
or payments of the Repurchase Amount. If the Servicer shall determine that
an Outstanding Precomputed Advance with respect to any Precomputed
Receivable shall not be recoverable in accordance with the preceding
sentence, the Servicer shall be reimbursed from any collections made on
other Precomputed Receivables which are included in the Pooled Property and
Outstanding Precomputed Advances with respect to such Precomputed
Receivables shall be reduced accordingly.

(b) Advances on Simple Interest Receivables. As of the close of
business on the last day of each Collection Period, the Servicer shall
advance an amount equal to the amount of interest due on the Simple
Interest Receivables at their respective APRs for the related Collection
Period (assuming the Simple Interest Receivables pay on their respective
due dates) minus the amount of interest actually received on the Simple
Interest Receivables during the related Collection Period (such amount, a
"Simple Interest Advance"). With respect to each Simple Interest
Receivable, the Simple Interest Advance shall increase Outstanding Simple
Interest Advances. If such calculation results in a negative number, an
amount equal to such negative number shall be paid to the Servicer and the
amount of Outstanding Simple Interest Advances shall be reduced by such
amount. In addition, in the event that a Simple Interest Receivable
becomes a Liquidated Receivable, Liquidation Proceeds with respect to a
Simple Interest Receivable attributable to accrued and unpaid interest
thereon (but not including interest for the then current Collection Period)
shall be paid to the Servicer to reduce Outstanding Simple Interest
Advances but only to the extent of any Outstanding Simple Interest
Advances. The Servicer shall not make any advance with respect to
principal of Simple Interest Receivables.

SECTION 5.5 Additional Deposits. (a) The Servicer shall
deposit in the Certificate Account the aggregate Advances pursuant to
Section 5.4. To the extent that the Servicer fails to make a Simple
Interest Advance pursuant to Section 5.4(b) on the date required, the
Servicer shall notify the Administrative Agent to withdraw such amount (or,
if determinable, such portion of such amount as does not represent advances
for delinquent interest) from the Reserve Account and deposit such amount
in the Certificate Account. The Servicer and the Seller shall deposit or
cause to be deposited in the Certificate Account the aggregate Repurchase
Amount with respect to Repurchased Receivables. The Servicer shall deposit
therein all amounts to be paid under Section 10.2. The Seller shall
deposit therein any amounts paid to it under each Interest Rate Cap
Agreement. The Servicer shall direct the Administrative Agent to make any
Monthly Yield Account Withdrawal and deposit the amount so withdrawn in the
Certificate Account. All deposits pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) shall be
made on the Deposit Date.

(b) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall cause to be
transferred from the Payahead Account to the Certificate Account, in
immediately available funds, the aggregate previous Payaheads to be applied
to Scheduled Payments on Precomputed Receivables for the related Collection
Period or prepayments for the related Collection Period, pursuant to
Sections 5.3 and 5.4, in the amounts set forth in the Servicer's
Certificate for such Distribution Date. A single, net transfer may be
made.

SECTION 5.6 Distributions. On each Distribution Date, the
Administrative Agent shall make the following distributions of amounts on
deposit in the Certificate Account with respect to the related Collection
Period, as shown from the Servicer's Certificate delivered on the preceding
Determination Date, in the following order of priority (to the extent of
amounts available therefor):

(a) Shortfall Interest. To each Purchaser, in accordance with
its Purchase Percentage, as a payment of Certificate Interest due on
any prior Distribution Date which was not paid on such prior
Distribution Date as a result of insufficient amounts on deposit in
the Certificate Account from the sources described herein for the
payment therefor at such or any later Distribution Date ("Shortfall
Interest"), plus interest on such Shortfall Interest; any such
Shortfall Interest shall bear interest at the Default Rate and shall
be payable, to the extent of funds available therefor, from (i)
Interest Distribution Amounts for the Collection Period preceding such
Distribution Date, (ii) if necessary after application of amounts
pursuant to clause (i), the Applicable Subordinated Percentage of the
Principal Distribution Amount for such Collection Period, (iii) if
necessary after application of amounts pursuant to clause (ii),
amounts to be transferred from the Reserve Account to the Certificate
Account on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 5.7(d) and (iv)
if necessary after application of amounts pursuant to clause (iii),
from the Applicable Senior Percentage of the Principal Distribution
Amount for such Collection Period (clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv),
collectively, "Available Amounts"; provided that any determination and
application of Available Amounts shall be made in the order of the
priority established by the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv)); and provided, further, that the calculation of Available
Amounts with respect to each distribution under this Section 5.6
(other than distributions under Sections 5.6(e) and (j)) shall not
include any amounts on account of Realized Losses.

(b) Shortfall Principal. To each Purchaser as payment of all or
that portion of the Applicable Senior Percentage of the Principal
Distribution Amounts due on any prior Distribution Date which was not
paid on such prior Distribution Date as a result of insufficient
amounts of principal collections on deposit in the Certificate Account
at such Distribution Date, payable, to the extent of funds available
therefor, from Available Amounts.

(c) Reimbursement of Advances. To the Servicer, the aggregate
amount of Advances, which, prior to such Distribution Date, have not
been reimbursed pursuant to this Section, payable, to the extent of
funds available therefor, from Available Amounts.

(d) Senior Certificate Interest. To each Purchaser, Certificate
Interest payable on such Purchaser's Purchase Percentage of the Senior
Amount at the Certificate Rate applicable to the Accrual Period to
which such Distribution Date relates, payable, to the extent of funds
available therefor, from Available Amounts.

(e) Senior Certificate Principal. To each Purchaser, in
reduction of the Senior Amount, Certificate Principal to such
Purchaser in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the product of such
Purchaser's Purchase Percentage and the then outstanding Senior Amount
and (b) the product of (i) such Purchaser's Purchase Percentage and
(ii) the Applicable Senior Percentage of the Principal Distribution
Amount for the Accrual Period preceding such Distribution Date,
payable, to the extent of funds available therefor, from Available
Amounts.

(f) Servicing Fee. To the Servicer as payment of the Servicing
Fee for the Accrual Period to which such Distribution Date relates,
payable, to the extent of funds available therefor, from Available
Amounts.

(g) Reserve Account Deposit. To the Reserve Account to the
extent necessary to cause the Specified Reserve Account Balance to
equal the Minimum Reserve Account Balance, payable, to the extent of
funds available therefor, from Available Amounts.

(h) Increased Costs. To any Senior Certificateholder (or the
Administrative Agent or the Agent pursuant to Section 11.3) which has
submitted a demand for Increased Costs during any preceding Collection
Period pursuant to Section 11.3, payment of (i) interest, payable at a
rate per annum equal to the Default Rate, on Increased Costs due on
any prior Distribution Date which were not paid on such prior
Distribution Date as a result of insufficient amounts being available
for the payment therefor at such Distribution Date and (ii) the amount
of such Increased Costs as so demanded, payable, in each case, from
Available Amounts of the type described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
definition of such term.

(i) Subordinated Certificate Interest. To the holder of the
Subordinated Certificate as Certificate Interest payable on the
Subordinated Certificate at the Certificate Rate for the related
Accrual Period, from the remaining Interest Distribution Amounts.

(j) Subordinated Certificate Principal. To the Seller as
Certificate Principal payable on and as a reduction of the
Subordinated Certificate for the preceding Accrual Period, payable, to
the extent of funds available therefor, from the Applicable
Subordinated Percentage of the Principal Distribution Amount for the
related Collection Period.

(k) Remaining Amounts to Seller. To the Seller, all remaining
Interest Distribution Amounts and any other amounts remaining in the
Certificate Account.

Distributions to any Purchaser pursuant to any of the foregoing
paragraphs shall be made to such Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.7 of the
Long Term RPA. The Servicer shall, in its sole discretion, allocate among
the Sellers any amounts due and payable to the Sellers hereunder and
neither the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall have any obligation to
make such allocation. Any distributions to the Servicer or the Sellers
shall be made on a net basis to such Persons, to the extent that the
Servicer or such Seller shall have failed to make a deposit or payment
required hereunder.

SECTION 5.7 Subordination; Reserve Account.

(a) The rights of each of the Sellers to receive distributions
in respect of the Subordinated Certificate and any payments in respect of
any Seller Subordinated Note shall be and hereby are subordinated, and made
junior, to the rights of the Purchasers to receive distributions in respect
of the Senior Certificates. Such subordination shall be effected pursuant
to the priority of payments set forth in Section 5.6.

(b) In order to effect the subordination provided for herein and
to provide for the prompt payment to the Purchasers pursuant to Section
5.6, the Seller as holder of the Subordinated Certificate, on behalf of
itself and its successors and assigns, sells, conveys and transfers to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers all of the Seller's
right, title and interest in and to the Reserve Account, all amounts on
deposit therein from time to time and all proceeds thereof. Neither the
Seller nor the Servicer shall have any right to withdraw amounts from the
Reserve Account.

(c) If at any time the Specified Reserve Account Balance is less
than the Minimum Reserve Account Balance, then on the first succeeding
Distribution Date thereafter, and on each succeeding Distribution Date
thereafter so long as the Specified Reserve Account Balance is less than
the Minimum Reserve Account Balance, any distributions that would be made
if the Servicer is CCC, to the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.6(c) (such
amounts, "Reallocated Payments") (or such lesser amounts as may be
necessary to cause the Specified Reserve Account Balance to at least equal
the Minimum Reserve Account Balance) shall be deposited by the
Administrative Agent into the Reserve Account, and held as set forth in
Section 5.1 and this Section 5.7.

(d) If on any Determination Date the distributions to be made
from Available Amounts exceed such Available Amounts of the type described
in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of such term, as shown from the
Servicer's Certificate for such Determination Date, the Administrative
Agent on the following Distribution Date shall withdraw from the Reserve
Account an amount equal to such excess, if then on deposit in the Reserve
Account (or, if a lesser amount is on deposit, such lesser amount), and
deposit such amount in the Certificate Account.

(e) If the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.4 determines on any
Determination Date that it is required to make an Advance and does not do
so from its own funds, the Servicer shall instruct the Administrative Agent
to withdraw funds from the Reserve Account and deposit them in the
Certificate Account to cover any shortfall. Such payment shall be deemed
to have been made by the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.4 for purposes of
making distributions pursuant to this Long Term Retail PSA, but shall not
otherwise satisfy the Servicer's obligation to deliver the amount of the
Advances, and the Servicer shall within two Business Days replace any funds
in the Reserve Account so used.

(f) If on any Deposit Date (after giving effect to distributions
to be made to the Purchasers on the next succeeding Distribution Date), the
sum of the amounts on deposit in the Reserve Account and the Yield Account
equals or exceeds the Senior Amount (plus any other amounts due and payable
to the Purchasers under this Long Term Retail PSA) on such date, the
Administrative Agent shall withdraw such amounts from the Reserve Account
and the Yield Account and deposit such withdrawal in the Certificate
Account to pay to each of the Purchasers, on the related Distribution Date,
an amount equal to such Purchaser's Purchase Percentage of the then
outstanding Senior Amount (plus any such other amounts owing to such
Purchaser hereunder).

(g) If on any date the Senior Amount has been reduced to zero,
any amounts then on deposit in the Reserve Account and the Yield Account,
after giving effect to the distributions made on the Scheduled Maturity
Date, shall be distributed to the Active Seller, on the Business Day
following the Scheduled Maturity Date.

SECTION 5.8 Interest Rate Cap Agreements. If, on any
Distribution Date, the aggregate notional amount under an Interest Rate Cap
Agreement shall exceed the then outstanding aggregate Principal Balance of
the related Receivables Group by an amount which shall be specified in such
Interest Rate Cap Agreement, then the Administrative Agent shall give
notice to each Cap Provider thereunder to reassign such excess of the
aggregate notional amount under such Interest Rate Cap Agreement to the
related Seller on such Distribution Date.

ARTICLE VI

The Certificates; Transfers of Purchase Commitments

SECTION 6.1 The Certificates. The Senior Certificates and the
Subordinated Certificate shall be substantially in the forms of Exhibits A
and B, respectively, with, in the case of each Senior Certificate,
appropriate insertions as to the Purchaser and its Purchase Commitment and
Purchase Percentage. Each Purchaser is hereby authorized to record (a)
with respect to each Purchase, the Transfer Date and its pro rata share of
the Purchase Price and (b) the date and amount of each payment or
prepayment of principal hereunder on the schedule annexed to and
constituting a part of its Senior Certificate and any such recordation
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information so
recorded, provided that the failure so to record the amount of any such pro
rata portion of a Purchase Price or any error in so recording such amount
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Sellers
hereunder.

SECTION 6.2 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates. 
If (a) any mutilated Certificate shall be surrendered to the Active Seller
or (b) the Active Seller shall receive evidence satisfactory in its
reasonable discretion of the destruction, loss, or theft of any Certificate

Certificate recorded therein for all purposes of this Long Term Retail PSA. 
The Administrative Agent shall also maintain at such address copies of each

Administrative Agent may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate
shall be recorded in the Register as the owner of such Certificate for the
purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to Section 5.6 and for all
other purposes, and neither the Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall be
bound by any notice to the contrary. The Administrative Agent shall
furnish or cause to be furnished to the Servicer, within fifteen days after
receipt by the Administrative Agent of a request therefor from the
Servicer, in such form as the Servicer may reasonably require, a list of
the names and addresses of the Senior Certificateholders as of the most

incorporation or by-laws of the Servicer, or any indenture, agreement
or other instrument to which the Servicer is a party or by which it
shall be bound; nor result in the creation or imposition of any Lien

may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Long Term Retail PSA and

ARTICLE IX

Service Defaults

SECTION 9.1 Service Defaults.

(a) If any one of the following events ("Service Defaults")
shall occur and be continuing:

(i) Any failure by the Servicer (or, for so long as CCC is the
Servicer, the Active Seller) to make or to cause to be made any
required payment or deposit, which shall continue unremedied for a
period of two Business Days following the due date therefor;

(ii) Any failure by the Servicer to deliver to the Administrative
Agent the Servicer's Certificate for any Collection Period required
hereunder within five Business Days from the date on which such
Servicer's Certificate shall be due to be delivered; 

(iii) Except for the transfer of the Transferred Property by the
Servicer to CFC, the Servicer shall have assigned, transferred,
pledged or otherwise conveyed such Transferred Property (or any
portion thereof) to any other Person;

(iv) Failure on the part of the Servicer (or, for so long as CCC
is the Servicer, the Active Seller) to duly observe or to perform in
any material respect any other covenants or agreements set forth in
the Certificates or in this Long Term Retail PSA, which failure
continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which
written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied,
shall have been given to the Servicer (or, for so long as the CCC is
the Servicer, the Active Seller) by the Agent, the Administrative
Agent and the Required Purchasers; 

(v) If, at any date, there shall exist a material
misrepresentation with respect to any representation or warranty made
by the Servicer hereunder or in the Purchase Agreement (other than a
material misrepresentation in respect of a Repurchased Receivable),
which continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on
which written notice of such misrepresentation, requiring the same to
be remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer (or, for so long as
CCC is the Servicer, the Seller) by the Agent, the Administrative
Agent or the Required Purchasers;

(vi) The entry of a decree or order by a court or agency or
supervisory authority of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a conservator, receiver, liquidator or trustee for any of the
Servicer, CFC or Chrysler Corporation in any bankruptcy, insolvency,

similar proceedings, or for the winding up or liquidation of its
affairs, and any such decree or order continues unstayed and in effect
for a period of 60 consecutive days; 

(vii) The consent by any of the Servicer, CFC or Chrysler
Corporation to the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator
or trustee in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt,
marshalling of assets and liabilities, or similar proceedings of or
relating to such Person or relating to substantially all of its
property, the admission in writing by such Person of its inability to
pay its debts generally as they become due, the filing by such Person
of a petition to take advantage of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization statute, the making by such Person of an
assignment for the benefit of its creditors or the voluntary
suspension by such Person of payment of its obligations; 

then, and in each and every case and so long as a Service Default shall not
have been remedied, the Administrative Agent, the Agent and the Required
Purchasers by notice then given in writing to the Servicer, may terminate
all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Long Term
Retail PSA. On or after the receipt by the Servicer of such written
notice, all authority and power of the Servicer under this Long Term Retail
PSA, whether with respect to the Certificates or the Pooled Property or
otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the Administrative Agent pursuant
to this Section 9.1; and thereupon the Administrative Agent shall be
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Servicer,
as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other
instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether
to complete the transfer and endorsement of the Receivable Files or the
Insurance Policies, the certificates of title to the Financed Vehicles, or
otherwise. The Servicer shall cooperate with the Administrative Agent or
such successor Servicer in effecting the termination of its
responsibilities and rights as Servicer under this Long Term Retail PSA,
including the transfer to the Administrative Agent or such successor
Servicer for administration of all cash amounts that are at the time held
by the Servicer for deposit, shall have been deposited by the Servicer in
the Certificate Account, or thereafter shall be received with respect to a
Receivable, all Receivable Files and all information or documents that the
Administrative Agent or such successor Servicer may require. In addition,
the Servicer shall transfer or cause to be transferred all electronic
records relating to the Receivables to the successor Servicer in such
electronic form as the successor Servicer may reasonably request, and shall
make available or cause to be made available to the successor Servicer such
personnel having knowledge of such electronic records for such period of
time as the successor Servicer shall reasonably require.

(b) If any of the foregoing Service Defaults occur, neither the
Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall have any obligation to notify
Certificateholders or any other Person of such occurrence prior to the
continuance of such event through the end of any cure period specified in
Section 9.1(a).

SECTION 9.2 Administrative Agent to Act; Appointment of
Successor Servicer. Upon the Servicer's resignation pursuant to Section
8.4 or upon the Servicer's receipt of notice of termination as Servicer
pursuant to Section 9.1, the Administrative Agent shall be the successor in
all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as Servicer under this Long
Term Retail PSA, and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties
and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and
provisions of this Long Term Retail PSA; provided, that, if the
Administrative Agent shall be acting as such successor Servicer, it shall
not be responsible for the payment of any reasonable amounts required to be
paid with respect to the expenses of the Servicer pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 4.8(b) (to the extent that such successor Servicer
would not otherwise be reimbursed for such amounts) which payments, in each
case, shall instead be paid monthly in arrears from Available Amounts
subsequent to distributions under Section 5.6(e) but prior to distributions
under Section 5.6(f). As compensation therefor, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to such compensation (whether payable out of the
Certificate Account or otherwise) as the Servicer would have been entitled
to under this Long Term Retail PSA if no such notice of termination or
resignation had been given. Notwithstanding the above, the Administrative
Agent may, if it shall be unwilling or legally unable so to act, appoint,
or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, an Eligible
Servicer as the successor to the terminated Servicer under this Long Term
Retail PSA. The Administrative Agent and such successor shall take such
action, consistent with this Long Term Retail PSA, as shall be necessary to
effectuate any such succession. No Servicer shall resign or be relieved of
its duties under this Long Term Retail PSA until a newly appointed Servicer
shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the terminated
Servicer under this Long Term Retail PSA. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any successor Servicer shall have any liability for any failure to
perform servicing obligations hereunder due to the timeliness, accuracy or
completeness of information supplied by any predecessor Servicer.

SECTION 9.3 Effect of Servicing Transfer.

(a) After the transfer of servicing hereunder, the
Administrative Agent or successor Servicer shall notify Obligors to make
directly to the successor Servicer payments that are due under the
Receivables after the effective date of such transfer.

(b) After the transfer of servicing hereunder, the outgoing
Servicer shall have no further obligations with respect to the management,
administration, servicing, custody or collection of the Receivables and the
successor Servicer shall have all of such obligations, except that the
outgoing Servicer shall transmit or cause to be transmitted directly to the
successor Servicer for its own account, promptly on receipt and in the same
form in which received, any amounts held by the outgoing Servicer (properly
endorsed where required for the successor Servicer to collect any such
items) received as payments upon or otherwise in connection with the
Receivables and the outgoing Servicer shall continue to cooperate with the
successor Servicer by providing information and in the enforcement of the
Receivables and the Insurance Policies.

(c) A transfer of servicing hereunder shall not affect the
rights and duties of the parties hereunder (including the obligations and
indemnities of any Seller pursuant to Sections 2.6, 7.1 and 7.2 or, with
respect to obligations and indemnities arising prior to, or concurrently
with, a transfer of servicing hereunder, the outgoing Servicer pursuant to
Sections 4.7, 8.1 or 8.2) other than those relating to the management,
administration, servicing, custody or collection of the Receivables and the
other Pooled Property. The successor Servicer shall, upon its appointment
pursuant to Section 9.2 and as part of its duties and responsibilities
under this Long Term Retail PSA, promptly take all action it deems
necessary or appropriate so that the outgoing Servicer (in whatever
capacity) is paid or reimbursed all amounts it is entitled to receive under
this Long Term Retail PSA on each Distribution Date subsequent to the date
on which it is terminated as Servicer hereunder.

SECTION 9.4 Notification to Certificateholders. Upon any notice
of a Service Default or upon any termination of, or appointment of a
successor to, the Servicer pursuant to this Article IX, the Administrative
Agent shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Agent and to the
Purchasers of record at the preceding Record Date at their respective
addresses of record.

ARTICLE X

remaining Purchasers to surrender their Senior Certificates for
cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If
within one year after the second notice all the Senior Certificates shall
not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Servicer may take
appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to
contact the remaining Purchasers concerning surrender of their
Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds and other
assets that shall remain subject to this Long Term Retail PSA. Any funds
remaining as part of the Pooled Property (whether in the Trust Accounts or
otherwise) after exhaustion of such remedies shall be distributed by the
Administrative Agent to the Active Seller.

SECTION 10.2 Repurchases of Pooled Property. If on any
Distribution Date the outstanding Senior Amount on such date is equal to or
less than 10% of the largest Senior Amount ever previously outstanding
under this Long Term Retail PSA (after giving effect to distributions to
the Purchasers on such Distribution Date), the Sellers may, at their
option, repurchase the Pooled Property by giving the Administrative Agent
irrevocable notice no later than the first Business Day of the following
calendar month. The Sellers shall pay the aggregate Repurchase Amount for
the Receivables on the Determination Date following the date of its notice. 
The payment shall be made in the manner specified in Section 5.5 and shall
be distributed pursuant to Section 5.6. On such Distribution Date after
giving effect to the distribution to the Purchasers required by Section
5.6, the Sellers shall again succeed to and own all interests in and to the
Pooled Property. 

SECTION 10.3 Sale of Pooled Property. (a) Mandatory Sale. The
Administrative Agent or the Agent with the consent of the Required
Purchasers may, or the Administrative Agent or the Agent at the direction
of the Required Purchasers shall, sell the Pooled Property to pay the
Purchasers any outstanding Senior Amount and any other amounts payable to
the Purchasers under this Long Term Retail PSA and the Senior Certificates
if (a) an event of the type described in Section 9.1(a)(vi) or (a)(vii)
occurs with respect to any Seller, (b) any Senior Amount is outstanding on
the Scheduled Maturity Date (after giving effect to distributions on such
date) or (c) at any date, the Senior Amount as of such date is not less
than the Pool Balance as of such date.

(b) Optional Sale. The Agent may at any time offer to sell the
Purchasers' interest in all or any portion of the Receivables for cash (i)
if the Senior Amount (plus accrued interest, fees and Increased Costs to
the date of such sale), after giving effect to such sale, will be reduced
to zero and (ii) if after giving effect thereto, no Service Default or
Retail Portfolio Termination Event shall be continuing. Proceeds of such
sale shall be treated as collections in respect of the repurchased
Receivables and applied in accordance with Section 5.6. Following the
receipt of a bona fide offer to purchase the Purchasers' interest in all or
any portion of the Receivables from any Person other than the Active
Seller, the Active Seller shall have a right of first refusal to purchase
such interest for an amount equal to the amount stated in such Person's
offer to purchase. The Sellers will be under no obligation to make such
purchase hereunder.

(c) Terms of Mandatory Sale. Any such sale or sales shall be
for cash or upon such other terms as the Agent or the Administrative Agent
shall, in its sole discretion, deem acceptable. Any of the Sellers, the
Servicer or CFC may purchase any of the Pooled Property for cash in any
such sale; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Agent
shall be under any obligation to, and none of the Sellers, the Servicer or
CFC shall be deemed to have any right to require that the Administrative
Agent or the Agent, offer the Pooled Property to the Sellers, the Servicer
or CFC before soliciting any other offers or engaging in negotiations with
respect to the Pooled Property. The proceeds of any such sale shall be
first, applied against the costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) of the Administrative Agent or the Agent in
consummating such sale, second, applied against distributions required to
be made by paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (e) of Section 5.6, third, applied
against any Increased Costs for which a demand has been made, fourth,
applied against any distribution required to be made by paragraph (i) of
Section 5.6 and fifth, to the extent of any proceeds remaining, turned over
to the Sellers.

ARTICLE XI

Miscellaneous

SECTION 11.1 Protection of Rights in Pooled Property. (a) The
Servicer shall execute and file such financing statements and cause to be
executed and filed such continuation statements, all in such manner and in
such places as may be required by law fully to preserve, maintain and
protect the interest of the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers under
this Long Term Retail PSA in the Pooled Property. The Servicer shall
deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Administrative Agent file-stamped
copies of, or filing receipts for, any document filed as provided in the
foregoing sentence as soon as available following such filing. In the
event that the Servicer fails to perform its obligations under this
Section, the Administrative Agent or the Agent may do so at the expense of
the Servicer.

(b) Neither the Servicer nor any Seller shall change its name,
identity, or corporate structure in any manner that would, could, or might
make any financing statement or continuation statement filed pursuant to
Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 11.1(a) seriously misleading within the meaning of
sect. 9-402(7) of the UCC as in effect from time to time in the State of
Michigan, unless it shall have given each of the Administrative Agent and
the Agent written notice thereof no later than 15 days after such change.

(c) Each Seller and the Servicer shall give the Administrative
Agent and the Agent at least 60 days' prior written notice of any
relocation of its principal executive office if, as a result of such
relocation, the applicable provisions of the UCC would require the filing
of any amendment of any previously filed financing or continuation
statement or of any new financing statement. Each Seller and the Servicer
shall at all times maintain each office from which it shall service
Contracts, and its principal executive office, within the United States of
America.

(d) The Servicer shall maintain or cause to be maintained
accounts and records as to each Receivable accurately and in sufficient
detail to permit (i) the reader thereof to know at any time the status of
such Receivable, including payments and Liquidation Proceeds made and
payments owing (and the nature of each), and (ii) reconciliation between
payments or Liquidation Proceeds on (or with respect to) each Receivable
and the amounts from time to time deposited in the Certificate Account in
respect of such Receivable.

(e) The Servicer shall maintain or cause to be maintained
computer systems so that, from and after the time of sale under this Long
Term Retail PSA of the Receivables to the Certificateholders, the
Servicer's computer records (including archives) that shall refer to a
Receivable indicate clearly that such Receivable is owned by the
Certificateholders. Indication of the Certificateholders' undivided
participating ownership of a Receivable shall be deleted from or modified
on any such computer systems when, and only when, the Receivable shall
become a Repurchased Receivable.

(f) If at any time any Seller or the Servicer shall propose to
sell, grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer any interest in
motor vehicle receivables to any prospective purchaser, lender or other
transferee, such Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, shall give to
such prospective purchaser, lender, or other transferee computer tapes,
records, or print-outs (including any restored from archives) that, if they
shall refer in any manner whatsoever to any Receivable, shall indicate
clearly that such Receivable has been sold and is owned by the
Certificateholders.

(g) Upon request, the Servicer, at its expense, shall furnish to
the Administrative Agent, within ten Business Days, a list of all
Receivables then held as part of the Pooled Property, together with a
reconciliation of such list to the schedules of such Receivables previously
delivered and to each of the Servicer's Certificates furnished pursuant to
Section 4.9 indicating removal of Receivables from the Pooled Property.

SECTION 11.2 Limitation on Rights of Certificateholders. 
Nothing set forth in this Long Term Retail PSA, or contained in the terms
of the Certificates, shall be construed so as to constitute the Holders as
partners or members of an association. No Purchaser shall have any right
by virtue or by availing itself of any provisions of this Long Term Retail
PSA to institute any suit, action, or proceeding in equity or at law upon
or under or with respect to this Long Term Retail PSA, unless such
Purchaser previously shall have given to the Administrative Agent and the
Agent a written notice of default and of the continuance thereof and unless
the Required Purchasers shall have made written request upon the
Administrative Agent to institute such action, suit, or proceeding in its
own name as Administrative Agent under the Long Term Retail PSA and shall
have offered to the Administrative Agent such reasonable indemnity as it
may require against the costs, expenses, and liabilities to be incurred
therein or thereby, and the Administrative Agent shall have refused to
institute any such action, suit or proceeding; provided that, if the
Administrative Agent has not responded to such request within 60 days after
its receipt of such notice, request and offer, the Administrative Agent
shall be deemed to have refused to institute any such action. No one or
more Purchasers shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or
by availing itself or themselves of any provisions of this Long Term Retail
PSA to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Purchasers, or
to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such
Purchaser or to enforce any right, under this Long Term Retail PSA, except
in the manner provided in this Long Term Retail PSA and for the equal,
ratable, and common benefit of all Purchasers. For the protection and
enforcement of the provisions of this Section 11.2, each Purchaser and the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to such relief as can be given
either at law or in equity.

SECTION 11.3 Increased Costs. The Active Seller agrees that it
shall pay all amounts (such amounts, "Increased Costs") which arise in the
event that any of the following costs or events occur:

(a) Reemployment Costs. The Sellers agree to indemnify each
Purchaser and to hold each Purchaser harmless from any loss or expense,
including, but not limited to, any such loss or expense arising from
interest or fees payable by such Purchaser to lenders of funds obtained by
it to purchase or maintain that portion of its Purchases hereunder with
respect to which Certificate Interest is determined by reference to the
LIBO Rate as a consequence of (i) default by such Seller in the performance
of its obligations hereunder, (ii) the occurrence of a Service Default or
an event which would, with the giving of notice or the passage of time,
constitute a Service Default, (iii) the occurrence of an event referred to
in Section 11.3(b) or 11.3(c), (iv) default by such Seller in selling a
Receivables Group on any Transfer Date after having given notice of such
sale, or (v) any reduction of the Senior Amount prior to the termination of
an Accrual Period for which Certificate Interest is scheduled to be paid to
the Purchasers. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by any Purchaser to such
Seller shall be conclusive absent manifest error. This covenant shall
survive termination of this Long Term Retail PSA. 

(b) Inability to Determine LIBO Rate. In the event that (a) the
Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Sellers) that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits
referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" are not being provided in the
relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for the purposes of
determining rates of interest for the Purchases hereunder as provided
herein, or (b) the Required Purchasers determine (which determination shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Sellers) and shall notify the Agent that
the rates of interest referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" as the
basis upon which the rate of interest for Purchases hereunder is to be
determined do not adequately cover the cost to the Purchasers of making or
maintaining such Purchases, the Agent shall forthwith give telex notice of
such determination, confirmed in writing, to the Active Seller and the
Purchasers, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Active Seller and the
Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no
longer exist, the Certificate Rate shall thereafter be calculated by
reference to the Base Rate.

(c) Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if
any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any
Purchaser to make or maintain its interest in its Senior Certificate
because Certificate Interest on such Senior Certificate is based on the
LIBO Rate and such Purchaser shall notify the Agent, the Administrative
Agent and the Active Seller, then the portion of the Senior Amount
applicable to such Purchaser shall thereafter bear interest at a rate
determined by reference to the Base Rate. If any such change in the method
of calculating interest occurs on a day which is not the last day of the
Accrual Period, the Active Seller shall pay to the Agent for the account of
such Purchaser the amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to
subsection 11.3(a).

(d) Additional Costs. In the event that any law, regulation,
treaty or directive or any change therein or in the interpretation or
application thereof or compliance by any Purchaser with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority enacted or made subsequent to the date hereof:

(i) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, any office of such Purchaser; or

(ii) does or shall impose on such Purchaser any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Purchaser of purchasing or maintaining its portion of the Senior Amount
hereunder (such increase in cost, "Additional Costs") then, in any such
case, the Active Seller shall promptly pay to the Agent for the account of
such Purchaser, upon the written demand of such Purchaser to such Active
Seller (with a copy to the Agent), so long as such Additional Costs are not
otherwise included in the amounts required to be paid to such Purchaser
pursuant to any other paragraph under this Section 11.3, any additional
amounts necessary to compensate such Purchaser for such Additional Costs
which such Purchaser deems to be material as determined by such Purchaser. 
If a Purchaser becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to
this subsection 11.3(d), it shall promptly notify the Active Seller,
through the Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so
entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to
the foregoing sentence submitted by a Purchaser, through the Agent, to the
Active Seller shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(e) Transfer of Commitments. Upon the occurrence of any of the
events specified in subsections 11.3(c) or 11.3(d), each Purchaser whose
Long Term Commitments are affected by any such event agrees that it will
transfer such Long Term Commitments affected by any such event to another
branch office (or, if such Purchaser so elects, to an Affiliate) of such
Purchaser, provided that such transfer shall be made only if such Purchaser
shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall, absent
manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) that,
(a) on the basis of existing circumstances, such transfer will avoid such
events and will not result in any additional costs, liabilities or expenses
to such Purchaser or to the Active Seller and (b) such transfer is
otherwise consistent with the interests of such Purchaser.

(f) Changes in Capital Requirements. (i) In the event that, in
the opinion of counsel for any Purchaser (which may, in the discretion of
such Purchaser, be such Purchaser's internal counsel), compliance with any
law, rule, regulation or guideline, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Purchaser with
any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
central bank or Governmental Authority enacted or made subsequent to the
date hereof shall affect the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by such Purchaser or any corporation controlling such Purchaser
and the amount of such capital that is required or expected to be
maintained is increased by or based upon the Long Term Commitment of such
Purchaser under this Long Term Retail PSA or any participation agreement
entered into pursuant to subsection 9.6 of the Long Term RPA, as applicable
(such event, a "Change in Law"), such affected Purchaser shall notify the
Active Seller and the Agent within 90 days after such affected Purchaser
shall first be required to comply with such Change in Law. At the time of
such notification such affected Purchaser shall provide the Active Seller
with a written statement setting forth the amount that would adequately
compensate such affected Purchaser for the costs associated with its
compliance with such Change in Law and setting forth in reasonable detail
the assumptions upon which such affected Purchaser calculated such amount,
and a copy of the opinion of counsel referred to in the preceding sentence. 
Such affected Purchaser shall allocate to the Active Seller the costs
associated with such Change in Law in such a way that the proportion of (i)
such costs that are allocated to the Active Seller to (ii) the total of
such costs of such affected Purchaser associated with such Change in Law as
it relates to all commitments of such Purchaser to its customers of similar
creditworthiness as the Active Seller, is substantially the same as the
proportion of (i) the Long Term Commitment of such affected Purchaser under
this Long Term Retail PSA or such participation agreement to (ii) the total
of all commitments by such affected Purchaser to its customers of similar
creditworthiness as the Active Seller.

(ii) Upon the occurrence of any Change in Law, each Purchaser
whose Long Term Commitment hereunder is affected by such Change in Law
shall transfer its Commitment to another branch office (or, if such
Purchaser so elects, to an Affiliate) of such Purchaser, provided that such
transfer shall be made only if such Purchaser shall have determined in good
faith (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties) that, (i) on the basis of existing
circumstances, such transfer will avoid or reduce the additional payments
resulting from such Change in Law and will not result in any additional
costs, liabilities or expenses to such Purchaser (unless the Active Seller
agrees to pay such additional costs, liabilities or expenses of such
Purchaser) and (ii) such transfer is otherwise consistent with the
interests of such Purchaser.

(g) Taxes. (i) In the event that the adoption of any law,
regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, in each case after the date hereof,
shall require any Taxes (as hereinafter defined) to be withheld or deducted
from any amount payable to the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any
Purchaser under this Long Term Retail PSA, upon notice by such Person to
the Active Seller (with a copy to the Agent) to the effect that (A) as a
result of the adoption of such law, rule, regulation, treaty or directive
or a change therein or in the interpretation thereof, Taxes are being
withheld or deducted from amounts payable to such Person under this Long
Term Retail PSA and (B) such Purchaser has taken all action required to be
taken by it to avoid the imposition of such Taxes pursuant to clause (iii)
below prior to demanding indemnification under this clause (i), the Active
Seller will pay to the Agent for the account of such Person additional
amounts so that such additional amounts, together with amounts otherwise
payable under this Long Term Retail PSA, will yield to such Person, after
deduction from such increased amount of all Taxes required to be withheld
or deducted therefrom, the amount stated to be payable under this Long Term
Retail PSA. The term "Taxes" shall mean all net income, stamp or other
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings,
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any country (or by any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), excluding,
with respect to any Purchaser, net income and franchise taxes imposed with
respect to net income of any country (or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein) where such Person is organized or
where such Person's credit commitments are booked. If the Active Seller
fails to pay any Taxes when due following notification by the Agent, the
Administrative Agent or any Purchaser as provided above, the Active Seller
shall indemnify such Person for any incremental taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by any such Person as a result of any
such failure by the Active Seller to make such payment.

(ii) Each Purchaser that is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver
to the Active Seller and the Agent (A) two duly completed copies of United
States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 or successor applicable
form, as the case may be, and (B) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or
W-9 or successor form. Each such Purchaser also agrees to deliver to the
Active Seller and the Agent two further copies of the said Form 1001 or
4224 and Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable forms or other manner of
certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring
a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Active
Seller, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be
requested by the Active Seller or the Agent, unless in any such case an
event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or
regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which
would prevent such Purchaser from duly completing and delivering any such
form with respect to it and such Purchaser so advises the Active Seller and
the Agent. Such Purchaser shall certify (X) in the case of Form 1001 or
4224, that it is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes and (Y)
in the case of a Form W-8 or W-9, that it is entitled to an exemption from
United States backup withholding tax.

(iii) No Purchaser may request indemnification for any Taxes
from the Active Seller under clause (i) above to the extent that such Taxes
would have been avoided or reduced by such Purchaser's transfer of its
Commitments affected by such event to another office of such Purchaser (or
to an Affiliate of such Purchaser), by such Purchaser's properly claiming
the benefit of any exemption from or reduction of such Taxes (whether
provided by statute, treaty or otherwise), including, without limitation,
by delivering the forms required by clause (ii) above, or by such
Purchaser's taking any other action which in its judgment is reasonable to
avoid or reduce such Taxes, provided that such Purchaser shall not be
required to (A) take any action which in the reasonable judgment of such
Purchaser could directly or indirectly result in any increased cost or
expense or in any loss of opportunity to such Purchaser unless the Active
Seller shall have provided to such Purchaser indemnity or reimbursement
therefor in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Purchaser or
(B) claim or apply any tax credit against such Taxes.

(iv) Within 30 days after the payment by the Active Seller of
any income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions or withholdings, withheld or deducted from any amount payable to
the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser under this Long Term
Retail PSA and irrespective of whether such Person is entitled to demand
indemnification in respect thereof under clause (i) above, the Active
Seller will furnish to such Person (with a copy to the Agent), the original
or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

SECTION 11.4 Payment of Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The Servicer
agrees to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Agent for all
their reasonable and customary out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and any
amendment, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of, this Long Term
Retail PSA and any other document executed and delivered in connection
herewith, including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of
counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Agent.

(b) The Servicer agrees to pay, indemnify, and hold each
Purchaser, the Agent and the Administrative Agent harmless from and against
any and all actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of
any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery,
performance, administration or enforcement of this Long Term Retail PSA
(the "indemnified liabilities"), except with respect to indemnified
liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Person. The agreements in this subsection shall survive repayment of the
Senior Amount and all other amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 11.5 GOVERNING LAW. THIS LONG TERM RETAIL PSA SHALL BE
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THE
OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS, AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS LONG TERM
RETAIL PSA SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAW.

SECTION 11.6 Notices. All demands, notices, and communications
under this Long Term Retail PSA shall be delivered in accordance with
Section 9.2 of the Long Term RPA.

SECTION 11.7 Severability of Provisions. If any one or more of
the covenants, provisions or terms of this Long Term Retail PSA shall be
for any reason whatsoever held invalid, then such covenants, provisions or
terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, provisions or
terms of this Long Term Retail PSA, and shall in no way affect the validity
or enforceability of the other provisions of this Long Term Retail PSA or
of the Certificates or the rights of the Holders thereof.

SECTION 11.8 Intention of Parties. (a) The execution and
delivery of this Long Term Retail PSA shall constitute an acknowledgement
by the Sellers, the Agent, the Administrative Agent and each
Certificateholder that they do not intend to establish (for Federal tax
purposes) an association taxable as a corporation. The powers granted and
obligations undertaken in this Long Term Retail PSA shall be construed so
as to further such intent.

(b) It is the intent of the Sellers and the Purchasers that, for
federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes, the Senior
Certificates will be evidence of indebtedness of the Sellers secured by the
Pooled Property. Each Seller, by entering into this Long Term Retail PSA,
and each Purchaser by the acceptance of its Senior Certificate, agrees to
treat the Senior Certificates for federal, state and local income and
franchise tax purposes as indebtedness of the Sellers, except as otherwise
required by law or any tax authorities.

SECTION 11.9 Counterparts. For the purpose of facilitating the
execution of this Long Term Retail PSA and for other purposes, this Long
Term Retail PSA may be executed simultaneously in any number of
counterparts, each of which counterparts shall be deemed to be an original,
and all of which counterparts shall constitute but one and the same
instrument.

SECTION 11.10 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made herein shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Long Term Retail PSA and the Certificates.

SECTION 11.11 No Petition. Each of the Servicer, the Agent, the
Administrative Agent and each Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that
such Person shall not at any time institute against any Seller any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings, or other proceedings under any Federal or state bankruptcy or
similar law.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Long Term Retail

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Long Term Supplement, each
Initial Bank Series Certificateholder hereby severally agrees (i) to
purchase from the Trust on the Effective Date a Bank Series Certificate for
an amount equal to such Initial Bank Series Certificateholder's Commitment
Percentage of the Initial Aggregate Bank Invested Amount and (ii) to
maintain, in accordance with the provisions of this Long Term Supplement,
an interest in the Trust, subject to increase or decrease during the
Revolving Period, equal to such Bank Series Certificateholder's Commitment
Percentage of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Long Term
Supplement, each Purchasing Bank hereby severally agrees to maintain, in
accordance with the provisions of this Long Term Supplement, an interest in
the Trust, subject to increase or decrease during the Revolving Period,
equal to such Bank Series Certificateholder's Commitment Percentage of the
Aggregate Bank Invested Amount.

SECTION 3.2. Procedure for Increasing the Invested Amount. (a) 
Subject to subsection 2.3 of the Long Term RPA and subsections 3.2(b) and
13.2 hereof, on any Business Day during the Revolving Period, the Invested
Amount may be increased by increasing each Bank Series Certificateholder's
Bank Invested Amount (an "Increase"), up to an amount not exceeding such
Bank Series Certificateholder's Long Term Commitment, upon the request of
the Seller on behalf of the Trust (each date on which an increase in the
Invested Amount occurs hereunder being herein referred to as the "Increase
Date" applicable to such Increase); provided that the Servicer shall have
given the Administrative Agent irrevocable written notice (effective upon
receipt) of such request pursuant to subsection 2.3 of the Long Term RPA,
and provided, further, that no more than one Increase shall be made during
any calendar month.

(b) The Bank Series Certificateholders shall not increase their
respective Bank Invested Amounts on any Increase Date hereunder if:

(i) the Seller shall not have increased the Available
Subordinated Amount to an amount greater than or equal to the Required
Available Subordinated Amount (after giving effect to such Increase);

(ii) the related Increase Amount is less than $50,000,000;

(iii) after giving effect to the Increase, the Aggregate Invested
Amount would exceed the aggregate Long Term Commitments (determined as
of the date the notice of such Increase is given); 

(iv) an Early Amortization Event or an event which, with the
passage of time or the giving of notice, would be an Early
Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing;

(v) after giving effect to the Increase, the Aggregate Bank
Invested Amount would exceed the Wholesale Bank Series Certificate
Sublimit;

(vi) after giving effect to the Increase, the Required
Participation Amount would exceed the Pool Balance at such time;

(vii) the conditions precedent set forth in subsection 4.3 of the
Long Term RPA and subsection 13.2 hereof shall not have been
satisfied;

(viii) if such Increase takes place prior to the Distribution Date
occurring in the calendar month such Increase is made, the Seller
shall not have deposited in the Collection Account an amount (a
"Pre-Accrual Period Deposit") equal to the Daily Base Rate Interest
Expense estimated by the Administrative Agent to accrue with respect
to such Increase for the period from the date of such Increase to such
Distribution Date; or

(ix) any "Event of Default" under and as defined in the CFC
Revolving Credit Agreement has occurred and its continuing.

(c) Payment by the Bank Series Certificateholders in respect of
any Increase shall be made to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
subsection 2.3 of the Long Term RPA.

SECTION 3.3. Procedure for Decreasing the Invested Amount. On
any Distribution Date during the Revolving Period, upon request of the
Seller on behalf of the Trust, the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount may be
reduced (a "Decrease") by the distribution to the Administrative Agent on
behalf of the Bank Series Certificateholders of some or all of Available
Bank Principal Collections on such Distribution Date; provided that the
Servicer shall have given the Administrative Agent written notice
(effective upon receipt) prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City time) two
Business Days prior to the date of such Decrease stating the amount of such
Decrease and provided, further, that such Decrease shall be in an amount
equal to or greater than $25,000,000. The Available Subordinated Amount
shall simultaneously be reduced to an amount equal to the Required
Available Subordinated Amount after giving effect to such Decrease.

SECTION 3.4. Interest. Interest shall be payable on the Bank
Series Certificates on each Distribution Date pursuant to subsection 5.6. 
Calculations of per annum rates and fees under this Long Term Supplement
shall be made on the basis of (a) a 360-day year for actual days elapsed
with respect to interest payments calculated based on the LIBO Rate and (b)
a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for actual days elapsed with
respect to other interest payments and fees. Each determination of the
LIBO Rate hereunder by the Agent shall be conclusive and binding upon each
of the parties hereto in the absence of manifest error. Any change in
monthly interest payable hereunder resulting from a change in the Base Rate
shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which
such change is announced.

SECTION 3.5. Indemnification by Seller. The Seller hereby
agrees to pay, and to indemnify and hold harmless, the Administrative
Agent, the Agent, each Bank Series Certificateholder and the Trustee and
each officer, director and employee thereof from (a) all claims, disputes,
damages, penalties and losses arising from the Receivables or the
underlying collateral (including any product warranty-related claims, but
excluding credit losses), (b) any taxes which may at any time be asserted
in respect of this transaction or the subject matter thereof (including,
without limitation, any sales, gross receipts, general corporation,
personal property, privilege or license taxes, but not including taxes
imposed upon the Agent, the Administrative Agent, any such Bank Series
Certificateholder or the Trustee with respect to its income arising out of
this transaction and imposed in any jurisdiction) and (c) costs, expenses
and reasonable counsel fees in defending against the same, whether arising
by reason of the acts to be performed by the Seller or the Servicer
hereunder or imposed against the Agent, the Administrative Agent, any Bank
Series Certificateholder, the Trustee or any officer, director or employee
thereof, or the Seller, the property involved or otherwise. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Long Term Supplement to the contrary,
any amounts payable by the Seller pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be
paid by the Seller only to the extent of Excess Servicing available to the
Seller pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(ii).

SECTION 3.6. Pro Rata Payments. All payments to be made by the
Bank Series Certificateholders pursuant to this Long Term Supplement shall
be made by each Bank Series Certificateholder of record on such date, pro
rata, based upon the Commitment Percentage of such Bank Series
Certificateholder.

party to the Long Term RPA pursuant to subsection 2.9 thereof shall become
a Long Term Bank Series Certificateholder party hereto by executing a New
Bank Supplement in accordance with said subsection 2.9. Any Long Term Bank
Series Certificateholder which increases its Long Term Commitment pursuant
to subsection 2.9 of the Long Term RPA shall execute a Long Term Commitment
Increase Supplement in accordance with said subsection 2.9. Upon receipt
of a copy of any such Supplement, the Seller shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate, a Long Term Bank Series Certificate for such new Long
Term Bank Series Certificateholder or such Long Term Bank Series
Certificateholder which increases its Long Term Commitment, provided that
any Long Term Bank Series Certificateholder increasing its Long Term
Commitment shall surrender its Long Term Bank Series Certificate to the
Trustee or provide the Trustee with a certificate of a responsible officer
of such Long Term Bank Series Certificateholder that such Long Term Bank
Series Certificate has been stolen, lost or destroyed and provide the
Trustee with such security or indemnity as may be required by it to save it
harmless.

SECTION 4.1. Servicing Compensation. The monthly servicing fee
(the "Monthly Servicing Fee") shall be payable to the Servicer, in arrears,
on each Distribution Date in respect of any Collection Period (or portion
thereof) occurring prior to the earlier of the first Distribution Date

Invested Amount is zero, in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the product
of (a) the Servicing Fee Rate, (b) the Pool Balance as of the last day of

"Certificateholders Monthly Servicing Fee") shall be equal to one-twelfth
of the product of (a) the Servicing Fee Rate and (b) the Aggregate Bank
Invested Amount as of the last day of the Collection Period second
preceding such Distribution Date. The remainder of the Monthly Servicing
Fee shall be paid by the Seller and in no event shall the Trust, the
Trustee or the Bank Series Certificateholders be liable for the share of
the Monthly Servicing Fee to be paid by the Seller; and the remainder of
the Servicing Fee shall be paid by the Seller and the Investor
Certificateholders of other Series and the Bank Series Certificateholders
shall in no event be liable for the share of the Servicing Fee to be paid
by the Seller or the Investor Certificateholders of other Series. The
Certificateholders Monthly Servicing Fee shall be payable to the Servicer
solely to the extent amounts are available for distribution in accordance
with the terms of this Long Term Supplement.

ARTICLE V

Rights of Bank Series Certificateholders and
Allocation and Application of Collections

SECTION 5.1. Allocations; Payments to Seller; Excess Principal
Collections and Unallocated Principal Collections. (a) Collections of
Non-Principal Receivables and Principal Receivables, Miscellaneous Payments
and Defaulted Amounts allocated to Bank Series pursuant to Article IV of
the Wholesale PSA shall be allocated and distributed as set forth in this
Article.

(b) The Servicer shall instruct the Trustee to withdraw from the
Collection Account and pay to the Seller on the dates set forth below the
following amounts:

(i) on each Deposit Date:

(A) an amount equal to the Excess Seller's Percentage for
the related Collection Period of Allocable Non-Principal
Collections deposited in the Collection Account for such Deposit
Date; and

(B) an amount equal to the Excess Seller's Percentage for
the related Collection Period of Allocable Principal Collections
deposited in the Collection Account for such Deposit Date, if the
Seller's Participation Amount (determined after giving effect to
any Principal Receivables transferred to the Trust on such
Deposit Date) exceeds the Trust Available Subordinated Amount for
the immediately preceding Determination Date (after giving effect
to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be
made on the Distribution Date immediately following such
Determination Date); and

(ii) on each Deposit Date with respect to the Revolving Period,
an amount equal to the Available Seller's Principal Collections for
such Deposit Date, if the Seller's Participation Amount (determined
after giving effect to any Principal Receivables transferred to the
Trust on such Deposit Date) exceeds the Trust Available Subordinated
Amount for the immediately preceding Determination Date (after giving
effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to
be made on the Distribution Date immediately following such
Determination Date); provided, however, that Available Seller's
Principal Collections shall be paid to the Seller with respect to any
Collection Period only after an amount equal to the sum of (A) the
Deficiency Amount, if any, relating to the immediately preceding
Collection Period and (B) the excess, if any, of the Reserve Account
Required Amount over the amount in the Reserve Account on the
immediately preceding Distribution Date (after giving effect to the
allocations of, distributions from, and deposits in, the Reserve
Account on such Distribution Date), has been deposited in the
Collection Account for the benefit of the Bank Series from such
Available Seller's Principal Collections.

The withdrawals to be made from the Collection Account pursuant
to this Section 5.1(b) do not apply to deposits into the Collection Account
that do not represent Collections, including Miscellaneous Payments,
payment of the purchase price for the Certificateholders' Interest pursuant
to Section 2.03 of the Wholesale PSA, payment of the purchase price for the
Bank Series Certificateholders Interest pursuant to Section 9.1 of this
Long Term Supplement and proceeds from the sale, disposition or liquidation
of Receivables pursuant to Section 9.02 or 12.02 of the Wholesale PSA.

(c) The Servicer shall instruct the Trustee to withdraw from the
Collection Account and deposit into the Reserve Account on Deposit Dates
with respect to the Revolving Period Available Seller's Principal
Collections for such Deposit Date, up to the amount of the excess, if any,
determined pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ii)(B).

SECTION 5.2. Determination of Monthly Interest. (a)(i) The
amount of monthly interest ("Monthly Interest") with respect to the Bank
Series Certificates on any Distribution Date shall be an amount equal to
the sum of (A) with respect to that portion of the Aggregate Bank Invested
Amount allocated to the LIBO Tranche, an amount equal to the product of (I)
the number of days in the preceding Accrual Period divided by 360, (II) the
sum of the LIBO Rate applicable to the LIBO Tranche for the Accrual Period
with respect to such Distribution Date and the Eurodollar Margin, and (III)
the portion of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount allocable to the LIBO
Tranche as of the close of business on the preceding Distribution Date
(after giving effect to all distributions of Monthly Principal on such
preceding Distribution Date) and (B) with respect to that portion of the
Aggregate Bank Invested Amount not allocated to the LIBO Tranche, an amount
("Monthly Base Rate Interest") equal to the sum of each Daily Base Rate
Interest Expense determined by the Administrative Agent for each day of the
Accrual Period with respect to such Distribution Date, provided, however,
if any Increase shall be made during the period from and including the
first calendar day of any month to but excluding the Distribution Date
occurring during such month, the amount of Daily Base Rate Interest Expense
calculated with respect to such Increase during such period shall not be
included in the Monthly Interest determined for the Accrual Period with
respect to such Distribution Date, but instead shall be included in the
Monthly Interest determined for the Accrual Period with respect to the next
succeeding Distribution Date.

(ii) In the event the Base Rate changes during the period between
any Determination Date and the following Distribution Date and a portion of
the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount is not allocated to the LIBO Tranche,
the Servicer and the Administrative Agent shall cooperate on the date of
such change in modifying the Distribution Date Statement to reflect the
adjustment in the Monthly Interest for the then current Accrual Period
caused by such change and any consequent adjustments, including adjustment
to the Deficiency Amount, if any. Any such modification, including any
adjustment to the Deficiency Amount shall be completed by 10:00 a.m. on
such Distribution Date.

(b) On the Determination Date preceding each Distribution Date,
the Servicer shall determine the amount, if any (the "Interest Shortfall"),
by which (i) the Monthly Interest for the Accrual Period with respect to
such Distribution Date is greater than (ii) the amount which will be
available to be distributed to the Bank Series Certificateholders on such
Distribution Date in respect thereof pursuant to this Long Term Supplement. 
If the Interest Shortfall with respect to any Distribution Date is greater
than zero, an additional amount ("Additional Interest") equal to the
product of (A) the number of days in the related Accrual Period divided by
365 (or 366, as determined in accordance with subsection 3.4), (B) the
Default Rate and (C) such Interest Shortfall (or the portion thereof which
has not been paid to the Bank Series Certificateholders) shall be payable
as provided herein with respect to the Bank Series Certificates on each
Distribution Date following such Distribution Date to and including, the
Distribution Date on which such Interest Shortfall is paid to Bank Series
Certificateholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Additional Interest shall be payable or distributed to the Bank Series
Certificateholders only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

(c) On each Distribution Date the Seller may, subject to
subsection 5.2(d), elect to allocate or continue to allocate all or any
part of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount to the LIBO Tranche by giving
the Administrative Agent irrevocable written or telephonic (confirmed in
writing) notice thereof, which notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City time) three
Business Days prior to such Distribution Date. Such notice shall specify
(i) the applicable Distribution Date, (ii) the date of the succeeding
Distribution Date and (iii) the portion of the Aggregate Bank Invested
Amount being allocated to the LIBO Tranche. Promptly upon receipt of each
such notice the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank Series
Certificateholder of the contents thereof. If the Administrative Agent
shall not have received timely notice as aforesaid with respect to all or
any portion of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount, the Monthly Interest on
the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount for the succeeding Accrual Period shall
be calculated by reference to the Base Rate.

(d) Anything contained in this Section 5.2 to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) the portion of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount
allocable to the LIBO Tranche must be an amount equal to $50,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) after the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Early Amortization Event, the
Seller may not elect to allocate all or any portion of the Aggregate Bank
Invested Amount to the LIBO Tranche.

SECTION 5.3. Determination of Monthly Principal. The amount of
monthly principal ("Monthly Principal") distributable with respect to the
Bank Series Certificates on each Distribution Date with respect to an Early
Amortization Period shall be equal to the sum of (i) the Available Bank
Principal Collections with respect to such Distribution Date and (ii) the
Available Seller's Principal Collections allocated pursuant to subsection
5.7(d)(ii); provided, however, that Monthly Principal shall not exceed the
Aggregate Bank Invested Amount.

SECTION 5.4. Establishment of Reserve Account. The Servicer,
for the benefit of the Bank Series Certificateholders, shall cause to be
established and maintained in the name of the Trust an Eligible Deposit
Account (the "Reserve Account") bearing a designation clearly indicating
that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Bank
Series Certificateholders. On the Effective Date, the Seller shall cause
to be deposited in the Reserve Account the Initial Reserve Account Deposit
Amount. The Trustee shall possess all right, title and interest in all
funds from time to time on deposit in, and all Eligible Investments
credited to, the Reserve Account and in all proceeds thereof. The Reserve
Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of the Trustee for the
benefit of the Bank Series Certificateholders. If, at any time, the
Reserve Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, the Servicer
shall establish a substitute Eligible Deposit Account as the Reserve
Account, transfer any cash and/or any Eligible Investments to such new
Reserve Account and from the date any such substitute account is
established, such account shall be the "Reserve Account". Neither the
Seller nor the Servicer, nor any person or entity claiming by, through or
under the Seller or Servicer, shall have any right, title or interest in,
or any right to withdraw any amount from, the Reserve Account, except as
expressly provided herein. Pursuant to the authority granted to the
Servicer in Section 3.01 of the Wholesale PSA, the Servicer shall have the
power, revocable by the Trustee, to instruct the Trustee to make
withdrawals and payments from the Reserve Account for the purposes of
carrying out the Servicer's or the Trustee's duties specified in the
Wholesale PSA and this Long Term Supplement.

All Eligible Investments in the Reserve Account shall be held by
the Trustee for the benefit of the Bank Series Certificateholders. Funds
on deposit in the Reserve Account shall at the direction of the Servicer be
invested by the Trustee solely in Eligible Investments that will mature so
that such funds will be available at the close of business on or before the
Business Day next preceding the following Distribution Date (or on or
before 10:00 a.m. on such following Distribution Date in the case of
Eligible Investments in respect of which the Trustee is the obligor). As
of each Determination Date, all interest and other investment earnings (net
of losses and investment expenses) on funds on deposit in the Reserve
Account received with respect to such Determination Date shall be credited
to the Collection Account for the benefit of the Bank Series (together with
earnings on the Pre-Accrual Period Deposit and an amount equal to the Bank
Series Allocation Percentage of the interest and other investment earnings
on funds held in the Collection Account credited to the Collection Account
pursuant to Section 4.02 of the Wholesale PSA with respect to such
Determination Date, "Investment Proceeds"). Schedule 1, which is hereby
incorporated into and made part of this Long Term Supplement, identifies
the Reserve Account by setting forth the account number of such account,
the account designation of such account and the name of the institution

Account is established pursuant to this Section, the Servicer shall provide
to the Trustee an amended Schedule 1, setting forth the relevant
information for such substitute Reserve Account.

SECTION 5.5. Deficiency Amount. With respect to each
Distribution Date, on the related Determination Date, the Servicer shall

Certificateholders on a prior Distribution Date, (iii) Additional Interest,
if any, for such Distribution Date and any Additional Interest previously

sum of (i) Bank Non-Principal Collections and Available Seller
Non-Principal Collections deposited in the Collection Account during the
Collection Period preceding such Distribution Date plus any Investment
Proceeds plus any Pre-Accrual Period Deposit made during the Accrual Period
preceding the Accrual Period with respect to such Distribution Date plus
(ii) the amount of funds in the Reserve Account which are available
pursuant to Section 5.7(a) to cover any portion of the Deficiency Amount. 
The lesser of the Deficiency Amount and the Available Subordinated Amount
on the related Determination Date shall be the "Required Subordination Draw
Amount".

SECTION 5.6. Application of Bank Non-Principal Collections,
Available Seller Non-Principal Collections, and Available Bank Principal
Collections. The Servicer shall cause the Trustee to apply, on each
Distribution Date, Bank Non-Principal Collections, Available Seller
Non-Principal Collections, Investment Proceeds and Available Bank Principal
Collections to make the following distributions:

(a) On each Distribution Date, an amount equal to the sum of
Bank Non-Principal Collections, Available Seller Non-Principal
Collections and any Investment Proceeds will with respect to the
preceding Collection Period and any Pre-Accrual Period Deposit made
during the Accrual Period preceding the Accrual Period with respect to
such Distribution Date be distributed in the following priority:

(i) an amount equal to Monthly Interest for such
Distribution Date, plus the amount of any Monthly Interest
previously due but not distributed to the Bank Series
Certificateholders on a prior Distribution Date, plus the amount
of any Additional Interest for such Distribution Date and any
Additional Interest previously due but not distributed to the
Bank Series Certificateholders on a prior Distribution Date,
shall be distributed to the Bank Series Certificateholders;

(ii) an amount equal to the Certificateholders Monthly
Servicing Fee for such Distribution Date shall be distributed to
the Servicer;

(iii) an amount equal to the Investor Default Amount for such
Distribution Date shall be treated as a portion of Bank Principal
Collections for such Distribution Date;

(iv) an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Investor
Charge-Offs which have not previously been reimbursed shall be
treated as a portion of Bank Principal Collections for such
Distribution Date;

(v) an amount equal to the sum of (A) Section 8 Costs for
such Distribution Date and (B) any Section 8 Costs not paid on
any preceding Distribution Date shall be paid to the Agent for
the account of the applicable Bank Series Certificateholders; and

(vi) the balance, if any, shall constitute Excess Servicing
and shall be allocated and distributed as set forth in Section
5.9.

(b) (i) On each Distribution Date during the Revolving Period
with respect to which the Seller has notified the Administrative Agent
a Decrease will occur, an amount of Available Bank Principal
Collections deposited in the Collection Account for the related
Collection Period equal to such Decrease will be distributed to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Bank Series
Certificateholders. The Aggregate Bank Invested Amount shall be
reduced by the amount of Available Bank Principal Collections so
distributed. Any such remaining Available Bank Principal Collections
shall be treated as Excess Principal Collections and applied in
accordance with Section 4.04 of the Wholesale PSA.

(ii) On each Distribution Date during the Revolving Period
with respect to which the Servicer has not notified the Administrative
Agent it will be making a Decrease, an amount equal to Available Bank
Principal Collections deposited in the Collection Account for the
related Collection Period shall be treated as Excess Principal
Collections and applied in accordance with Section 4.04 of the
Wholesale PSA.

(c) On each Distribution Date with respect to an Early
Amortization Period, an amount equal to the sum of (i) Available Bank
Principal Collections and (ii) Available Seller's Principal
Collections allocated pursuant to subsection 5.7(d)(ii) will be
distributed in the following priority: (i) an amount equal to Monthly
Principal for such Distribution Date shall be distributed to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Bank Series
Certificateholders and (ii) after giving effect to the distribution
referred to in clause (i), an amount equal to the balance, if any, of
such Available Bank Principal Collections shall be treated as Excess
Principal Collections and applied in accordance with Section 4.04 of
the Wholesale PSA.

SECTION 5.7. Application of Reserve Account and Available
Subordinated Amount. (a) If the portion of Bank Non-Principal
Collections, Available Seller's Non-Principal Collections, any Pre-Accrual
Period Deposit and Investment Proceeds allocated to the Bank Series
Certificateholders on any Distribution Date pursuant to Section 5.6(a) is
not sufficient to make the entire distributions required on such
Distribution Date by Section 5.6(a)(i) through (v), the Servicer shall
cause the Trustee to withdraw funds from the Reserve Account to the extent
available therein, and apply such funds to complete the distributions
pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(i) through (v).

(b) If there is a Required Subordination Draw Amount for such
Distribution Date, the Servicer shall apply or cause the Trustee to apply
the Available Seller's Principal Collections on deposit in the Collection
Account on such Distribution Date, but only up to the amount of the
Required Subordination Draw Amount, to make the distributions required by
Section 5.6(a)(i) through (v) that have not been made through the
application of funds from the Reserve Account in accordance with the
preceding paragraph. Any such Available Seller's Principal Collections
remaining after the application thereof pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall be treated as a portion of Bank Principal Collections for such
Distribution Date, but only up to the amount of unpaid Adjustment Payments
allocated to the Bank Series as described in Section 5.5(a)(vii). The
amount of the Available Seller's Principal Collections applied in
accordance with the two preceding sentences shall reduce the Available
Subordinated Amount as described in clause (c) of the definition thereof. 
If the Required Subordination Draw Amount exceeds Available Seller's
Principal Collections for such Distribution Date, the Available
Subordinated Amount shall be further reduced by the amount of such excess,
but not by more than the sum of (x) the Investor Default Amount and (y) the
amount of unpaid Adjustment Payments allocated to the Bank Series as
described in Section 5.5(a)(vii).

(c) If, after giving effect to the allocations of, distributions
from, and deposits in, the Reserve Account made pursuant to Section 13.2,
Sections 5.1(c), 5.4, and Section 5.7(a) and (d), (i) during the Revolving
Period, the amount in the Reserve Account is greater than the Reserve
Account Required Amount for the related Distribution Date, the Servicer
shall cause the Trustee to distribute such excess amount to the Seller;
provided that the Seller's Participation Amount (determined after giving
effect to any Principal Receivables transferred to the Trust on such
Distribution Date) exceeds the Trust Available Subordinated Amount for the
immediately preceding Determination Date or (ii) the amount in the Reserve
Account is less than such Reserve Account Required Amount, then the Trustee
shall deposit any remaining Available Seller's Principal Collections on
deposit in the Collection Account for such Distribution Date into the
Reserve Account until either (x) the amount in the Reserve Account is equal
to such Reserve Account Required Amount (and the Available Subordinated
Amount shall be reduced by the amount of Available Seller's Principal
Collections so applied) or (y) the Available Subordinated Amount shall have
been reduced to the Required Available Subordinated Amount. On the
Termination Date, any funds in the Reserve Account will be treated as
Available Bank Principal Collections. After the earlier of the payment in
full of the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount and the Termination Date, any
funds remaining on deposit in the Reserve Account shall be paid to the
Seller.

(d) The balance of Available Seller's Principal Collections on
any Distribution Date, after giving effect to any distributions thereof
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 5.7 shall (i) during the
Revolving Period, be distributed to the Seller; provided that the Seller's
Participation Amount (determined after giving effect to any Principal
Receivables transferred to the Trust on such Distribution Date) exceeds the
Trust Available Subordinated Amount for the immediately preceding
Determination Date and (ii) during an Early Amortization Period, be treated
as a portion of Bank Principal Collections and distributed pursuant to
Section 5.6(c).

SECTION 5.8. Investor Charge-offs. If, on any Distribution Date
on which the Available Subordinated Amount on the preceding Determination
Date (after giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals
and deposits to be made on such Distribution Date) is zero and the
Deficiency Amount for such Distribution Date is greater than zero, the
Aggregate Bank Invested Amount shall be reduced by the amount of the excess
of such Deficiency Amount over any remaining Available Subordinated Amount
on such Determination Date, but not by more than the Investor Default
Amount. Investor Charge-Offs shall thereafter be reimbursed and the
Aggregate Bank Invested Amount increased (but not by an amount in excess of
the aggregate Investor Charge-Offs) on any Distribution Date by the sum of
(a) Allocable Miscellaneous Payments with respect to such Distribution Date
and (b) any amounts allocated and available for that purpose pursuant to
Section 5.6(a)(iv).

SECTION 5.9. Excess Servicing. The Servicer shall cause the
Trustee to apply, on each Distribution Date, Excess Servicing with respect
to such Distribution Date, to make the following distributions in the
following priority:

(a) an amount equal to the Reserve Account Deposit Amount (after
giving effect to any application of Available Seller's Principal
Collections pursuant to Section 5.7(b)) for such Distribution Date
shall be deposited in the Reserve Account; and

(b) the balance, if any, (i) for any Distribution Date during an
Early Amortization Period, shall be treated as a portion of Bank
Principal Collections and (ii) for any Distribution Date during the
Revolving Period, shall be distributed to the Seller.

SECTION 5.10. Excess Principal Collections. That portion of
Excess Principal Collections for any Distribution Date equal to the amount
of Bank Series Allocable Excess Principal Collections for such Distribution
Date will be allocated to the Bank Series and will be distributed as set
forth in this Long Term Supplement.

ARTICLE VI

SECTION 6.1. Distributions. (a) On each Distribution Date with
respect to a Collection Period during which the Aggregate Bank Invested
Amount was greater than zero at any time, at the direction of the Servicer
the Trustee shall distribute to the Administrative Agent on behalf of each
Bank Series Certificateholder of record on the preceding Record Date (other
than as provided in Section 12.02 of the Wholesale PSA respecting a final
distribution) all amounts specified in Article V and promptly thereafter
the Administrative Agent shall make available to each Bank Series
Certificateholder pursuant to subsection 2.7 of the Long Term RPA an amount
equal to the product of (i) the amount to be distributed to the Bank Series
Certificateholders pursuant to Article V and (ii) such Bank Series
Certificateholder's Commitment Percentage. 

(b) All allocations and distributions hereunder shall be in
accordance with the Distribution Date Statement delivered by the Servicer
to the Trustee pursuant to subsection 6.3 and shall be made in lawful money
of the United States and in immediately available funds.

(c) The final distribution on the Bank Series Certificates will
be made only upon presentation and surrender of the Bank Series
Certificates by the Administrative Agent to the Trustee. Each Bank Series
Certificateholder agrees to deliver, on or prior to the scheduled date of
such distribution, its Bank Series Certificate to the Administrative Agent
for presentation and surrender to the Trustee pursuant to the preceding
sentence.

SECTION 6.2. Daily Reports. On each Business Day when the
Aggregate Bank Invested Amount is greater than zero, the Servicer shall
provide the Administrative Agent and the Trustee with a Daily Report. The
Administrative Agent shall make copies of the Daily Report available to the
Bank Series Certificateholders at their reasonable request at the
Administrative Agent's office in New York City.

SECTION 6.3. Periodic Reports. (a) Distribution Date
Statements. On each Determination Date with respect to a Collection Period
during which the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount was greater than zero at
any time, the Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee and the Administrative
Agent a Distribution Date Statement. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely
on each Distribution Date Statement to determine the Aggregate Bank
Invested Amount. The Administrative Agent shall forward a copy of each
such Distribution Date Statement to any Bank Series Certificateholder upon
request by such Bank Series Certificateholder.

(b) Monthly Certificateholders' Statement. On each Distribution
Date with respect to a Collection Period during which the Aggregate Bank
Invested Amount was greater than zero at any time, the Servicer shall
deliver to the Trustee and the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative
Agent shall forward to each Bank Series Certificateholder, a Monthly
Certificateholders' Statement.

(c) Annual Certificateholders' Tax Statement. On or before
January 31 of each calendar year (or such earlier date as required by
applicable law) following a calendar year during which the Aggregate Bank
Invested Amount was greater than zero at any time, the Servicer on behalf
of the Trustee shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to each Person who
at any time during the preceding calendar year was a Bank Series
Certificateholder, a statement prepared by the Servicer containing the
aggregate amount distributed to such Person for such calendar year or the
applicable portion thereof during which such Person was a Bank Series
Certificateholder, together with such other information as is required to
be provided by an issuer of indebtedness under the Internal Revenue Code
and such other customary information as the Trustee or the Servicer deems
necessary or desirable to enable the Bank Series Certificateholders to
prepare their tax returns. Such obligation of the Servicer shall be deemed
to have been satisfied to the extent that substantially comparable
information shall be provided by the Trustee pursuant to any requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code as from time to time in effect.

(d) Early Amortization Period Notices. Upon the occurrence of
an Early Amortization Event, the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may
be, shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Trustee and the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof
to each Bank Series Certificateholder. In addition, the Servicer shall
give the Administrative Agent written notice of the occurrence and nature
of an Early Amortization Event with respect to any other series which is
not an Early Amortization Event with respect to the Bank Series.

ARTICLE VII

Additional Early Amortization Events

SECTION 7.1. Additional Early Amortization Events.
The occurrence of any of the following events shall, immediately upon the
occurrence thereof without notice or other action on the part of the
Trustee or the Bank Series Certificateholders, be deemed to be an Early
Amortization Event solely with respect to Bank Series:

(a) on any Determination Date, the ratio of (i) the aggregate
Allocable Defaulted Amount for the three preceding Collection Periods
to (ii) the aggregate Allocable Principal Collections deposited in the
Collection Account for the three preceding Collection Periods exceeds

(b) on any Determination Date, the Available Subordinated Amount
(after giving effect to all reductions with respect thereto on the
related Distribution Date) will be reduced to less than the Required
Available Subordinated Amount;

(c) any Service Default with respect to the Bank Series occurs;

(d) on any Determination Date, as of the last day of the
Collection Period with respect thereto, the aggregate amount of
Principal Receivables relating to used Vehicles exceeds 20% of the

(e) on any six consecutive Distribution Dates any Interest
Coverage Shortfall exists;

(f) failure on the part of the Seller, the Servicer or CCC, as
applicable, to deliver any Daily Report or Monthly Certificateholders'

the Reserve Account is less than the Reserve Account Trigger Amount;

(h) on any Determination Date, the average of the Monthly
Payment Rates for the two preceding Collection Periods is less than
20%; and

Commitments shall terminate.

SECTION 7.2. Notice of Early Amortization Event. The Trustee

Amortization Event unless the Trustee shall have received written notice
describing such Early Amortization Event and stating that such notice is a
"notice of Early Amortization Event."

ARTICLE VIII

Change In Circumstances

SECTION 8.1. Reemployment Costs. The Seller agrees to indemnify
each Bank Series Certificateholder and to hold each Bank Series
Certificateholder harmless from any loss or expense, including any such
loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by such Bank Series
Certificateholder to lenders of funds obtained by it to purchase or
maintain that portion of its Bank Invested Amount hereunder with respect to
which Monthly Interest is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate as a
consequence of (a) default by the Seller in the performance of its
obligations hereunder or under the Wholesale PSA, (b) the occurrence of a
Service Default or an event which would, with the giving of notice or the
passage of time, constitute a Service Default, (c) the occurrence of an
event referred to in Section 8.2 or 8.3, (d) default by the Seller in
selling an Increase in the Aggregate Bank Invested Amount on an Increase
Date after having given notice of such Increase, or (e) any reduction of
the LIBO Tranche prior to the termination of the Accrual Period for such
LIBO Tranche. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant
to the foregoing sentence submitted by any Bank Series Certificateholder to
the Seller shall be conclusive absent manifest error. This covenant shall
survive termination of this Long Term Supplement and the Wholesale PSA. 

SECTION 8.2. Inability to Determine LIBO Rate. In the event
that (a) the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Bank Series Certificateholders) that quotations of
interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of
"LIBO Rate" are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the
relevant maturities for the purposes of determining rates of interest for
the LIBO Tranche hereunder as provided herein, or (b) the Required Bank
Series Certificateholders determine (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Bank Series Certificateholders) and shall
notify the Agent that the rates of interest referred to in the definition
of "LIBO Rate" as the basis upon which the rate of interest for the LIBO
Tranche hereunder is to be determined do not adequately cover the cost to
the Bank Series Certificateholders of making or maintaining their
investments in Bank Series Certificates at such time as any of the
Aggregate Bank Invested Amount is allocated to the LIBO Tranche, the Agent
shall forthwith give telex or telecopy notice of such determination,
confirmed in writing, to the Seller and the Trustee, whereupon until the
Agent notifies the Seller and the Trustee that the circumstances giving
rise to such notice no longer exist, none of the Aggregate Bank Invested
Amount shall be allocated to the LIBO Tranche.

SECTION 8.3. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision
herein, if any law, regulation, treaty or directive , or any change therein
or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for
any Bank Series Certificateholder to purchase or maintain its interest in
its Bank Series Certificate in any LIBO Tranche and such Bank Series
Certificateholder shall notify the Administrative Agent, the Agent, the
Trustee and the Seller, then interest payable in respect of the portion of
each LIBO Tranche applicable to such Bank Series Certificateholder shall
thereafter be calculated by reference to the Base Rate. If any such change
in the method of calculating interest occurs on a day which is not the last
day of the Accrual Period with respect to any LIBO Tranche, the Seller
shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank Series
Certificateholder the amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to
Section 8.1.

SECTION 8.4. Increased Costs. (a) In the event that any law,
regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Bank Series
Certificateholder with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority enacted
or made subsequent to the date hereof:

(A) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank Series
Certificateholder; or

(B) does or shall impose on such Bank Series Certificateholder
any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank
Series Certificateholder of purchasing or maintaining its portion of the
Bank Series Certificateholders' Interest hereunder (such increase in cost,
"Increased Costs"), then, in any such case, the Seller shall promptly pay
to the Agent for the account of such Bank Series Certificateholder, upon
the written demand of such Bank Series Certificateholder to the Seller
(with a copy to the Agent), so long as such Increased Costs are not
otherwise included in the amounts required to be paid to such Bank Series
Certificateholder pursuant to any other paragraph under this Section 8, any
additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank Series
Certificateholder for such Increased Costs which such Bank Series
Certificateholder deems to be material as determined by such Bank Series
Certificateholder. If a Bank Series Certificateholder becomes entitled to
claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 8.4, it shall
promptly notify the Seller, through the Agent, of the event by reason of
which it has become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional
amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by a Bank
Series Certificateholder, through the Agent, to the Seller shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(b) Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in
subsections 8.3 or 8.4(a), each Bank Series Certificateholder whose Long
Term Commitments are affected by any such event agrees that it will
transfer such Long Term Commitments affected by any such event to another
branch office (or, if such Bank Series Certificateholder so elects, to an
Affiliate) of such Bank Series Certificateholder, provided that such
transfer shall be made only if such Bank Series Certificateholder shall
have determined in good faith (which determination shall, absent manifest
error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) that, (a) on the
basis of then existing circumstances, such transfer will avoid such events
and will not result in any additional costs, liabilities or expenses to
such Bank Series Certificateholder, to the Seller or to the Trust and (b)
such transfer is otherwise consistent with the interests of such Bank
Series Certificateholder.

SECTION 8.5. Changes in Capital Requirements. (i) In the event
that, in the opinion of counsel for any Bank Series Certificateholder
(which may, in the discretion of such Bank Series Certificateholder, be
such Bank Series Certificateholder's internal counsel), compliance with any
law, rule, regulation or guideline, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Bank Series
Certificateholder with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) from any central bank or Governmental Authority enacted or
made subsequent to the date hereof shall affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by such Bank Series Certificateholder
or any corporation controlling such Bank Series Certificateholder and the
amount of such capital that is required or expected to be maintained is
increased by or based upon the Long Term Commitments of such Bank Series
Certificateholder under this Long Term Supplement or the Wholesale PSA or
any participation agreement entered into pursuant to subsection 9.6 of the
Long Term RPA, as applicable (such event, a "Change in Law"), such affected
Bank Series Certificateholder shall notify the Seller and the Agent within
90 days after such affected Bank Series Certificateholder shall first be
required to comply with such Change in Law. At the time of such
notification such affected Bank Series Certificateholder shall provide the
Seller with a written statement setting forth the amount that would
adequately compensate such affected Bank Series Certificateholder for the
costs associated with its compliance with such Change in Law and setting
forth in reasonable detail the assumptions upon which such affected Bank
Series Certificateholder calculated such amount, and a copy of the opinion
of counsel referred to in the preceding sentence. Such affected Bank
Series Certificateholder shall allocate to the Seller the costs associated
with such Change in Law in such a way that the proportion of (i) such costs
that are allocated to the Seller to (ii) the total of such costs of such
affected Bank Series Certificateholder associated with such Change in Law
as it relates to all commitments of such Bank Series Certificateholder to
its customers of similar creditworthiness as the Seller, is substantially
the same as the proportion of (i) the aggregate Long Term Commitments of
such affected Bank Series Certificateholder under this Long Term Supplement
or the Wholesale PSA or such participation agreement to (ii) the total of
all commitments by such affected Bank Series Certificateholder to its
customers of similar creditworthiness as the Seller. 

(ii) Upon the occurrence of any Change in Law, each Bank Series
Certificateholder whose Long Term Commitment hereunder is affected by such
Change in Law shall transfer its Long Term Commitment to another branch
office (or, if such Bank Series Certificateholder so elects, to an
Affiliate) of such Bank Series Certificateholder, provided that such
transfer shall be made only if such Bank Series Certificateholder shall
have determined in good faith (which determination shall, absent manifest
error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) that, (i) on the
basis of then existing circumstances, such transfer will avoid or reduce
the additional payments resulting from such Change in Law and will not
result in any additional costs, liabilities or expenses to such Bank Series
Certificateholder (unless the Seller agrees to pay such additional costs,
liabilities or expenses of such Bank Series Certificateholder), the Seller
or the Trust and (ii) such transfer is otherwise consistent with the
interests of such Bank Series Certificateholder.

SECTION 8.6. Taxes. (a) In the event that the adoption of any
law, regulation, treaty or directive or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, in each case after the date hereof,
shall require any Taxes (as hereinafter defined) to be withheld or deducted
from any amount payable to the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Bank
Series Certificateholder under this Wholesale PSA, upon notice by such
Person to the Seller (with a copy to the Agent) to the effect that (i) as a
result of the adoption of such law, rule, regulation, treaty or directive
or a change therein or in the interpretation thereof, Taxes are being
withheld or deducted from amounts payable to such Person under this
Wholesale PSA and (ii) such Bank Series Certificateholder has taken all
action required to be taken by it to avoid the imposition of such Taxes
pursuant to clause (c) below prior to demanding indemnification under this
clause (a), the Seller will pay to the Agent for the account of such Person
additional amounts so that such additional amounts, together with amounts
otherwise payable under this Wholesale PSA, will yield to such Person,
after deduction from such increased amount of all Taxes required to be
withheld or deducted therefrom, the amount stated to be payable under this
Wholesale PSA. The term "Taxes" shall mean all net income, stamp or other
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings,
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any country (or by any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), excluding,
with respect to any Bank Series Certificateholder, net income and franchise
taxes imposed with respect to net income by any country (or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) where such Person is
organized or where such Person's credit commitments are booked. If the
Seller fails to pay any Taxes when due following notification by the Agent,
the Administrative Agent or any Bank Series Certificateholder as provided
above, the Seller shall indemnify such Person for any incremental taxes,
interest or penalties that may become payable by any such Person as a
result of any such failure by the Seller to make such payment.

(b) Each Bank Series Certificateholder that is not incorporated
under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees
that it will deliver to the Seller and the Agent (i) two duly completed
copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 or
successor applicable form, as the case may be, and (ii) an Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor form. Each such Bank Series
Certificateholder also agrees to deliver to the Seller and the Agent two
further copies of the said Form 1001 or 4224 and Form W-8 or W-9, or
successor applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case
may be, on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes
obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the
most recent form previously delivered by it to the Seller, and such
extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Seller
or the Agent, unless in any such case an event (including any change in
treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such
delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank Series Certificateholder from
duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such
Bank Series Certificateholder so advises the Seller and the Agent. Such
Bank Series Certificateholder shall certify (i) in the case of Form 1001 or
4224, that it is entitled to receive payments under this Wholesale PSA
without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes
and (ii) in the case of a Form W-8 or W-9, that it is entitled to an
exemption from United States backup withholding tax.

(c) No Bank Series Certificateholder may request indemnification
for any Taxes from the Seller under clause (a) above to the extent that
such Taxes would have been avoided or reduced by such Bank Series
Certificateholder's transfer of its Long Term Commitments affected by such
event to another office of such Bank Series Certificateholder (or to an
Affiliate of such Bank Series Certificateholder), by such Bank Series
Certificateholder's properly claiming the benefit of any exemption from or
reduction of such Taxes (whether provided by statute, treaty or otherwise),
including by delivering the forms required by clause (b) above, or by such
Bank Series Certificateholder's taking any other action which in its
judgment is reasonable to avoid or reduce such Taxes, provided that such
Bank Series Certificateholder shall not be required to (i) take any action
which in the reasonable judgment of such Bank Series Certificateholder
could directly or indirectly result in any increased cost or expense or in
any loss of opportunity to such Bank Series Certificateholder unless the
Seller shall have provided to such Bank Series Certificateholder indemnity
or reimbursement therefor in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
such Bank Series Certificateholder or (ii) claim or apply any tax credit
against such Taxes.

(d) Within 30 days after the payment by the Seller of any
income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions or withholdings, withheld or deducted from any amount payable to
the Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Bank Series Certificateholder
under this Wholesale PSA and irrespective of whether such Person is
entitled to demand indemnification in respect thereof under clause (a)
above, the Seller will furnish to such Person (with a copy to the Agent),
the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

SECTION 8.7. Section 8 Costs. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Long Term Supplement to the contrary, Section 8 Costs shall be paid by
the Seller only to the extent of funds available therefor pursuant to
subsection 5.6(a)(v).

ARTICLE IX

Optional Repurchase

SECTION 9.1. Optional Repurchase. (a) On any Distribution Date
occurring during an Early Amortization Period on which the Aggregate Bank
Invested Amount on such date is less than or equal to 10% of the Aggregate
Bank Invested Amount as of the last day of the Revolving Period, the Seller
shall have the option to purchase the entire Bank Series
Certificateholders' Interest, at a purchase price equal to the Reassignment

ARTICLE II - AMOUNT AND TERMS OF COMMITMENTS

2.1 Replacement. Upon the Replacement Effective Date, the 1993
Commitments shall be terminated. If any 1993 Short-Term Carried-Over
Invested Amount is then outstanding and the 1993 Related Documents are not
terminated pursuant to the 1993 Termination Agreement, such 1993 Short-Term
Carried-Over Invested Amount shall remain outstanding under and pursuant to
the 1993 RPA and the 1993 Related Documents, provided that, as set forth in
the definitions of 1993 Short-Term Carried-Over Invested Amount and
Aggregate 1994 Invested Amount, such 1993 Short-Term Carried-Over Invested
Amount shall be credited to reduce the Banks' obligations to make Purchases
hereunder.

2.2 Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
during the Commitment Period each Bank severally agrees to purchase from
the Retail Seller, Retail Obligations (each such purchase, a "Retail
Purchase") and to purchase from the Wholesale Sellers undivided ownership
interests in Wholesale Pooled Property (each such purchase, a "Wholesale
Purchase") in amounts such that at any one time such Bank's Purchase
Percentage of the Short-Term Aggregate Invested Amount shall not exceed
such Bank's Commitment Amount.

2.3 Related Documents. 

(a) Short-Term Retail PSA. Retail Purchases hereunder shall be
made pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Short-Term Retail PSA.

(b) Short-Term Wholesale Series Supplement. Wholesale Purchases

Term Wholesale Series Supplement, and each Bank's undivided ownership
interests in the Wholesale Pooled Property shall be evidenced by a Short-
Term Wholesale Certificate issued to such Bank pursuant to the Wholesale
PSA and the Short-Term Wholesale Series Supplement.

2.4 Procedure for Purchase. 

(a) Seller Procedure. The Sellers may utilize the Commitments
during the Commitment Period on any Business Day, provided that:

(i) Notice. CCCL shall give the Agent irrevocable notice
in the form of, and containing the particulars set out
in, Schedule 2.4 hereto (which notice must be received
by the Agent prior to 10:00 a.m., Toronto time, at
least five Business Days prior to the requested
Purchase Date); and

(ii) Minimum Purchase Amount. On each Purchase Date, the
Purchases under the Commitments will be in an aggregate
amount equal to at least $5,000,000 in respect of a
Retail Purchase and $10,000,000 in respect of a
Wholesale Purchase. 

(b) Agent/Bank Deposit Procedure. Upon receipt of any such
notice from CCCL, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each
Bank shall deposit in the Clearing Account an amount in immediately
available funds equal to the amount of the Purchase Price or portion
thereof required to be paid by it in respect of such Purchase prior to
11:00 a.m., Toronto time, on the Purchase Date requested. The Agent shall
cause all such amounts to be withdrawn from the Clearing Account and shall
make the aggregate amount so withdrawn available to the Seller by
depositing the proceeds thereof in the account of the Seller with the
Agent.

2.5 Utilization Fee. CCCL agrees to pay to the Agent for the
account of each Bank an additional fee (the "Utilization Fee") in respect
of each month during which Utilization exceeds 33-1/3%, from and including
the Replacement Effective Date to but excluding the later of (i) the
Commitment Termination Date and (ii) the date on which the Short-Term
Aggregate Invested Amount is zero (such later date, the "Final Date"). The
Utilization Fee shall be payable monthly in arrears on (a) the first
Business Day of each calendar month (or portion thereof) and (b) on the
Final Date (for the period ended on such date for which no payment has been
received pursuant to clause (a) above) (each such month or period, a
"Utilization Period"). The Utilization Fee for each Utilization Period
shall be equal to the product of (x) the average daily Short-Term Aggregate
Invested Amount during such Utilization Period, (y) an annual rate equal to
.125% and (z) a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of
days elapsed in the Utilization Period and the denominator of which is 365
(or 366, in leap years). 

2.6 Facility Fee. The Seller shall pay to the Agent for the
account of each Bank, a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") for each day from
and including the Replacement Effective Date to but excluding the Final
Date. Such Facility Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on (a) the
first Business Day of each of January, April, July and October (for the
three-month period (or portion thereof) ended on the last day of the
immediately preceding month) and (b) on the Final Date (for the period
ended on such date for which no payment has been received pursuant to
clause (a) above) (each such period, a "Fee Period"). The Facility Fee for
each Fee Period shall be an amount equal to the product of (x) the average
daily Short-Term Commitment Amount during such Fee Period, (y) an annual
rate equal to the Short-Term Facility Fee Percentage, and (z) a fraction
the numerator of which is the actual number of days elapsed in the Fee
Period and the denominator of which is 365 (or 366, in leap years).

immediately terminate without notice of any kind, which is hereby waived by
the CCCL Parties and (B) if such event is any other event specified in this
Article, so long as such event shall be continuing, the Agent may, with the
consent of the Required Banks, or the Agent shall, upon the request of the
Required Banks, declare by notice to CCCL that the Commitments are
terminated forthwith, whereupon the Commitments shall immediately
terminate.

ARTICLE VIII - THE AGENT

8.1 Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints Royal as the agent of such Bank under this Short-Term RPA and the
Related Documents and each such Bank irrevocably authorizes Royal, as the
agent for such Bank to take such action on its behalf under the provisions
of this Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent by
the terms of this Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents, together with
such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary in this Short-Term RPA, the Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities
shall be read into this Short-Term RPA or any Related Document or otherwise
exist against the Agent.

8.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may perform any of its
duties under this Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents by or through
agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-
fact selected by it with reasonable care.

8.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agent, nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates
(except the Custodian in its capacity as such) shall be:

(a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken
by it or such Person under or in connection with this Short-
Term RPA or any Related Document (except for its or such
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or 

(b) responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
any CCCL Party or any officer thereof contained in this
Short-Term RPA or any Related Document or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to
or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in
connection with, this Short-Term RPA or any Related Document
or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Short-Term RPA or any
Related Document or for any failure of any CCCL Party to
perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. 

The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Bank to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Short-Term RPA or any
Related Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any
CCCL Party.

8.4 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy,
telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or
conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to any
CCCL Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take
any action under this Short-Term RPA or any Related Document unless it
shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Banks as it
deems appropriate and be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks
against any and all Liabilities and Costs which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in
all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
this Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents in accordance with a request
of the Required Banks, and such request and any action taken or failure to
act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks.

8.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Commitment Termination Event
hereunder unless the Agent has received notice from a Bank or a CCCL Party
referring to this Short-Term RPA, describing such Commitment Termination
Event and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event
that the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof
to the Banks. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such
Commitment Termination Event as shall be reasonably directed by the
Required Banks; provided that unless and until the Agent shall have
received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Commitment Termination Event, as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Banks.

8.6 Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Banks. Each Bank expressly
acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates (except the Custodian in
its capacity as such) has made any representations or warranties to it and
that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the
affairs of the CCCL Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents
to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into
the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the CCCL Parties, the Retail Obligations and the
Wholesale Obligations and made its own decision to make its Purchases
hereunder and enter into this Short-Term RPA and the other Related
Documents to which it is a party. Each Bank also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, or any other Bank, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Short-Term RPA and the Related
Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the CCCL Parties, the Retail Obligations
and the Wholesale Obligations. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent
hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide
any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business,
operations, property, financial or other condition, prospects or
creditworthiness of the CCCL Parties, the Retail Obligations or the
Wholesale Obligations which may come into the possession of the Agent or
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates.

8.7 Indemnification of Agent. The Banks agree to indemnify the
Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the
CCCL Parties and without limiting the obligation of the CCCL Parties to do
so), ratably according to their respective Purchase Percentages, from and
against any and all Liabilities and Costs which may at any time (including,
without limitation, at any time following the termination of this Short-
Term RPA and the Related Documents) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agent, in any way relating to or arising out of this Short-Term
RPA, any of the Related Documents or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection
with any of the foregoing including without limitation all Liabilities and
Costs imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent: 

(a) in exercising any of the rights and powers which the Agent
may have under or in respect of this Short-Term RPA or any
Related Document or any Retail Obligation or Wholesale
Obligation or any related document or instrument, or in
taking any actions or proceedings to enforce any of the
obligations or liabilities of any CCCL Party under or in
respect of this Short-Term RPA or any Related Document or of
the obligor or any other Person under or in respect of any
Retail Obligation or Wholesale Obligation or any related
document or instrument, or in taking any actions or
proceedings to realize upon or enforce the security or any
of the other rights constituted by any Retail Obligation or
Wholesale Obligation or any related document or instrument;
or 

(b) resulting or arising from any claims, demands, suits,
actions or other proceedings brought by or on behalf of any
of the obligors or other parties under or in respect of any
of the Retail Obligations or Wholesale Obligations or the
vehicles financed thereby;

provided that no Bank (other than Royal) shall be liable for the payment of
any portion of such Liabilities and Costs, resulting solely from the
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

8.8 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in
any kind of business with the CCCL Parties as though the Agent were not the
Agent hereunder and under the Related Documents. With respect to any
Interests the Agent in its individual capacity as a Bank may from time to
time hold, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this
Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents as any Bank and may exercise the
same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks"
shall include the Agent in its individual capacity. 

8.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 10
days' notice to the Banks. If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this
Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents, then the Required Banks shall
appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks, which
successor agent shall be approved by CCCL, whereupon such successor agent
shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent, and the term
"Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its appointment, and
the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated,
without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent
or any of the parties to this Short-Term RPA. After any retiring Agent's
resignation as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall enure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent under this Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents. 

8.10 Exchange of Information. The CCCL Parties agree that each
of the Banks and the Agent may provide to any of the others of them such
information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and
other condition and creditworthiness of the CCCL Parties, Retail
Obligations or the Wholesale Obligations, as, in the opinion of such Bank
or the Agent, is relevant under or in connection with this Short-Term RPA
and the Related Documents.

8.11 Netting of Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Short-Term RPA, the Agent may net against any
amount which is payable by the Agent to any Bank pursuant to this Short-
Term RPA, any amount which is payable by such Bank to the Agent pursuant to
this Short-Term RPA.

8.12 Survival. The agreements in this Article VIII shall survive
termination of this Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents.

8.13 For Benefit of Banks Only. The provisions of this Article
relating to the rights and obligations of the Agent and the Banks inter se
shall be operative as between the Agent and the Banks only, and no CCCL
Party shall have any rights hereunder or be entitled to rely for any
purposes upon such provisions.

ARTICLE IX - INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Payment of Expenses and Taxes. CCCL agrees, on demand:

(a) to pay or reimburse the Agent for its reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of, and any
amendment, supplement or modification to, this Short-Term
RPA and the Related Documents and any other documents
prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the
consummation and administration of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, (including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of one
counsel to the Agent and to the several Banks);

(b) to pay or reimburse the Agent for all reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel to the Agent in connection with the
ongoing administration of this Short-Term RPA and the
Related Documents;

(c) to pay or reimburse the Agent and each Bank for all their
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Short-
Term RPA, the Related Documents and any such other documents
(including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
one counsel to the Agent and to the several Banks), 

(d) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Bank and the Agent harmless
from, any and all recording and filing fees and any and all
Liabilities and Costs with respect to any licence fees,
duties and taxes (including without limitation any goods and
services, sales, use, stamp, excise, gross receipts or
personal property taxes), and other assessments which may at
any time be payable, if any, or determined to be payable or
asserted in connection with the execution and delivery of,
or consummation or administration of any of the transactions
or arrangements contemplated by, or any amendment,
supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent
under or in respect of, this Short-Term RPA, the Related
Documents and any such other documents or the Retail
Obligations or the Wholesale Pooled Property, 

(e) to pay, indemnify and hold each Bank and the Agent harmless
from and against all Liabilities and Costs arising from the
Retail Contracts and the Wholesale Contracts or the
underlying collateral (including any product warranty
related claims, but excluding credit losses), 

(f) to pay, indemnify and hold each Bank and the Agent harmless
from and against all Liabilities and Costs arising from the
inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations and
warranties contained in this Short-Term RPA or the Related
Documents or the failure of any CCCL Party to perform or
observe any covenants, agreements or other terms or
provisions contained in this Short-Term RPA and the Related
Documents, and

(g) to indemnify the Agent and each Bank from and against
Liabilities and Costs (other than legal fees and
disbursements) of any kind whatsoever (and, with respect to
any proceeding or related proceedings, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of one firm of counsel to the relevant
Banks in connection with such proceeding(s)) which may at
any time (including, without limitation, at any time
following repayment of the Short-Term Aggregate Invested
Amount) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such
Bank in any way relating to or arising out of this Short-
Term RPA, the Guarantee, the Related Documents or any other
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
action taken or omitted by such Bank under or in connection
with any of the foregoing,

(all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified 
Liabilities"),

provided, that CCCL shall have no obligation hereunder to
the Agent or any Bank with respect to Indemnified Liabilities arising from
(i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent, its Affiliates
or any such Bank, (ii) legal proceedings commenced against the Agent, its
Affiliates or any such Bank by any security holder or creditor thereof
arising out of and based upon rights afforded any such security holder or
creditor solely in its capacity as such, or (iii) legal proceedings
commenced against the Agent, its Affiliates or any such Bank by any other
Bank or by any Transferee and further provided, that the Indemnified
Liabilities referred to in (d) shall not include, with respect to any Bank,
any taxes imposed on the net income of such Bank except to the extent that
(i) such taxes are payable by such Bank as a consequence of (A) the
Investor Master Custodial Certificate held by such Bank not being
characterized as evidencing an undivided ownership interest in the
Wholesale Pooled Property or (B) the Custodial Arrangement (as defined in
the Wholesale PSA) not being characterized solely as an agency and (ii) as
a result of such characterization the amount of taxes payable by such Bank
exceeds the amount of taxes that would have been payable had (C) the
Investor Master Custodial Certificates been characterized as evidencing an
undivided ownership interest in the Wholesale Pooled Property or the
Custodial Arrangement and (D) the Custodial Arrangement been characterized
solely as an agency. 

9.2 Statements, Reports etc. All statements, reports,
certificates, opinions and other documents or information required to be
furnished to the Banks or the Agent by the Seller under this Short-Term RPA
shall be supplied by the Seller, without cost to the Banks or the Agent.

9.3 Increased Costs. In the event that any Applicable Law or
any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof or
compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
enacted or made subsequent to the date hereof:

(a) does or shall subject such Bank to any Tax, or change
the basis of taxation or increase any existing Tax, on
payments of any amounts payable by the Seller to such
Bank (except for taxes on the overall net income of
such Bank imposed by the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated or resident or from which it is acting for
the purposes of this Short-Term RPA, but including
taxes on capital or other similar taxes);

(b) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
requirement against assets held by, or deposits or
other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or
loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank; or

(c) does or shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank
of purchasing or holding any such Bank's Interests hereunder or to reduce
any amount receivable in respect thereof (such increase in costs or
reduction in amounts receivable, "Increased Costs") then, in any such case,
the Seller shall promptly pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank,
upon the written demand of such Bank to the Seller (with a copy to the
Agent), so long as such Increased Costs are not otherwise included in the
amounts required to be paid to such Bank pursuant to Section 9.4, 9.5 or
9.6, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such
Increased Costs which such Bank deems to be material as determined by such
Bank with respect to its Purchases. If a Bank becomes entitled to claim
any additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly notify
the Seller, through the Agent, of the event by reason of which it has
become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by a Bank, through the Agent,
to the Seller shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

9.4 Reemployment Costs. CCCL agrees to indemnify each Bank and
to hold each Bank harmless from any Liabilities and Costs, including, but
not limited to, any such Liabilities and Costs arising from interest or
fees payable by such Bank to lenders of funds obtained by it to purchase or
hold such Bank's Interests, which such Bank may sustain or incur as a
consequence of:

(a) default by the Seller in the performance of its obligations
hereunder; or 

(b) default by the Seller in selling Interests on a Purchase
Date or in converting or continuing the annual rate of
return to or in, as applicable, a rate based on a Bank's BA
Rate, in each case after having given notice of a sale or
electing to have the Bank's BA Rate applied; or 

(c) the application of any collections in reduction of such
Bank's investment in the Interests at any time such that any
portion of the Short-Term Aggregate Invested Amount in
respect of which the Seller elects to have the rate of
return based on a Bank's BA Rate for bankers' acceptances
maturing over a period of time ending on a Distribution Date
does not remain outstanding during the entire period for
which such Bank's BA Rate is to apply, or 

(d) the Exact Retail Amount Due (as defined in the Short-Term
Retail PSA) upon Retail Obligations purchased by the Bank on
a Fixed Rate basis being different from the Estimated Retail
Amount Due (as defined in the Short-Term Retail PSA) upon
such Retail Obligations. A certificate as to any additional
amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted
by a Bank to CCCL shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

9.5 Changes in Capital Requirements. 

(a) In the event that, in the opinion of counsel for any Bank
(which may, in the discretion of such Bank, be such Bank's internal
counsel), compliance with any law, rule, regulation or guideline, or any
change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, or
compliance by any Bank with any request or directive from any central bank
or Governmental Authority (whether or not such requirement has the force of
law) enacted or made subsequent to the date hereof shall affect the amount
of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any
corporation controlling such Bank and the amount of such capital that is
required or expected to be maintained is increased by or based upon the
Commitment of such Bank under this Short-Term RPA (such requirement, a
"Change in Capital Requirement"), such Bank shall so notify CCCL and the
Agent within one-hundred eighty (180) days after such Bank shall have
obtained actual knowledge of the costs associated with its compliance with
such Change in Capital Requirement (but in no event later than 365 days
after such Bank is first required to comply with such Change in Capital
Requirement).

(b) At the time of such notification such affected Bank shall
provide CCCL and the Agent with a written statement setting forth the
amount that would adequately compensate such affected Bank for the
Liabilities and Costs associated with its compliance with such Change in
Capital Requirement and setting forth in reasonable detail the assumptions
upon which such affected Bank calculated such amount and a copy of the
opinion of counsel for the Bank referred to in the preceding paragraph.

(c) Such affected Bank shall allocate to the Seller the
Liabilities and Costs associated with such Change in Capital Requirement in
such a way that the proportion of (i) such Liabilities and Costs that are
allocated to the Seller to (ii) the total of such Liabilities and Costs of
such affected Bank associated with such Change in Capital Requirement as it
relates to all commitments of such Bank to its customers of similar
creditworthiness as the Seller, is substantially the same as the proportion
of (i) the Commitment of such affected Bank under this Short-Term RPA to
(ii) the total of all commitments by such affected Bank to its customers of
similar creditworthiness as the Seller.

(d) CCCL and such affected Bank shall thereafter negotiate in
good faith an agreement to increase that portion of the Facility Fees
payable to such affected Bank under Section 2.6 of this Short-Term RPA,
which, in the opinion of such affected Bank, will adequately compensate
such affected Bank for such costs. If such increase is approved in writing
by CCCL within ninety (90) days from the date of the notice to CCCL from
such affected Bank, the Facility Fees payable by CCCL shall include the
amount of such agreed increase (but subject to subsection 9.5(e)), and CCCL
will so notify the Agent. If CCCL and such affected Bank are unable to
agree on such an increase within ninety (90) days from the date of the
notice to CCCL from such affected Bank, CCCL shall by written notice to
such affected Bank within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date
of the aforesaid notice to CCCL from such affected Bank, elect either to
(i) terminate the Commitment of such affected Bank (each such Bank, a
"Terminated Bank") (subject to subsection 9.5(e)) or (ii) (subject to
subsection 9.5(e)) increase the Facility Fees payable to such affected Bank
by the amount requested by such affected Bank, and CCCL will so notify the
Agent. Without limiting the foregoing, if CCCL elects to take the action
described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, it may simultaneously
therewith reduce the Commitment of such affected Bank by an amount chosen
by CCCL. If CCCL fails to provide notice to such affected Bank as
described in the second preceding sentence by such one hundred twentieth
day, CCCL shall be deemed to have taken the action described in clause (ii)
of such second preceding sentence without reduction of the Commitment of
such affected Bank. 

(e) CCCL (A) may from time to time after such one hundred
twentieth day reduce the compensation to be received pursuant to this
Section 9.5 by any affected Bank as a result of any Change in Capital
Requirement, to the average compensation (the "Average Compensation") CCCL
has agreed, as provided above, to pay the affected Banks as a result of
such Change in Capital Requirement (such average compensation to be
measured by a percentage of the aggregate Commitments of such affected
Banks) and (B) shall pay to each Terminated Bank an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of (i) the lesser of (I) the aggregate Facility Fees that
would have been payable to such Terminated Bank from the date of such
Terminated Bank's notice to CCCL pursuant to this Section 9.5 to the date
the Commitment of such Terminated Bank is terminated had such Facility Fees
been determined by reference to the Average Compensation, and (II) the
aggregate Facility Fees that would have been payable to such Terminated
Bank during such period had such Facility Fees been increased by an amount
necessary to adequately compensate such Terminated Bank (as determined by
such Terminated Bank in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Section 9.5) for the costs attributable to the relevant Change in Capital
Requirement, over (ii) the aggregate Facility Fees actually paid to such
Terminated Bank during such period. 

(f) On the day the Commitment of a Terminated Bank is terminated
pursuant to subsection 9.5(d), (i) the Seller shall pay in full any accrued
and unpaid Facility Fees, Utilization Fees or other amounts owing to such
Terminated Bank hereunder, and (ii) notwithstanding such termination, CCCL
and CFC shall continue to remain fully liable to such Terminated Bank for
the satisfaction of all obligations and the payment of all amounts due or
to become due under this Short-Term RPA and the relevant Related Documents
(except for Facility Fees and Utilization Fees) as if such Commitment had
not been terminated until all such obligations have been satisfied and all
such amounts paid in full; and (iii) CCCL shall pay to the Terminated Bank
on each date on which the Facility Fees would have been payable to such
Terminated Bank had such Commitment not been terminated an amount equal to
the increase in such Terminated Bank's portion of the Facility Fees which
such Terminated Bank requested pursuant to subsection 9.5(d), adjusted to
give effect to the termination of such Terminated Bank's Commitment, during
the remaining term of this Short-Term RPA so long as the Terminated Bank's
investment in Retail Obligations or Wholesale Pooled Property remains
greater than zero.

(g) Upon the occurrence of any Change in Capital Requirement,
any Bank whose commitment hereunder is affected by such Change in Capital
Requirement shall transfer its commitment to another branch office (or, if
such Bank so elects, to an Affiliate) of such Bank, provided that such
transfer shall be made only if such Bank shall have determined in good
faith (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties) that, (i) on the basis of existing
circumstances, such transfer will avoid the increased costs resulting from
such Change in Capital Requirement and will not result in any additional
Liabilities and Costs to such Bank or to CCCL (unless CCCL agrees to pay
such additional Liabilities and Costs of such Bank or CCCL, as the case may
be) and (ii) such transfer is otherwise consistent with the interests of
such Bank. A transfer of a Bank's Commitment pursuant to this subsection
9.5(g) shall be effected pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.8,
provided that no consent to such transfer shall be required from the Seller
or the Agent.

9.6 Replacement of Banks

The Seller shall be permitted to replace any Bank which (a)
requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 9.3 and as a
result thereof any of the actions described in such Section is required to
be taken, (b) defaults in its obligation to make Purchases hereunder, or
(c) ceases to be a party to the Revolving Credit Agreement, provided that
(i) such replacement does not conflict with any Applicable Law, (ii) no
Commitment Termination Event shall have occurred and be continuing at the
time of such replacement, (iii) the Seller shall be liable to such
replaced Bank under subsection 9.4(c) to the extent such replaced Bank
incurs any Liabilities or Costs contemplated in such subsection as a result
of such replacement, (iv) the replacement Bank, if not already a Bank, and
the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent, (v) the replaced Bank shall be obligated to make
such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.8, (vi)
until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Seller shall
pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Sections 9.3 or
9.5, as the case may be, and (vii) any such replacement shall not be deemed
to be a waiver of any rights which the Seller, the Agent or any other Bank
shall have against the replaced Bank.

9.7 Survival. The agreements in this Article shall survive the
termination of this Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other indemnification granted
by any CCCL Party in any Related Document.

modification shall apply equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding
upon the CCCL Parties, the Banks and the Agent. In the case of any waiver,
the CCCL Parties, the Banks and the Agent shall be restored to their former
position and rights hereunder and under the Related Documents, and any
Commitment Termination Event waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
Commitment Termination Event, or impair any right consequent thereon. 

10.2 Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the
respective parties hereto to be effective shall be in writing delivered by
certified or registered mail, by hand, by courier, or by telecopy or telex,
and, unless otherwise expressly provided herein, shall be deemed to have
been duly given or made when delivered by hand, certified or registered
mail, or by courier, in the case of telecopy notice, when received, or, in
the case of telex notice, when sent, answerback received, addressed to the
parties as set forth in the signature pages hereto, or to such other
address as may be hereafter notified by the respective parties hereto
provided that any notice, request or demand to or upon the Agent or the
Banks pursuant to Section 2.4 shall not be effective until received.

10.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and
no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Bank, any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. 
Nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

10.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any document,
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Short-Term RPA.

10.5 Successors and Assigns. This Short-Term RPA shall be
binding upon and enure to the benefit of the CCCL Parties, the Banks, the
Agent, and their respective successors and assigns, except that no CCCL
Party may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Short-Term RPA without the prior written consent of the Required Banks
(other than in connection with an Additional Wholesale Seller pursuant to
the terms hereof).

10.6 Participation. Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its
commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time sell to one or more Chartered Banks ("Participants") participating
interests in any Commitment of such Bank, any Short-Term Wholesale
Certificate or any other Interests of such Bank hereunder. In the event of
any such sale by a Bank of participating interests to a Participant, such
Bank's obligations under this Short-Term RPA to the other parties to this
Short-Term RPA shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely
responsible for the performance thereof for all purposes under this Short-
Term RPA, and CCCL, the Seller and the Agent shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and
obligations under this Short-Term RPA. In the case of a sale by a Bank of
a participating interest in Wholesale Pooled Property represented by a
Short-Term Wholesale Certificate, such Bank shall remain the registered
holder of such Short-Term Wholesale Certificate.

10.7 Optional Sale. The Agent may at any time during the
Commitment Period offer to sell all or any portion of the Banks' Interests
comprising Sold Retail Obligations (as defined in the Short-Term Retail
PSA) for cash (a) if the Short-Term Retail Aggregate Invested Amount (plus
accrued interest, fees and other amounts payable by the Seller hereunder to
the date of such sale) after giving effect to such sale, would be reduced
to zero and (b) if after giving effect to such sale no Service Default (as
defined in the Short-Term Retail PSA) shall be then continuing. Proceeds
of such sale shall be treated as and applied as a collection on account of
Sold Retail Obligations under and in accordance with the Short-Term Retail
PSA. Following the receipt of a bona fide offer to purchase all or any
portion of the Banks' Interests in the said Sold Retail Obligations from
any Person other than the Seller which the Agent wishes to accept (a "Third
Party Offer"), the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Seller, which
notice shall constitute an irrevocable offer to sell such Interests to the
Seller for an amount and on the terms and conditions specified in the Third
Party Offer. The Seller will be under no obligation to accept such offer. 
If the Seller does not accept such offer within five (5) Business Days
after receiving notice thereof, the Agent may accept the Third Party Offer. 

10.8 Sale of Interests.

(a) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to
any Bank, and, with the consent of CCCL and the Agent (which in each case
shall not be unreasonably withheld) to one or more additional Chartered
Banks ("Purchasing Banks") all or a portion of its rights and obligations
under this Short-Term RPA, the Related Documents and the Short-Term
Wholesale Certificates pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement,
executed by such Purchasing Bank, such transferor Bank, the Guarantor and
the Agent (and, in the case of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank,
by CCCL), and delivered to the Agent for its acceptance and recording in
the Register provided that (i) prior to the termination of the Commitments
(whether on the Commitment Termination Date or otherwise), any such sale
shall include a proportionate share of each of such transferor Bank's
Commitments, Retail Obligations and interests in Wholesale Pooled Property,
and after any termination of the Commitments, any such sale may be of any
combination of Retail Obligations and interests in Wholesale Pooled
Property and (ii) the principal amount of such Bank's Commitment so sold
(or, if no Commitments are outstanding, the principal amount of interests
in Wholesale Pooled Property and Retail Obligations so sold) shall be in an
aggregate amount of $3,000,000 or more. 

(b) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance, and recording,
from and after the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to such
Commitment Transfer Supplement, (i) the Purchasing Bank thereunder shall be
a party hereto and the Related Documents and, to the extent provided in
such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a
Bank hereunder with a Commitment as set forth therein, and (ii) the
transferor Bank thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Commitment
Transfer Supplement, be released from its obligations under this Short-Term
RPA (and, in the case of a Commitment Transfer Supplement covering all or
the remaining portion of a transferor Bank's rights and obligations under
this Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents, such transferor Bank shall
cease to be a party hereto). 

(c) Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend
this Short-Term RPA to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to
reflect the addition of such Purchasing Bank and the resulting adjustment
of Purchase Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Bank
of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Bank
under this Short-Term RPA and the Related Documents. On or prior to the
Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, the Wholesale Custodian, at its own expense, shall execute and
deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered Short-Term Wholesale
Certificate a new Short-Term Wholesale Certificate issued in the name of
such Purchasing Bank pursuant to the Short-Term Wholesale Series Supplement
and, if the transferor Bank has retained Commitments hereunder, a new
Short-Term Wholesale Certificate issued in the name of the transferor Bank.

(d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to on the
signature pages hereto or such other address of which the Agent may give
notice in accordance with Section 10.2, a copy of each Commitment Transfer
Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitments of,
and principal amount of the Retail Obligations and interests in Wholesale
Pooled Property sold to, each Bank from time to time. The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the
CCCL Parties, the Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Retail Obligations, the
interests in Wholesale Pooled Property and the Short-Term Wholesale
Certificates recorded therein for all purposes of this Short-Term RPA. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the CCCL Parties or any Bank
at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
Within two (2) Business Days after the end of each month during the term of
this Short-Term RPA, the Agent shall provide a copy of the Register to the
Seller. 

(e) Upon its receipt of a Commitment Transfer Supplement
executed by a transferor Bank and a Purchasing Bank (and, in the case of a
Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank or an Affiliate thereof, by CCCL
and the Agent), the Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Commitment
Transfer Supplement and (ii) on the Transfer Effective Date determined
pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register
and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Banks and CCCL.

(f) Each CCCL Party authorizes each Bank to disclose to any
Participant or Purchasing Bank (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Bank's possession
concerning such CCCL Party and its Affiliates which has been delivered to
such Bank by or on behalf of such CCCL Party pursuant to this Short-Term
RPA or which has been delivered to such Bank by or on behalf of such CCCL
Party in connection with such Bank's credit evaluation of such CCCL Party
and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Short-Term RPA.

10.9 Adjustments; Set-Off.

(a) If any Bank (a "benefitted Bank") shall at any time receive
any payment of all or part of its investments in Wholesale Pooled Property
or Retail Obligations, or any return or interest thereon, or receive any
collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by
set-off or counterclaim, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Sections 7.1(g), 7.1(h), 7.1(i), 7.1(j) or 7.1(k) or
otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral
received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's
investments in Wholesale Pooled Property or Retail Obligations, or return
or interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the
other Banks such portion of each such other Bank's investments in Wholesale
Pooled Property or Retail Obligations, or shall provide such other Banks
with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall
be necessary to cause such benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or
benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Banks;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or
benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Bank, such purchase
shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each CCCL Party agrees that
each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's investments in
Wholesale Pooled Property or Retail Obligations may exercise all rights of
payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to
such portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct holder of such
portion.

(b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided
by law, each Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to any CCCL
Party, any such notice being expressly waived by each CCCL Party to the
extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and
payable by such CCCL Party hereunder or under the Related Documents
(whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off
and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any
other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case
whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured,
at any time held or owing by such Bank or any branch or agency thereof to
or for the credit or the account of such CCCL Party, provided, however,
that no Bank which maintains any bank account for the Wholesale Custodian
shall exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim or similar right with
respect to amounts on deposit in such bank account. Each Bank agrees
promptly to notify CCCL and the Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 

10.10 Counterparts. This Short-Term RPA may be executed by one or
more of the parties to this Short-Term RPA in any number of separate
counterparts, and all of such counterparts taken together shall be deemed
to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this
Short-Term RPA signed by all the parties shall be lodged with CCCL and the
Agent.

10.11 Severability. Any provision of this Short-Term RPA which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and
any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

10.12 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein with
respect to the 1993 RPA and the Long-Term RPA, this Short-Term RPA
represents the entire agreement of the CCCL Parties, the Agent and the
Banks with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by the Agent or any Bank
relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to
herein or in the Related Documents.

10.13 Governing Law. This Short-Term RPA and the rights and
obligations of the parties under this Short-Term RPA shall be governed by,
and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the law of the Province
of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.

10.14 Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each CCCL Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally:

(a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
proceeding relating to this Short-Term RPA and the Related
Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgement in respect thereof, to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of
Ontario;

(b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought
in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding
in any such court or that such action or proceeding was
brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or
claim the same;

(c) agrees that service of process in any such action or
proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by
registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar
form of mail), postage prepaid, to such Person at its
address set forth in the signature pages hereto or at such
other address of which the Agent shall have been notified
pursuant to Section 10.2;

(d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by law or
shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

(e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any
right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or
proceeding referred to in this subsection any special,
exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

10.15 Further Assurances. Each CCCL Party agrees that it will
from time to time and at any time, do and perform any and all acts and
execute any and all further instruments required or reasonably requested by
the Agent to effect more fully the purposes and intent of this Short-Term
RPA, the Short-Term Wholesale Series Supplement, the Short-Term Retail PSA
and the Purchases contemplated hereunder or thereunder, including without
limitation, the execution of any financing statements, financing change
statements and all affidavits, notices or assignments for filing under the
provisions of the legislation of any jurisdiction.

10.16 Termination. This Short-Term RPA terminates on the later of
the termination of the Short-Term Retail PSA and the termination of the
Short-Term Wholesale Series Supplement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have caused this
Short-Term RPA to be duly executed as of the date and year first above
written.

during the Commitment Period undivided interests in all the right, title
and interest of the Seller in, to and under all Retail Obligations to be
described in schedules to be delivered to the Agent at least three Business
Days prior to each related Closing Date hereunder for a purchase price
equal to the product of such Bank's Purchase Percentage and the Purchase
Price of the Retail Obligations being sold on the related Closing Date.

(b) Selection and Legal Characterization. Those Retail Obligations
to be sold to the Banks hereunder on any Closing Date shall be selected
from the total portfolio of Retail Obligations then owned by the Seller on
a random basis agreed upon between the Seller and the Agent, on behalf of

not constitute a mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest, conditional
sale, title retention agreement or other similar encumbrance in respect of
any such Retail Obligations.

hereinafter provided, the 1993 Commitments shall be terminated. Any 1993

further that any amount payable hereunder or thereunder as of the
Replacement Effective Date to NBD Bank, Canada, or to Hongkong Bank of
Canada shall continue to be so payable as if the 1993 RPA were still in
full force and effect.

2.3 Purchase and Sale Procedure. 

(a) General. Subject to the Short-Term RPA and the terms and
conditions provided in this subsection 2.3 and in Article VII, sales of
Retail Obligations hereunder may take place on any Business Day during the
Commitment Period (each date upon which a sale of Retail Obligations may
occur hereunder being herein called a "Closing Date" applicable to such
sale). Each such sale shall be as of the close of business on the last day
of the calendar month immediately preceding the related Closing Date (each
such date being herein called a "Date of Sale" applicable to such Sold
Retail Obligations) and shall take place at the office of the Agent or at
such other place as may be agreed upon. 

(b) Notice and Other Requirements for Retail Purchases. In respect of
any sale of Retail Obligations proposed to be made by the Seller hereunder:

(i) the Seller shall comply with all applicable conditions
precedent for Purchases contained in Section 4.4 of the
Short-Term RPA and for Retail Purchases contained in
Article VI of this Agreement;

(ii) the Seller shall give the Agent five Business Days'
prior written notice of the Seller's intention to sell
Retail Obligations hereunder; and

(iii) on each Closing Date hereunder the Seller shall deliver
to the Agent (A) a certificate in the form of Exhibit A
attached hereto, duly executed by a Responsible Officer
of the Seller, dated such Closing Date, setting forth
the Retail Amount Outstanding before giving effect to
the purchase and sale to be effected on such Closing
Date and (B) an Assignment, dated such Closing Date,
assigning and transferring to the Banks in proportion
to their respective Purchase Percentages, as of the
close of business on the related Date of Sale with
respect to each sale of any Retail Obligations
hereunder, all right, title and interest of the Seller
in and to the Retail Obligations described in the
schedule delivered to the Agent prior to such Closing
Date pursuant to subsection 2.1(a), a copy of which
schedule shall also be attached to such Assignment. 

(c) Estimated Amounts. Not less than five Business Days prior
to each Closing Date hereunder, the Seller shall deliver to the Agent with
respect to the Retail Obligations to be sold on such Closing Date:

(i) the Seller's estimate in writing of the amount due and
to become due upon all of the Retail Obligations to be
sold to the Banks on such Closing Date (such amount and
each such estimated amount applicable to the Retail
Obligations purchased on any Closing Date being herein
called the "Estimated Retail Amount Due" upon such
Retail Obligations), 

(ii) the Applicable Anticipated Collection Schedule relating
to such Retail Obligations, and, 

(iii) no later than the applicable Fixed Rate Determination
Date, a statement of the Retail Paid Percentage of the
Estimated Retail Amount Due upon such Retail
Obligations. 

(d) Minimum Retail Paid Percentage. The Banks shall have no
obligation to purchase any Retail Obligations on any Closing Date hereunder
unless the Retail Paid Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due upon
the Retail Obligations proposed to be sold to it on such Closing Date
exceeds $5,000,000. 

(e) Exact Retail Amount Due. As soon as practicable, but in any
event not later than the last Business Day of the calendar month in which
such Closing Date shall have occurred, the Seller will furnish to the Agent
a written statement of the exact amount due and to become due as of the
close of business on the related Date of Sale upon the Retail Obligations
sold to the Banks as of such Date of Sale (such amount being herein called
the "Exact Retail Amount Due" upon such Retail Obligations). If the Seller
does not furnish to the Agent a written statement of the Exact Retail
Amount Due in respect of Retail Obligations purchased on a Closing Date by
the end of the calendar month in which such Closing Date occurs, then for
the purposes of this Agreement, the Seller shall be deemed to have
furnished to the Agent a written statement of the Exact Retail Amount Due
identical to the related statement of the Estimated Retail Amount Due in
respect of the Retail Obligations purchased on such Closing Date.

2.4 Payment of Purchase Price. 

(a) Computation and Payment. The aggregate purchase price
("Purchase Price") for the Retail Obligations to be purchased by and sold
to the Banks on each Closing Date hereunder shall equal the aggregate of
the net amounts payable by the Banks, or by the Agent on behalf of the
Banks, as applicable, to the Seller in respect of a purchase of Retail
Obligations hereunder after effect has been given to the following
provisions: 

(i) On each Closing Date each Bank shall deduct from its
Purchase Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due
upon such Retail Obligations and retain its Purchase
Percentage of an amount (such amount, as the same may
be increased or reduced as provided for herein, being
herein called the "Retail Deferred Payment" applicable
to such Retail Obligations) equal to the lesser of (x)
the Deferred Percentage (Retail Gross) of the Estimated
Retail Amount Due upon such Retail Obligations and (y)
the Deferred Percentage (Retail Net) of the Retail Paid
Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due upon such
Retail Obligations; and, subject to receipt from each
Bank of its Purchase Percentage thereof, the Agent
shall pay the Seller an amount equal to the Retail Paid
Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due upon such
Retail Obligations. The Retail Deferred Payment
applicable to the Sold Retail Obligations purchased on
any related Closing Date will be applied as hereinafter
provided. 

(ii) Upon receipt by the Agent of the statement showing the
Exact Retail Amount Due upon such Retail Obligations: 

(A) if the Exact Retail Amount Due upon such Retail
Obligations exceeds the Estimated Retail Amount
Due upon such Retail Obligations, each Bank shall,
subject to the provisions of subsection 2.5,
deduct from its Purchase Percentage of such excess
and add to the Retail Deferred Payment applicable
to such Retail Obligations its Purchase Percentage
of an amount so that the Retail Deferred Payment
equals the lesser of (x) the Deferred Percentage
(Retail Gross) of the Exact Retail Amount Due upon
such Retail Obligations and (y) the Deferred
Percentage (Retail Net) of the Retail Paid
Percentage of the Exact Retail Amount Due upon
such Retail Obligations, subject to receipt from
each Bank of its Purchase Percentage thereof, and
the Agent shall promptly pay the Seller an
additional amount equal to the Retail Paid
Percentage of such excess together with interest
on such additional amount computed for the period
from such Closing Date to the date of payment of
such additional amount at the Fixed Rate
applicable to such Retail Obligations; and 

(B) if the Exact Retail Amount Due upon such Retail
Obligations is less than the Estimated Retail
Amount Due upon such Retail Obligations, the
Seller shall promptly pay the Agent an amount
equal to the Retail Paid Percentage of the
difference between the Exact Retail Amount Due
upon such Retail Obligations and the Estimated
Retail Amount Due upon such Retail Obligations,
together with interest on such amount computed for
the period from such Closing Date to the date of
payment of such amount at the Fixed Rate
applicable to such Retail Obligations, and the
Retail Deferred Payment applicable to such Retail
Obligations shall be reduced by an amount so that
the Retail Deferred Payment equals the lesser of
the amounts referred to in (A)(x) and (A)(y)
above. 

(b) Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Agent, the Banks and the
Seller agree that the Purchase Price to be paid by the Agent for the Sold
Retail Obligations purchased on each Closing Date shall be adjusted from
time to time in order to ensure that the Banks shall receive an annual rate
of return (computed on a monthly basis) on their investment calculated with
respect to such Sold Retail Obligations at a rate per annum equal to the
applicable Fixed Rate (the annual rate of return specified in this
subsection 2.4(b) applicable to such Sold Retail Obligations being herein
called the "Applicable Yield" for such Sold Retail Obligations). 
Accordingly, adjustments in the Purchase Price paid by the Agent for Sold
Retail Obligations shall be made on each Settlement Date as provided for in
subsection 4.1.

2.5 Maximum Amount of Purchases. 

(a) Maximum. The Banks shall not be obligated to purchase any
Retail Obligations on any Closing Date hereunder if the sum of (i) the
Aggregate Amount Outstanding before giving effect to such purchase plus
(ii) the Retail Paid Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due upon any
Retail Obligations to be purchased on such Closing Date (the sum of clauses
(i) and (ii) being herein called the "Retail Amount Outstanding") plus
(iii) the Short-Term Wholesale Aggregate Invested Amount would exceed the
Short-Term Commitment Amount. 

(b) Reassignment of Excess Retail Obligations. Notwithstanding
the provisions of clause (i) of subsection 2.4(a), if, after the receipt by
the Agent of any written statement of Exact Retail Amount Due furnished to
the Agent pursuant to subsection 2.3(c)(i) and the calculation of the
Aggregate Retail Amount Outstanding to include the Exact Retail Amount Due
set forth on said statement, the sum of the Retail Amount Outstanding plus
the Short-Term Wholesale Aggregate Invested Amount would exceed the Short-
Term Commitment Amount, determined on the Settlement Date hereunder next
preceding the date of receipt by the Agent of such statement of Exact
Retail Amount Due and after giving effect to any purchase hereunder on such
Settlement Date, the Agent shall reassign to the Seller, without recourse,
representation or warranty, such of the Retail Obligations to which such
statement of Exact Retail Amount Due relates (selected on a random basis
agreed upon between the Seller and the Agent) as is necessary so that,
after giving effect to any reassignment of Retail Obligations then being
made, the sum of the Retail Amount Outstanding plus the Wholesale Aggregate
Invested Amount would not exceed the Short-Term Commitment Amount,
determined as aforesaid. There shall be no increase in the Retail Deferred
Payment and no payment pursuant to clause (i) of subsection 2.4(a) of this
Agreement with respect to any such Retail Obligations so reassigned.

2.6 Interest on Overdue Payments. If any amount shown by any
Settlement Statement to be payable to the Agent is not paid on the relevant
Settlement Date, such amount shall bear interest from such Settlement Date
until such amount is paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the greater
of (i) the Applicable Yield plus 2.0% and (ii) the Prime Rate plus 2.0%.

2.7 Discount and Interest Calculations. Calculations of discounts
and per annum rates under this Agreement shall be made on a monthly basis
and on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) for
actual days elapsed.

ARTICLE III 
SELLER'S SERVICING OBLIGATIONS: COLLECTIONS; MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS

3.1 Collections and Applications. 

(a) Identification of Collections. The parties
acknowledge that the Seller has established a system whereby the Seller
can, within two Business Days of the receipt thereof by the branch offices
of the Seller, identify collections as attributable to the Sold Retail
Obligations, and from and after the Replacement Effective Date, the Seller
will follow the established system of collections and remittances described
in subsections 3.1(b) and 3.1(c).

(b) Deposit of Collections. All collections of proceeds
of, or other payments in connection with, the Sold Retail Obligations will
be paid by the obligors under such Sold Retail Obligations to the branch
offices of the Seller or to the credit of the Seller by direct deposit to a
branch bank account of the Seller (each such account being herein called a
"Branch Account"). Such branch offices will deposit all collections
received as soon as practicable (in accordance with customary procedures)
following receipt thereof (whether attributable to the Sold Retail
Obligations or otherwise) into a Branch Account. Unless and until the
Agent shall deliver a Daily Remittance Notice to the Seller in accordance
with subsection 3.1(c), the Seller shall transfer or cause to be
transferred to the Agent on each Settlement Date under this Agreement an
amount equal to the collections received by the Seller on account of the
Sold Retail Obligations during the Settlement Period which next precedes
such Settlement Date. The Seller shall transfer or cause to be transferred
to the Agent all collections applicable to the Sold Retail Obligations and
deposited in a Branch Account from but not including the related Date of
Sale. If the Seller shall transfer funds to the Application Account on
account of any item received by the Seller which is subsequently returned
or dishonoured, then the Seller may deduct the amount of such item from the
funds otherwise transferred to the Application Account on the first
Business Day after the Seller knows that such item has been returned or
dishonoured.

(c) Daily Remittance Notices. At the written request of
the Required Banks, and provided that and only if at the time of such
request at least one class of the senior unsecured debt of the Guarantor is
rated Level V, the Agent shall deliver a Daily Remittance Notice to the
Seller. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Required Banks may in
their sole discretion require the Agent to deliver a Daily Remittance
Notice at any time, except as provided in the preceding sentence, and the
Agent agrees that it may deliver a Daily Remittance Notice only at the
request of the Required Banks. From and after the second Business Day next
following receipt by the Seller of a Daily Remittance Notice in accordance
with the preceding sentence, the Seller shall, within two Business Day of
receipt by the branch office of such items, identify those collections
which are on account of the Sold Retail Obligations and shall, on the
Business Day next following the date of such identification, transfer or
cause to be transferred in immediately available funds to the Application
Account an aggregate amount equal to the collections so identified as
attributable to the Sold Retail Obligations. In addition to the foregoing
the Seller shall no later than the fourth Business Day following receipt of
a Daily Remittance Notice, transfer or cause to be transferred to the
Application Account all collections then held by the Seller (including
those collections deposited in a Branch Account) attributable to the Sold
Retail Obligations which were to have been remitted to the Agent on each
Settlement Date next following receipt of such Daily Remittance Notice. On
each Settlement Date following receipt by the Seller of a Daily Remittance
Notice, an amount equal to the collections deposited in the Application
Account during the immediately preceding Settlement Period shall be
transferred to the Agent from the Application Account. On the Business Day
next following such Settlement Date, any interest or other earnings on the
principal balance of the Application Account during the immediately
preceding Settlement Period shall be transferred to the Seller from the
Application Account.

(d) Treatment of Funds. The Agent shall treat all funds
deposited in the Application Account or otherwise received by the Agent
during a Settlement Period after the delivery of a Daily Remittance Notice
as collections for purposes of this Agreement as of the Settlement Date
immediately following such Settlement Period.

(e) Application Account. Neither the Seller nor any other
Person claiming by, through or under the Seller, shall have any right,
title or interest in, or any control over the use of, or any right to
withdraw moneys from, the Application Account. Amounts credited to the
Application Account may be invested by the Agent in Cash Equivalents, which
investments shall be liquidated as necessary, on each Settlement Date. Any
interest or other earnings on the principal balance of the Application
Account shall be for the account of the Seller and shall be distributable
in accordance with subsection 3.1(c). The Seller agrees that the Agent
shall not be responsible for any loss or liability arising in respect of
such investments (including as a result of the liquidation before maturity
of any such investments) except to the extent that such loss or liability
is a result of the Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

(f) Cancellation of Daily Remittance Notice. Upon receipt
of a Daily Remittance Notice, the Seller shall comply with the provisions
of subsections 3.1(b) through 3.1(e) until the Settlement Date applicable
to each Sold Retail Obligation next following the date on which such Daily
Remittance Notice shall be cancelled by a written notification to such
effect delivered at any time by the Agent to the Seller. Such notification
shall be delivered either at the written request of the Required Banks or
upon receipt by the Agent of satisfactory evidence that no class of the
senior unsecured debt of the Guarantor is rated Level V.

3.2 Collections by Seller. 

(a) Seller's Servicing Duties. The Seller will, at the
Seller's cost and expense and as agent for the Banks and the Agent, but
subject at any time to the right of the Banks (through the Agent) to direct
and control, endeavour to collect, as and when the same becomes due, the
amounts owing on each Sold Retail Obligation, and in so doing the Seller
will apply the standard of care and diligence which would be prudent and
businesslike for the administration and collection of its own accounts
receivable; and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the
Seller shall comply with the following provisions of this section 3.2. 

(i) Payment made on any Sold Retail Obligation shall
be applied in the direct order of maturity of
payment due thereon. 

(ii) In the event of default under any Sold Retail
Obligation, the Seller shall have the power and
authority, on behalf of the Banks, but at the
Seller's cost and expense, to take such action in
respect of any Sold Retail Obligation (including,
in the case of any Sold Retail Obligation in
respect of which a security interest in goods
shall have been obtained, the repossession and
resale of such goods), as the Seller, in the
absence of contrary instructions from the Agent,
may deem advisable. In no event shall the Seller
be entitled to take any action which would make
the Agent or any Bank a party to any litigation
without the Agent's or such Bank's express prior
written consent. In the enforcement or collection
of any Sold Retail Obligation, the Seller shall be
entitled to sue the obligor in its own name, if
possible, or, if, but only if, the Agent consents
in writing, in the name of the Agent on behalf of
the Banks. 

(iii) Subject to section 3.2(f), the Agent may at any time by
notice in writing terminate the authority of the Seller
to act as agent for and on behalf of the Banks and the
Agent as set forth in this subsection 3.2. 

(iv) If the Seller repossesses goods, as aforesaid, or
elects to use legal proceedings to enforce any
Sold Retail Obligation, then unless and until the
Agent shall have given the Seller written notice
to the contrary, the act of repossession or of
commencing such litigation shall be deemed to be
an automatic reconveyance by the Agent and the
Banks, without recourse, representation or
warranty whatsoever, to the Seller of all of the
Agent's and the Banks' right, title and interest
in and to such Sold Retail Obligation, and upon
request by the Seller, the Agent will execute and
deliver a separate instrument confirming such
reconveyance. As the price for such reconveyance,
the Seller agrees to pay the Agent an amount equal
to all future proceeds collected on such Sold
Retail Obligation which the Agent had a right to
retain by virtue of its prior purchase. 

(v) The proceeds of any reconveyance under subsection
3.2(a)(iv) shall constitute collections hereunder. 
In addition, all proceeds or benefits of any
physical damage, life or disability insurance
policies which are received by the Seller and
which relate to any Sold Retail Obligations shall
be treated as collections hereunder and shall be
remitted by the Seller to the Agent on the next
Settlement Date or on such earlier date as may be
required if the Seller is in receipt of a Daily
Remittance Notice. 

(vi) The Seller shall be entitled to retain late
charges and extension fees received by it in the
course of its administration of the Sold Retail
Obligations.

(b) Indemnification. The Seller hereby agrees to defend and
indemnify the Agent and the several Banks against all costs, expenses,
claims and liabilities in respect of any action taken by the Seller
relative to any Sold Retail Obligation, or arising out of any failure of
compliance of any Sold Retail Obligation with the provisions of any law or
regulation, whether federal, provincial or municipal, applicable thereto
(including, without limitation, usury and consumer protection laws and
regulations). In the event of any repossession of goods, as aforesaid, the
Seller agrees to resell such goods in a commercially reasonable manner for
the account of the Banks in accordance with the requirements of all
applicable laws and regulations and shall remit to the Agent the gross sale
proceeds thereof net of the account debtor's equity of redemption, if any. 
Neither the Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to take any action
or commence any proceedings to realize upon any Sold Retail Obligation
(including, without limitation, any Defaulted Retail Obligation), or to
enforce any of its rights or remedies with respect thereto. Any monies
collected by the Seller pursuant to subsections 3.1 and 3.2 shall be held
in trust by the Seller and shall not constitute property of the Seller and
shall be remitted promptly to the Agent in accordance with subsection 3.1.

(c) Power of Attorney. The Seller hereby irrevocably grants to
the Agent an irrevocable power of attorney, with full power of
substitution, coupled with an interest, to take in the name of the Seller
and/or in its own name on behalf of the Banks all steps necessary or
advisable to endorse, negotiate or otherwise realize on any writing or
other right of any kind held or owned by the Seller or transmitted to or
received by the Agent as payment on account or otherwise in respect of any
Sold Retail Obligation including, without limitation, to take in the name
of the Seller and/or in its own name all steps necessary or advisable to
enforce or realize on any Sold Retail Obligations and all guarantees
thereof and collateral security therefor.

(d) Service Default. Any one of the following events that
shall occur and be continuing with respect to the Seller shall constitute a
"Service Default" hereunder: 

(i) any failure by the Seller to make any payment, transfer
or deposit or to give instructions or to give notice to
the Agent to make such payment, transfer or deposit on
or before the date occurring five days after the date
such payment, transfer or deposit or such instruction
or notice is required to be made or given, as the case
may be, under the terms of this Agreement;

(ii) failure on the part of the Seller duly to observe or
perform any other covenants or agreements of the Seller
set forth in this Agreement which has a material
adverse effect on the Banks and which continues
unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on
which written notice of such failure, requiring the
same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
Seller by the Agent; or the Seller shall delegate its
duties under this Agreement, except as permitted by
section 3.2(c);

(iii) any representation, warranty or certification made by
the Seller in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall prove to
have been incorrect when made, which has a material
adverse effect on the rights of the Banks and which
material adverse effect continues for a period of 60
days after the date on which written notice thereof,
requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been
given to the Seller by the Agent;

(iv) any Insolvency Event (as defined in the Wholesale PSA)
shall occur with respect to the Seller.

The Seller shall immediately notify the Agent in writing of any Service
Default; however, the failure by the Seller so to notify the Agent with
respect to the occurrence of any event listed in this section 3.2(d) shall
not affect the characterization of such event as a Service Default. 

(e) Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a delay in or
failure of performance under section 3.2(d)(i) for a period of 10 Business
Days after the grace period specified therein or under section 3.2(d)(ii)
or 3.2(d)(iii) for a period of 60 Business Days after the grace specified
therein, shall not constitute a Service Default if such delay or failure
could not be prevented by the exercise of reasonable diligence by the
Seller and such delay or failure was caused by an act of God or the Queen's
enemy, acts of declared or undeclared war, public disorder, rebellion or
sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning, fire, hurricanes, earthquakes,
floods or similar causes. The preceding sentence shall not relieve the
Seller from using its best efforts to perform its respective obligations in
a timely manner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Seller shall provide the Agent, the Seller and the Banks with a certificate
of a Responsible Officer of the Seller giving prompt notice of such failure
or delay by it, together with a description of its efforts so to perform
its obligations. 

(f) Termination of Servicing by Seller. At the written request
of the Required Banks, at any time after the occurrence of a Service
Default which has not been remedied within the grace period specified
therefor under section 3.2(d) or excused pursuant to section 3.2(e), the
Agent shall by notice in writing to the Seller terminate the Seller's
functions as to all of the administrative, servicing and collection
functions provided for herein (such notice being herein referred to as
notice of a "Complete Servicing Transfer"). The Seller acknowledges and
agrees that the Required Banks may in their sole discretion require the
Agent to deliver a notice of Complete Servicing Transfer at any time
provided that at such time a Service Default has occurred and is
continuing. Upon the occurrence of a Complete Servicing Transfer, without
limitation: 

(i) the Agent or its designee shall administer the

entitled to notify the obligors on any Sold Retail
Obligations to make payment of amounts due
thereunder directly to the Agent or its designee;

(iii) the Seller shall, at its own expense (x) if so
requested by the Agent, endorse each instrument,
if any, evidencing any Sold Retail Obligation to
the Agent in such manner as the Agent shall direct
and (y) further perform any and all acts and
execute any and all documents as may be reasonably
requested by the Agent in order to effect the
purposes of this Agreement and the sale of Retail
Obligations hereunder and to perfect and protect
the ownership interests of the several Banks in
the Sold Retail Obligations;

(iv) the Seller shall, at its own expense, cause to be
transmitted directly to the Agent or its designee
all cash, cheques, drafts and other instruments or
items for the payment of money which may be
received by the Seller as payment on account or
otherwise in respect of any Sold Retail
Obligation, provided that the Seller may maintain
possession of such items or instruments mistakenly
delivered to it at the time a notice of Complete
Servicing Transfer is received by the Seller, in
trust for the Agent, so long as the Seller
complies with the provisions of subsection 3.1
with regard to such items or instruments and the
proceeds thereof as if a Complete Servicing
Transfer has not occurred;

(v) the Seller and CFC will upon written request by
the Agent and at their own cost and expense (A)
deliver to the Agent or its designee the Contracts
relating to the Sold Retail Obligations, and all
books, accounts, ledgers, computer records and
other records and materials pertaining thereto,
(B) grant to the Agent or its designee a non-
exclusive royalty-free licence to use all the
application software and computer programs then
being used in connection with the administration,
servicing and collection of the Sold Retail
Obligations and owned by the Seller or CFC (the
"Software"), provided, however, that any such
licence shall be restricted to the administration,
servicing and collection of Sold Retail
Obligations and shall contain such other terms as
the Seller and CFC may reasonably require to
protect their proprietary interests in the
Software, such terms to be consistent with the
provisions and intent of this clause (B), and (C)
deliver the Software in machine readable and
printed form to the Agent or its designee,
together with such other documentation and
material which may be reasonably requested by the
Agent in support of the Software including,
without limitation, specifications, source

(vi) do all such other acts and things as the Agent may
reasonably request for the purpose of giving
effect to the provisions and intent of this
subsection 3.2(f).

(g) Reinstatement of Servicing by Seller. Upon receipt of a
notice of a Complete Servicing Transfer, the Seller shall comply with the
provisions of subsection 3.2(f) hereof until the Settlement Date next
following the date on which such Complete Servicing Transfer shall be
cancelled by a written notification to such effect delivered at any time by
the Agent (which notification shall be delivered only at the written
request of the Required Banks in their sole discretion) to the Seller.

3.3 Maintenance of Records. 

(a) Access, etc. The Seller will hold in trust for the Agent and
the several Banks at the office of the Seller referred to above, or at one
or more of the Seller's branch offices, all Sold Retail Obligations,
together with such books of account and other records as will enable the
Agent or its designee to determine at any time the status thereof. The
Seller will permit the Agent (or Deloitte & Touche on behalf of the Agent
but at the expense of the Seller) at any time and from time to time to
inspect, audit, check and make abstracts from the Seller's books, accounts,
ledger cards, computer and other records, or other papers pertaining to
such Sold Retail Obligations and the Seller will at any time and from time
to time provide access to all information necessary or appropriate for the
Agent (or Deloitte & Touche on behalf of the Agent but at the expense of
the Seller) to review and evaluate the Seller's financial controls and
procedures. 

(b) Delivery of Records and Contracts. From time to time upon
the written request of the Agent, the Seller at its own expense will
deliver to the Agent: (i) a schedule of the Sold Retail Obligations
indicating as to each such Sold Retail Obligation information as to the

Contract evidencing such Sold Retail Obligation and such other information
as the Agent may deem appropriate, and (ii) any such Contract and such
records pertaining thereto as the Agent may deem essential to enable it to
enforce its rights thereunder. In addition, upon the written request of
the Agent, the Seller will deliver all such Contracts and records
pertaining thereto to any agent selected by the Agent. So long as such
Contracts are in possession of the Seller, such Contracts, together with
ledger cards or other account or computer records, if any, relating
thereto, will be held in trust for and kept safely for the Agent in filing
cabinets or other suitable containers. 

(c) Marking of Records. Each computer record relating to Sold
Retail Obligations and all other account records relating to such Sold
Retail Obligations maintained at the principal office of CFC will be marked
with the following legend: "Sold to certain financial institutions party to
a certain Short-Term Retail Purchase and Servicing Agreement dated as of
May 23, 1994 through Royal Bank of Canada acting as agent". 

(d) Segregation of Records. Upon request of the Agent, the
Seller will: (i) segregate from all other receivables then owned or being
serviced by the Seller all Contracts relating to a Sold Retail Obligation; 
(ii) hold in trust and safely keep such Contracts in separate filing
cabinets or other suitable containers marked to show the Agent's and the
Banks' interest with the legend specified in section 3.3(c) above and
maintained in such place or places as shall be designated by the Agent and
(iii) mark all Contracts relating to a Sold Retail Obligation with the
legend specified above.

3.4 Rebates, Adjustments, Returns and Reductions.

(a) The amount of any rebate, refund or adjustment of any Sold
Retail Obligation, the amount owing for any returns or cancellations or the
amount of any other reduction of any payment (including, without limitation
reductions in the anticipated amount of finance charges as the result of
any prepayment of any Sold Retail Obligation) under any Sold Retail
Obligation shall be treated as a collection thereon by the Seller for
purposes of this Agreement and shall: (i) during the period when a Daily
Remittance Notice is in effect, be deposited in the Application Account on
the second Business Day next following the day of such rebate, refund,
adjustment, return or reduction and shall be treated as a collection
thereon in accordance with subsection 3.1(c), and (ii) in all other cases,
be paid to the Agent on the next Settlement Date, provided that, with
respect to the Sold Retail Obligations purchased by the Banks as of any
Date of Sale, the Seller may, in any subsequent period of twelve
consecutive calendar months, extend any one instalment due under any such
Sold Retail Obligation for up to two periods of up to one calendar month
each, and such extensions shall not give rise to a deposit obligation or be
treated as a collection hereunder.

(b) The provisions of this subsection 3.4 shall not affect the
Seller's right to grant or receive any rebates, adjustments, returns or
reductions on any Retail Obligation prior to the Date of Sale thereof.

ARTICLE IV 
ADJUSTMENTS; SETTLEMENTS

4.1 Adjustments. 

(a) Date of Adjustments. Each Settlement Date is hereby
designated as a date for the purpose of making the following discount and
timing adjustments with respect to all collections received by the Seller
(whether (i) remitted to the Agent on the Settlement Date next following
receipt by the Seller or, (ii) in accordance with subsection 3.1(c),
transferred to the Application Account within two Business Days of receipt
by the branch offices of the Seller) in respect of the Sold Retail
Obligations during the Settlement Period next preceding such Settlement
Date.

(b) Anticipated Collections. Not less than five Business Days
prior to each Closing Date hereunder, the Seller shall deliver to the Agent
a schedule setting forth with respect to any sale of Retail Obligations on
such Closing Date, the anticipated collections for each Settlement Period
on the Retail Obligations to be sold to the Banks as of the related Date of
Sale (expressed in cumulative percentages of such Retail Obligations) (each
schedule of anticipated collections for each Settlement Period applicable
to the Sold Retail Obligations purchased on any Closing Date being herein
referred to as an "Anticipated Collection Schedule" applicable to such
Retail Obligations). Each Anticipated Collection Schedule delivered after
the Replacement Effective Date, whether delivered prior to or after the
delivery by the Agent of a Daily Remittance Notice, will be prepared on the
assumption that all amounts collected by the Seller during each Settlement
Period applicable to the Sold Retail Obligations to which such Anticipated
Collection Schedule relates will be received by the Agent on the Settlement
Date applicable to such Sold Retail Obligations next succeeding such
Settlement Period. 

(c) Fast Pay/Slow Pay Adjustments. The Seller does not
guarantee collection of the Sold Retail Obligations. However, with respect
to the Retail Obligations purchased by the Banks hereunder as of any
related Date of Sale, if the cumulative aggregate amount of collections
received by the Seller or, in accordance with subsection 3.1, by the Agent,
for any related Settlement Period on such Retail Obligations purchased by
the Banks as of any related Date of Sale is less than the cumulative
aggregate amount of anticipated collections therefor, the Seller shall pay
the Agent on the next succeeding Settlement Date as a discount adjustment,
an amount determined by multiplying the amount of the Applicable Adjustment
Percentage (as hereinafter defined) of the amount of the deficiency by a
Discount Factor (as hereinafter defined) based upon the Fixed Rate
applicable to such Retail Obligations for the period from and including
such Settlement Date to the next succeeding Settlement Date. On the other
hand, if the cumulative aggregate amount of such collections exceeds the
cumulative aggregate amount of such anticipated collections, the Agent
shall credit to the Seller, as a discount adjustment, an amount determined
by multiplying the Applicable Adjustment Percentage of the amount of the
excess by a Discount Factor based upon the Fixed Rate applicable to such
Retail Obligations for the period from and including such Settlement Date
to the next succeeding Settlement Date. The Primary Retail Deferred
Payment applicable to such Retail Obligations shall be increased by the
amount referred to in the preceding sentence and applied as provided in
section 4.2(c) hereof. 

(d) Applicable Adjustment Percentage. As used herein, the term
"Applicable Adjustment Percentage" shall mean, in respect of any Sold
Retail Obligations purchased by the Banks as of the related Date of Sale,
that percentage determined by dividing: 

(i) the difference between (A) the anticipated amount of
the collections to be received by the Agent on the
Settlement Date next succeeding a Settlement Period
applicable to such Sold Retail Obligations (in
accordance with the assumptions made in preparing the
related Anticipated Collection Schedule) on account of
such Sold Retail Obligations and (B) the anticipated
amount to be released by the Agent to the Seller from
the Primary Retail Deferred Payment applicable to such
Sold Retail Obligations pursuant to subsection 4.2(c),
on such Settlement Date (in accordance with the
assumptions made in preparing the related Anticipated
Collection Schedule), by 

(ii) the anticipated amount of the collections to be
received by the Agent on account of such Sold Retail
Obligations on such Settlement Date (in accordance with
the assumptions made in preparing the related
Anticipated Collection Schedule). 

(e) Discount Factor. As used herein, the term "Discount Factor"
shall mean, with respect to the period from one Settlement Date to the next
succeeding Settlement Date, a fraction, the numerator of which is

(i) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the decimal
equivalent of the Fixed Rate applicable to the purchase
of the relevant Retail Obligations by (B) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days from and
including such Settlement Date to but not including the
next succeeding Settlement Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the year (i.e. 365, or
366 in a leap year), 

and the denominator of which is

(ii) the said numerator described in (i) plus one.

4.2 Settlement Statements; Charging Defaulted Obligations to the
Deferred Payment; Adjustments to the Deferred Payment.

(a) Settlement Statement. Not later than five Business Days
prior to each Settlement Date, until all the Sold Retail Obligations have
been paid in full and all amounts owing to the Agent on account thereof
have been transferred to the Agent, the Seller shall submit to the Agent a
Settlement Statement for each group of Retail Obligations purchased
hereunder or under the 1993 RPA on a related Closing Date, substantially in
the form of Exhibit C hereto, which shall set forth with respect to the
Sold Retail Obligations, among other things: 

(i) the total collections received by the Agent on such
Retail Obligations up to and including the last day of
the next preceding Settlement Period applicable to such
Sold Retail Obligations, including collections pursuant
to subsection 3.4 and collections on Defaulted Retail
Obligations theretofore charged to the Retail Deferred
Payment applicable to such Retail Obligations and for
which the Seller shall not have previously accounted to
the Agent; 

(ii) the balance on such Retail Obligations (A) on which the
obligor thereon is in default in an amount payable
thereon for three or more consecutive months and/or (B)
with respect to which any of the events of the kind
described in clauses (a) through (k) of section 7.1 of
the Short-Term RPA shall have occurred in respect of
the obligor or its assets or liabilities (such Retail
Obligations being herein collectively called "Defaulted
Retail Obligations"); and 

(iii) such other information as the Agent may request for the
purpose of effecting an accounting and settlement hereunder.

The form of Settlement Statement provided in Exhibit C will be varied to
the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions and intent of this
Agreement, it being acknowledged and agreed that in the event of any
inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and any Settlement
Statement delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the provisions of this
Agreement will prevail. If any application of any Retail Deferred Payment
Excess is required on any Settlement Date pursuant to clauses (i), (ii),
(iii), (iv) and (v) of subsection 4.2(c), then concurrently with the
delivery of each Settlement Statement provided for above, the Seller shall
submit to the Agent a further statement or statements in a form to be
agreed upon between the Agent and the Seller, which statement or statements
shall give effect to the application of the Retail Deferred Payment Excess. 

(b) Defaulted Obligations. Subject as hereinafter provided,the
Agent may, at its option, on the Settlement Date on which a Sold Retail
Obligation is first identified as a Defaulted Retail Obligation, charge to
the Retail Deferred Payment related to the group of Sold Retail Obligations
of which such Defaulted Retail Obligation is a part (such related Retail
Deferred Payment being herein called the "Primary Retail Deferred Payment")
an amount equal to the outstanding balance on such Defaulted Retail
Obligation, and the Agent may, at its option, at any time charge any other
amount due with respect to the Sold Retail Obligations (including, without
limitation, amounts payable to the Agent pursuant to subsection 4.1(b), but
without prejudice to any right of the Agent to collect such other amounts
directly from the Seller) which is then owed to the Agent under this
Agreement and which has not been paid by the Seller in accordance with its
terms, to such Primary Retail Deferred Payment; provided that if such
Primary Retail Deferred Payment is less than the outstanding balance on
such Defaulted Retail Obligation or such other amount which is then being
charged thereto, the Agent may charge the difference to any other Retail
Deferred Payment the balance of which has not theretofore been remitted to
the Seller. 

Defaulted Retail Obligations so charged to a Retail Deferred
Payment shall be retained by the Agent, and any collections thereafter made
thereon (together with any other amounts received by the Agent on account
of any other obligation of the Seller theretofore charged to such Retail
Deferred Payment) shall be credited to the applicable Retail Deferred
Payment and shall be dealt with as provided in subsection 4.2(c). 

The Agent agrees with the Banks that in each case where the Agent
exercising the option provided in the first sentence of this subsection
4.2(b) elects not to charge to the Primary Retail Deferred Payment an
amount equal to the outstanding balance on a Sold Retail Obligation at the
time such Sold Retail Obligation is first identified as a Defaulted Retail
Obligation, the Agent shall give the Banks written notice of such election
within 20 days of the exercise thereof, describing in such notice in
reasonably complete detail the circumstances surrounding such election and
explaining why, in the Agent's reasonable opinion and in light of the
circumstances so described, the exercise of such election would not
reasonably be expected to prejudice the interests of the Banks. 

(c) Adjustments to Deferred Payment. If after completion of the
transactions provided for in subsection 4.1(b) and in subsections
4.2(a)(ii) and 4.2(b), in each case on any Settlement Date, the Retail
Deferred Payments applicable to any Sold Retail Obligations exceed the
Required Retail Deferred Payment Level applicable to such Sold Retail
Obligations, then the amount of such excess (herein called the "Retail
Deferred Payment Excess" applicable to such Sold Retail Obligations) shall
be applied in the following order on such Settlement Date:

(i) to the payment to the Agent of amounts thereof up to an
aggregate amount equal to the aggregate amount of the
unpaid balances payable under Defaulted Retail
Obligations purchased on each Closing Date which have
not been charged against their related Primary Retail
Deferred Payments less the aggregate amount of all
previous applications pursuant to this clause 4.2(c)(i)
relative to such Defaulted Retail Obligations purchased
on each such Closing Date (applied firstly to the
payment of such amounts relative to the Defaulted
Retail Obligations purchased on any Closing Date with
the largest aggregate unpaid balance, and then to the
payment of such amounts relative to the Defaulted
Retail Obligations purchased on other Closing Dates in
descending order of their respective aggregate unpaid
balances);

(ii) to the credit of Retail Deferred Payments applicable to
those Sold Retail Obligations whose related Primary
Retail Deferred Payments are in amounts less than their
respective Required Retail Deferred Payment Levels
(applied firstly to the Primary Retail Deferred Payment
with the greatest percentage deficiency relative to its
Required Retail Deferred Payment Level, and then to the
other Primary Retail Deferred Payments in descending
order of their respective percentage deficiencies
relative to their Required Retail Deferred Payment
Levels);

(iii) to the payment of any amounts payable by the
Seller to the Agent under subsection 4.1;

(iv) to the payment of any other amounts payable by the
Seller to the Agent under this Agreement or under the
Short-Term RPA;

(v) to the payment to the Agent of the amounts of any
liabilities, losses, costs, damages and expenses
suffered or incurred by the Agent or any Bank as a
result of any claims or proceedings by obligors under
Contracts which are included in the Sold Retail
Obligations and which relate to the vehicles that are
the subject matter of such Contracts or the financing
thereof; provided that the amount to be applied in
respect of any Retail Obligation under this clause
4.2(c)(v) shall be limited to the unpaid balance of
such Contract on the related Date of Sale; and 

(vi) subject to subsection 4.2(e), any remainder to the Seller.

(d) Required Retail Deferred Payment Level. As used herein, the
term "Required Retail Deferred Payment Level" applicable to any Sold Retail
Obligations shall mean the amount which is the greater of:

(A) the product of (I) the Deferred Percentage (Retail
Gross) with respect to such Retail Obligations
(determined as of such Settlement Date) times (II) the
unpaid balance of all such Retail Obligations, and

(B) the lesser of (I) the then unpaid balance of all such
Retail Obligations or (II) 4% of the sum of the Exact
Retail Amounts Due upon all such Retail Obligations as
of the Date of Sale thereof.

provided, however, that anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the aggregate of the Retail
Deferred Payments applicable to those Retail Obligations which have unpaid
balances of 4% or less of their respective Exact Retail Amounts Due thereon
as of their respective Dates of Sale exceed the greater of (x) $2,287,500
and (y) an amount equal to 5.45% of the maximum value of the Retail Amount
Outstanding on any Settlement Date (the "Maximum"), and if such aggregate
does exceed the Maximum, then the respective amounts of such Retail
Deferred Payments shall be reduced proportionately so that the aggregate
thereof equals the Maximum.

(e) Payments to Seller After Default. After the occurrence of
any material default by the Seller in the observance or performance of any
of the terms or conditions of this Agreement or after the occurrence of any
of the Commitment Termination Events referred to in Article VII of the
Short-Term RPA and so long as such default or event is continuing, any
Retail Deferred Payment Excess applicable to Sold Retail Obligations which
remains after the applications provided for in clauses (i), (ii), (iii),
(iv) and (v) of subsection 4.2(c) shall be paid to the Seller only if at or
prior to the time of such applications the Agent has received repayment in
full of the Banks' investment in the Sold Retail Obligations together with
the total return on such investment contemplated by subsection 2.4(b).

(f) Adjustments in Payments to Banks. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, it is agreed that it is the intention of
the parties that the Banks shall receive repayment of the Banks'
investments in Sold Retail Obligations purchased hereunder and shall
receive an annual rate of return (computed on a monthly basis) on the
Banks' investments in such Sold Retail Obligations for the period from each
Closing Date or Settlement Date, as the case may be, to the next succeeding
Settlement Date at the rates per annum described in subsection 2.4(b), and
that any Retail Deferred Payment Excess which would otherwise be payable to
the Seller on any Settlement Date pursuant to subsection 4.2(c)(vi) shall
be paid to the Agent if and to the extent necessary to give effect to such
intention with respect to the Sold Retail Obligations.

(g) Termination of Agreement. This Agreement will terminate
when all Sold Retail Obligations and all amounts payable to the Agent and
the Banks hereunder shall have been paid in full and any remaining Retail
Deferred Payment Excess shall have been applied in accordance with
subsection 4.2(c), and the Agent and the Banks shall have no further
agreement to purchase Retail Obligations hereunder; provided, however, that
the covenants, representations, warranties and indemnities of the Seller
and CFC to the Agent and the Banks set forth in this Agreement shall
survive such termination.

ARTICLE VII
THE AGENT AND THE BANKS

7.1 For Benefit of Banks Only. The provisions of this Article
VII relating to the rights and obligations the Agent and the Banks inter se
shall be operative as between the Agent and the Banks only, and the Seller
shall have no rights hereunder or be entitled to rely for any purposes upon
such provisions.

7.2 Status of Agent. The Banks hereby confirm that the Agent
shall act as their administrative agent hereunder on their behalf in
accordance with and pursuant to Article VIII of the Short-Term RPA, and,
for greater certainty but without restricting the generality of the
foregoing, the Banks confirm that the Agent is irrevocably authorized and
directed to do all such things as may be necessary or reasonably incidental
to administering all collections and disbursements hereunder and to make
all such determinations and take all such actions as may be required from
time to time hereunder. Except as expressly modified or supplemented
herein, the Agent's rights, duties and liabilities hereunder shall be
governed by Article VIII of the Short-Term RPA in its entirety, including
without limitation all such provisions thereof relating to delegation of
duties, exculpation, reliance by the Agent, notice of default, non-reliance
on the Agent, and indemnification.

7.3 Purchase and Sale.

(a) Agreements to Purchase and Sell. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Short-Term RPA, each Bank
hereby severally confirms and agrees with the Agent that on each Closing
Date it will purchase, with the Agent acting as intermediary as provided
herein, an undivided ownership interest in the Retail Obligations purchased
on such date equal to such Bank's Purchase Percentage of such Retail
Obligations for a portion of the purchase price calculated in accordance
with subsection 7.3(c)(i), and each Bank severally agrees with the Agent to
pay such Bank's respective portion of the Purchase Price on the terms and
conditions provided in this Article VII.

(b) Ownership Percentages. Each Bank's undivided interest in
the Sold Retail Obligations shall be, at any time, equal to such Bank's
Ownership Percentage thereof.

(c) Purchase Price; Adjustments on Account of Exact Amounts Due.

(i) Computation. The portion of the Purchase Price to be
paid by each several Bank for its addition to its
Ownership Interest in each group of Retail Obligations
purchased hereunder shall be an amount equal to such
Bank's Purchase Percentage of the Retail Paid
Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due required
to be paid by the Agent to the Seller under this
Agreement on the Closing Date on which such Retail
Obligations are sold, plus or minus the amount of any
subsequent adjustment required by this subsection
7.3(c)(i) and subsections 7.6 and 7.7.

(ii) Effect of Purchase. Immediately upon the purchase, as
aforesaid, by a Bank of an addition to its Ownership
Interest, such Bank's Ownership Interest shall increase
by an amount equal to the purchase price paid by such
Bank for such addition on such date. 

(iii) Remittances - Estimated Amounts. Promptly after
receipt by the Agent of notice from the Seller
designating a Closing Date, the Agent shall notify each
Bank thereof, and: 

(A) promptly after receipt by the Agent of the
Seller's advice as to the Estimated Weighted
Average Life and the Estimated Fixed Rate Purchase
Proceeds, the Agent shall give notice to each Bank
of such estimates as well as the Estimated Fixed
Rate substantially in the form of Exhibit E
hereto; 

(B) each Bank will promptly give notice to the Agent
of its Bank's BA/CDOR Spread and its Bank's
Reserve Adjustment by 10:30 a.m. (Toronto time) on
the Fixed Rate Determination Date substantially in
the form of Exhibit F-1 hereto, whereupon the
Agent will by 11:00 a.m. (Toronto time) calculate
and advise the Seller of the Fixed Rate by notice
substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 hereto; 

(C) promptly after receipt by the Agent on a Fixed
Rate Determination Date of the Seller's advice as
to the Weighted Average Life of the Retail
Obligations to be purchased by the Banks on the
Closing Date as well as the Retail Paid Percentage
of the Estimated Retail Amount Due upon the Retail
Obligations to be purchased, the Agent will give
notice to each Bank thereof as well as the amount
of such Bank's Purchase Percentage of the Retail
Paid Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due
upon such Retail Obligations substantially in the
form of Exhibit G hereto; and 

(D) the Bank will remit payment of its Purchase
Percentage of the Retail Paid Percentage of the
Estimated Retail Amount Due upon such Retail
Obligations to the Agent for receipt by the Agent
not later than 12:00 noon (Toronto time) on such
Closing Date. 

(iv) Remittances - Exact Amounts. Promptly after receipt by
the Agent from the Seller of the statement of the Exact
Retail Amount Due upon the Retail Obligations purchased
by the Banks on any Closing Date, the Agent will advise
each Bank by giving notice substantially in the form of
Exhibit H hereto of:

(A) the amount of any payment to be made by the Agent
to the Seller under subsection 2.4(a) as an
adjustment (to reflect correction of estimates) of
the Estimated Retail Amount Due upon such Retail
Obligations; and 

(B) the amount of such Bank's share of such payment
calculated on a pro rata basis according to such
Bank's Purchase Percentage of such Retail
Obligations. 

Each Bank shall remit to the Agent, for receipt by the
Agent not later than 12:00 noon (Toronto time) on the
next Business Day following delivery of such advice to
such Bank, the amount of such Bank's share of such
payment. If the Exact Retail Amount Due upon the
Retail Obligations purchased by the Banks on any
Closing Date is less than the Estimated Retail Amount
Due upon such Retail Obligations, then upon receipt by
the Agent of the payment by the Seller to be made
pursuant to subsection 2.4(a), the Agent will promptly
remit the proceeds thereof to the Banks pro rata
according to their respective Purchase Percentages of
such Retail Obligations.

(d) Confirmation of Ownership Interests. Promptly after each
Settlement Date if there remains outstanding any Sold Retail Obligation,
the Agent will send to each Bank a written confirmation of such Bank's
Ownership Interest in the Sold Retail Obligations as of such Settlement
Date. The Agent shall hold this Agreement, all Sold Retail Obligations and
all funds on deposit in the Application Account (until paid to the Banks in
accordance with the terms hereof) for the benefit of the Banks in
accordance with the provisions and intent of this Agreement until the
Ownership Interests of the Banks have been reduced to zero and their
commitment to purchase has been terminated.

7.4 Maximum Amounts of Purchases. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no Bank shall be required to
purchase an addition to its Ownership Interest, whether under subsections
7.3(a) or 7.3(c), such that after giving effect thereto (whether based upon
estimated or exact statements of the amount due) the amount of such Bank's
Ownership Interest would exceed the difference between (A) the Bank's
Commitment Amount and (B) the Bank's Purchase Percentage of the Short-Term
Wholesale Aggregate Invested Amount.

7.5 Sharing of Earned Discounts: Each Bank's pro rata share of
the aggregate amount of the discounts deducted by the Agent in computing
the purchase price of the Retail Obligations purchased under this Agreement
which shall have been earned by such Bank shall be calculated on the basis
that such Bank's annual rate of return (computed on a monthly basis) on its
investment calculated with respect to each Sold Retail Obligation shall be
equal to the Applicable Yield for such Sold Retail Obligation calculated as
if references to the "Blended BA/CDOR Spread" and "Blended Reserve
Adjustment" in the definition of "Fixed Rate" were references to the
related "Bank's BA/CDOR Spread" and "Bank's Reserve Adjustment" for such
Bank.

7.6 Distributions to Banks of Payments Received by Agent.

(a) Collections: All payments received by the Agent from the
Seller or otherwise on account of collection of amounts owing or payable on
or in respect of Sold Retail Obligations, or on account of the adjustments
required pursuant to Article IV with respect to such Sold Retail
Obligations, and any interest and other payments relating to such Sold
Retail Obligations which are received by the Agent from the Seller and
which are to be shared by all the Banks according to the provisions and
intent of this Agreement (other than the payments referred to below in
subsections 7.6(b), (c) and (d)), will be promptly remitted by the Agent to
the Banks (i) firstly, to the extent of the aggregate amount of the
discounts deducted by the Agent in computing the purchase price of all Sold
Retail Obligations which shall have been earned and not yet remitted
hereunder, pro rata according to their respective shares of the earned
discount calculated in accordance with subsection 7.5; and (ii) secondly,
to the extent of the balance, pro rata according to their respective
Purchase Percentages. 

(b) All payments received by the Agent on account of the
commitment fee required pursuant to the Short-Term RPA shall be promptly
remitted by the Agent to the Banks pro rata according to their respective
Purchase Percentages. 

(c) All payments received by the Agent on account of the
Facility Fees and Utilization Fees required by the Short-Term RPA and on
account of the reimbursement by the Seller for the costs, expenses, claims
and liabilities of the Agent shall be retained by the Agent for its own
account.

(d) All payments received by the Agent for the account of any
Bank pursuant to Article IX of the Short-Term RPA shall be promptly
remitted by the Agent to such Bank.

7.7 Further Payments on Account of Deferred Payment Excesses and
Timing Adjustments. Promptly after receipt by the Agent of each Settlement
Statement applicable to Sold Retail Obligations purchased by the Banks on
any Closing Date, the Agent will advise each Bank of (i) the amount of any
payment to be made by the Agent to the Seller on the relevant Settlement
Date pursuant to subsection 4.2(c)(vi) out of the Retail Deferred Payment
Excess applicable to any Sold Retail Obligations, and (ii) the amount of
such Bank's share of any such payments calculated on a pro rata basis
according to such Bank's Purchase Percentage. Each Bank shall remit to the
Agent, for receipt by the Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on
such Settlement Date, the amount of such Bank's share of any such payments.

7.8 Mechanics of Payments

(a) Payments by Banks. All payments to be remitted hereunder by
the Banks to the Agent shall be paid by the Banks to the credit of an
account maintained by the Agent at its branch located at Royal Bank Plaza,
200 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario entitled "Chrysler Credit Canada Ltd.
Banks' Remittance Account".

(b) Payments by the Agent. All payments to be remitted
hereunder by the Agent to the Banks shall be promptly remitted by the Agent
to them at their respective offices in Toronto after receipt from the
Seller, and in any event any payments received by the Agent from the Seller
by 2:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on any day will be remitted to the Banks by
4:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the same day.

7.9 Actions by Agent.

(a) Exercise of Rights. 

(i) The Agent shall have the right but shall be under no
obligation: (A) to exercise any of the rights and powers which it has or
may have under or in respect of this Agreement or any Sold Retail
Obligation or any related document or instrument, (B) to take any actions
or proceedings to enforce any of the obligations or liabilities of the
Seller or CFC under or in respect of this Agreement or of the obligor or
any other person under or in respect of any Sold Retail Obligation or any
related document or instrument, or (C) to take any actions or proceedings
to realize upon or enforce the security or any of the other rights
constituted by any Sold Retail Obligation or any related document or
instrument. The Agent will advise the other Banks of any material actions
taken or proposed to be taken by it under this Agreement. 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection 7.9(a)(i), the
Agent will exercise any such rights or powers or take any such actions or
proceedings when expressly requested in writing to do so by Banks having a
then aggregate Ownership Percentage of more than 50%, or if there are no
Sold Retail Obligations, by Banks having a then aggregate Purchase
Percentage of more than 50%, following a meeting to which all Banks have
been invited on not less than two Business Days' notice to discuss the
proposed request; provided, however, that (A) the Agent shall under no
circumstances be under any obligation to take over itself the
administration, servicing and collection of any of the Sold Retail
Obligations pursuant to subsection 3.2(f) of this Agreement, and (B) any
decision to deliver a Daily Remittance Notice to the Seller in accordance
with subsection 3.1(c) of this Agreement or to take over the
administration, servicing and collection of any of the Sold Retail
Obligations pursuant to subsection 3.2(f) of this Agreement may only be
taken upon the written request of the Required Banks.

(b) Complete Servicing Transfer. If the administration,
servicing and collection of the Sold Retail Obligations is taken over by
the Agent or by one of the other Banks as the Agent's designee pursuant to
subsection 3.2(f) of this Agreement, then the Agent or such other Bank
shall be reimbursed its costs and expenses in connection with such
administration, servicing and collection on a basis to be agreed upon by
all the Banks at that time. If such administration, servicing and
collection is taken over by a third party selected by the Banks, then the
costs and expenses of such third party will be paid severally by all the
Banks pro rata according to their respective Ownership Percentages at the
time when such costs or expenses were incurred or accrued. This subsection
7.9(b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 

(c) Recovery From Seller or CFC. Any amounts paid by the Banks
to the Agent under subsection 7.9(b) hereof which are subsequently
recovered by the Agent from the Seller or CFC will be repaid by the Agent
to the Banks.

7.10 Non-Performance by Bank. 

(a) Consequences of Default. In the event any Bank (in
this section 7.10 the "Defaulting Bank") shall fail to perform any
obligation to be performed by it hereunder, the Agent may terminate, and
thereby acquire, or place with other parties, the entire Ownership Interest
of such Defaulting Bank in the Sold Retail Obligations (whereupon such
Defaulting Bank shall cease to have an interest in such Sold Retail
Obligations) without, however, relieving such Defaulting Bank from any
liability for damages, costs and expenses suffered by the Agent or any
other Bank as a result of such failure on the part of such Defaulting Bank. 
For the purposes of any distributions to Banks of the amounts referred to
in subsection 7.6(a) pursuant to clause (ii) of subsection 7.6(a), the
Purchase Percentage of any Defaulting Bank shall be adjusted appropriately
to reflect such Defaulting Bank's remaining Ownership Interest. For the
purposes of any distributions to Banks of the amounts referred to in
subsections 7.6(a) or 7.6(b), the Purchase Percentage of any Defaulting
Bank shall be deemed to be nil from and after the time of default. 

(b) Purchase of Defaulting Bank's Interest. Without limiting
the foregoing, in the event that the Defaulting Bank shall fail to remit to
the Agent on any Closing Date such Bank's portion of the Retail Paid
Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due on such date, then each other
Bank whose Maximum Commitment is not then fully utilized (after giving
effect to any purchase on such date other than the purchase described in
this subsection 7.10) agrees to purchase, in an amount not exceeding the
such Bank's Available Commitment, such Defaulting Bank's addition to its
Ownership Interest in the Sold Retail Obligation to be purchased on such
date and shall pay to the Agent, as the purchase price therefor, an amount
determined for each Bank (other than the Defaulting Bank) by multiplying
(i) the lesser of (A) such Defaulting Bank's portion of the Paid Percentage
of the Estimated Retail Amount Due on such date or (B) the sum of each
Bank's Available Commitment (other than the Defaulting Bank) times (ii) the
then percentage equivalent of a fraction the numerator of which is such
Bank's Available Commitment and the denominator of which is the sum of each
Bank's Available Commitment (other than the Defaulting Bank). Any
additional interest purchased by a Bank pursuant to this subsection 7.10
shall be deemed a part of such Bank's investment for purposes of the
definition of "Ownership Interest" as of the date of such purchase. The
purchase of an additional interest pursuant to this subsection 7.10 shall
not relieve the Defaulting Bank from any liability for damages, costs and
expenses suffered by the Seller, the Agent or any other Bank as a result of
such failure on the part of such Defaulting Bank. 

(c) Liability of Banks to Agent. Each Bank hereby expressly
acknowledges that it shall be liable for any damages, costs or expenses
suffered by the Seller, the Agent or any other Bank as a result of any
failure to remit to the Agent on any Closing Date its portion of the Retail
Paid Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due including, without
limitation, in the case of the Seller, all damages suffered as a result of
any failure of the Agent to purchase any Retail Obligations pursuant to
subsection 2.1.

7.11 Information. The Agent will forward or make available, as
it deems appropriate, to each Bank copies of

(a) each Settlement Statement received by the Agent from the
Seller; and

(b) all other documents or information so received and
considered pertinent by the Agent or reasonably requested by
the Bank.

WHEREAS the parties hereto wish to replace the 1993 RPA in

NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the premises and of the

RPA.

ARTICLE II - AMOUNT AND TERMS OF COMMITMENTS

2.1 Replacement. Upon the Replacement Effective Date, the 1993
Commitments shall be terminated. If any 1993 Long-Term Carried-Over
Invested Amount is then outstanding and the 1993 Related Documents are not
terminated pursuant to the 1993 Termination Agreement, such 1993 Long-Term
Carried-Over Invested Amount shall remain outstanding under and pursuant to
the 1993 RPA and the 1993 Related Documents, provided that, as set forth in
the definitions of 1993 Long-Term Carried-Over Invested Amount and
Aggregate 1994 Invested Amount, such 1993 Long-Term Carried-Over Invested
Amount shall be credited to reduce the Banks' obligations to make Purchases
hereunder.

2.2 Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
during the Commitment Period each Bank severally agrees to purchase from
the Retail Seller, Retail Obligations (each such purchase, a "Retail
Purchase") and to purchase from the Wholesale Sellers undivided ownership
interests in Wholesale Pooled Property (each such purchase, a "Wholesale
Purchase") in amounts such that at any one time such Bank's Purchase
Percentage of the Long-Term Aggregate Invested Amount shall not exceed such
Bank's Commitment Amount.

2.3 Related Documents. 

(a) Long-Term Retail PSA. Retail Purchases hereunder shall be
made pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Long-Term Retail PSA.

(b) Long-Term Wholesale Series Supplement. Wholesale Purchases
hereunder shall be made pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Long-
Term Wholesale Series Supplement, and each Bank's undivided ownership
interests in the Wholesale Pooled Property shall be evidenced by a Long-
Term Wholesale Certificate issued to such Bank pursuant to the Wholesale
PSA and the Long-Term Wholesale Series Supplement.

2.4 Procedure for Purchase. 

(a) Seller Procedure. The Sellers may utilize the Commitments
during the Commitment Period on any Business Day, provided that:

(i) Notice. CCCL shall give the Agent irrevocable notice
in the form of, and containing the particulars set out
in, Schedule 2.4 hereto (which notice must be received
by the Agent prior to 10:00 a.m., Toronto time, at
least five Business Days prior to the requested
Purchase Date); and

(ii) Minimum Purchase Amount. On each Purchase Date, the
Purchases under the Commitments will be in an aggregate
amount equal to at least $5,000,000 in respect of a
Retail Purchase and $10,000,000 in respect of a
Wholesale Purchase. 

(b) Agent/Bank Deposit Procedure. Upon receipt of any such
notice from CCCL, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each
Bank shall deposit in the Clearing Account an amount in immediately
available funds equal to the amount of the Purchase Price or portion
thereof required to be paid by it in respect of such Purchase prior to
11:00 a.m., Toronto time, on the Purchase Date requested. The Agent shall
cause all such amounts to be withdrawn from the Clearing Account and shall
make the aggregate amount so withdrawn available to the Seller by
depositing the proceeds thereof in the account of the Seller with the
Agent.

2.5 Utilization Fee. CCCL agrees to pay to the Agent for the
account of each Bank an additional fee (the "Utilization Fee") in respect
of each month during which Utilization exceeds 33-1/3%, from and including
the Replacement Effective Date to but excluding the later of (i) the
Commitment Termination Date and (ii) the date on which the Long-Term
Aggregate Invested Amount is zero (such later date, the "Final Date"). The
Utilization Fee shall be payable monthly in arrears on (a) the first
Business Day of each calendar month (or portion thereof) and (b) on the
Final Date (for the period ended on such date for which no payment has been
received pursuant to clause (a) above) (each such month or period, a
"Utilization Period"). The Utilization Fee for each Utilization Period
shall be equal to the product of (x) the average daily Long-Term Aggregate
Invested Amount during such Utilization Period, (y) an annual rate equal to
.125% and (z) a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of
days elapsed in the Utilization Period and the denominator of which is 365
(or 366, in leap years). 

2.6 Facility Fee. The Seller shall pay to the Agent for the
account of each Bank, a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") for each day from
and including the Replacement Effective Date to but excluding the Final
Date. Such Facility Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on (a) the
first Business Day of each of January, April, July and October (for the
three-month period (or portion thereof) ended on the last day of the
immediately preceding month) and (b) on the Final Date (for the period
ended on such date for which no payment has been received pursuant to
clause (a) above) (each such period, a "Fee Period"). The Facility Fee for
each Fee Period shall be an amount equal to the product of (x) the average
daily Long-Term Commitment Amount during such Fee Period, (y) an annual
rate equal to the Long-Term Facility Fee Percentage, and (z) a fraction the
numerator of which is the actual number of days elapsed in the Fee Period
and the denominator of which is 365 (or 366, in leap years). 

2.7 Default Interest. Facility Fees, Utilization Fees or other
fees that are not paid when due shall bear interest, payable on demand,
from the date when due until paid in full (both before and after judgment)
at the Default Rate. 

2.8 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Sellers may
terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, reduce the Long-Term
Commitment Amount, provided that:

(a) Notice. CCCL shall give the Agent irrevocable notice in the
form of and containing the particulars set out in Schedule 2.8 (which
notice must be received by the Agent at least five Business Days prior to
such cancellation or reduction);

(b) Fees. On the date of any such cancellation CCCL shall pay
in full any accrued and unpaid Facility Fees, Utilization Fees or other
amounts owing to the Agent or the Banks hereunder; and

(c) Minimum Reduction. Any such reduction shall be in an amount
at least equal to $5,000,000 and be a whole multiple of $1,000,000 and
shall permanently reduce the Long-Term Commitment Amount then in effect.

2.9 Increase in Commitments.

From time to time the Seller may propose to the Agent in
writing that the Long-Term Commitment Amount be increased either by
increasing the Commitment of one or more Banks (each, an "Increasing Bank")
or by introducing one or more new Chartered Banks as a Bank hereunder
(each, a "New Bank"). Each proposed increase will be subject to receipt by
the Agent of the prior written consent of each Increasing Bank whose
Commitment is proposed to be increased and shall become effective upon
receipt by the Agent of duly executed supplements as provided in subsection
10.1 of this Long-Term RPA evidencing an aggregate increase in Commitment
Amounts equal to the aggregate amount of such increase in respect of the
Increasing Bank's Commitment or New Bank's Commitment, as applicable, and,
in the case of a New Bank, duly executed counterparts of this Long-Term RPA
and the Related Documents evidencing the addition of such New Bank as a
party thereto and a Long-Term Wholesale Certificate duly certified by the
Custodian and issued to such New Bank in accordance with the Wholesale PSA. 
From and after the date on which any such proposed increase becomes
effective pursuant to the provisions of this subsection 2.9, the aggregate
dollar amount set forth in the definition of "Long-Term Commitment Amount"
in this Long-Term RPA shall be increased by the amount so proposed by the
Seller in respect of the Increasing Banks' or New Banks' Commitments. No
such increase shall diminish or otherwise affect the entitlement of any
Bank to any amounts payable hereunder or under the Related Documents in
respect of any Purchases made prior to the date such increase becomes
effective.

2.10 Rate of Return. 

(a) Retail. The rate of return or yield due to the Banks on all
or any portion of their investment in Retail Obligations shall be as set
forth in the Long-Term Retail PSA.

(b) Wholesale. The rate of return or yield due to the Banks on
all or any portion of their investment in Wholesale Pooled Property shall
be as set forth in the Long-Term Wholesale Series Supplement.

2.11 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. 

(a) Pro Rata Treatment. Each Purchase hereunder, each payment
by CCCL on account of any Facility Fees and Utilization Fees hereunder and
any reduction of the Long-Term Commitment Amount shall be made according to
the respective Purchase Percentages of each of the Banks. 

(b) Payments to Agent. All payments (including prepayments) by
any CCCL Party shall be made to the Agent for the account of the Banks or
the Agent, as applicable, by 2:00 p.m., Toronto time, at the office of the
Agent referred set out in the signature pages hereto in Dollars, in
immediately available funds and without set-off or counterclaim. 

(c) Distribution of Payments by Agent. The Agent shall promptly
distribute such payments to each Bank entitled to receive a portion thereof
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Long-Term RPA, the
Long-Term Retail PSA and the Long-Term Wholesale Series Supplement at the
respective office of each such Bank in Toronto set out opposite such Bank's
name on the signature pages hereto and in any event any payments received
by the Agent from the Seller by 2:00 p.m., Toronto time, on any day will be
distributed to each Bank by 4:00 p.m., Toronto time, on the same day.

2.12 Addition of Wholesale Sellers. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, from time to
time a Designated Affiliate may become an additional Wholesale Seller (an
"Additional Wholesale Seller") provided that: 

(i) the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7.04(b)
of the Wholesale PSA have been satisfied;

(ii) the Designated Affiliate executes a Supplement to this
Long-Term RPA and a Wholesale PSA Supplement to the
Wholesale PSA; and

(iii) the Designated Affiliate executes a Wholesale
Assignment and Assumption Agreement, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Agent. 

(b) A Designated Affiliate shall become an Additional Wholesale
Seller effective on the date (the "Additional Seller Date") that the Agent
has received a certificate of a Responsible Officer of CCCL stating that
all conditions precedent to the addition of such Wholesale Seller as a
party have been satisfied. From and after the Additional Seller Date with
respect to each Additional Wholesale Seller, through but excluding the
Additional Seller Date with respect to any successive Additional Wholesale
Seller, all Wholesale Purchases shall be made from the Active Wholesale
Seller. 

(c) CCCL hereby unconditionally and irrevocably covenants and
agrees that it will cause each Additional Wholesale Seller duly and
punctually to perform and observe all of the terms, conditions, covenants,
agreements and indemnities of each Additional Wholesale Seller under this
Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents strictly in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof, and that if for any reason whatsoever, any such
Additional Wholesale Seller shall fail to so perform and observe such
terms, conditions, covenants, agreements and indemnities, CCCL will duly
and punctually perform and observe the same. The provisions of Sections
6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 of this Long-Term RPA shall apply mutatis mutandis to this
guarantee by CCCL.

of this Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents and to exercise such powers
and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the
terms of this Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents, together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in this Long-Term RPA, the Agent shall not have
any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or

duties under this Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents by or through
agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-
fact selected by it with reasonable care.

8.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agent, nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates
(except the Custodian in its capacity as such) shall be:

(a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken
by it or such Person under or in connection with this Long-
Term RPA or any Related Document (except for its or such
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or 

(b) responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
any CCCL Party or any officer thereof contained in this
Long-Term RPA or any Related Document or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided
for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection
with, this Long-Term RPA or any Related Document or for the
value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of this Long-Term RPA or any Related Document
or for any failure of any CCCL Party to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. 

The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Bank to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Long-Term RPA or any
Related Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any
CCCL Party.

8.4 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy,
telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or
conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to any
CCCL Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take
any action under this Long-Term RPA or any Related Document unless it shall
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Banks as it deems
appropriate and be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any
and all Liabilities and Costs which may be incurred by it by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents in accordance with a request of the
Required Banks, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks.

8.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Commitment Termination Event

that the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof
to the Banks. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such
Commitment Termination Event as shall be reasonably directed by the
Required Banks; provided that unless and until the Agent shall have
received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Commitment Termination Event, as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Banks.

8.6 Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Banks. Each Bank expressly
acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates (except the Custodian in
its capacity as such) has made any representations or warranties to it and
that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the
affairs of the CCCL Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents
to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into
the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the CCCL Parties, the Retail Obligations and the
Wholesale Obligations and made its own decision to make its Purchases
hereunder and enter into this Long-Term RPA and the other Related Documents
to which it is a party. Each Bank also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, or any other Bank, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Long-Term RPA and the Related
Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the CCCL Parties, the Retail Obligations
and the Wholesale Obligations. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent
hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide
any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business,
operations, property, financial or other condition, prospects or
creditworthiness of the CCCL Parties, the Retail Obligations or the
Wholesale Obligations which may come into the possession of the Agent or
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates.

8.7 Indemnification of Agent. The Banks agree to indemnify the
Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the
CCCL Parties and without limiting the obligation of the CCCL Parties to do
so), ratably according to their respective Purchase Percentages, from and
against any and all Liabilities and Costs which may at any time (including,
without limitation, at any time following the termination of this Long-Term
RPA and the Related Documents) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agent, in any way relating to or arising out of this Long-Term
RPA, any of the Related Documents or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection
with any of the foregoing including without limitation all Liabilities and
Costs imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent: 

(a) in exercising any of the rights and powers which the Agent
may have under or in respect of this Long-Term RPA or any
Related Document or any Retail Obligation or Wholesale
Obligation or any related document or instrument, or in
taking any actions or proceedings to enforce any of the
obligations or liabilities of any CCCL Party under or in
respect of this Long-Term RPA or any Related Document or of
the obligor or any other Person under or in respect of any
Retail Obligation or Wholesale Obligation or any related
document or instrument, or in taking any actions or
proceedings to realize upon or enforce the security or any
of the other rights constituted by any Retail Obligation or
Wholesale Obligation or any related document or instrument;
or 

(b) resulting or arising from any claims, demands, suits,
actions or other proceedings brought by or on behalf of any
of the obligors or other parties under or in respect of any
of the Retail Obligations or Wholesale Obligations or the
vehicles financed thereby;

provided that no Bank (other than Royal) shall be liable for the payment of
any portion of such Liabilities and Costs, resulting solely from the
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

8.8 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in
any kind of business with the CCCL Parties as though the Agent were not the
Agent hereunder and under the Related Documents. With respect to any
Interests the Agent in its individual capacity as a Bank may from time to
time hold, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Long-
Term RPA and the Related Documents as any Bank and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall
include the Agent in its individual capacity. 

8.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 10
days' notice to the Banks. If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this
Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents, then the Required Banks shall
appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks, which
successor agent shall be approved by CCCL, whereupon such successor agent
shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent, and the term
"Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its appointment, and
the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated,
without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent
or any of the parties to this Long-Term RPA. After any retiring Agent's
resignation as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall enure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent under this Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents. 

8.10 Exchange of Information. The CCCL Parties agree that each
of the Banks and the Agent may provide to any of the others of them such
information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and
other condition and creditworthiness of the CCCL Parties, Retail
Obligations or the Wholesale Obligations, as, in the opinion of such Bank
or the Agent, is relevant under or in connection with this Long-Term RPA
and the Related Documents.

contrary contained in this Long-Term RPA, the Agent may net against any
amount which is payable by the Agent to any Bank pursuant to this Long-Term
RPA, any amount which is payable by such Bank to the Agent pursuant to this
Long-Term RPA.

8.12 Survival. The agreements in this Article VIII shall survive
termination of this Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents.

8.13 For Benefit of Banks Only. The provisions of this Article
relating to the rights and obligations of the Agent and the Banks inter se
shall be operative as between the Agent and the Banks only, and no CCCL
Party shall have any rights hereunder or be entitled to rely for any
purposes upon such provisions.

enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Long-
Term RPA, the Related Documents and any such other documents
(including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
one counsel to the Agent and to the several Banks), 

(d) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Bank and the Agent harmless
from, any and all recording and filing fees and any and all
Liabilities and Costs with respect to any licence fees,
duties and taxes (including without limitation any goods and
services, sales, use, stamp, excise, gross receipts or
personal property taxes), and other assessments which may at
any time be payable, if any, or determined to be payable or
asserted in connection with the execution and delivery of,
or consummation or administration of any of the transactions

Obligations or the Wholesale Pooled Property, 

(e) to pay, indemnify and hold each Bank and the Agent harmless
from and against all Liabilities and Costs arising from the
Retail Contracts and the Wholesale Contracts or the
underlying collateral (including any product warranty
related claims, but excluding credit losses), 

(f) to pay, indemnify and hold each Bank and the Agent harmless
from and against all Liabilities and Costs arising from the
inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations and
warranties contained in this Long-Term RPA or the Related
Documents or the failure of any CCCL Party to perform or
observe any covenants, agreements or other terms or
provisions contained in this Long-Term RPA and the Related
Documents, and

(g) to indemnify the Agent and each Bank from and against
Liabilities and Costs (other than legal fees and
disbursements) of any kind whatsoever (and, with respect to
any proceeding or related proceedings, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of one firm of counsel to the relevant
Banks in connection with such proceeding(s)) which may at
any time (including, without limitation, at any time
following repayment of the Long-Term Aggregate Invested
Amount) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such
Bank in any way relating to or arising out of this Long-Term
RPA, the Guarantee, the Related Documents or any other
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
action taken or omitted by such Bank under or in connection
with any of the foregoing,

(all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified
Liabilities"),

provided, that CCCL shall have no obligation hereunder to
the Agent or any Bank with respect to Indemnified Liabilities arising from
(i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent, its Affiliates
or any such Bank, (ii) legal proceedings commenced against the Agent, its
Affiliates or any such Bank by any security holder or creditor thereof
arising out of and based upon rights afforded any such security holder or
creditor solely in its capacity as such, or (iii) legal proceedings
commenced against the Agent, its Affiliates or any such Bank by any other
Bank or by any Transferee and further provided, that the Indemnified
Liabilities referred to in (d) shall not include, with respect to any Bank,
any taxes imposed on the net income of such Bank except to the extent that
(i) such taxes are payable by such Bank as a consequence of (A) the
Investor Master Custodial Certificate held by such Bank not being
characterized as evidencing an undivided ownership interest in the
Wholesale Pooled Property or (B) the Custodial Arrangement (as defined in
the Wholesale PSA) not being characterized solely as an agency and (ii) as
a result of such characterization the amount of taxes payable by such Bank
exceeds the amount of taxes that would have been payable had (C) the
Investor Master Custodial Certificates been characterized as evidencing an
undivided ownership interest in the Wholesale Pooled Property or the
Custodial Arrangement and (D) the Custodial Arrangement been characterized
solely as an agency. 

9.2 Statements, Reports etc. All statements, reports,
certificates, opinions and other documents or information required to be
furnished to the Banks or the Agent by the Seller under this Long-Term RPA
shall be supplied by the Seller, without cost to the Banks or the Agent.

9.3 Increased Costs. In the event that any Applicable Law or
any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof or
compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
enacted or made subsequent to the date hereof:

(a) does or shall subject such Bank to any Tax, or change
the basis of taxation or increase any existing Tax, on
payments of any amounts payable by the Seller to such
Bank (except for taxes on the overall net income of
such Bank imposed by the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated or resident or from which it is acting for
the purposes of this Long-Term RPA, but including taxes
on capital or other similar taxes);

(b) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
requirement against assets held by, or deposits or
other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or
loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank; or

(c) does or shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank
of purchasing or holding any such Bank's Interests hereunder or to reduce
any amount receivable in respect thereof (such increase in costs or
reduction in amounts receivable, "Increased Costs") then, in any such case,
the Seller shall promptly pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank,
upon the written demand of such Bank to the Seller (with a copy to the
Agent), so long as such Increased Costs are not otherwise included in the
amounts required to be paid to such Bank pursuant to Section 9.4, 9.5 or
9.6, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such
Increased Costs which such Bank deems to be material as determined by such
Bank with respect to its Purchases. If a Bank becomes entitled to claim
any additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly notify
the Seller, through the Agent, of the event by reason of which it has
become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by a Bank, through the Agent,
to the Seller shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

9.4 Reemployment Costs. CCCL agrees to indemnify each Bank and
to hold each Bank harmless from any Liabilities and Costs, including, but
not limited to, any such Liabilities and Costs arising from interest or
fees payable by such Bank to lenders of funds obtained by it to purchase or
hold such Bank's Interests, which such Bank may sustain or incur as a
consequence of:

(a) default by the Seller in the performance of its obligations
hereunder; or 

(b) default by the Seller in selling Interests on a Purchase
Date or in converting or continuing the annual rate of
return to or in, as applicable, a rate based on a Bank's BA
Rate, in each case after having given notice of a sale or
electing to have the Bank's BA Rate applied; or 

(c) the application of any collections in reduction of such
Bank's investment in the Interests at any time such that any
portion of the Long-Term Aggregate Invested Amount in
respect of which the Seller elects to have the rate of
return based on a Bank's BA Rate for bankers' acceptances
maturing over a period of time ending on a Distribution Date
does not remain outstanding during the entire period for
which such Bank's BA Rate is to apply, or 

(d) the Exact Retail Amount Due (as defined in the Long-Term
Retail PSA) upon Retail Obligations purchased by the Bank on
a Fixed Rate basis being different from the Estimated Retail
Amount Due (as defined in the Long-Term Retail PSA) upon
such Retail Obligations. A certificate as to any additional
amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted
by a Bank to CCCL shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

9.5 Changes in Capital Requirements. 

(a) In the event that, in the opinion of counsel for any Bank
(which may, in the discretion of such Bank, be such Bank's internal
counsel), compliance with any law, rule, regulation or guideline, or any
change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, or
compliance by any Bank with any request or directive from any central bank
or Governmental Authority (whether or not such requirement has the force of
law) enacted or made subsequent to the date hereof shall affect the amount
of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any
corporation controlling such Bank and the amount of such capital that is
required or expected to be maintained is increased by or based upon the
Commitment of such Bank under this Long-Term RPA (such requirement, a
"Change in Capital Requirement"), such Bank shall so notify CCCL and the
Agent within one-hundred eighty (180) days after such Bank shall have
obtained actual knowledge of the costs associated with its compliance with
such Change in Capital Requirement (but in no event later than 365 days
after such Bank is first required to comply with such Change in Capital
Requirement).

(b) At the time of such notification such affected Bank shall
provide CCCL and the Agent with a written statement setting forth the
amount that would adequately compensate such affected Bank for the
Liabilities and Costs associated with its compliance with such Change in
Capital Requirement and setting forth in reasonable detail the assumptions
upon which such affected Bank calculated such amount and a copy of the
opinion of counsel for the Bank referred to in the preceding paragraph.

(c) Such affected Bank shall allocate to the Seller the
Liabilities and Costs associated with such Change in Capital Requirement in
such a way that the proportion of (i) such Liabilities and Costs that are
allocated to the Seller to (ii) the total of such Liabilities and Costs of
such affected Bank associated with such Change in Capital Requirement as it
relates to all commitments of such Bank to its customers of similar
creditworthiness as the Seller, is substantially the same as the proportion
of (i) the Commitment of such affected Bank under this Long-Term RPA to
(ii) the total of all commitments by such affected Bank to its customers of
similar creditworthiness as the Seller.

(d) CCCL and such affected Bank shall thereafter negotiate in
good faith an agreement to increase that portion of the Facility Fees
payable to such affected Bank under Section 2.6 of this Long-Term RPA,
which, in the opinion of such affected Bank, will adequately compensate
such affected Bank for such costs. If such increase is approved in writing
by CCCL within ninety (90) days from the date of the notice to CCCL from
such affected Bank, the Facility Fees payable by CCCL shall include the
amount of such agreed increase (but subject to subsection 9.5(e)), and CCCL
will so notify the Agent. If CCCL and such affected Bank are unable to
agree on such an increase within ninety (90) days from the date of the
notice to CCCL from such affected Bank, CCCL shall by written notice to
such affected Bank within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date
of the aforesaid notice to CCCL from such affected Bank, elect either to
(i) terminate the Commitment of such affected Bank (each such Bank, a
"Terminated Bank") (subject to subsection 9.5(e)) or (ii) (subject to
subsection 9.5(e)) increase the Facility Fees payable to such affected Bank
by the amount requested by such affected Bank, and CCCL will so notify the
Agent. Without limiting the foregoing, if CCCL elects to take the action
described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, it may simultaneously
therewith reduce the Commitment of such affected Bank by an amount chosen
by CCCL. If CCCL fails to provide notice to such affected Bank as
described in the second preceding sentence by such one hundred twentieth
day, CCCL shall be deemed to have taken the action described in clause (ii)
of such second preceding sentence without reduction of the Commitment of
such affected Bank. 

(e) CCCL (A) may from time to time after such one hundred
twentieth day reduce the compensation to be received pursuant to this
Section 9.5 by any affected Bank as a result of any Change in Capital
Requirement, to the average compensation (the "Average Compensation") CCCL
has agreed, as provided above, to pay the affected Banks as a result of
such Change in Capital Requirement (such average compensation to be
measured by a percentage of the aggregate Commitments of such affected
Banks) and (B) shall pay to each Terminated Bank an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of (i) the lesser of (I) the aggregate Facility Fees that
would have been payable to such Terminated Bank from the date of such
Terminated Bank's notice to CCCL pursuant to this Section 9.5 to the date
the Commitment of such Terminated Bank is terminated had such Facility Fees
been determined by reference to the Average Compensation, and (II) the
aggregate Facility Fees that would have been payable to such Terminated
Bank during such period had such Facility Fees been increased by an amount
necessary to adequately compensate such Terminated Bank (as determined by
such Terminated Bank in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Section 9.5) for the costs attributable to the relevant Change in Capital
Requirement, over (ii) the aggregate Facility Fees actually paid to such
Terminated Bank during such period. 

(f) On the day the Commitment of a Terminated Bank is terminated
pursuant to subsection 9.5(d), (i) the Seller shall pay in full any accrued
and unpaid Facility Fees, Utilization Fees or other amounts owing to such
Terminated Bank hereunder, and (ii) notwithstanding such termination, CCCL
and CFC shall continue to remain fully liable to such Terminated Bank for
the satisfaction of all obligations and the payment of all amounts due or
to become due under this Long-Term RPA and the relevant Related Documents
(except for Facility Fees and Utilization Fees) as if such Commitment had
not been terminated until all such obligations have been satisfied and all
such amounts paid in full; and (iii) CCCL shall pay to the Terminated Bank
on each date on which the Facility Fees would have been payable to such
Terminated Bank had such Commitment not been terminated an amount equal to
the increase in such Terminated Bank's portion of the Facility Fees which
such Terminated Bank requested pursuant to subsection 9.5(d), adjusted to
give effect to the termination of such Terminated Bank's Commitment, during
the remaining term of this Long-Term RPA so long as the Terminated Bank's
investment in Retail Obligations or Wholesale Pooled Property remains
greater than zero.

(g) Upon the occurrence of any Change in Capital Requirement,
any Bank whose commitment hereunder is affected by such Change in Capital
Requirement shall transfer its commitment to another branch office (or, if
such Bank so elects, to an Affiliate) of such Bank, provided that such
transfer shall be made only if such Bank shall have determined in good
faith (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties) that, (i) on the basis of existing
circumstances, such transfer will avoid the increased costs resulting from
such Change in Capital Requirement and will not result in any additional
Liabilities and Costs to such Bank or to CCCL (unless CCCL agrees to pay
such additional Liabilities and Costs of such Bank or CCCL, as the case may
be) and (ii) such transfer is otherwise consistent with the interests of
such Bank. A transfer of a Bank's Commitment pursuant to this subsection
9.5(g) shall be effected pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.8,
provided that no consent to such transfer shall be required from the Seller
or the Agent.

9.6 Replacement of Banks

The Seller shall be permitted to replace any Bank which (a)
requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 9.3 and as a
result thereof any of the actions described in such Section is required to
be taken, (b) defaults in its obligation to make Purchases hereunder, or
(c) ceases to be a party to the Revolving Credit Agreement, provided that
(i) such replacement does not conflict with any Applicable Law, (ii) no
Commitment Termination Event shall have occurred and be continuing at the
time of such replacement, (iii) the Seller shall be liable to such
replaced Bank under subsection 9.4(c) to the extent such replaced Bank
incurs any Liabilities or Costs contemplated in such subsection as a result
of such replacement, (iv) the replacement Bank, if not already a Bank, and
the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent, (v) the replaced Bank shall be obligated to make
such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.8, (vi)
until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Seller shall
pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Sections 9.3 or
9.5, as the case may be, and (vii) any such replacement shall not be deemed
to be a waiver of any rights which the Seller, the Agent or any other Bank
shall have against the replaced Bank.

9.7 Survival. The agreements in this Article shall survive the
termination of this Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other indemnification granted
by any CCCL Party in any Related Document.

10.1 Amendments and Waivers. 

(a) Neither this Long-Term RPA, any Related Document, nor any
terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in

in each case without the consent of each Bank.

(c) Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or
modification shall apply equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding
upon the CCCL Parties, the Banks and the Agent. In the case of any waiver,
the CCCL Parties, the Banks and the Agent shall be restored to their former
position and rights hereunder and under the Related Documents, and any
Commitment Termination Event waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
Commitment Termination Event, or impair any right consequent thereon. 

10.2 Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the
respective parties hereto to be effective shall be in writing delivered by
certified or registered mail, by hand, by courier, or by telecopy or telex,
and, unless otherwise expressly provided herein, shall be deemed to have
been duly given or made when delivered by hand, certified or registered
mail, or by courier, in the case of telecopy notice, when received, or, in
the case of telex notice, when sent, answerback received, addressed to the
parties as set forth in the signature pages hereto, or to such other
address as may be hereafter notified by the respective parties hereto
provided that any notice, request or demand to or upon the Agent or the
Banks pursuant to Section 2.4 shall not be effective until received.

10.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and
no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Bank, any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. 
Nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

10.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any document,
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Long-Term RPA.

10.5 Successors and Assigns. This Long-Term RPA shall be binding
upon and enure to the benefit of the CCCL Parties, the Banks, the Agent,
and their respective successors and assigns, except that no CCCL Party may
assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Long-Term
RPA without the prior written consent of the Required Banks (other than in
connection with an Additional Wholesale Seller pursuant to the terms
hereof).

10.6 Participation. Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its
commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time sell to one or more Chartered Banks ("Participants") participating
interests in any Commitment of such Bank, any Long-Term Wholesale
Certificate or any other Interests of such Bank hereunder. In the event of
any such sale by a Bank of participating interests to a Participant, such
Bank's obligations under this Long-Term RPA to the other parties to this
Long-Term RPA shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely
responsible for the performance thereof for all purposes under this Long-
Term RPA, and CCCL, the Seller and the Agent shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and
obligations under this Long-Term RPA. In the case of a sale by a Bank of a
participating interest in Wholesale Pooled Property represented by a Long-
Term Wholesale Certificate, such Bank shall remain the registered holder of
such Long-Term Wholesale Certificate.

10.7 Optional Sale. The Agent may at any time during the
Commitment Period offer to sell all or any portion of the Banks' Interests
comprising Sold Retail Obligations (as defined in the Long-Term Retail PSA)
for cash (a) if the Long-Term Retail Aggregate Invested Amount (plus
accrued interest, fees and other amounts payable by the Seller hereunder to
the date of such sale) after giving effect to such sale, would be reduced
to zero and (b) if after giving effect to such sale no Service Default (as
defined in the Long-Term Retail PSA) shall be then continuing. Proceeds of
such sale shall be treated as and applied as a collection on account of
Sold Retail Obligations under and in accordance with the Long-Term Retail
PSA. Following the receipt of a bona fide offer to purchase all or any
portion of the Banks' Interests in the said Sold Retail Obligations from
any Person other than the Seller which the Agent wishes to accept (a "Third
Party Offer"), the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Seller, which
notice shall constitute an irrevocable offer to sell such Interests to the
Seller for an amount and on the terms and conditions specified in the Third
Party Offer. The Seller will be under no obligation to accept such offer. 
If the Seller does not accept such offer within five (5) Business Days
after receiving notice thereof, the Agent may accept the Third Party Offer. 

10.8 Sale of Interests.

(a) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to
any Bank, and, with the consent of CCCL and the Agent (which in each case
shall not be unreasonably withheld) to one or more additional Chartered
Banks ("Purchasing Banks") all or a portion of its rights and obligations
under this Long-Term RPA, the Related Documents and the Long-Term Wholesale
Certificates pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by such
Purchasing Bank, such transferor Bank, the Guarantor and the Agent (and, in
the case of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank, by CCCL), and
delivered to the Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register
provided that (i) prior to the termination of the Commitments (whether on
the Commitment Termination Date or otherwise), any such sale shall include
a proportionate share of each of such transferor Bank's Commitments, Retail
Obligations and interests in Wholesale Pooled Property, and after any
termination of the Commitments, any such sale may be of any combination of
Retail Obligations and interests in Wholesale Pooled Property and (ii) the
principal amount of such Bank's Commitment so sold (or, if no Commitments
are outstanding, the principal amount of interests in Wholesale Pooled
Property and Retail Obligations so sold) shall be in an aggregate amount of
$5,000,000 or more. 

(b) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance, and recording,
from and after the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to such
Commitment Transfer Supplement, (i) the Purchasing Bank thereunder shall be
a party hereto and the Related Documents and, to the extent provided in
such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a
Bank hereunder with a Commitment as set forth therein, and (ii) the
transferor Bank thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Commitment
Transfer Supplement, be released from its obligations under this Long-Term
RPA (and, in the case of a Commitment Transfer Supplement covering all or
the remaining portion of a transferor Bank's rights and obligations under
this Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents, such transferor Bank shall
cease to be a party hereto). 

(c) Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend
this Long-Term RPA to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to
reflect the addition of such Purchasing Bank and the resulting adjustment
of Purchase Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Bank
of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Bank
under this Long-Term RPA and the Related Documents. On or prior to the
Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, the Wholesale Custodian, at its own expense, shall execute and
deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered Long-Term Wholesale
Certificate a new Long-Term Wholesale Certificate issued in the name of
such Purchasing Bank pursuant to the Long-Term Wholesale Series Supplement
and, if the transferor Bank has retained Commitments hereunder, a new Long-
Term Wholesale Certificate issued in the name of the transferor Bank.

(d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to on the
signature pages hereto or such other address of which the Agent may give
notice in accordance with Section 10.2, a copy of each Commitment Transfer
Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitments of,
and principal amount of the Retail Obligations and interests in Wholesale
Pooled Property sold to, each Bank from time to time. The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the
CCCL Parties, the Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Retail Obligations, the
interests in Wholesale Pooled Property and the Long-Term Wholesale
Certificates recorded therein for all purposes of this Long-Term RPA. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the CCCL Parties or any Bank
at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
Within two (2) Business Days after the end of each month during the term of
this Long-Term RPA, the Agent shall provide a copy of the Register to the
Seller. 

(e) Upon its receipt of a Commitment Transfer Supplement
executed by a transferor Bank and a Purchasing Bank (and, in the case of a
Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank or an Affiliate thereof, by CCCL
and the Agent), the Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Commitment
Transfer Supplement and (ii) on the Transfer Effective Date determined
pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register
and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Banks and CCCL.

(f) Each CCCL Party authorizes each Bank to disclose to any
Participant or Purchasing Bank (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Bank's possession
concerning such CCCL Party and its Affiliates which has been delivered to
such Bank by or on behalf of such CCCL Party pursuant to this Long-Term RPA
or which has been delivered to such Bank by or on behalf of such CCCL Party
in connection with such Bank's credit evaluation of such CCCL Party and its
Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Long-Term RPA.

10.9 Adjustments; Set-Off.

(a) If any Bank (a "benefitted Bank") shall at any time receive
any payment of all or part of its investments in Wholesale Pooled Property
or Retail Obligations, or any return or interest thereon, or receive any
collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by
set-off or counterclaim, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Sections 7.1(g), 7.1(h), 7.1(i), 7.1(j) or 7.1(k) or
otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral
received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's
investments in Wholesale Pooled Property or Retail Obligations, or return
or interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the
other Banks such portion of each such other Bank's investments in Wholesale
Pooled Property or Retail Obligations, or shall provide such other Banks
with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall
be necessary to cause such benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or
benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Banks;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or
benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Bank, such purchase
shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each CCCL Party agrees that
each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's investments in
Wholesale Pooled Property or Retail Obligations may exercise all rights of
payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to
such portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct holder of such
portion.

(b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided
by law, each Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to any CCCL
Party, any such notice being expressly waived by each CCCL Party to the
extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and
payable by such CCCL Party hereunder or under the Related Documents
(whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off
and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any
other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case
whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured,
at any time held or owing by such Bank or any branch or agency thereof to
or for the credit or the account of such CCCL Party, provided, however,
that no Bank which maintains any bank account for the Wholesale Custodian
shall exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim or similar right with
respect to amounts on deposit in such bank account. Each Bank agrees
promptly to notify CCCL and the Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 

10.10 Counterparts. This Long-Term RPA may be executed by one or more
of the parties to this Long-Term RPA in any number of separate
counterparts, and all of such counterparts taken together shall be deemed
to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this
Long-Term RPA signed by all the parties shall be lodged with CCCL and the
Agent.

10.11 Severability. Any provision of this Long-Term RPA which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and
any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

10.12 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein with
respect to the 1993 RPA and the Short-Term RPA, this Long-Term RPA
represents the entire agreement of the CCCL Parties, the Agent and the
Banks with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by the Agent or any Bank
relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to
herein or in the Related Documents.

from the total portfolio of Retail Obligations then owned by the Seller on

that any amount payable hereunder or thereunder as of the Replacement
Effective Date to NBD Bank, Canada, or to Hongkong Bank of Canada shall

(a) General. Subject to the Long-Term RPA and the terms and
conditions provided in this subsection 2.3 and in Article VII, sales of
Retail Obligations hereunder may take place on any Business Day during the
Commitment Period (each date upon which a sale of Retail Obligations may
occur hereunder being herein called a "Closing Date" applicable to such
sale). Each such sale shall be as of the close of business on the last day
of the calendar month immediately preceding the related Closing Date (each
such date being herein called a "Date of Sale" applicable to such Sold
Retail Obligations) and shall take place at the office of the Agent or at
such other place as may be agreed upon. 

(b) Notice and Other Requirements for Retail Purchases. In respect of

Retail Obligations), 

(ii) the Applicable Anticipated Collection Schedule relating
to such Retail Obligations, and, 

(iii) no later than the applicable Fixed Rate Determination

be increased or reduced as provided for herein, being
herein called the "Retail Deferred Payment" applicable
to such Retail Obligations) equal to the lesser of (x)
the Deferred Percentage (Retail Gross) of the Estimated
Retail Amount Due upon such Retail Obligations and (y)
the Deferred Percentage (Retail Net) of the Retail Paid
Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due upon such
Retail Obligations; and, subject to receipt from each
Bank of its Purchase Percentage thereof, the Agent
shall pay the Seller an amount equal to the Retail Paid
Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due upon such
Retail Obligations. The Retail Deferred Payment
applicable to the Sold Retail Obligations purchased on
any related Closing Date will be applied as hereinafter
provided. 

(ii) Upon receipt by the Agent of the statement showing the
Exact Retail Amount Due upon such Retail Obligations: 

(A) if the Exact Retail Amount Due upon such Retail
Obligations exceeds the Estimated Retail Amount Due
upon such Retail Obligations, each Bank shall, subject
to the provisions of subsection 2.5, deduct from its
Purchase Percentage of such excess and add to the
Retail Deferred Payment applicable to such Retail
Obligations its Purchase Percentage of an amount so
that the Retail Deferred Payment equals the lesser of
(x) the Deferred Percentage (Retail Gross) of the Exact
Retail Amount Due upon such Retail Obligations and (y)
the Deferred Percentage (Retail Net) of the Retail Paid
Percentage of the Exact Retail Amount Due upon such
Retail Obligations, subject to receipt from each Bank
of its Purchase Percentage thereof, and the Agent shall
promptly pay the Seller an additional amount equal to
the Retail Paid Percentage of such excess together with
interest on such additional amount computed for the
period from such Closing Date to the date of payment of
such additional amount at the Fixed Rate applicable to
such Retail Obligations; and 

(B) if the Exact Retail Amount Due upon such Retail
Obligations is less than the Estimated Retail Amount
Due upon such Retail Obligations, the Seller shall
promptly pay the Agent an amount equal to the Retail
Paid Percentage of the difference between the Exact
Retail Amount Due upon such Retail Obligations and the
Estimated Retail Amount Due upon such Retail
Obligations, together with interest on such amount
computed for the period from such Closing Date to the
date of payment of such amount at the Fixed Rate
applicable to such Retail Obligations, and the Retail
Deferred Payment applicable to such Retail Obligations
shall be reduced by an amount so that the Retail
Deferred Payment equals the lesser of the amounts
referred to in (A)(x) and (A)(y) above. 

(b) Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Agent, the Banks and the
Seller agree that the Purchase Price to be paid by the Agent for the Sold
Retail Obligations purchased on each Closing Date shall be adjusted from
time to time in order to ensure that the Banks shall receive an annual rate
of return (computed on a monthly basis) on their investment calculated with
respect to such Sold Retail Obligations at a rate per annum equal to the
applicable Fixed Rate (the annual rate of return specified in this
subsection 2.4(b) applicable to such Sold Retail Obligations being herein
called the "Applicable Yield" for such Sold Retail Obligations). 
Accordingly, adjustments in the Purchase Price paid by the Agent for Sold
Retail Obligations shall be made on each Settlement Date as provided for in
subsection 4.1.

2.5 Maximum Amount of Purchases. 

(a) Maximum. The Banks shall not be obligated to purchase any
Retail Obligations on any Closing Date hereunder if the sum of (i) the
Aggregate Amount Outstanding before giving effect to such purchase plus
(ii) the Retail Paid Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due upon any
Retail Obligations to be purchased on such Closing Date (the sum of clauses
(i) and (ii) being herein called the "Retail Amount Outstanding") plus
(iii) the Long-Term Wholesale Aggregate Invested Amount would exceed the
Long-Term Commitment Amount. 

(b) Reassignment of Excess Retail Obligations. Notwithstanding
the provisions of clause (i) of subsection 2.4(a), if, after the receipt by
the Agent of any written statement of Exact Retail Amount Due furnished to
the Agent pursuant to subsection 2.3(c)(i) and the calculation of the
Aggregate Retail Amount Outstanding to include the Exact Retail Amount Due
set forth on said statement, the sum of the Retail Amount Outstanding plus
the Long-Term Wholesale Aggregate Invested Amount would exceed the Long-
Term Commitment Amount, determined on the Settlement Date hereunder next
preceding the date of receipt by the Agent of such statement of Exact
Retail Amount Due and after giving effect to any purchase hereunder on such
Settlement Date, the Agent shall reassign to the Seller, without recourse,
representation or warranty, such of the Retail Obligations to which such
statement of Exact Retail Amount Due relates (selected on a random basis
agreed upon between the Seller and the Agent) as is necessary so that,
after giving effect to any reassignment of Retail Obligations then being
made, the sum of the Retail Amount Outstanding plus the Wholesale Aggregate
Invested Amount would not exceed the Long-Term Commitment Amount,
determined as aforesaid. There shall be no increase in the Retail Deferred
Payment and no payment pursuant to clause (i) of subsection 2.4(a) of this
Agreement with respect to any such Retail Obligations so reassigned.

2.6 Interest on Overdue Payments. If any amount shown by any
Settlement Statement to be payable to the Agent is not paid on the relevant
Settlement Date, such amount shall bear interest from such Settlement Date
until such amount is paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the greater
of (i) the Applicable Yield plus 2.0% and (ii) the Prime Rate plus 2.0%.

2.7 Discount and Interest Calculations. Calculations of discounts
and per annum rates under this Agreement shall be made on a monthly basis
and on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) for
actual days elapsed.

ARTICLE III 
SELLER'S SERVICING OBLIGATIONS: COLLECTIONS; MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS

3.1 Collections and Applications. 

(a) Identification of Collections. The parties acknowledge that
the Seller has established a system whereby the Seller can, within two
Business Days of the receipt thereof by the branch offices of the Seller,
identify collections as attributable to the Sold Retail Obligations, and
from and after the Replacement Effective Date, the Seller will follow the
established system of collections and remittances described in subsections
3.1(b) and 3.1(c).

(b) Deposit of Collections. All collections of proceeds of, or
other payments in connection with, the Sold Retail Obligations will be paid
by the obligors under such Sold Retail Obligations to the branch offices of
the Seller or to the credit of the Seller by direct deposit to a branch
bank account of the Seller (each such account being herein called a "Branch
Account"). Such branch offices will deposit all collections received as
soon as practicable (in accordance with customary procedures) following
receipt thereof (whether attributable to the Sold Retail Obligations or
otherwise) into a Branch Account. Unless and until the Agent shall deliver
a Daily Remittance Notice to the Seller in accordance with subsection
3.1(c), the Seller shall transfer or cause to be transferred to the Agent
on each Settlement Date under this Agreement an amount equal to the
collections received by the Seller on account of the Sold Retail
Obligations during the Settlement Period which next precedes such
Settlement Date. The Seller shall transfer or cause to be transferred to
the Agent all collections applicable to the Sold Retail Obligations and
deposited in a Branch Account from but not including the related Date of
Sale. If the Seller shall transfer funds to the Application Account on
account of any item received by the Seller which is subsequently returned
or dishonoured, then the Seller may deduct the amount of such item from the
funds otherwise transferred to the Application Account on the first
Business Day after the Seller knows that such item has been returned or
dishonoured.

(c) Daily Remittance Notices. At the written request of the
Required Banks, and provided that and only if at the time of such request
at least one class of the senior unsecured debt of the Guarantor is rated
Level V, the Agent shall deliver a Daily Remittance Notice to the Seller. 
The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Required Banks may in their
sole discretion require the Agent to deliver a Daily Remittance Notice at
any time, except as provided in the preceding sentence, and the Agent
agrees that it may deliver a Daily Remittance Notice only at the request of
the Required Banks. From and after the second Business Day next following
receipt by the Seller of a Daily Remittance Notice in accordance with the
preceding sentence, the Seller shall, within two Business Day of receipt by
the branch office of such items, identify those collections which are on
account of the Sold Retail Obligations and shall, on the Business Day next
following the date of such identification, transfer or cause to be
transferred in immediately available funds to the Application Account an
aggregate amount equal to the collections so identified as attributable to
the Sold Retail Obligations. In addition to the foregoing the Seller shall
no later than the fourth Business Day following receipt of a Daily
Remittance Notice, transfer or cause to be transferred to the Application
Account all collections then held by the Seller (including those
collections deposited in a Branch Account) attributable to the Sold Retail
Obligations which were to have been remitted to the Agent on each
Settlement Date next following receipt of such Daily Remittance Notice. On
each Settlement Date following receipt by the Seller of a Daily Remittance
Notice, an amount equal to the collections deposited in the Application
Account during the immediately preceding Settlement Period shall be
transferred to the Agent from the Application Account. On the Business Day
next following such Settlement Date, any interest or other earnings on the
principal balance of the Application Account during the immediately
preceding Settlement Period shall be transferred to the Seller from the
Application Account.

(d) Treatment of Funds. The Agent shall treat all funds
deposited in the Application Account or otherwise received by the Agent
during a Settlement Period after the delivery of a Daily Remittance Notice
as collections for purposes of this Agreement as of the Settlement Date
immediately following such Settlement Period.

(e) Application Account. Neither the Seller nor any other Person
claiming by, through or under the Seller, shall have any right, title or
interest in, or any control over the use of, or any right to withdraw
moneys from, the Application Account. Amounts credited to the Application
Account may be invested by the Agent in Cash Equivalents, which investments
shall be liquidated as necessary, on each Settlement Date. Any interest or
other earnings on the principal balance of the Application Account shall be
for the account of the Seller and shall be distributable in accordance with
subsection 3.1(c). The Seller agrees that the Agent shall not be
responsible for any loss or liability arising in respect of such
investments (including as a result of the liquidation before maturity of
any such investments) except to the extent that such loss or liability is a
result of the Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

(f) Cancellation of Daily Remittance Notice. Upon receipt of a
Daily Remittance Notice, the Seller shall comply with the provisions of
subsections 3.1(b) through 3.1(e) until the Settlement Date applicable to
each Sold Retail Obligation next following the date on which such Daily
Remittance Notice shall be cancelled by a written notification to such
effect delivered at any time by the Agent to the Seller. Such notification
shall be delivered either at the written request of the Required Banks or
upon receipt by the Agent of satisfactory evidence that no class of the
senior unsecured debt of the Guarantor is rated Level V.

3.2 Collections by Seller. 

(a) Seller's Servicing Duties. The Seller will, at the
Seller's cost and expense and as agent for the Banks and the Agent, but
subject at any time to the right of the Banks (through the Agent) to direct
and control, endeavour to collect, as and when the same becomes due, the
amounts owing on each Sold Retail Obligation, and in so doing the Seller
will apply the standard of care and diligence which would be prudent and
businesslike for the administration and collection of its own accounts
receivable; and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the
Seller shall comply with the following provisions of this section 3.2. 

(i) Payment made on any Sold Retail Obligation shall be
applied in the direct order of maturity of payment due
thereon. 

(ii) In the event of default under any Sold Retail
Obligation, the Seller shall have the power and
authority, on behalf of the Banks, but at the Seller's
cost and expense, to take such action in respect of any
Sold Retail Obligation (including, in the case of any
Sold Retail Obligation in respect of which a security
interest in goods shall have been obtained, the
repossession and resale of such goods), as the Seller,
in the absence of contrary instructions from the Agent,
may deem advisable. In no event shall the Seller be
entitled to take any action which would make the Agent
or any Bank a party to any litigation without the
Agent's or such Bank's express prior written consent. 
In the enforcement or collection of any Sold Retail
Obligation, the Seller shall be entitled to sue the
obligor in its own name, if possible, or, if, but only
if, the Agent consents in writing, in the name of the
Agent on behalf of the Banks. 

(iii) Subject to section 3.2(f), the Agent may at any
time by notice in writing terminate the authority
of the Seller to act as agent for and on behalf of
the Banks and the Agent as set forth in this
subsection 3.2. 

(iv) If the Seller repossesses goods, as aforesaid, or
elects to use legal proceedings to enforce any Sold
Retail Obligation, then unless and until the Agent
shall have given the Seller written notice to the
contrary, the act of repossession or of commencing such
litigation shall be deemed to be an automatic
reconveyance by the Agent and the Banks, without
recourse, representation or warranty whatsoever, to the
Seller of all of the Agent's and the Banks' right,
title and interest in and to such Sold Retail
Obligation, and upon request by the Seller, the Agent
will execute and deliver a separate instrument
confirming such reconveyance. As the price for such
reconveyance, the Seller agrees to pay the Agent an
amount equal to all future proceeds collected on such
Sold Retail Obligation which the Agent had a right to
retain by virtue of its prior purchase. 

(v) The proceeds of any reconveyance under subsection
3.2(a)(iv) shall constitute collections hereunder. In
addition, all proceeds or benefits of any physical
damage, life or disability insurance policies which are
received by the Seller and which relate to any Sold
Retail Obligations shall be treated as collections
hereunder and shall be remitted by the Seller to the
Agent on the next Settlement Date or on such earlier
date as may be required if the Seller is in receipt of
a Daily Remittance Notice. 

(vi) The Seller shall be entitled to retain late
charges and extension fees received by it in the
course of its administration of the Sold Retail
Obligations.

(b) Indemnification. The Seller hereby agrees to defend and
indemnify the Agent and the several Banks against all costs, expenses,
claims and liabilities in respect of any action taken by the Seller
relative to any Sold Retail Obligation, or arising out of any failure of
compliance of any Sold Retail Obligation with the provisions of any law or
regulation, whether federal, provincial or municipal, applicable thereto
(including, without limitation, usury and consumer protection laws and
regulations). In the event of any repossession of goods, as aforesaid, the
Seller agrees to resell such goods in a commercially reasonable manner for
the account of the Banks in accordance with the requirements of all
applicable laws and regulations and shall remit to the Agent the gross sale
proceeds thereof net of the account debtor's equity of redemption, if any. 
Neither the Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to take any action
or commence any proceedings to realize upon any Sold Retail Obligation
(including, without limitation, any Defaulted Retail Obligation), or to
enforce any of its rights or remedies with respect thereto. Any monies
collected by the Seller pursuant to subsections 3.1 and 3.2 shall be held
in trust by the Seller and shall not constitute property of the Seller and
shall be remitted promptly to the Agent in accordance with subsection 3.1.

(c) Power of Attorney. The Seller hereby irrevocably grants to
the Agent an irrevocable power of attorney, with full power of
substitution, coupled with an interest, to take in the name of the Seller
and/or in its own name on behalf of the Banks all steps necessary or
advisable to endorse, negotiate or otherwise realize on any writing or
other right of any kind held or owned by the Seller or transmitted to or
received by the Agent as payment on account or otherwise in respect of any
Sold Retail Obligation including, without limitation, to take in the name
of the Seller and/or in its own name all steps necessary or advisable to
enforce or realize on any Sold Retail Obligations and all guarantees
thereof and collateral security therefor.

(d) Service Default. Any one of the following events that
shall occur and be continuing with respect to the Seller shall constitute a
"Service Default" hereunder: 

(i) any failure by the Seller to make any payment, transfer
or deposit or to give instructions or to give notice to
the Agent to make such payment, transfer or deposit on
or before the date occurring five days after the date
such payment, transfer or deposit or such instruction
or notice is required to be made or given, as the case
may be, under the terms of this Agreement;

(ii) failure on the part of the Seller duly to observe or
perform any other covenants or agreements of the Seller
set forth in this Agreement which has a material
adverse effect on the Banks and which continues
unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on
which written notice of such failure, requiring the
same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
Seller by the Agent; or the Seller shall delegate its
duties under this Agreement, except as permitted by
section 3.2(c);

(iii) any representation, warranty or certification made by
the Seller in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall prove to
have been incorrect when made, which has a material
adverse effect on the rights of the Banks and which
material adverse effect continues for a period of 60
days after the date on which written notice thereof,
requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been
given to the Seller by the Agent;

(iv) any Insolvency Event (as defined in the Wholesale PSA)
shall occur with respect to the Seller.

The Seller shall immediately notify the Agent in writing of any Service
Default; however, the failure by the Seller so to notify the Agent with
respect to the occurrence of any event listed in this section 3.2(d) shall
not affect the characterization of such event as a Service Default. 

(e) Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a delay in or
failure of performance under section 3.2(d)(i) for a period of 10 Business
Days after the grace period specified therein or under section 3.2(d)(ii)
or 3.2(d)(iii) for a period of 60 Business Days after the grace specified
therein, shall not constitute a Service Default if such delay or failure
could not be prevented by the exercise of reasonable diligence by the
Seller and such delay or failure was caused by an act of God or the Queen's
enemy, acts of declared or undeclared war, public disorder, rebellion or
sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning, fire, hurricanes, earthquakes,
floods or similar causes. The preceding sentence shall not relieve the
Seller from using its best efforts to perform its respective obligations in
a timely manner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Seller shall provide the Agent, the Seller and the Banks with a certificate
of a Responsible Officer of the Seller giving prompt notice of such failure
or delay by it, together with a description of its efforts so to perform
its obligations. 

(f) Termination of Servicing by Seller. At the written request
of the Required Banks, at any time after the occurrence of a Service
Default which has not been remedied within the grace period specified
therefor under section 3.2(d) or excused pursuant to section 3.2(e), the
Agent shall by notice in writing to the Seller terminate the Seller's
functions as to all of the administrative, servicing and collection
functions provided for herein (such notice being herein referred to as
notice of a "Complete Servicing Transfer"). The Seller acknowledges and
agrees that the Required Banks may in their sole discretion require the
Agent to deliver a notice of Complete Servicing Transfer at any time
provided that at such time a Service Default has occurred and is
continuing. Upon the occurrence of a Complete Servicing Transfer, without
limitation: 

(i) the Agent or its designee shall administer the
servicing functions in any manner it deems fit,
provided that the Agent or its designee will furnish or
cause to be furnished to the Seller such information as
the Seller needs to perform its obligations under
subsections 4.1 and 4.2;

(ii) the Agent shall, at any time thereafter, be entitled to
notify the obligors on any Sold Retail Obligations to
make payment of amounts due thereunder directly to the
Agent or its designee;

(iii) the Seller shall, at its own expense (x) if so
requested by the Agent, endorse each instrument,
if any, evidencing any Sold Retail Obligation to
the Agent in such manner as the Agent shall direct
and (y) further perform any and all acts and
execute any and all documents as may be reasonably
requested by the Agent in order to effect the
purposes of this Agreement and the sale of Retail
Obligations hereunder and to perfect and protect
the ownership interests of the several Banks in
the Sold Retail Obligations;

(iv) the Seller shall, at its own expense, cause to be
transmitted directly to the Agent or its designee
all cash, cheques, drafts and other instruments or
items for the payment of money which may be
received by the Seller as payment on account or
otherwise in respect of any Sold Retail
Obligation, provided that the Seller may maintain
possession of such items or instruments mistakenly
delivered to it at the time a notice of Complete
Servicing Transfer is received by the Seller, in
trust for the Agent, so long as the Seller
complies with the provisions of subsection 3.1
with regard to such items or instruments and the
proceeds thereof as if a Complete Servicing
Transfer has not occurred;

(v) the Seller and CFC will upon written request by
the Agent and at their own cost and expense (A)
deliver to the Agent or its designee the Contracts
relating to the Sold Retail Obligations, and all
books, accounts, ledgers, computer records and
other records and materials pertaining thereto,
(B) grant to the Agent or its designee a non-
exclusive royalty-free licence to use all the
application software and computer programs then
being used in connection with the administration,
servicing and collection of the Sold Retail
Obligations and owned by the Seller or CFC (the
"Software"), provided, however, that any such
licence shall be restricted to the administration,
servicing and collection of Sold Retail
Obligations and shall contain such other terms as
the Seller and CFC may reasonably require to
protect their proprietary interests in the
Software, such terms to be consistent with the
provisions and intent of this clause (B), and (C)
deliver the Software in machine readable and
printed form to the Agent or its designee,
together with such other documentation and
material which may be reasonably requested by the
Agent in support of the Software including,
without limitation, specifications, source
listings, user manuals, drawings, flow charts,
methods, practices and the like; and 

(vi) do all such other acts and things as the Agent may
reasonably request for the purpose of giving
effect to the provisions and intent of this
subsection 3.2(f).

(g) Reinstatement of Servicing by Seller. Upon receipt of a
notice of a Complete Servicing Transfer, the Seller shall comply with the
provisions of subsection 3.2(f) hereof until the Settlement Date next
following the date on which such Complete Servicing Transfer shall be
cancelled by a written notification to such effect delivered at any time by
the Agent (which notification shall be delivered only at the written
request of the Required Banks in their sole discretion) to the Seller.

3.3 Maintenance of Records. 

(a) Access, etc. The Seller will hold in trust for the Agent and
the several Banks at the office of the Seller referred to above, or at one
or more of the Seller's branch offices, all Sold Retail Obligations,
together with such books of account and other records as will enable the
Agent or its designee to determine at any time the status thereof. The
Seller will permit the Agent (or Deloitte & Touche on behalf of the Agent
but at the expense of the Seller) at any time and from time to time to
inspect, audit, check and make abstracts from the Seller's books, accounts,
ledger cards, computer and other records, or other papers pertaining to
such Sold Retail Obligations and the Seller will at any time and from time
to time provide access to all information necessary or appropriate for the
Agent (or Deloitte & Touche on behalf of the Agent but at the expense of
the Seller) to review and evaluate the Seller's financial controls and
procedures. 

(b) Delivery of Records and Contracts. From time to time upon
the written request of the Agent, the Seller at its own expense will
deliver to the Agent: (i) a schedule of the Sold Retail Obligations
indicating as to each such Sold Retail Obligation information as to the
obligor thereon, the unpaid balance thereof and the location of the
Contract evidencing such Sold Retail Obligation and such other information
as the Agent may deem appropriate, and (ii) any such Contract and such
records pertaining thereto as the Agent may deem essential to enable it to
enforce its rights thereunder. In addition, upon the written request of
the Agent, the Seller will deliver all such Contracts and records
pertaining thereto to any agent selected by the Agent. So long as such
Contracts are in possession of the Seller, such Contracts, together with
ledger cards or other account or computer records, if any, relating
thereto, will be held in trust for and kept safely for the Agent in filing
cabinets or other suitable containers. 

(c) Marking of Records. Each computer record relating to Sold
Retail Obligations and all other account records relating to such Sold
Retail Obligations maintained at the principal office of CFC will be marked
with the following legend: "Sold to certain financial institutions party to
a certain Long-Term Retail Purchase and Servicing Agreement dated as of May
23, 1994 through Royal Bank of Canada acting as agent". 

(d) Segregation of Records. Upon request of the Agent, the
Seller will: (i) segregate from all other receivables then owned or being
serviced by the Seller all Contracts relating to a Sold Retail Obligation; 
(ii) hold in trust and safely keep such Contracts in separate filing
cabinets or other suitable containers marked to show the Agent's and the
Banks' interest with the legend specified in section 3.3(c) above and
maintained in such place or places as shall be designated by the Agent and
(iii) mark all Contracts relating to a Sold Retail Obligation with the
legend specified above.

3.4 Rebates, Adjustments, Returns and Reductions.

(a) The amount of any rebate, refund or adjustment of any Sold
Retail Obligation, the amount owing for any returns or cancellations or the
amount of any other reduction of any payment (including, without limitation
reductions in the anticipated amount of finance charges as the result of
any prepayment of any Sold Retail Obligation) under any Sold Retail
Obligation shall be treated as a collection thereon by the Seller for
purposes of this Agreement and shall: (i) during the period when a Daily
Remittance Notice is in effect, be deposited in the Application Account on
the second Business Day next following the day of such rebate, refund,
adjustment, return or reduction and shall be treated as a collection
thereon in accordance with subsection 3.1(c), and (ii) in all other cases,
be paid to the Agent on the next Settlement Date, provided that, with
respect to the Sold Retail Obligations purchased by the Banks as of any
Date of Sale, the Seller may, in any subsequent period of twelve
consecutive calendar months, extend any one instalment due under any such
Sold Retail Obligation for up to two periods of up to one calendar month
each, and such extensions shall not give rise to a deposit obligation or be
treated as a collection hereunder.

(b) The provisions of this subsection 3.4 shall not affect the
Seller's right to grant or receive any rebates, adjustments, returns or
reductions on any Retail Obligation prior to the Date of Sale thereof.

ARTICLE IV 
ADJUSTMENTS; SETTLEMENTS

4.1 Adjustments. 

(a) Date of Adjustments. Each Settlement Date is hereby
designated as a date for the purpose of making the following discount and
timing adjustments with respect to all collections received by the Seller
(whether (i) remitted to the Agent on the Settlement Date next following
receipt by the Seller or, (ii) in accordance with subsection 3.1(c),
transferred to the Application Account within two Business Days of receipt
by the branch offices of the Seller) in respect of the Sold Retail
Obligations during the Settlement Period next preceding such Settlement
Date.

(b) Anticipated Collections. Not less than five Business Days
prior to each Closing Date hereunder, the Seller shall deliver to the Agent
a schedule setting forth with respect to any sale of Retail Obligations on
such Closing Date, the anticipated collections for each Settlement Period
on the Retail Obligations to be sold to the Banks as of the related Date of
Sale (expressed in cumulative percentages of such Retail Obligations) (each
schedule of anticipated collections for each Settlement Period applicable
to the Sold Retail Obligations purchased on any Closing Date being herein
referred to as an "Anticipated Collection Schedule" applicable to such
Retail Obligations). Each Anticipated Collection Schedule delivered after
the Replacement Effective Date, whether delivered prior to or after the
delivery by the Agent of a Daily Remittance Notice, will be prepared on the
assumption that all amounts collected by the Seller during each Settlement
Period applicable to the Sold Retail Obligations to which such Anticipated
Collection Schedule relates will be received by the Agent on the Settlement
Date applicable to such Sold Retail Obligations next succeeding such
Settlement Period. 

(c) Fast Pay/Slow Pay Adjustments. The Seller does not
guarantee collection of the Sold Retail Obligations. However, with respect
to the Retail Obligations purchased by the Banks hereunder as of any
related Date of Sale, if the cumulative aggregate amount of collections
received by the Seller or, in accordance with subsection 3.1, by the Agent,
for any related Settlement Period on such Retail Obligations purchased by
the Banks as of any related Date of Sale is less than the cumulative
aggregate amount of anticipated collections therefor, the Seller shall pay
the Agent on the next succeeding Settlement Date as a discount adjustment,
an amount determined by multiplying the amount of the Applicable Adjustment
Percentage (as hereinafter defined) of the amount of the deficiency by a
Discount Factor (as hereinafter defined) based upon the Fixed Rate
applicable to such Retail Obligations for the period from and including
such Settlement Date to the next succeeding Settlement Date. On the other
hand, if the cumulative aggregate amount of such collections exceeds the
cumulative aggregate amount of such anticipated collections, the Agent
shall credit to the Seller, as a discount adjustment, an amount determined
by multiplying the Applicable Adjustment Percentage of the amount of the
excess by a Discount Factor based upon the Fixed Rate applicable to such
Retail Obligations for the period from and including such Settlement Date
to the next succeeding Settlement Date. The Primary Retail Deferred
Payment applicable to such Retail Obligations shall be increased by the
amount referred to in the preceding sentence and applied as provided in
section 4.2(c) hereof. 

(d) Applicable Adjustment Percentage. As used herein, the term
"Applicable Adjustment Percentage" shall mean, in respect of any Sold
Retail Obligations purchased by the Banks as of the related Date of Sale,
that percentage determined by dividing: 

(i) the difference between (A) the anticipated amount of the
collections to be received by the Agent on the Settlement
Date next succeeding a Settlement Period applicable to
such Sold Retail Obligations (in accordance with the
assumptions made in preparing the related Anticipated
Collection Schedule) on account of such Sold Retail
Obligations and (B) the anticipated amount to be released
by the Agent to the Seller from the Primary Retail
Deferred Payment applicable to such Sold Retail
Obligations pursuant to subsection 4.2(c), on such
Settlement Date (in accordance with the assumptions made
in preparing the related Anticipated Collection
Schedule), by 

(ii) the anticipated amount of the collections to be
received by the Agent on account of such Sold Retail
Obligations on such Settlement Date (in accordance with
the assumptions made in preparing the related
Anticipated Collection Schedule). 

(e) Discount Factor. As used herein, the term "Discount Factor"
shall mean, with respect to the period from one Settlement Date to the next
succeeding Settlement Date, a fraction, the numerator of which is

(i) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the decimal
equivalent of the Fixed Rate applicable to the purchase
of the relevant Retail Obligations by (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days from and
including such Settlement Date to but not including the
next succeeding Settlement Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the year (i.e. 365, or 366
in a leap year), 

and the denominator of which is

(ii) the said numerator described in (i) plus one.

4.2 Settlement Statements; Charging Defaulted Obligations to the
Deferred Payment; Adjustments to the Deferred Payment.

(a) Settlement Statement. Not later than five Business Days
prior to each Settlement Date, until all the Sold Retail Obligations have
been paid in full and all amounts owing to the Agent on account thereof
have been transferred to the Agent, the Seller shall submit to the Agent a
Settlement Statement for each group of Retail Obligations purchased
hereunder or under the 1993 RPA on a related Closing Date, substantially in
the form of Exhibit C hereto, which shall set forth with respect to the
Sold Retail Obligations, among other things: 

(i) the total collections received by the Agent on such
Retail Obligations up to and including the last day of
the next preceding Settlement Period applicable to such
Sold Retail Obligations, including collections pursuant
to subsection 3.4 and collections on Defaulted Retail
Obligations theretofore charged to the Retail Deferred
Payment applicable to such Retail Obligations and for
which the Seller shall not have previously accounted to
the Agent; 

(ii) the balance on such Retail Obligations (A) on which the
obligor thereon is in default in an amount payable
thereon for three or more consecutive months and/or (B)
with respect to which any of the events of the kind
described in clauses (a) through (k) of section 7.1 of
the Long-Term RPA shall have occurred in respect of the
obligor or its assets or liabilities (such Retail
Obligations being herein collectively called "Defaulted
Retail Obligations"); and 

(iii) such other information as the Agent may request
for the purpose of effecting an accounting and
settlement hereunder. 

The form of Settlement Statement provided in Exhibit C will be varied to
the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions and intent of this
Agreement, it being acknowledged and agreed that in the event of any
inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and any Settlement
Statement delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the provisions of this
Agreement will prevail. If any application of any Retail Deferred Payment
Excess is required on any Settlement Date pursuant to clauses (i), (ii),
(iii), (iv) and (v) of subsection 4.2(c), then concurrently with the
delivery of each Settlement Statement provided for above, the Seller shall
submit to the Agent a further statement or statements in a form to be
agreed upon between the Agent and the Seller, which statement or statements
shall give effect to the application of the Retail Deferred Payment Excess. 

(b) Defaulted Obligations. Subject as hereinafter provided,the
Agent may, at its option, on the Settlement Date on which a Sold Retail
Obligation is first identified as a Defaulted Retail Obligation, charge to
the Retail Deferred Payment related to the group of Sold Retail Obligations
of which such Defaulted Retail Obligation is a part (such related Retail
Deferred Payment being herein called the "Primary Retail Deferred Payment")
an amount equal to the outstanding balance on such Defaulted Retail
Obligation, and the Agent may, at its option, at any time charge any other
amount due with respect to the Sold Retail Obligations (including, without
limitation, amounts payable to the Agent pursuant to subsection 4.1(b), but
without prejudice to any right of the Agent to collect such other amounts
directly from the Seller) which is then owed to the Agent under this
Agreement and which has not been paid by the Seller in accordance with its
terms, to such Primary Retail Deferred Payment; provided that if such
Primary Retail Deferred Payment is less than the outstanding balance on
such Defaulted Retail Obligation or such other amount which is then being
charged thereto, the Agent may charge the difference to any other Retail
Deferred Payment the balance of which has not theretofore been remitted to
the Seller. 

Defaulted Retail Obligations so charged to a Retail Deferred
Payment shall be retained by the Agent, and any collections thereafter made
thereon (together with any other amounts received by the Agent on account
of any other obligation of the Seller theretofore charged to such Retail
Deferred Payment) shall be credited to the applicable Retail Deferred
Payment and shall be dealt with as provided in subsection 4.2(c). 

The Agent agrees with the Banks that in each case where the Agent
exercising the option provided in the first sentence of this subsection
4.2(b) elects not to charge to the Primary Retail Deferred Payment an
amount equal to the outstanding balance on a Sold Retail Obligation at the
time such Sold Retail Obligation is first identified as a Defaulted Retail
Obligation, the Agent shall give the Banks written notice of such election
within 20 days of the exercise thereof, describing in such notice in
reasonably complete detail the circumstances surrounding such election and
explaining why, in the Agent's reasonable opinion and in light of the
circumstances so described, the exercise of such election would not
reasonably be expected to prejudice the interests of the Banks. 

(c) Adjustments to Deferred Payment. If after completion of the
transactions provided for in subsection 4.1(b) and in subsections
4.2(a)(ii) and 4.2(b), in each case on any Settlement Date, the Retail
Deferred Payments applicable to any Sold Retail Obligations exceed the
Required Retail Deferred Payment Level applicable to such Sold Retail
Obligations, then the amount of such excess (herein called the "Retail
Deferred Payment Excess" applicable to such Sold Retail Obligations) shall
be applied in the following order on such Settlement Date:

(i) to the payment to the Agent of amounts thereof up to an
aggregate amount equal to the aggregate amount of the
unpaid balances payable under Defaulted Retail
Obligations purchased on each Closing Date which have
not been charged against their related Primary Retail
Deferred Payments less the aggregate amount of all
previous applications pursuant to this clause 4.2(c)(i)
relative to such Defaulted Retail Obligations purchased
on each such Closing Date (applied firstly to the
payment of such amounts relative to the Defaulted
Retail Obligations purchased on any Closing Date with
the largest aggregate unpaid balance, and then to the
payment of such amounts relative to the Defaulted
Retail Obligations purchased on other Closing Dates in
descending order of their respective aggregate unpaid
balances);

(ii) to the credit of Retail Deferred Payments applicable to
those Sold Retail Obligations whose related Primary
Retail Deferred Payments are in amounts less than their
respective Required Retail Deferred Payment Levels
(applied firstly to the Primary Retail Deferred Payment
with the greatest percentage deficiency relative to its
Required Retail Deferred Payment Level, and then to the
other Primary Retail Deferred Payments in descending
order of their respective percentage deficiencies
relative to their Required Retail Deferred Payment
Levels);

(iii) to the payment of any amounts payable by the
Seller to the Agent under subsection 4.1;

(iv) to the payment of any other amounts payable by the
Seller to the Agent under this Agreement or under the
Long-Term RPA;

(v) to the payment to the Agent of the amounts of any
liabilities, losses, costs, damages and expenses
suffered or incurred by the Agent or any Bank as a
result of any claims or proceedings by obligors under
Contracts which are included in the Sold Retail
Obligations and which relate to the vehicles that are
the subject matter of such Contracts or the financing
thereof; provided that the amount to be applied in
respect of any Retail Obligation under this clause
4.2(c)(v) shall be limited to the unpaid balance of
such Contract on the related Date of Sale; and 

(vi) subject to subsection 4.2(e), any remainder to the Seller.

(d) Required Retail Deferred Payment Level. As used herein, the
term "Required Retail Deferred Payment Level" applicable to any Sold Retail
Obligations shall mean the amount which is the greater of:

(A) the product of (I) the Deferred Percentage (Retail
Gross) with respect to such Retail Obligations
(determined as of such Settlement Date) times (II) the
unpaid balance of all such Retail Obligations, and

(B) the lesser of (I) the then unpaid balance of all such
Retail Obligations or (II) 4% of the sum of the Exact
Retail Amounts Due upon all such Retail Obligations as
of the Date of Sale thereof;

provided, however, that anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the aggregate of the Retail
Deferred Payments applicable to those Retail Obligations which have unpaid
balances of 4% or less of their respective Exact Retail Amounts Due thereon
as of their respective Dates of Sale exceed the greater of (x) $5,337,500
and (y) an amount equal to 5.45% of the maximum value of the Retail Amount
Outstanding on any Settlement Date (the "Maximum"), and if such aggregate
does exceed the Maximum, then the respective amounts of such Retail
Deferred Payments shall be reduced proportionately so that the aggregate
thereof equals the Maximum.

(e) Payments to Seller After Default. After the occurrence of
any material default by the Seller in the observance or performance of any
of the terms or conditions of this Agreement or after the occurrence of any
of the Commitment Termination Events referred to in Article VII of the
Long-Term RPA and so long as such default or event is continuing, any
Retail Deferred Payment Excess applicable to Sold Retail Obligations which
remains after the applications provided for in clauses (i), (ii), (iii),
(iv) and (v) of subsection 4.2(c) shall be paid to the Seller only if at or
prior to the time of such applications the Agent has received repayment in
full of the Banks' investment in the Sold Retail Obligations together with
the total return on such investment contemplated by subsection 2.4(b).

(f) Adjustments in Payments to Banks. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, it is agreed that it is the intention of
the parties that the Banks shall receive repayment of the Banks'
investments in Sold Retail Obligations purchased hereunder and shall
receive an annual rate of return (computed on a monthly basis) on the
Banks' investments in such Sold Retail Obligations for the period from each
Closing Date or Settlement Date, as the case may be, to the next succeeding
Settlement Date at the rates per annum described in subsection 2.4(b), and
that any Retail Deferred Payment Excess which would otherwise be payable to
the Seller on any Settlement Date pursuant to subsection 4.2(c)(vi) shall
be paid to the Agent if and to the extent necessary to give effect to such
intention with respect to the Sold Retail Obligations.

(g) Termination of Agreement. This Agreement will terminate
when all Sold Retail Obligations and all amounts payable to the Agent and
the Banks hereunder shall have been paid in full and any remaining Retail
Deferred Payment Excess shall have been applied in accordance with
subsection 4.2(c), and the Agent and the Banks shall have no further
agreement to purchase Retail Obligations hereunder; provided, however, that
the covenants, representations, warranties and indemnities of the Seller
and CFC to the Agent and the Banks set forth in this Agreement shall
survive such termination.

to be paid by the Agent to the Seller under this
Agreement on the Closing Date on which such Retail
Obligations are sold, plus or minus the amount of any

(ii) Effect of Purchase. Immediately upon the purchase, as
aforesaid, by a Bank of an addition to its Ownership

contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no Bank shall be required to
purchase an addition to its Ownership Interest, whether under subsections
7.3(a) or 7.3(c), such that after giving effect thereto (whether based upon
estimated or exact statements of the amount due) the amount of such Bank's
Ownership Interest would exceed the difference between (A) the Bank's
Commitment Amount and (B) the Bank's Purchase Percentage of the Long-Term
Wholesale Aggregate Invested Amount.

7.5 Sharing of Earned Discounts: Each Bank's pro rata share of
the aggregate amount of the discounts deducted by the Agent in computing
the purchase price of the Retail Obligations purchased under this Agreement
which shall have been earned by such Bank shall be calculated on the basis
that such Bank's annual rate of return (computed on a monthly basis) on its
investment calculated with respect to each Sold Retail Obligation shall be
equal to the Applicable Yield for such Sold Retail Obligation calculated as
if references to the "Blended BA/CDOR Spread" and "Blended Reserve

related document or instrument, or (C) to take any actions or proceedings
to realize upon or enforce the security or any of the other rights
constituted by any Sold Retail Obligation or any related document or
instrument. The Agent will advise the other Banks of any material actions
taken or proposed to be taken by it under this Agreement. 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection 7.9(a)(i), the
Agent will exercise any such rights or powers or take any such actions or
proceedings when expressly requested in writing to do so by Banks having a
then aggregate Ownership Percentage of more than 50%, or if there are no
Sold Retail Obligations, by Banks having a then aggregate Purchase
Percentage of more than 50%, following a meeting to which all Banks have
been invited on not less than two Business Days' notice to discuss the
proposed request; provided, however, that (A) the Agent shall under no
circumstances be under any obligation to take over itself the
administration, servicing and collection of any of the Sold Retail
Obligations pursuant to subsection 3.2(f) of this Agreement, and (B) any
decision to deliver a Daily Remittance Notice to the Seller in accordance
with subsection 3.1(c) of this Agreement or to take over the
administration, servicing and collection of any of the Sold Retail
Obligations pursuant to subsection 3.2(f) of this Agreement may only be
taken upon the written request of the Required Banks.

(b) Complete Servicing Transfer. If the administration,
servicing and collection of the Sold Retail Obligations is taken over by
the Agent or by one of the other Banks as the Agent's designee pursuant to
subsection 3.2(f) of this Agreement, then the Agent or such other Bank
shall be reimbursed its costs and expenses in connection with such
administration, servicing and collection on a basis to be agreed upon by
all the Banks at that time. If such administration, servicing and
collection is taken over by a third party selected by the Banks, then the
costs and expenses of such third party will be paid severally by all the
Banks pro rata according to their respective Ownership Percentages at the
time when such costs or expenses were incurred or accrued. This subsection
7.9(b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 

(c) Recovery From Seller or CFC. Any amounts paid by the Banks
to the Agent under subsection 7.9(b) hereof which are subsequently
recovered by the Agent from the Seller or CFC will be repaid by the Agent
to the Banks.

7.10 Non-Performance by Bank. 

(a) Consequences of Default. In the event any Bank (in this
section 7.10 the "Defaulting Bank") shall fail to perform any obligation
to be performed by it hereunder, the Agent may terminate, and thereby
acquire, or place with other parties, the entire Ownership Interest of such
Defaulting Bank in the Sold Retail Obligations (whereupon such Defaulting
Bank shall cease to have an interest in such Sold Retail Obligations)
without, however, relieving such Defaulting Bank from any liability for
damages, costs and expenses suffered by the Agent or any other Bank as a
result of such failure on the part of such Defaulting Bank. For the
purposes of any distributions to Banks of the amounts referred to in
subsection 7.6(a) pursuant to clause (ii) of subsection 7.6(a), the
Purchase Percentage of any Defaulting Bank shall be adjusted appropriately
to reflect such Defaulting Bank's remaining Ownership Interest. For the
purposes of any distributions to Banks of the amounts referred to in
subsections 7.6(a) or 7.6(b), the Purchase Percentage of any Defaulting
Bank shall be deemed to be nil from and after the time of default. 

(b) Purchase of Defaulting Bank's Interest. Without limiting
the foregoing, in the event that the Defaulting Bank shall fail to remit to
the Agent on any Closing Date such Bank's portion of the Retail Paid
Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due on such date, then each other
Bank whose Maximum Commitment is not then fully utilized (after giving
effect to any purchase on such date other than the purchase described in
this subsection 7.10) agrees to purchase, in an amount not exceeding the
such Bank's Available Commitment, such Defaulting Bank's addition to its
Ownership Interest in the Sold Retail Obligation to be purchased on such
date and shall pay to the Agent, as the purchase price therefor, an amount
determined for each Bank (other than the Defaulting Bank) by multiplying
(i) the lesser of (A) such Defaulting Bank's portion of the Paid Percentage
of the Estimated Retail Amount Due on such date or (B) the sum of each
Bank's Available Commitment (other than the Defaulting Bank) times (ii) the
then percentage equivalent of a fraction the numerator of which is such
Bank's Available Commitment and the denominator of which is the sum of each
Bank's Available Commitment (other than the Defaulting Bank). Any
additional interest purchased by a Bank pursuant to this subsection 7.10
shall be deemed a part of such Bank's investment for purposes of the
definition of "Ownership Interest" as of the date of such purchase. The
purchase of an additional interest pursuant to this subsection 7.10 shall
not relieve the Defaulting Bank from any liability for damages, costs and
expenses suffered by the Seller, the Agent or any other Bank as a result of
such failure on the part of such Defaulting Bank. 

(c) Liability of Banks to Agent. Each Bank hereby expressly
acknowledges that it shall be liable for any damages, costs or expenses
suffered by the Seller, the Agent or any other Bank as a result of any
failure to remit to the Agent on any Closing Date its portion of the Retail
Paid Percentage of the Estimated Retail Amount Due including, without
limitation, in the case of the Seller, all damages suffered as a result of
any failure of the Agent to purchase any Retail Obligations pursuant to
subsection 2.1.

7.11 Information. The Agent will forward or make available, as
it deems appropriate, to each Bank copies of

(a) each Settlement Statement received by the Agent from the
Seller; and

(b) all other documents or information so received and
considered pertinent by the Agent or reasonably requested by
the Bank.

Period, the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount may upon the
request of the Seller be increased (an "Increase") by requiring each Bank
Series 1994-1 Certificateholder to purchase an increase in its undivided
ownership interest in the Purchased Property and the Bank Invested Amount
of each Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholder shall be increased
correspondingly by an amount equal to its Purchase Percentage of the
Increase upon payment to the Custodian of a purchase price (the "Purchase

Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount occurs hereunder being herein
referred to as the "Increase Date" applicable to such Increase); provided
that CCCL shall have given the Agent irrevocable written notice (effective
upon receipt) of such request pursuant to subsection 2.4 of the Long-Term
RPA, and provided, further, that no more than one Increase shall be made

preceding Determination Date);

(ii) no Bank Series 1994-1 Early Amortization Event and no event
which, with the lapse of time, the giving of notice, or

Bank Series 1994-1 Early Amortization Event, shall have
occurred and be continuing;

(iii) after giving effect to the Increase, the Pool Balance shall
be greater than or equal to the Required Participation
Amount as of the last day of the immediately preceding
Collection Period; 

(iv) the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.4 of the

Deposit") equal to the Daily Wholesale Prime Rate Yield
Amount which would accrue with respect to such Increase for
the period from and including the date of such Increase to
but excluding such Distribution Date; 

(vi) the amount on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall be greater
than or equal to the Reserve Fund Required Amount after
giving effect to such Increase;

(vii) after giving effect to the Increase, the Long-Term Aggregate
Invested Amount (as defined in the Long-Term RPA) shall not

substantially in the form of Exhibit E and covering such
other legal matters as the Agent or its counsel may

(x) a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Seller that
the Account Assets are free and clear of any Liens; and

(xi) a certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of the
Seller, dated the relevant Increase Date, to the effect that
all instruments required by applicable legislation to be
registered or filed in order to protect, perfect and
preserve the rights of the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate-
holders in all the Purchased Property have been or will be,
within the time prescribed by the applicable legislation,
duly executed by the required parties thereto and registered
and filed in each appropriate office in each applicable
jurisdiction (which certificate shall also have annexed
thereto a schedule setting forth each such instrument and
each such office in which such registrations or filings have
been or will be made and such certificate shall also state
that such instruments are the only instrument required and
such offices are the only offices in which registration or
filing is required by applicable legislation in order to
protect, perfect and preserve the interest of the Bank
Series 1994-1 Certificateholders in such Purchased Property
against all creditors of and purchasers from the Seller).

(c) In the case of the first Increase requested to be made after
the Effective Date, the obligation of the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate-
holders to make such Increase is subject to satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in subsection 3.2(b) and subject to satisfaction of the
further following conditions precedent on or before such Increase Date:

(i) a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Seller that
the Account Assets are free and clear of any Liens, which
certificate shall have attached thereto the results of
recent searches with respect to the Seller in each of the
Relevant Provinces; and

(ii) if the Seller has agreed to Transfer or has Transferred any
of its wholesale receivables (other than the Receivables) to
any Persons otherwise than pursuant to the Agreement and a
Supplement, the Custodian on behalf of the Bank Series 1994-1
Certificateholders shall have entered into such agreements
with such Persons as are required by and in accordance with
Section 11.01(h) of the Agreement; provided that in such
Section the term "co-ownership agreement" and "inter-
creditor agreement" shall be deemed to include inter-
purchaser and inter-transferee agreements. 

(d) Payment by the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders in
respect of any Increase shall be made by the Agent to the Custodian and the
Custodian hereby directs that such payment be made to the Seller.

SECTION 3.3. Procedure for Decreasing the Aggregate Bank Series
1994-1 Invested Amount. On any Distribution Date during the Revolving
Period, the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount may be reduced (a
"Decrease") upon request of the Seller by the distribution to the Agent on
behalf of the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders of some or all of
Available Bank Principal Collections on such Distribution Date; provided
that the Seller shall have given the Agent irrevocable written notice
(effective upon receipt) prior to 12:00 Noon (Toronto Time) two Business
Days prior to the date of such Decrease stating the amount of such Decrease
and provided, further, that such Decrease shall be in an amount equal to or
greater than $1,000,000. The Available Subordinated Amount shall
simultaneously be reduced to an amount equal to the Required Subordinated
Amount after giving effect to such Decrease.

SECTION 3.4. Yield. Yield calculated at the rates and in the
manner provided for in Section 5.2 shall be payable on the Bank Series
1994-1 Certificates on each Distribution Date pursuant to Section 5.6. 
Calculations of per annum rates and fees under this Bank Series 1994-1
Supplement shall be made on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year (as
applicable) for actual days elapsed. Any change in Yield payable hereunder
resulting from a change in the Wholesale Prime Rate shall become effective
as of the opening of business on the day on which such change is announced. 
Whenever in respect of any Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate, the yield is
calculated on the basis of a 365 day year, the annual equivalent of such
rate is equal to the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate Rate multiplied by 365
(or 366, in leap years) and divided by the actual number of days in the
calendar year.

SECTION 3.5. Changes in Available Subordinated Amount. The
Available Subordinated Amount may be increased on each Increase Date by the
Seller to the Required Subordinated Amount by notice to the Custodian and
the Agent on or before such Increase Date.

ARTICLE IV

Servicing Fee

SECTION 4.1. Servicing Compensation. A monthly servicing fee,
inclusive of applicable taxes, including goods and services tax, if any
(the "Monthly Servicing Fee"), shall be payable by the Bank Series 1994-1
Certificateholders and the Seller to any Successor Servicer, other than a
Successor Servicer which is an Affiliate of CCCL, in arrears, on each
Distribution Date in respect of any Collection Period (or portion thereof)
occurring prior to the Termination Date in an amount to be agreed upon by
the Successor Servicer and by the Custodian, as agent for and on behalf of
the Master Custodial Certificateholders; provided, however, that the
Monthly Servicing Fee shall not exceed an amount equal to one-twelfth of
the product of 

(a) 1%, 

(b) the Pool Balance as of the last day of the Collection Period
second preceding such Distribution Date and

(c) the Bank Series 1994-1 Allocation Percentage with respect to the
immediately preceding Collection Period. 

No Monthly Servicing Fee shall be payable while CCCL or any Affiliate of
CCCL is the Servicer. The share of the Monthly Servicing Fee allocable to
the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders with respect to any Distribution
Date (the "Bank Series 1994-1 Monthly Servicing Fee") shall be equal to
one-twelfth of the product of

(a) the Servicing Fee Rate and 

(b) the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount as of the last
day of the Collection Period second preceding such Distribution
Date. 

The remainder of the Monthly Servicing Fee shall be paid by the Seller and
in no event shall the Custodian or the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate-
holders be liable for the share of the Monthly Servicing Fee to be paid by
the Seller; and the remainder of the Servicing Fee shall be paid by the
Seller and the Investor Master Custodial Certificateholders of other Series
and the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders shall in no event be liable
for the share of the Servicing Fee to be paid by the Seller or the Investor
Master Custodial Certificateholders of other Series. The Bank Series 1994-1
Monthly Servicing Fee shall be payable to the Servicer solely to the
extent amounts are available for distribution in accordance with the terms
of this Bank Series 1994-1 Supplement.

Any Successor Servicer will be permitted, in its sole discretion,
to waive the Monthly Servicing Fee, if any, for any Distribution Date by
notice to the Custodian on or before the related Determination Date;
provided that the Successor Servicer believes that sufficient Collections
of Non-Principal Receivables will be available on any future Distribution
Date to pay the Bank Series 1994-1 Monthly Servicing Fee relating to the
waived Monthly Servicing Fee. If the Successor Servicer so waives the
Monthly Servicing Fee for any Distribution Date, the Monthly Servicing Fee
and the Bank Series 1994-1 Monthly Servicing Fee for such Distribution Date
shall be deemed to be zero for all purposes of this Bank Series 1994-1
Supplement and the Agreement; provided, however, that such Bank Series
1994-1 Monthly Servicing Fee shall be paid on a future Distribution Date
solely to the extent amounts are available therefor pursuant to
Section 5.10(b); provided further that, to the extent any such waived Bank
Series 1994-1 Monthly Servicing Fee is so paid, the related portion of the
Monthly Servicing Fee to be paid by the Seller shall be paid by the Seller
to the Successor Servicer.

ARTICLE V

Application of Collections

SECTION 5.1. Allocations; Payments to Seller; Excess Principal
Collections and Unallocated Principal Collections.

(a) Collections of Non-Principal Receivables and Principal

Principal Collections deposited in the Collection
Account on such Deposit Date; and

(B) an amount equal to the Excess Seller's Percentage for
the related Collection Period of Allocable Principal
Collections deposited in the Collection Account on such
Deposit Date, if the Seller's Invested Amount
(determined after giving effect to the transfer of any
Principal Receivables to the Custodian on such Deposit
Date) exceeds the Custodial Available Subordinated
Amount for the immediately preceding Determination Date
(after giving effect to the allocations, distributions,
withdrawals and deposits to be made on the Distribution
Date immediately following such Determination Date and
to any Increase made thereafter that is not reflected
in the Custodial Available Subordinated Amount); and

(ii) on each Deposit Date with respect to the Revolving Period,
an amount equal to the Available Seller's Principal
Collections for such Deposit Date, if the Seller's Invested
Amount (determined after giving effect to any Principal
Receivables transferred to the Custodian on such Deposit
Date) exceeds the Custodial Available Subordinated Amount
for the immediately preceding Determination Date (after
giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals
and deposits to be made on the Distribution Date immediately
following such Determination Date and to any Increase made
thereafter that is not reflected in the Custodial Available
Subordinated Amount); provided, however, that Available
Seller's Principal Collections shall be paid to the Seller
with respect to any Collection Period only after an amount
equal to the sum of 

(A) the Deficiency Amount, if any, relating to the
immediately preceding Collection Period and 

(B) the excess, if any, of the Reserve Fund Required Amount
over the amount in the Reserve Fund on the immediately
preceding Distribution Date (after giving effect to the
allocations of, distributions from, and deposits in,
the Reserve Fund on such Distribution Date), has been
deposited in the Collection Account for the account of
Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders from such
Available Seller's Principal Collections.

The withdrawals to be made from the Collection Account pursuant
to this Section 5.1(b) do not apply to deposits into the Collection Account
that do not represent Collections, including Miscellaneous Payments,

Interest pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Agreement, payments of the
purchase price for the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders' Interest
pursuant to Section 9.1 of this Bank Series 1994-1 Supplement and proceeds
from the sale, disposition or liquidation of Receivables pursuant to
Section 12.02 of the Agreement.

(c) The Servicer shall instruct the Custodian to withdraw from
the Collection Account and deposit into the Reserve Fund on each Deposit
Date during the Revolving Period Available Seller's Principal Collections
for such Deposit Date, up to the amount of the excess, if any, determined
pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ii)(B).

SECTION 5.2. Yield and Yield Options. 

(a) (i) The amount of yield ("Yield") with respect to the Bank
Series 1994-1 Certificates payable on any Distribution Date
shall be an amount equal to the sum of (x) the product of
(A) the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate Rate for such Yield
Period, (B) the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount
as of the close of business on the preceding Distribution
Date (after giving effect to all repayments of principal
made to Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders on such
preceding Distribution Date, if any) and (C) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the actual number of days elapsed in
such Yield Period and the denominator of which is 365 (or
366, in leap years) and (y) the product of (A) the Bank
Series 1994-1 Certificate Rate for such Yield Period, (B)
the amount of any Increase made after such preceding
Distribution Date and prior to the first day of the calendar
month following such preceding Distribution Date, and (C) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the actual number of
days elapsed from and including the Increase Date related to
such Increase to but excluding the next succeeding
Distribution Date and the denominator of which is 365 (or
366, in leap years) and (z) the amount equal to any Pre-
Yield Period Deposit made during the Yield Period preceding
such Yield Period.

(ii) In the event the Wholesale Prime Rate changes during the
period between any Determination Date and the following
Distribution Date and a portion of the Aggregate Bank Series
1994-1 Invested Amount has not been allocated to the BA
Tranche, the Servicer and the Agent shall cooperate on the
date of such change in modifying the Distribution Date
Statement to reflect the adjustment in the Yield for the
then current Yield Period caused by such change and any
consequent adjustments, including adjustment to the
Deficiency Amount, if any. Any such modification, including
any adjustment to the Deficiency Amount shall be completed
by 10:00 a.m. on such Distribution Date.

(b) On the Determination Date preceding each Distribution Date, the
Servicer shall determine the excess, if any (the "Yield Shortfall"), of
(x) the aggregate Yield for the Yield Period applicable to such
Distribution Date over (y) the amount which will be available to be
distributed to Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders on such Distribution
Date in respect thereof pursuant to this Bank Series 1994-1 Supplement. If
the Yield Shortfall with respect to any Distribution Date is greater than
zero, an additional amount ("Additional Yield") equal to the product of
(i) the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate Rate for the Yield Period commencing
on the related Distribution Date (or, for subsequent Yield Periods, the
Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate Rate for such subsequent Yield Periods),
(ii) such Yield Shortfall (or the portion thereof which has not been paid)
and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual number of days
elapsed in such Yield Period (or in a subsequent Yield Period) and the
denominator of which is 365 (or 366, in leap years) shall be payable as
provided herein with respect to the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificates on each
Distribution Date following such Distribution Date to and including the
Distribution Date on which such Yield Shortfall is paid. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Additional Yield shall be payable or
distributed to Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders only to the extent
permitted by applicable law.

(c) (i) At least three Business Days prior to each Distribution
Date, the Seller may elect to have the yield due to the Bank
Series 1994-1 Certificateholders hereunder on all or any
portion of the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount
(determined in each case on such Distribution Date and after
giving effect to any distributions and Increases proposed on
such Date) based on the Wholesale Prime Rate or on one or
more Wholesale Bankers' Acceptance Rates for Canadian dollar
discount bankers' acceptances issued on the Distribution
Date maturing in a minimum of 28 days and a maximum of 180
days on a Distribution Date. The rate selection shall apply
for the period from and including the Distribution Date in
respect of which the election is being made to but not
including the immediately following Distribution Date;
provided, however, that if the Seller selects a Wholesale
Bankers' Acceptance Rate for discount bankers' acceptances
maturing after such immediately following Distribution Date,
then the Seller shall be deemed to have selected such rate
in respect of the applicable portion or portions of the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount for the period
to the maturity date for such discount bankers' acceptances.

(ii) The Seller shall give written or telephonic notice (promptly
confirmed in writing) to the Agent of such election and
shall specify in such notice the portion or portions of the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount to which each
such rate shall apply. If the Seller fails to give notice
of its yield option election in a timely manner as required,
the yield on the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested
Amount (other than the portion or portions for which the
Seller shall have been deemed to have selected a rate as
aforesaid) shall be based on the Wholesale Prime Rate.

(iii) Promptly after receiving the Seller's yield option election
as aforesaid, the Agent shall notify each Bank Series 1994-1
Certificateholder thereof.

(iv) On each Distribution Date on which a Wholesale Bankers'
Acceptance Rate is to be calculated, each Bank Series 1994-1
Certificateholder will notify the Agent and the Seller of
its applicable Certificateholder's Bankers' Acceptance Rate.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection
5.2(c),

(A) the portion of the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1
Invested Amount to which a particular Wholesale
Bankers' Acceptance Rate shall apply shall be a minimum
of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof, and

(B) in the event that the Agent shall have determined
(which determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Seller) that (I) quotation of annual rates for
the relevant discount bankers' acceptances referred to
above are not being provided in the relevant amount or
for the relevant maturities for the purposes of
determining the yield when based on the Wholesale
Bankers' Acceptance Rate, or (II) the Wholesale
Bankers' Acceptance Rate does not accurately reflect
the cost to the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders
of adding to or maintaining their respective
investments in their respective portions of the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount, the Agent
shall forthwith give written notice of such
determination to the Seller at least one day prior to
the Distribution Date on which such rate is to be
applied hereunder and if such notice is given then,
until such notice has been withdrawn by the Agent, the
Seller shall not have the option to elect the
calculation of the annual rate of return based upon the
Wholesale Bankers' Acceptance Rate.

(d) Anything contained in this Section 5.2 to the contrary
notwithstanding, after the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Bank Series 1994-1 Early Amortization Event, the Seller may not elect to
allocate all or any part of the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested
Amount to the BA Tranche.

SECTION 5.3. Determination of Monthly Principal. The amount of
monthly principal ("Monthly Principal") distributable with respect to the
Bank Series 1994-1 Certificates on each Distribution Date with respect to
any Bank Series 1994-1 Early Amortization Period shall be equal to the
Available Bank Principal Collections with respect to such Distribution
Date; provided, however, that Monthly Principal shall not exceed the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount.

SECTION 5.4. Establishment of Reserve Fund.

(a) (i) The Custodian, as agent for and on behalf of the Bank Series
1994-1 Certificateholders, shall cause to be established and
maintained at the Custodian an Eligible Deposit Account (the
"Reserve Fund") which shall be identified as the "Reserve
Fund for the Master Custodial and Servicing Agreement, Bank
Series 1994-1" and shall bear a designation clearly
indicating that the funds deposited therein belong to the
Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders and to the Seller as
their interests appear herein.

(ii) At the direction of the Servicer, funds on deposit in the
Reserve Fund shall be invested by the Custodian in Eligible
Investments selected by the Servicer that will mature so
that such funds will be available at the close of business
on or before the Business Day next preceding the following
Distribution Date. All Eligible Investments shall be held by
the Custodian as agent for and on behalf of the Bank Series
1994-1 Certificateholders and the Seller as their interests
appear herein. On each Distribution Date, all interest and
other investment earnings (net of losses and investment
expenses) on funds on deposit in the Reserve Fund received
prior to such Distribution Date shall be applied as set
forth in Section 5.6(a) of this Bank Series 1994-1
Supplement. Funds deposited in the Reserve Fund on a
Business Day (which immediately precedes a Distribution
Date) upon the maturity of any Eligible Investments are not
required to be invested overnight.

(b) (i) The Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders shall possess all
right, title and interest in and to all funds on deposit
from time to time in, and all Eligible Investments credited
to, the Reserve Fund and in all proceeds thereof, except to
the extent of the interest of the Seller therein to the
extent expressly set forth in this Bank Series 1994-1
Supplement. The Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders
agree, by acceptance of their Bank Series 1994-1
Certificates and without further action, that all such funds
and Eligible Investments shall be maintained, invested and
disbursed in accordance with this Bank Series 1994-1
Supplement and the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders
hereby authorize and empower the Custodian and the Servicer
to maintain, invest and disburse such funds and Eligible
Investments in accordance with this Bank Series 1994-1
Supplement. If, at any time, the Reserve Fund ceases to be
an Eligible Deposit Account, the Custodian (or the Servicer
on its behalf) shall within 10 Business Days (or such longer
period, not to exceed 30 calendar days, as to which the
Agent may consent) establish a new Reserve Fund meeting the
conditions specified in paragraph 5.4(a)(i) above, as
applicable, as an Eligible Deposit Account and shall
transfer any cash and/or any investments to such new Reserve
Fund. None of the Seller, the Servicer, the Custodian nor
any person or entity claiming by, through or under the
Seller, the Servicer, the Custodian or any such person or
entity shall have any right, title or interest in, or any
right to withdraw any amount from, the Reserve Fund, except
as expressly provided herein. Schedule 1, which is hereby
incorporated into and made part of this Bank Series 1994-1
Supplement, identifies the Reserve Fund by setting forth the
account number of such account, the account designation of
such account and the name of the institution with which such
account has been established. If a substitute Reserve Fund
is established pursuant to this Section, the Servicer, prior
to making any deposits therein, shall provide to the
Custodian an amended Schedule 1, setting forth the relevant
information for such substitute Reserve Fund.

(ii) Pursuant to the authority granted to the Servicer in
Section 4.01(a) of the Agreement, the Servicer shall have
the power, revocable by the Custodian, to make withdrawals
and payments or to instruct the Custodian to make
withdrawals and payments from the Reserve Fund for the
purposes of carrying out the Servicer's or Custodian's
duties hereunder.

(iii) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Agent, at no time may
Eligible Investments in a principal amount equal to more
than 10% of the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount
be invested in Eligible Investments (other than obligations
of the Government of Canada) of any single entity or its
Affiliates.

SECTION 5.5. Deficiency Amount. With respect to each
Distribution Date, on the related Determination Date, the Servicer shall
determine the amount (the "Deficiency Amount"), if any, by which 

(a) the sum of 

(i) Yield for such Distribution Date, 

(ii) any Yield previously due but not distributed to the Bank
Series 1994-1 Certificateholders on a prior Distribution
Date, 

(iii) Additional Yield, if any, for such Distribution Date and any
Additional Yield previously due but not distributed to the
Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders on a prior
Distribution Date,

(iv) the Bank Series 1994-1 Monthly Servicing Fee, if any, for
such Distribution Date, and 

(v) the Bank Defaulted Amount, if any, for such Distribution
Date, and 

(vi) the Bank Series 1994-1 Allocation Percentage of the amount
of any Adjustment Payment required to be deposited in the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.09(a) of the
Agreement with respect to the related Collection Period that
has not been so deposited as of such Determination Date, 

exceeds

(b) the sum of 

(i) Bank Non-Principal Collections for such Distribution Date,
Available Seller's Non-Principal Collections for such
Distribution Date, any Investment Proceeds with respect to
such Distribution Date, and 

(ii) the amount of funds in the Reserve Fund which are available
pursuant to Section 5.8(a) to cover any portion of the
Deficiency Amount. 

The lesser of the Deficiency Amount and the Available Subordinated Amount
shall be the "Required Subordination Draw Amount".

SECTION 5.6. Application of Bank Non-Principal Collections,
Available Seller's Non-Principal Collections, Investment Proceeds and
Available Bank Principal Collections. The Servicer shall cause the
Custodian to apply, on each Distribution Date, Bank Non-Principal
Collections, Available Seller's Non-Principal Collections, Investment
Proceeds and Available Bank Principal Collections to make the following
distributions:

(a) On each Distribution Date, an amount equal to the sum of Bank
Non-Principal Collections, Available Seller's Non-Principal
Collections and any Investment Proceeds with respect to the
preceding Collection Period will be distributed in the following
priority:

(i) first, an amount equal to Yield for such Distribution Date,
plus the amount of any Yield previously due but not
distributed to the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders on
a prior Distribution Date, plus the amount of any Additional
Yield for such Distribution Date and any Additional Yield
previously due but not distributed to the Bank Series 1994-1
Certificateholders on a prior Distribution Date, shall be
distributed to the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders;

(ii) second, an amount equal to the Bank Series 1994-1 Monthly
Servicing Fee, if any, for such Distribution Date shall be
distributed to the Successor Servicer (unless such amount
has been netted against deposits to the Collection Account
or waived);

(iii) third, an amount equal to the Bank Defaulted Amount for such
Distribution Date shall be distributed and treated as a
portion of Bank Principal Collections for such Distribution
Date;

(iv) fourth, an amount equal to the Reserve Fund Deposit Amount,
if any, for such Distribution Date shall be deposited in the
Reserve Fund; and

(v) fifth, the balance, if any, shall constitute Excess Income
and shall be allocated and distributed as set forth in
Section 5.10.

(b) (i) On each Distribution Date with respect to the Revolving
Period with respect to which the Seller has notified the
Agent a Decrease will occur, an amount of Available Bank
Principal Collections deposited in the Collection Account
for the related Collection Period equal to such Decrease
will be distributed to the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate-
holders. The Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount
shall be reduced by the amount of Available Bank Principal
Collections so distributed. Any such remaining Available
Bank Principal Collections shall be treated as Excess
Principal Collections and applied in accordance with Section
4.04 of the Agreement.

(ii) On each Distribution Date with respect to the Revolving
Period with respect to which the Seller has not notified the
Agent it will be making a Decrease, an amount equal to
Available Bank Principal Collections deposited in the
Collection Account for the related Collection Period shall
be treated as Excess Principal Collections and applied in
accordance with Section 4.04 of the Agreement.

(c) On each Distribution Date with respect to a Bank Series 1994-1
Early Amortization Period, an amount equal to Available Bank
Principal Collections will be distributed in the following
priority:

(i) first, an amount equal to Monthly Principal for such
Distribution Date shall be paid to the Bank Series 1994-1
Certificateholders; and

(ii) second, after giving effect to the payment referred to in
clause (i) above, an amount equal to the balance, if any, of
such Available Bank Principal Collections shall be treated
as Excess Principal Collections and applied in accordance
with Section 4.04 of the Agreement and Section 5.11 hereof.

SECTION 5.7. Distributions to Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate-
holders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Bank Series
1994-1 Supplement or the Agreement, to the extent there are any amounts
owing to the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders hereunder on the
Termination Date, such amounts shall be distributed to the Bank Series
1994-1 Certificateholders from Available Seller's Collections on such
Termination Date.

SECTION 5.8. Application of Reserve Fund and Available
Subordinated Amount. 

(a) If the portion of Bank Non-Principal Collections, Available
Seller's Non-Principal Collections and Investment Proceeds allocated to
Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders on any Distribution Date pursuant to
Section 5.6(a) is not sufficient to make the entire distributions required
on such Distribution Date by Sections 5.6(a)(i), 5.6(a)(ii) and
5.6(a)(iii), the Servicer shall cause the Custodian to withdraw funds from
the Reserve Fund, to the extent available therein, and apply such funds to
complete the distributions pursuant to Sections 5.6(a)(i), 5.6(a)(ii) and
5.6(a)(iii).

(b) If there is a Required Subordination Draw Amount for such
Distribution Date, the Servicer shall apply or cause the Custodian to apply
the Available Seller's Principal Collections on deposit in the Collection
Account on such Distribution Date, but only up to the amount of the
Required Subordination Draw Amount, to make the distributions required by
Sections 5.6(a)(i), 5.6(a)(ii) and 5.6(a)(iii) that have not been made
through the application of funds from the Reserve Fund in accordance with
the preceding paragraph. Any such Available Seller's Principal Collections
remaining after the application thereof pursuant to the preceding sentence
and any Available Seller's Non-Principal Collections remaining after the
application thereof pursuant to Section 5.6(a) shall be treated as a
portion of Bank Principal Collections for such Distribution Date, but only
up to the amount of unpaid Adjustment Payments allocated to the Bank Series
1994-1 as described in Section 5.5(a)(vi). The amount of the Available
Seller's Principal Collections applied in accordance with the two preceding
sentences shall reduce the Available Subordinated Amount as described in
clause (c) of the definition thereof. If the Required Subordination Draw
Amount exceeds Available Seller's Collections for such Distribution Date,
the Available Subordinated Amount shall be further reduced by the amount of
such excess, but not by more than the sum of (x) the Bank Defaulted Amount
and (y) an amount of unpaid Adjustment Payments allocated to the Bank
Series 1994-1 as described in Section 5.5(a)(vi).

(c) If, after giving effect to the allocations of, distributions
from, and deposits in, the Reserve Fund made pursuant to Sections 5.1(c),
5.4, 5.6(a) and 5.8(a), the amount in the Reserve Fund is greater than the
Reserve Fund Required Amount for such Distribution Date, the Servicer shall
cause the Custodian to distribute such excess amount to the Seller,
provided that the Custodial Available Subordinated Amount for the
immediately preceding Determination Date exceeds the Seller's Invested
Amount on such date (determined after giving effect to any Principal
Receivables Transferred to the Custodian on such Distribution Date). On
the Termination Date, any funds in the Reserve Fund will be treated as
Available Bank Principal Collections. Upon the earlier of the Termination
Date and the payment in full of the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested
Amount any funds remaining on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall be paid to
the Seller.

(d) If, for any Distribution Date with respect to a Bank Series 1994-1
Early Amortization Event, after giving effect to the allocations of,
distributions from, and deposits in, the Reserve Fund made pursuant to
Sections 5.1(c), 5.4, 5.6(a) and 5.8, the amount in the Reserve Fund is
less than the Reserve Fund Required Amount for such Distribution Date, the
Custodian shall deposit any remaining Available Seller's Principal
Collections on deposit in the Collection Account for such Distribution Date
into the Reserve Fund until the amount in the Reserve Fund is equal to such
Reserve Fund Required Amount.

(e) The balance of Available Seller's Principal Collections on any
Distribution Date, after giving effect to any distributions thereof
pursuant to Section 5.6 and this Section 5.8(b) and 5.8(d) shall be
distributed to the Seller on such Distribution Date, provided that, the
Custodial Available Subordinated Amount for the immediately preceding
Determination Date exceeds the Seller's Invested Amount on such date
(determined after giving effect to any Principal Receivables Transferred to
the Custodian on such Distribution Date).

SECTION 5.9. Bank Charge-Offs. If, on any Distribution Date on
which the Available Subordinated Amount on the preceding Determination Date
(after giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and
deposits to be made on such Distribution Date) is zero and the Deficiency
Amount for such Distribution Date is greater than zero, the Aggregate Bank
Series 1994-1 Invested Amount shall be reduced by the amount (a "Bank
Charge-Off") of the excess of such Deficiency Amount over any remaining
Available Subordinated Amount on such Determination Date, but not by more
than the Bank Defaulted Amount. The Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders
shall thereafter be reimbursed in respect of the Bank Charge-Offs and the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount increased (but not by an
amount in excess of the aggregate unreimbursed Bank Charge-Offs on any
Distribution Date) by the sum of 

(a) Allocable Miscellaneous Payments with respect to such
Distribution Date and 

(b) the amount of Excess Income allocated and available for that
purpose pursuant to Section 5.10(a).

SECTION 5.10. Excess Income. The Servicer shall cause the
Custodian to apply, on each Distribution Date, Excess Income with respect
to the Collection Period immediately preceding such Distribution Date, to
make the following distributions in the following priority:

(a) an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Bank Charge-Offs in
respect of which the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders have
not been previously reimbursed as provided in Section 5.9 (after
giving effect to the allocation on such Distribution Date of any
amount for that purpose pursuant to Section 5.9) shall be treated
as a portion of Bank Principal Collections with respect to such
Distribution Date;

(b) an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding amounts of the Bank
Series 1994-1 Monthly Servicing Fee, if any, which have been
previously waived pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be distributed to
the Servicer; and

(c) the balance, if any, shall be distributed to the Seller.

SECTION 5.11. Excess Principal Collections. 

(a) On each Distribution Date, the Servicer shall allocate a portion
of Excess Principal Collections to the Bank Series 1994-1 as set forth in
this Bank Series 1994-1 Supplement. That portion of Excess Principal
Collections for any Distribution Date allocated to the Bank Series 1994-1
for any Distribution Date (the "Bank Series 1994-1 Excess Principal
Collections") shall be the amount specified under Section 5.11(b) and shall
be distributed as set forth in this Bank Series 1994-1 Supplement.

(b) Bank Series 1994-1 Excess Principal Collections, with respect to
any Distribution Date, shall be an amount equal to the Bank Series 1994-1
Principal Shortfall for such Distribution Date; provided, however, that, if
the aggregate amount of Excess Principal Collections for all Series for
such Distribution Date is less than the aggregate amount of Principal
Shortfalls for all Series for such Distribution Date, then Bank Series
1994-1 Excess Principal Collections for such Distribution Date shall be an
amount equal the product of (x) Excess Principal Collections for all Series
for such Distribution Date and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the Bank Series 1994-1 Principal Shortfall for such Distribution Date and
the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Principal Shortfalls
for all Series for such Distribution Date. The "Bank Series 1994-1
Principal Shortfall", with respect to any Distribution Date, means an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) (x) for any Distribution Date
with respect to the Revolving Period, the amount of the Decrease, if any,
with respect to such Distribution Date or (y) for any Distribution Date
with respect to a Bank Series 1994-1 Early Amortization Period, the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount, over (ii) Available Bank
Principal Collections for such Distribution Date (excluding any portion
thereof attributable to Excess Principal Collections).

SECTION 5.12. Allocations and Applications of Collections and
Other Funds. For purposes of Section 4.03(e)(i) of the Agreement as it
relates to the Bank Series 1994-1 and the definition of Series Adjusted
Invested Amount as it relates to the Bank Series 1994-1, each Increase
pursuant to Section 3.2 of this Bank Series 1994-1 Supplement and each
Decrease pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Bank Series 1994-1 Supplement (and
any related increase or decrease in the Available Subordinated Amount)
shall be deemed to have occurred as of the last day of the Collection
Period immediately preceding the Collection Period in which such Increase
or Decrease occurs. 

ARTICLE VI

(a) On each Distribution Date with respect to a Collection Period
during which the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount was greater

Article V and (ii) such Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholder's Purchase

"Blended Wholesale Rate" were references to the applicable "Certificate-
holder's Bankers' Acceptance Rate".

(b) Except as provided in Section 12.02 of the Agreement with respect
to a final distribution, distributions to Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate-
holders hereunder shall be made by wire transfer to the Agent on behalf of
each Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholder without presentation or surrender
of any Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate or the making of any notation
thereon; provided, however, that, subject to the receipt of the
Distribution Date Statement pursuant to Section 6.3(a) hereof, the
Custodian shall give wire transfer instructions with respect to such
distributions by 10:00 a.m., Toronto time, for wire transfer of such
distributions to the Agent to the account specified by the Agent at the
Royal Bank of Canada, Main Branch, Royal Bank Plaza, Toronto, Ontario, or

Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested Amount is greater than zero, the
Servicer shall provide the Agent and the Custodian with a Daily Report and
the Agent shall at the reasonable request of the Bank Series 1994-1
Certificateholders make copies of the Daily Reports available at its Main

with respect to a Collection Period during which the Aggregate Bank Series
1994-1 Invested Amount was greater than zero at any time, the Servicer

Statement and the Agent shall forward a copy of each such statement to each
Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholder.

(c) Bank Series 1994-1 Early Amortization Period Notices. Upon the
occurrence of a Bank Series 1994-1 Early Amortization Event or any event
which, with the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both, or the
satisfaction of any other condition, would be a Bank Series 1994-1 Early
Amortization Event, the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, shall
give prompt written notice thereof to the Custodian and the Agent. In
addition, the Seller shall give the Agent written notice of the occurrence
and nature of an Early Amortization Event with respect to any other Series
which is not a Bank Series 1994-1 Early Amortization Event or any event
which, with the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both, or the
satisfaction of any other condition would be an Early Amortization Event
for such other Series.

(d) Annual Tax Statement. As soon as practicable after the end of
each calendar year during which the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-1 Invested
Amount was greater than zero at any time, beginning with calendar year
1994, the Custodian shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each Person
who at any time during the preceding calendar year was a Bank Series 1994-1
Certificateholder, a statement prepared by the Servicer containing the
information which is required to be contained in the Distribution Date
Statement aggregated for such preceding calendar year or the applicable
portion thereof during which such Person was a Bank Series 1994-1
Certificateholder, together with other information as is necessary to
enable the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificateholders to prepare their Canadian
federal and provincial income, large corporations and capital tax returns. 

(e) Tax Information. Each of the Custodian, the Servicer and the
Seller shall, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, in
connection with any assessment, reassessment or audit of any Bank Series
1994-1 Certificateholder under or pursuant to any relevant Canadian federal
or provincial taxing legislation, or any objection to or appeal from such
assessment, reassessment or audit, make available to the affected Bank
Series 1994-1 Certificateholder, its advisors and relevant taxing
authorities, all information, records, and documents in its possession
pertaining to the Purchased Assets or the Bank Series 1994-1 Certificate-
holder's ownership interest therein which is relevant to such assessment,
reassessment or audit. The obligations of the Custodian, Seller and

Supplement or any termination of custodial arrangements created under the
Agreement.

that such instruments are the only instrument required and
such offices are the only offices in which registration or

(effective upon receipt) prior to 12:00 Noon (Toronto Time) two Business

Whenever in respect of any Bank Series 1994-2 Certificate, the yield is
calculated on the basis of a 365 day year, the annual equivalent of such
rate is equal to the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificate Rate multiplied by 365
(or 366, in leap years) and divided by the actual number of days in the

inclusive of applicable taxes, including goods and services tax, if any

Successor Servicer which is an Affiliate of CCCL, in arrears, on each

occurring prior to the Termination Date in an amount to be agreed upon by
the Successor Servicer and by the Custodian, as agent for and on behalf of
the Master Custodial Certificateholders; provided, however, that the
Monthly Servicing Fee shall not exceed an amount equal to one-twelfth of
the product of 

(a) 1%, 

(b) the Pool Balance as of the last day of the Collection Period
second preceding such Distribution Date and

(c) the Bank Series 1994-2 Allocation Percentage with respect to the
immediately preceding Collection Period. 

No Monthly Servicing Fee shall be payable while CCCL or any Affiliate of
CCCL is the Servicer. The share of the Monthly Servicing Fee allocable to
the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders with respect to any Distribution
Date (the "Bank Series 1994-2 Monthly Servicing Fee") shall be equal to
one-twelfth of the product of

(a) the Servicing Fee Rate and 

(b) the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount as of the last

Date. 

The remainder of the Monthly Servicing Fee shall be paid by the Seller and
in no event shall the Custodian or the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificate-
holders be liable for the share of the Monthly Servicing Fee to be paid by
the Seller; and the remainder of the Servicing Fee shall be paid by the
Seller and the Investor Master Custodial Certificateholders of other Series
and the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders shall in no event be liable
for the share of the Servicing Fee to be paid by the Seller or the Investor
Master Custodial Certificateholders of other Series. The Bank Series 1994-2
Monthly Servicing Fee shall be payable to the Servicer solely to the
extent amounts are available for distribution in accordance with the terms
of this Bank Series 1994-2 Supplement.

Any Successor Servicer will be permitted, in its sole discretion,
to waive the Monthly Servicing Fee, if any, for any Distribution Date by
notice to the Custodian on or before the related Determination Date;
provided that the Successor Servicer believes that sufficient Collections
of Non-Principal Receivables will be available on any future Distribution
Date to pay the Bank Series 1994-2 Monthly Servicing Fee relating to the
waived Monthly Servicing Fee. If the Successor Servicer so waives the
Monthly Servicing Fee for any Distribution Date, the Monthly Servicing Fee
and the Bank Series 1994-2 Monthly Servicing Fee for such Distribution Date
shall be deemed to be zero for all purposes of this Bank Series 1994-2
Supplement and the Agreement; provided, however, that such Bank Series
1994-2 Monthly Servicing Fee shall be paid on a future Distribution Date
solely to the extent amounts are available therefor pursuant to
Section 5.10(b); provided further that, to the extent any such waived Bank
Series 1994-2 Monthly Servicing Fee is so paid, the related portion of the
Monthly Servicing Fee to be paid by the Seller shall be paid by the Seller
to the Successor Servicer.

IV of the Agreement shall be allocated and distributed as set forth in this
Article.

(b) The Servicer shall instruct the Custodian to withdraw from
the Collection Account and pay to the Seller on the dates set forth below
the following amounts:

(i) on each Deposit Date:

(A) an amount equal to the Excess Seller's Percentage for
the related Collection Period of Allocable Non-
Principal Collections deposited in the Collection
Account on such Deposit Date; and

(B) an amount equal to the Excess Seller's Percentage for
the related Collection Period of Allocable Principal
Collections deposited in the Collection Account on such
Deposit Date, if the Seller's Invested Amount
(determined after giving effect to the transfer of any
Principal Receivables to the Custodian on such Deposit
Date) exceeds the Custodial Available Subordinated
Amount for the immediately preceding Determination Date
(after giving effect to the allocations, distributions,
withdrawals and deposits to be made on the Distribution
Date immediately following such Determination Date and
to any Increase made thereafter that is not reflected
in the Custodial Available Subordinated Amount); and

(ii) on each Deposit Date with respect to the Revolving Period,
an amount equal to the Available Seller's Principal
Collections for such Deposit Date, if the Seller's Invested
Amount (determined after giving effect to any Principal
Receivables transferred to the Custodian on such Deposit
Date) exceeds the Custodial Available Subordinated Amount
for the immediately preceding Determination Date (after
giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals
and deposits to be made on the Distribution Date immediately
following such Determination Date and to any Increase made
thereafter that is not reflected in the Custodial Available
Subordinated Amount); provided, however, that Available
Seller's Principal Collections shall be paid to the Seller
with respect to any Collection Period only after an amount
equal to the sum of 

(A) the Deficiency Amount, if any, relating to the
immediately preceding Collection Period and 

(B) the excess, if any, of the Reserve Fund Required Amount
over the amount in the Reserve Fund on the immediately
preceding Distribution Date (after giving effect to the
allocations of, distributions from, and deposits in,
the Reserve Fund on such Distribution Date), has been
deposited in the Collection Account for the account of
Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders from such
Available Seller's Principal Collections.

The withdrawals to be made from the Collection Account pursuant
to this Section 5.1(b) do not apply to deposits into the Collection Account
that do not represent Collections, including Miscellaneous Payments,
payments of the purchase price for the Master Custodial Certificateholders'
Interest pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Agreement, payments of the
purchase price for the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders' Interest
pursuant to Section 9.1 of this Bank Series 1994-2 Supplement and proceeds
from the sale, disposition or liquidation of Receivables pursuant to
Section 12.02 of the Agreement.

(c) The Servicer shall instruct the Custodian to withdraw from
the Collection Account and deposit into the Reserve Fund on each Deposit
Date during the Revolving Period Available Seller's Principal Collections
for such Deposit Date, up to the amount of the excess, if any, determined
pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ii)(B).

SECTION 5.2. Yield and Yield Options. 

(a) (i) The amount of yield ("Yield") with respect to the Bank
Series 1994-2 Certificates payable on any Distribution Date
shall be an amount equal to the sum of (x) the product of
(A) the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificate Rate for such Yield
Period, (B) the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount
as of the close of business on the preceding Distribution
Date (after giving effect to all repayments of principal
made to Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders on such
preceding Distribution Date, if any) and (C) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the actual number of days elapsed in
such Yield Period and the denominator of which is 365 (or
366, in leap years) and (y) the product of (A) the Bank
Series 1994-2 Certificate Rate for such Yield Period, (B)
the amount of any Increase made after such preceding
Distribution Date and prior to the first day of the calendar
month following such preceding Distribution Date, and (C) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the actual number of
days elapsed from and including the Increase Date related to
such Increase to but excluding the next succeeding
Distribution Date and the denominator of which is 365 (or
366, in leap years) and (z) the amount equal to any Pre-
Yield Period Deposit made during the Yield Period preceding
such Yield Period.

(ii) In the event the Wholesale Prime Rate changes during the
period between any Determination Date and the following
Distribution Date and a portion of the Aggregate Bank Series
1994-2 Invested Amount has not been allocated to the BA
Tranche, the Servicer and the Agent shall cooperate on the
date of such change in modifying the Distribution Date
Statement to reflect the adjustment in the Yield for the
then current Yield Period caused by such change and any
consequent adjustments, including adjustment to the
Deficiency Amount, if any. Any such modification, including
any adjustment to the Deficiency Amount shall be completed
by 10:00 a.m. on such Distribution Date.

(b) On the Determination Date preceding each Distribution Date, the
Servicer shall determine the excess, if any (the "Yield Shortfall"), of
(x) the aggregate Yield for the Yield Period applicable to such
Distribution Date over (y) the amount which will be available to be
distributed to Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders on such Distribution
Date in respect thereof pursuant to this Bank Series 1994-2 Supplement. If
the Yield Shortfall with respect to any Distribution Date is greater than
zero, an additional amount ("Additional Yield") equal to the product of
(i) the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificate Rate for the Yield Period commencing
on the related Distribution Date (or, for subsequent Yield Periods, the
Bank Series 1994-2 Certificate Rate for such subsequent Yield Periods),
(ii) such Yield Shortfall (or the portion thereof which has not been paid)
and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual number of days
elapsed in such Yield Period (or in a subsequent Yield Period) and the
denominator of which is 365 (or 366, in leap years) shall be payable as
provided herein with respect to the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificates on each
Distribution Date following such Distribution Date to and including the
Distribution Date on which such Yield Shortfall is paid. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Additional Yield shall be payable or
distributed to Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders only to the extent
permitted by applicable law.

(c) (i) At least three Business Days prior to each Distribution
Date, the Seller may elect to have the yield due to the Bank
Series 1994-2 Certificateholders hereunder on all or any
portion of the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount
(determined in each case on such Distribution Date and after
giving effect to any distributions and Increases proposed on
such Date) based on the Wholesale Prime Rate or on one or
more Wholesale Bankers' Acceptance Rates for Canadian dollar
discount bankers' acceptances issued on the Distribution
Date maturing in a minimum of 28 days and a maximum of 180
days on a Distribution Date. The rate selection shall apply
for the period from and including the Distribution Date in
respect of which the election is being made to but not
including the immediately following Distribution Date;
provided, however, that if the Seller selects a Wholesale
Bankers' Acceptance Rate for discount bankers' acceptances
maturing after such immediately following Distribution Date,
then the Seller shall be deemed to have selected such rate
in respect of the applicable portion or portions of the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount for the period
to the maturity date for such discount bankers' acceptances.

(ii) The Seller shall give written or telephonic notice (promptly
confirmed in writing) to the Agent of such election and
shall specify in such notice the portion or portions of the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount to which each
such rate shall apply. If the Seller fails to give notice
of its yield option election in a timely manner as required,
the yield on the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested
Amount (other than the portion or portions for which the
Seller shall have been deemed to have selected a rate as
aforesaid) shall be based on the Wholesale Prime Rate.

(iii) Promptly after receiving the Seller's yield option election
as aforesaid, the Agent shall notify each Bank Series 1994-2
Certificateholder thereof.

(iv) On each Distribution Date on which a Wholesale Bankers'
Acceptance Rate is to be calculated, each Bank Series 1994-2
Certificateholder will notify the Agent and the Seller of
its applicable Certificateholder's Bankers' Acceptance Rate.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection
5.2(c),

(A) the portion of the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2
Invested Amount to which a particular Wholesale
Bankers' Acceptance Rate shall apply shall be a minimum
of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof, and

(B) in the event that the Agent shall have determined
(which determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Seller) that (I) quotation of annual rates for
the relevant discount bankers' acceptances referred to
above are not being provided in the relevant amount or
for the relevant maturities for the purposes of
determining the yield when based on the Wholesale
Bankers' Acceptance Rate, or (II) the Wholesale
Bankers' Acceptance Rate does not accurately reflect
the cost to the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders
of adding to or maintaining their respective
investments in their respective portions of the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount, the Agent
shall forthwith give written notice of such
determination to the Seller at least one day prior to
the Distribution Date on which such rate is to be
applied hereunder and if such notice is given then,
until such notice has been withdrawn by the Agent, the
Seller shall not have the option to elect the
calculation of the annual rate of return based upon the
Wholesale Bankers' Acceptance Rate.

(d) Anything contained in this Section 5.2 to the contrary
notwithstanding, after the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Bank Series 1994-2 Early Amortization Event, the Seller may not elect to
allocate all or any part of the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested
Amount to the BA Tranche.

SECTION 5.3. Determination of Monthly Principal. The amount of
monthly principal ("Monthly Principal") distributable with respect to the
Bank Series 1994-2 Certificates on each Distribution Date with respect to
any Bank Series 1994-2 Early Amortization Period shall be equal to the
Available Bank Principal Collections with respect to such Distribution
Date; provided, however, that Monthly Principal shall not exceed the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount.

SECTION 5.4. Establishment of Reserve Fund.

(a) (i) The Custodian, as agent for and on behalf of the Bank Series
1994-2 Certificateholders, shall cause to be established and
maintained at the Custodian an Eligible Deposit Account (the
"Reserve Fund") which shall be identified as the "Reserve
Fund for the Master Custodial and Servicing Agreement, Bank
Series 1994-2" and shall bear a designation clearly
indicating that the funds deposited therein belong to the
Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders and to the Seller as
their interests appear herein.

(ii) At the direction of the Servicer, funds on deposit in the
Reserve Fund shall be invested by the Custodian in Eligible
Investments selected by the Servicer that will mature so
that such funds will be available at the close of business
on or before the Business Day next preceding the following
Distribution Date. All Eligible Investments shall be held by
the Custodian as agent for and on behalf of the Bank Series
1994-2 Certificateholders and the Seller as their interests
appear herein. On each Distribution Date, all interest and
other investment earnings (net of losses and investment
expenses) on funds on deposit in the Reserve Fund received
prior to such Distribution Date shall be applied as set
forth in Section 5.6(a) of this Bank Series 1994-2
Supplement. Funds deposited in the Reserve Fund on a
Business Day (which immediately precedes a Distribution
Date) upon the maturity of any Eligible Investments are not
required to be invested overnight.

(b) (i) The Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders shall possess all
right, title and interest in and to all funds on deposit
from time to time in, and all Eligible Investments credited
to, the Reserve Fund and in all proceeds thereof, except to
the extent of the interest of the Seller therein to the
extent expressly set forth in this Bank Series 1994-2
Supplement. The Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders
agree, by acceptance of their Bank Series 1994-2
Certificates and without further action, that all such funds
and Eligible Investments shall be maintained, invested and
disbursed in accordance with this Bank Series 1994-2
Supplement and the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders
hereby authorize and empower the Custodian and the Servicer
to maintain, invest and disburse such funds and Eligible
Investments in accordance with this Bank Series 1994-2
Supplement. If, at any time, the Reserve Fund ceases to be
an Eligible Deposit Account, the Custodian (or the Servicer
on its behalf) shall within 10 Business Days (or such longer
period, not to exceed 30 calendar days, as to which the
Agent may consent) establish a new Reserve Fund meeting the
conditions specified in paragraph 5.4(a)(i) above, as
applicable, as an Eligible Deposit Account and shall
transfer any cash and/or any investments to such new Reserve
Fund. None of the Seller, the Servicer, the Custodian nor
any person or entity claiming by, through or under the
Seller, the Servicer, the Custodian or any such person or
entity shall have any right, title or interest in, or any
right to withdraw any amount from, the Reserve Fund, except
as expressly provided herein. Schedule 1, which is hereby
incorporated into and made part of this Bank Series 1994-2
Supplement, identifies the Reserve Fund by setting forth the
account number of such account, the account designation of
such account and the name of the institution with which such
account has been established. If a substitute Reserve Fund
is established pursuant to this Section, the Servicer, prior
to making any deposits therein, shall provide to the
Custodian an amended Schedule 1, setting forth the relevant
information for such substitute Reserve Fund.

(ii) Pursuant to the authority granted to the Servicer in
Section 4.01(a) of the Agreement, the Servicer shall have
the power, revocable by the Custodian, to make withdrawals
and payments or to instruct the Custodian to make
withdrawals and payments from the Reserve Fund for the
purposes of carrying out the Servicer's or Custodian's
duties hereunder.

(iii) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Agent, at no time may
Eligible Investments in a principal amount equal to more
than 10% of the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount
be invested in Eligible Investments (other than obligations
of the Government of Canada) of any single entity or its
Affiliates.

SECTION 5.5. Deficiency Amount. With respect to each
Distribution Date, on the related Determination Date, the Servicer shall
determine the amount (the "Deficiency Amount"), if any, by which 

(a) the sum of 

(i) Yield for such Distribution Date, 

(ii) any Yield previously due but not distributed to the Bank
Series 1994-2 Certificateholders on a prior Distribution Date, 

(iii) Additional Yield, if any, for such Distribution Date and any
Additional Yield previously due but not distributed to the
Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders on a prior
Distribution Date,

(iv) the Bank Series 1994-2 Monthly Servicing Fee, if any, for
such Distribution Date, and 

(v) the Bank Defaulted Amount, if any, for such Distribution
Date, and 

(vi) the Bank Series 1994-2 Allocation Percentage of the amount
of any Adjustment Payment required to be deposited in the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.09(a) of the
Agreement with respect to the related Collection Period that
has not been so deposited as of such Determination Date, 

exceeds

(b) the sum of 

(i) Bank Non-Principal Collections for such Distribution Date,
Available Seller's Non-Principal Collections for such
Distribution Date, any Investment Proceeds with respect to
such Distribution Date, and 

(ii) the amount of funds in the Reserve Fund which are available
pursuant to Section 5.8(a) to cover any portion of the
Deficiency Amount. 

The lesser of the Deficiency Amount and the Available Subordinated Amount
shall be the "Required Subordination Draw Amount".

SECTION 5.6. Application of Bank Non-Principal Collections,
Available Seller's Non-Principal Collections, Investment Proceeds and
Available Bank Principal Collections. The Servicer shall cause the
Custodian to apply, on each Distribution Date, Bank Non-Principal
Collections, Available Seller's Non-Principal Collections, Investment
Proceeds and Available Bank Principal Collections to make the following
distributions:

(a) On each Distribution Date, an amount equal to the sum of Bank
Non-Principal Collections, Available Seller's Non-Principal
Collections and any Investment Proceeds with respect to the
preceding Collection Period will be distributed in the following
priority:

(i) first, an amount equal to Yield for such Distribution Date,
plus the amount of any Yield previously due but not
distributed to the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders on
a prior Distribution Date, plus the amount of any Additional
Yield for such Distribution Date and any Additional Yield
previously due but not distributed to the Bank Series 1994-2
Certificateholders on a prior Distribution Date, shall be
distributed to the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders;

(ii) second, an amount equal to the Bank Series 1994-2 Monthly
Servicing Fee, if any, for such Distribution Date shall be
distributed to the Successor Servicer (unless such amount
has been netted against deposits to the Collection Account
or waived);

(iii) third, an amount equal to the Bank Defaulted Amount for such
Distribution Date shall be distributed and treated as a
portion of Bank Principal Collections for such Distribution
Date;

(iv) fourth, an amount equal to the Reserve Fund Deposit Amount,
if any, for such Distribution Date shall be deposited in the
Reserve Fund; and

(v) fifth, the balance, if any, shall constitute Excess Income
and shall be allocated and distributed as set forth in
Section 5.10.

(b) (i) On each Distribution Date with respect to the Revolving
Period with respect to which the Seller has notified the
Agent a Decrease will occur, an amount of Available Bank
Principal Collections deposited in the Collection Account
for the related Collection Period equal to such Decrease
will be distributed to the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificate-
holders. The Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount
shall be reduced by the amount of Available Bank Principal
Collections so distributed. Any such remaining Available
Bank Principal Collections shall be treated as Excess
Principal Collections and applied in accordance with Section
4.04 of the Agreement.

(ii) On each Distribution Date with respect to the Revolving
Period with respect to which the Seller has not notified the
Agent it will be making a Decrease, an amount equal to
Available Bank Principal Collections deposited in the
Collection Account for the related Collection Period shall
be treated as Excess Principal Collections and applied in
accordance with Section 4.04 of the Agreement.

(c) On each Distribution Date with respect to a Bank Series 1994-2
Early Amortization Period, an amount equal to Available Bank
Principal Collections will be distributed in the following
priority:

(i) first, an amount equal to Monthly Principal for such
Distribution Date shall be paid to the Bank Series 1994-2
Certificateholders; and

(ii) second, after giving effect to the payment referred to in
clause (i) above, an amount equal to the balance, if any, of
such Available Bank Principal Collections shall be treated
as Excess Principal Collections and applied in accordance
with Section 4.04 of the Agreement and Section 5.11 hereof.

SECTION 5.7. Distributions to Bank Series 1994-2 Certificate-
holders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Bank Series
1994-2 Supplement or the Agreement, to the extent there are any amounts
owing to the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders hereunder on the
Termination Date, such amounts shall be distributed to the Bank Series
1994-2 Certificateholders from Available Seller's Collections on such
Termination Date.

SECTION 5.8. Application of Reserve Fund and Available
Subordinated Amount. 

(a) If the portion of Bank Non-Principal Collections, Available
Seller's Non-Principal Collections and Investment Proceeds allocated to
Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders on any Distribution Date pursuant to
Section 5.6(a) is not sufficient to make the entire distributions required
on such Distribution Date by Sections 5.6(a)(i), 5.6(a)(ii) and
5.6(a)(iii), the Servicer shall cause the Custodian to withdraw funds from
the Reserve Fund, to the extent available therein, and apply such funds to
complete the distributions pursuant to Sections 5.6(a)(i), 5.6(a)(ii) and
5.6(a)(iii).

(b) If there is a Required Subordination Draw Amount for such
Distribution Date, the Servicer shall apply or cause the Custodian to apply
the Available Seller's Principal Collections on deposit in the Collection
Account on such Distribution Date, but only up to the amount of the
Required Subordination Draw Amount, to make the distributions required by
Sections 5.6(a)(i), 5.6(a)(ii) and 5.6(a)(iii) that have not been made
through the application of funds from the Reserve Fund in accordance with
the preceding paragraph. Any such Available Seller's Principal Collections
remaining after the application thereof pursuant to the preceding sentence
and any Available Seller's Non-Principal Collections remaining after the
application thereof pursuant to Section 5.6(a) shall be treated as a
portion of Bank Principal Collections for such Distribution Date, but only
up to the amount of unpaid Adjustment Payments allocated to the Bank Series
1994-2 as described in Section 5.5(a)(vi). The amount of the Available
Seller's Principal Collections applied in accordance with the two preceding
sentences shall reduce the Available Subordinated Amount as described in
clause (c) of the definition thereof. If the Required Subordination Draw
Amount exceeds Available Seller's Collections for such Distribution Date,
the Available Subordinated Amount shall be further reduced by the amount of
such excess, but not by more than the sum of (x) the Bank Defaulted Amount
and (y) an amount of unpaid Adjustment Payments allocated to the Bank
Series 1994-2 as described in Section 5.5(a)(vi).

(c) If, after giving effect to the allocations of, distributions
from, and deposits in, the Reserve Fund made pursuant to Sections 5.1(c),
5.4, 5.6(a) and 5.8(a), the amount in the Reserve Fund is greater than the
Reserve Fund Required Amount for such Distribution Date, the Servicer shall
cause the Custodian to distribute such excess amount to the Seller,
provided that the Custodial Available Subordinated Amount for the
immediately preceding Determination Date exceeds the Seller's Invested
Amount on such date (determined after giving effect to any Principal
Receivables Transferred to the Custodian on such Distribution Date). On
the Termination Date, any funds in the Reserve Fund will be treated as
Available Bank Principal Collections. Upon the earlier of the Termination
Date and the payment in full of the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested
Amount any funds remaining on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall be paid to
the Seller.

(d) If, for any Distribution Date with respect to a Bank Series 1994-2
Early Amortization Event, after giving effect to the allocations of,
distributions from, and deposits in, the Reserve Fund made pursuant to
Sections 5.1(c), 5.4, 5.6(a) and 5.8, the amount in the Reserve Fund is
less than the Reserve Fund Required Amount for such Distribution Date, the
Custodian shall deposit any remaining Available Seller's Principal
Collections on deposit in the Collection Account for such Distribution Date
into the Reserve Fund until the amount in the Reserve Fund is equal to such
Reserve Fund Required Amount.

(e) The balance of Available Seller's Principal Collections on any
Distribution Date, after giving effect to any distributions thereof
pursuant to Section 5.6 and this Section 5.8(b) and 5.8(d) shall be
distributed to the Seller on such Distribution Date, provided that, the
Custodial Available Subordinated Amount for the immediately preceding
Determination Date exceeds the Seller's Invested Amount on such date
(determined after giving effect to any Principal Receivables Transferred to
the Custodian on such Distribution Date).

SECTION 5.9. Bank Charge-Offs. If, on any Distribution Date on
which the Available Subordinated Amount on the preceding Determination Date
(after giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and
deposits to be made on such Distribution Date) is zero and the Deficiency
Amount for such Distribution Date is greater than zero, the Aggregate Bank
Series 1994-2 Invested Amount shall be reduced by the amount (a "Bank
Charge-Off") of the excess of such Deficiency Amount over any remaining
Available Subordinated Amount on such Determination Date, but not by more
than the Bank Defaulted Amount. The Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders
shall thereafter be reimbursed in respect of the Bank Charge-Offs and the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount increased (but not by an
amount in excess of the aggregate unreimbursed Bank Charge-Offs on any
Distribution Date) by the sum of 

(a) Allocable Miscellaneous Payments with respect to such
Distribution Date and 

(b) the amount of Excess Income allocated and available for that
purpose pursuant to Section 5.10(a).

SECTION 5.10. Excess Income. The Servicer shall cause the
Custodian to apply, on each Distribution Date, Excess Income with respect
to the Collection Period immediately preceding such Distribution Date, to
make the following distributions in the following priority:

(a) an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Bank Charge-Offs in
respect of which the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders have
not been previously reimbursed as provided in Section 5.9 (after
giving effect to the allocation on such Distribution Date of any
amount for that purpose pursuant to Section 5.9) shall be treated
as a portion of Bank Principal Collections with respect to such
Distribution Date;

(b) an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding amounts of the Bank
Series 1994-2 Monthly Servicing Fee, if any, which have been
previously waived pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be distributed to
the Servicer; and

(c) the balance, if any, shall be distributed to the Seller.

SECTION 5.11. Excess Principal Collections. 

(a) On each Distribution Date, the Servicer shall allocate a portion
of Excess Principal Collections to the Bank Series 1994-2 as set forth in
this Bank Series 1994-2 Supplement. That portion of Excess Principal
Collections for any Distribution Date allocated to the Bank Series 1994-2
for any Distribution Date (the "Bank Series 1994-2 Excess Principal
Collections") shall be the amount specified under Section 5.11(b) and shall
be distributed as set forth in this Bank Series 1994-2 Supplement.

(b) Bank Series 1994-2 Excess Principal Collections, with respect to
any Distribution Date, shall be an amount equal to the Bank Series 1994-2
Principal Shortfall for such Distribution Date; provided, however, that, if
the aggregate amount of Excess Principal Collections for all Series for
such Distribution Date is less than the aggregate amount of Principal
Shortfalls for all Series for such Distribution Date, then Bank Series
1994-2 Excess Principal Collections for such Distribution Date shall be an
amount equal the product of (x) Excess Principal Collections for all Series
for such Distribution Date and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the Bank Series 1994-2 Principal Shortfall for such Distribution Date and
the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Principal Shortfalls
for all Series for such Distribution Date. The "Bank Series 1994-2
Principal Shortfall", with respect to any Distribution Date, means an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) (x) for any Distribution Date
with respect to the Revolving Period, the amount of the Decrease, if any,
with respect to such Distribution Date or (y) for any Distribution Date
with respect to a Bank Series 1994-2 Early Amortization Period, the
Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount, over (ii) Available Bank
Principal Collections for such Distribution Date (excluding any portion
thereof attributable to Excess Principal Collections).

SECTION 5.12. Allocations and Applications of Collections and
Other Funds. For purposes of Section 4.03(e)(i) of the Agreement as it
relates to the Bank Series 1994-2 and the definition of Series Adjusted
Invested Amount as it relates to the Bank Series 1994-2, each Increase
pursuant to Section 3.2 of this Bank Series 1994-2 Supplement and each
Decrease pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Bank Series 1994-2 Supplement (and
any related increase or decrease in the Available Subordinated Amount)
shall be deemed to have occurred as of the last day of the Collection
Period immediately preceding the Collection Period in which such Increase
or Decrease occurs. 

ARTICLE VI

Distributions and Reports
to Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders

SECTION 6.1. Distributions. 

(a) On each Distribution Date with respect to a Collection Period
during which the Aggregate Bank Series 1994-2 Invested Amount was greater
than zero at any time, the Servicer shall cause the Custodian to distribute
to the Agent on behalf of each Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholder of
record on the preceding Record Date (other than as provided in
Section 12.02 of the Agreement respecting a final distribution) all amounts
required to be distributed to the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders in
Article V and promptly thereafter the Agent shall make available to each
Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholder pursuant to subsection 2.8(c) of the
Short-Term RPA an amount equal to the product of (i) the amounts to be
distributed to the Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholders pursuant to
Article V and (ii) such Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholder's Purchase
Percentage. Each Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholder's Purchase
Percentage of Yield or Additional Yield will be calculated by the Agent as
if references to "Wholesale Bankers' Acceptance Rate" in the definition of
"Blended Wholesale Rate" were references to the applicable "Certificate-
holder's Bankers' Acceptance Rate".

(b) Except as provided in Section 12.02 of the Agreement with respect
to a final distribution, distributions to Bank Series 1994-2 Certificate-
holders hereunder shall be made by wire transfer to the Agent on behalf of
each Bank Series 1994-2 Certificateholder without presentation or surrender
of any Bank Series 1994-2 Certificate or the making of any notation
thereon; provided, however, that, subject to the receipt of the
Distribution Date Statement pursuant to Section 6.3(a) hereof, the
Custodian shall give wire transfer instructions with respect to such
distributions by 10:00 a.m., Toronto time, for wire transfer of such
distributions to the Agent to the account specified by the Agent at the
Royal Bank of Canada, Main Branch, Royal Bank Plaza, Toronto, Ontario, or
such other account in Canada as the Agent shall specify to the Servicer and
Custodian in writing from time to time in immediately available funds.

(c) All allocations and distributions hereunder shall be in
accordance with the Distribution Date Statement delivered by the Servicer
to the Custodian pursuant to subsection 6.3(a) and shall be made in lawful
currency of Canada and in immediately available funds.
