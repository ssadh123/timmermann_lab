Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On July 29, 1994 Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (the "Registrant") purchased
from CRSS Inc. the engineering and construction management service businesses of
CRSS Inc. for a purchase price equal to $14 million plus the net book value on
the closing date of the businesses acquired. On the closing date the Registrant
paid CRSS Inc. $33.5 million, which was an amount equal to $14 million plus the
estimated net book value on that date of the businesses acquired. The net book
value of the businesses acquired is subject to an audit to be completed in the
Registrant's fourth fiscal quarter. The exact purchase price will be determined
when the audit is complete, and any difference between that amount and the
amount paid on the closing date will be settled between the parties.

In the transaction the Registrant purchased substantially all of the assets
of CRS Sirinne Engineers, Inc., subject to certain liabilities, all of the stock
of CRSS Constructors, Inc. and CRSS International, Inc. and the assets, subject
to certain liabilities, or all of the stock, of certain insignificant
subsidiaries of CRSS Inc. The purchase was made under the terms of a Purchase
Agreement dated July 29,1994 between the Registrant and CRSS Inc., which was
executed concurrently with the close of purchase. For a more complete
understanding of the structure of the transaction, reference should be made to
the Purchase Agreement, which is attached to this Report as Exhibit 1.

The businesses acquired by the Registrant provide engineering and design
services to the pulp and paper, micro-electronics, process and pharmaceutical
industries, among others, as well as construction and construction management
services to the public and institutional markets, including criminal justice,
health care, education and transportation infrastructure. Jacobs did not
purchase, and CRSS Inc. retained, certain assets and liabilities, including
those relating to certain engineering, procurement and construction contracts
for independent electric power projects that are essentially complete or in the
later stages of completion.

The purchase was made at arm's-length and will be accounted for as a
purchase of assets. The Registrant financed the acquisition from working capital
and from funds borrowed from Bank of America National Trust and Savings
Association.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(a) and (b) The Registrant will file the financial statements required by
Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and the pro

K/A no later than September 27, 1994.

Engineering Group Inc. and CRSS Inc. including a schedule of
annexes and exhibits; the Registrant will furnish copies of
such annexes and exhibits to the Commission upon its
request.

ARTICLE TWO: CONVEYANCE, CONSIDERATION AND RELATED
MATTERS

2.1 Agreement of Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, CRSS agrees to sell to Jacobs, and Jacobs agrees to
purchase from CRSS, the Business to be Acquired for a purchase price (the
"Purchase Price") equal to the Closing Date Net Asset Value of the Business to
be Acquired plus $14,000,000.00, payable in cash.

2.2 Determination of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be
determined in accordance with this Section 2.2.

(i) Not later than two business days prior to the Closing Date,
Jacobs and CRSS shall agree on a preliminary Net Asset Value of the Business
to be Acquired. This value (the "Preliminary Net Asset Value") shall reflect
the consolidated net assets of the Business to be Acquired as of a recent
date, and shall be based on the Business to be Acquired as reflected in the
Interim Date Pro Forma Consolidating Balance Sheet, but shall be adjusted as
reasonably agreed between the parties to take account of differences between
the Business to be Acquired and the businesses reflected in the Interim Date
Pro Forma Consolidating Balance Sheet.

(ii) (a) Following the Closing Date CRSS shall cause to be
delivered to Jacobs an audited consolidating balance sheet of the
Business to be Acquired as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet"), together with the unqualified report
thereon issued by Ernst & Young certifying the Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with the
presentation of Services' consolidated balance sheets as of June 30,
1993. Jacobs and CRSS shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the preparation of the Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet.

(b) Not later than 25 days after the Closing Date, CRSS
shall deliver to Jacobs a draft of the Closing Date Consolidating
Balance Sheet (the "Draft Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet").
Thereupon, Jacobs shall have the right during the succeeding 20 days
(the "examination period") to examine (at Jacobs' sole cost and
expense) said Draft Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet. Jacobs
shall notify CRSS and Ernst & Young in writing, on or before the last
day of the examination period, of any good faith objections to the
Draft Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet,

8
<PAGE>

setting forth a reasonably specific description of such objections
and, if practicable, the dollar amount of each objection (such
objections are hereinafter referred to as "Disputed Matters"). If
Jacobs does not deliver such notice within the examination period, the
Draft Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet shall be deemed to have
been accepted by Jacobs, and Ernst & Young shall thereafter promptly
deliver to Jacobs the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet,
together with its unqualified report thereon. During the examination
period, CRSS shall notify Jacobs immediately of any change to the
Draft Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet. If CRSS presents any
change, additions or deletions to the Draft Closing Date Consolidating
Balance Sheet, then the Examination Period shall end 20 days from the
date of such later presentation. During the examination period, CRSS
shall cooperate in assisting Jacobs with its examination of the Draft
Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet including, without
limitation, providing Jacobs with full and complete access to all
relevant books and records during regular business hours, as well as
access to CRSS' independent auditors and, to the extent permitted by
such auditors, its working papers, as Jacobs may reasonably require to
complete its examination of the Draft Closing Date Consolidating
Balance Sheet.

(c) If Jacobs in good faith objects to the Draft Closing
Date Consolidating Balance Sheet in accordance with Section 2.2(ii)(b)
above, then CRSS, Jacobs and Ernst & Young shall attempt to resolve
the Disputed Matters within 20 days of the receipt of notice of such
matters by CRSS. If the parties are unable to resolve the Disputed
Matters within such 20 day period, Ernst & Young shall, after
considering the objections raised by Jacobs and the responses of CRSS,
promptly request CRSS to make changes, if any, to the Draft Closing
Date Consolidating Balance Sheet that Ernst & Young deems necessary in
order the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet to present fairly
the financial condition of the Business to be Acquired in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
and CRSS shall complete the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet
in accordance with such requests and deliver it to Jacobs together
with the unqualified report issued thereon by Ernst & Young. Such
balance sheet shall be the "Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet"
as such term is used in this Agreement.

(iii) "Net Asset Value of the Business to be Acquired" as of any
particular date means the excess, if a positive number, or the deficit, if a
negative number, of total assets minus total liabilities of the Business to
be Acquired as of such date.

(iv) Neither the Preliminary Net Asset Value nor the Closing Date
Net Asset Value of the Business to be Acquired shall reflect any tax-related
asset or liability for federal income taxes, or state or local income taxes
reported on a consolidated basis for CRSS and its Affiliates.

(v) "Change in Net Asset Value," which may be a positive or
negative number, means the Closing Date Net Asset Value of the Business to
be Acquired as determined from the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet
minus the Preliminary Net Asset Value of the Business to be Acquired.

(vi) Within two days following the agreement of CRSS and Jacobs
as to the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet, or the final
determination with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.2(ii)(c), Jacobs
and CRSS shall determine the Change in Net Asset Value in accordance with
Section 2.2(v). If the Change in Net Asset Value is positive, then Jacobs
shall pay CRSS such amount within five days of its determination; if the
Change in Net Asset Value is negative, then CRSS shall pay Jacobs such
amount within five days of its determination.

(vii) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, including
without limitation Article Twelve and any representations and warranties
herein, this Section 2.2 constitutes the sole and exclusive remedy of Jacobs
with respect to the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet, the Interim
Date Pro Forma Consolidating Balance Sheet and the Audited Financial
Statements (as defined in Section 3.4), and any other financial or
accounting records or statements relating to the foregoing financial
statements, except as to matters knowingly misrepresented or willfully not

2.3 Closing. The Closing of the exchange contemplated hereby shall
take place on July 29, 1994 at 10:00 a.m., P.D.S.T. at the offices of Jacobs in
Pasadena, California or at such other time, date and place as shall be mutually
agreed upon by CRSS and Jacobs. For the purposes of accounting for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such transactions shall be deemed
to have closed at 11:59 p.m. on July 31, 1994 (the "Closing Date"). If the
Closing shall not have occurred by July 31, 1994, then either CRSS or Jacobs
shall have the right, pursuant to

2.4 Sales, Transfer and Documentary Taxes, etc. CRSS shall pay all
federal, state and local sales, documentary and other transfer taxes, if any,
due as a result of the transfer of the assets to be conveyed to Jacobs in

respect of the liability for payment of or failure to pay any such taxes or the
filing of or failure to file any reports required in connection therewith.

the Interim Date Pro Forma Consolidating Balance Sheet reflects, and the

regulations affecting its financial condition, business, properties or
operation of its business ("Regulations") except for violations and failures
to comply that do not and will not have a material and adverse effect on the
financial condition, business, properties or operations of the Business to
be Acquired. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as
otherwise disclosed herein, each of the Corporations owns, holds, possesses
or lawfully uses in the operation of its business all franchises, licenses,
permits, rights, applications, filings, registrations and other
authorizations ("Authorizations") that are in any manner necessary for it to
conduct the Business to be Acquired, free and clear of all liens, charges,
restrictions and encumbrances and in compliance with all Regulations, except

business. None of the Corporations is in default or has received any notice
of any claim of default, with respect to any such Authorization, except
where the default or claimed default would not have a material and adverse
effect on its financial condition, business, properties or the operation of
its business. All such Authorizations are renewable by their terms or in the

notice of any asserted failure to comply with, or violation of, any
Regulation that would have a material and adverse effect on the Business to
be Acquired. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither any
of the Corporations nor any employee or agent of any of them nor anyone on
their behalf has made any payments to any person, firm, corporation or
governmental or other entity that would have been required to be disclosed
by CRSS under applicable disclosure policies of the Securities and Exchange
Commission under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

15 U.S.C. Section 78dd, United States laws pertaining to the export of
technical data, United States laws pertaining to restrictive trade practices
or boycotts or the regulations under any of such statutes or laws and, since
December 31, 1986, none of the Corporations nor any employee or agent acting

authorization of the payment of money or anything of value that would be in
violation of said Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

(i) Jacobs has designated certain contracts to which the
Corporations are party as "At Risk Contracts". The At Risk Contracts are
listed on Annex VI, which is attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Section
11.1 shall provide the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties for any
matter that affects Margin Improvement or Margin Deterioration; to the
extent that a claim of a third party results in Liabilities that do not
affect Margin Improvement or Margin Deterioration, such Liabilities shall be
subject to indemnification under Article Twelve to the extent provided
therein.

(ii) Jacobs and CRSS shall share the risk of any "Margin
Improvement" or "Margin Deterioration" in the At Risk Contracts as
hereinafter set forth.

(iii) For the purpose of this Section 11.1:

(a) "Margin Improvement" shall mean any increase in the
gross margin of a project at final completion over the sum of the
gross margin recognized for such project in the Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet plus the Closing Date Future Gross Margin
for such project; and

99
<PAGE>

(b) "Margin Deterioration" shall mean any reduction in the
gross margin (including negative gross margin) of a project at final
completion over the sum of the gross margin recognized for such
project in the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet plus the
Closing Date Future Gross Margin for such project.

(c) For purposes of this Section, gross margin shall be
determined in a manner consistent with CRSS' past practice.

(iv) The Margin Improvement and Margin Deterioration on each At
Risk Contract shall be added, or subtracted, as appropriate, to obtain the
Aggregate Margin Improvement or Deterioration, as the case may be.

(v) (a) Jacobs shall bear the risk of the first $1,000,000 of
Aggregate Margin Deterioration; Jacobs and CRSS shall each bear 50% of the
Aggregate Margin Deterioration in excess of $1,000,000 up to $4,000,000, and
CRSS shall bear all of the risk of any Aggregate Margin Deterioration in
excess of $4,000,000.

(b) Jacobs shall receive the full benefit of the first
$1,000,000 of Aggregate Margin Improvement; Jacobs and CRSS shall each
receive 50% of the benefit of the Aggregate Margin Improvement in
excess of $1,000,000 up to $4,000,000, and CRSS shall receive all of
the benefit of Aggregate Margin Improvement in excess of $4,000,000.

(vi) Jacobs and CRSS shall account to each other on each

shall manage the At Risk Contracts in a good, workmanlike and timely manner
in accordance with the terms and conditions of such At Risk Contracts, and
in accordance with prudent practice and industry standards. After the
Closing, Jacobs shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the
project management and completion bonuses on each At Risk Contract in place
until completion, but Jacobs may, in its reasonable discretion, change or
alter any or all of such project management if such changes or alterations
are made in good faith and would not reasonably be expected to materially
and adversely affect the gross margin on the At Risk Contract.

100

<PAGE>

(viii) Annex VI, which is attached hereto and hereby made a part
hereof, contains a schedule of the forecasts of future gross margins on each
of the At Risk Contracts as reflected on the Profit Plan per the Project
Planning System or the Project Briefing Cost Summary Report (such report or
plan being referred to as a "Profit Plan") for each At Risk Contract as of
June 30, 1994. Contemporaneous with the delivery to Jacobs of the Closing
Date Consolidating Balance Sheet, CRSS shall deliver to Jacobs a schedule of
the forecast of future gross margin on each of the At Risk Contracts as of
the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Future Gross Margin"), which Closing
Date Future Gross Margins shall be prepared consistent with the Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet.

(ix) Jacobs will provide CRSS on a quarterly basis a report on
the status of each At Risk Contract indicating the Margin Improvement and

pursuant to Section 11.7 and may confer with the Project Manager assigned to
such project at any time, including without limitation if CRSS disputes
Jacobs' accounting for any At Risk Contract.

V is ultimately determined not to be guaranteed maximum price contract as of

of any other Person or Persons, or misuse in any way, any confidential
information or trade secrets of any of the Corporations including personnel
information, secret processes, know-how, customer lists, receipts, formulas
or other Intellectual Property.

(ii) Jacobs shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,

relating to the Business to be Acquired that it shall have learned in the
course of its investigation of the Business to be Acquired, including
personnel information, secret processes, know-how, customer lists, receipts,
formulas or other Intellectual Property.

11.4 Performance of Certain Contracts After Closing.

assigned or for which consent to assignment has not been obtained or the

will not be obtained for some time after the Closing, Jacobs and the CRSS
Companies agree that until such consents or licenses are obtained or such

facilities as may be required to complete such Contracts and shall

with respect thereto in the manner and to the extent provided in
Section 12.2.

(d) Each party shall account to the other party with
respect to such contracts promptly on an ongoing basis during the
performance of the contract.

(e) This Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
assign any such Contracts, and such Contracts shall not be assigned to
Jacobs until all such consents and/or licenses are obtained.

(f) Amendments of, or expansion of services relating to,
any of such Contracts on or after the date hereof will be entered into
by, and be the total responsibility of, Jacobs.

(g) CRSS and Jacobs shall execute any and all additional
documents and take additional measures reasonably required by each
other further to effectuate the foregoing.

(ii) For any work that needs to be performed on any Completed

Subsidiaries. Effective immediately after Closing all persons who are
employed by an Asset Corporation (other than Steve Williams) shall be hired
by Jacobs or a subsidiary of Jacobs, and Jacobs shall be deemed to have
hired the employees of the Stock Corporations. To the extent permitted under
all benefit plans and policies of Jacobs, any eligibility waiting periods
imposed by such plans and policies shall be deemed to have been waived, and
such employees shall receive credit for their service with CRSS and the CRSS
Subsidiaries by which they were employed for the purpose of determining any
participation and/or vesting rights under such plans and policies including
any severance and vacation plans.

103
<PAGE>

(ii) For a period of two years following Closing neither CRSS nor

equity of the Business to be Acquired for each of the two fiscal years then
ended, together with the related notes thereto, certified without qualification
by Ernst & Young, independent public accountants.

11.7 Maintenance of Books and Records. CRSS and the CRSS Subsidiaries
(and their respective successors and assigns) and Jacobs and its Affiliates
shall preserve until the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date all records
possessed or to be possessed by such party relating to the Business to be
Acquired, the Corporations, and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Assumed Contracts and the Continuing Contracts. After the Closing
Date, where there is a legitimate purpose, such party shall provide the other
parties with access, upon prior reasonable written request specifying the need
therefor, during regular business hours, to (i) the officers and employees of
such party and (ii) the books of account and records of such party, but, in each
case, only to the extent relating to the Business to be Acquired, including the
Assumed Contracts and the Continuing Contracts, and the other parties and their
representatives shall have the right to make copies of such books and records;
provided, however, that the foregoing right of access shall not be exercisable
in such a manner as to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations and
business of such party; and further, provided, that, as to so much of such
information as constitutes trade secrets or confidential business information of
such party, the requesting party and its officers, directors and representatives
will use due care to not disclose such information except (i) as required by
law, (ii) with the prior written consent of such party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, or (iii) where such information becomes available to
the public generally, or becomes generally known to competitors of such party,
through sources other than the requesting party, its affiliates or its officers,
directors or representatives. Such records may nevertheless be destroyed by a
party if such party sends to the other parties written notice of its intent to
destroy records, specifying with particularity the contents of the records to be
destroyed. Such records may then be destroyed after the 30th day after such
notice is given unless another party objects to the destruction in which case
the party

104
<PAGE>

seeking to destroy the records shall deliver such records to the objecting
party.

11.8 Payments Received.

(i) CRSS and Jacobs each agree that after the Closing each of
them shall hold and will promptly transfer and deliver to the other, from
time to time as and when received, any cash, checks with appropriate
endorsements (using their best efforts not to convert such checks into
cash), or other property that they or their Subsidiaries may receive on or
after the Closing that properly belongs to the other party, and will account
to the other for all such receipts. From and after the Closing, Jacobs shall
have the right and authority to endorse without recourse the name of the
named payee on any check or any other evidences of indebtedness received by
Jacobs on account of the business and the assets transferred to Jacobs
hereunder.

(ii) Any payments made by Jacobs that are not payments or
obligations of the Business to be Acquired shall be reimbursed by CRSS to
Jacobs upon presentation of documentation.

(iii) Any payments made by CRSS that are payments or obligations
of the Business to be Acquired shall be reimbursed by Jacobs to CRSS upon
presentation of documentation.

11.9 Further Assurances of CRSS. In order to carry out the
conveyances, transfers and assignments contemplated by this Agreement, CRSS
shall execute and deliver to Jacobs on the Closing Date all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and other documents and instruments of conveyance, transfer or
assignment as shall be necessary or appropriate to vest in or confirm to Jacobs
good, valid and indefeasible title, free of any liens or encumbrances other than
those listed in Exhibit 3.13, to all of the properties, assets, good will and
business comprising the Business to be Acquired, transferred and assigned to
Jacobs under this Agreement, all of which documents shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Jacobs and its legal counsel. Subsequent to
the Closing Date CRSS shall and shall cause the CRSS Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts (not involving the payment of consideration) to
obtain such consents, subject to the obligations of the Parties pursuant to
Section 11.4 hereof, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to
vest in and confirm to Jacobs good, valid and indefeasible title to, and the
right to use, free of any liens or encumbrances, except for liens and
encumbrances described in Section 3.13, the properties, assets, goodwill and
business of the Corporations herein comprising the Business to be

105
<PAGE>

Acquired and the Contracts to be assigned to Jacobs pursuant to this Agreement.

11.10 Further Assurances of Jacobs.

(i) Jacobs shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
CRSS in obtaining all consents required to the assignment of any Contracts
to be assigned to Jacobs hereunder and consents to changes of ownership with
respect to contracts held by the Stock Corporations.

(ii) Promptly following the Closing and in any event within 30
days thereafter, Jacobs shall commence commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the release of CRSS and the CRSS Subsidiaries from any bonds, letters
of credit and guarantees pertaining to any Assumed Contracts or Continuing
Contracts and from any guaranties of any Assumed Contracts, Continuing
Contracts, Leases, Personal Property Leases, and Ancillary Contracts (the
"Existing Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees"), including obtaining or
providing replacement bonds, letters of credit and guarantees in Jacobs' own
name.

11.11 Insurance Coverage. CRSS shall arrange to have the casualty,
professional errors and omissions and directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies listed on Exhibit 3.14 provide coverage to CRSS for all
occurrences prior to Closing for which claims are made on or before June 30,
1995. CRSS shall also seek to have Jacobs, its subsidiaries and their successors
named as additional insureds, provided that the issuers of such policies agree
to such an endorsement and such endorsement can be obtained by CRSS at no more
than nominal additional cost. If the cost of such coverage of Jacobs is more
than a nominal amount, then Jacobs may elect to pay for such coverage, in which
event CRSS shall procure such coverage at Jacobs' cost. CRSS shall promptly
furnish Jacobs evidence of such coverage when it is obtained.

11.12 Liabilities Not to be Assumed by Jacobs.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Jacobs shall not
assume the Liabilities and obligations of CRSS or its Affiliates or their
predecessors in interest listed below (the "Retained Liabilities"), all of which
Retained Liabilities shall be and continue to be the liabilities and obligations
of CRSS and its Affiliates after the Closing Date:

(d) Warranty claims, and claims for failure to perform
warranty claims, for negligence in the performance of or misfeasance

Affiliate of CRSS or any subcontractor or supplier, regardless of

omissions that shall have occurred prior to Closing;

(e) The termination of employment by CRSS or any of its

legislation against CRSS or any of its Affiliates to the extent
proximately caused by acts or omissions that occurred prior to
Closing;

(g) Any claim for any federal, state or local taxes of any
sort or kind, not accrued in the Closing Date Consolidating Balance
Sheet arising from the business, property, assets or operations of
CRSS or any of its Affiliates or from their performance of this
Agreement;

(h) Any claims related to the withdrawal of CRSS or any of
its Affiliates from any employee stock purchase, pension, profit-

them or by any union, provided that such claims arise from acts,
omissions or transactions occurring prior to or at Closing or as a
result of this Agreement; and

(i) Any Liability or penalty imposed by the federal or any
state or local governmental body related to a Customer Contract with

ARTICLE TWELVE: INDEMNIFICATION

12.1 General Indemnification Obligation of CRSS. From and after the
Closing, CRSS shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Jacobs and its
Affiliates, successors and assigns (each of whom is referred to as an
"Indemnified Jacobs Party") against and in respect of:

(i) Any and all Liabilities, asserted by any Person other than
CRSS and its Affiliates or Jacobs and its Affiliates arising from any acts,
errors or omissions of CRSS or any of its Affiliates on or before the
Closing Date

108
<PAGE>

in connection with (a) the Completed Contracts regardless of when
performed, and (b) any portion of any of the Assumed Contracts and the
Continuing Contracts performed by CRSS or any of its Affiliates prior to
Closing (a "Third Party Claim"), whether such Third Party Claim is made
against a CRSS Company, Jacobs, a Corporation, the Business to be Acquired
or any Affiliate or subsidiary of any of the foregoing; provided, however,
that with respect to any Assumed Contract or Continuing Contract the
obligation of CRSS shall apply only to the extent that the actions of CRSS
or one of its Affiliates on or before the Closing Date are shown to be the
proximate cause of such Third Party Claim. With respect to the Assumed
Contracts and the Continuing Contracts, if Jacobs becomes aware of any Third
Party Claim or any facts that would in the ordinary course of events
constitute the basis for a Third Party Claim, then Jacobs shall take such
reasonable action to mitigate such Third Party Claim as is in accordance
with good professional and business practice, and, to the extent that
actions beyond normal mitigation are necessary Jacobs shall give CRSS notice
of such Third Party Claim and provide CRSS reasonable cooperation in
reducing the exposure of CRSS to such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding any
other provision hereof, this Section 12.1(i) describes all of the
indemnification obligations of CRSS under this Agreement with respect to
Third Party Claims relating to Assumed Contracts and Continuing Contracts
and specifically such indemnification obligations shall not be limited or
expanded by any representations, warranties or covenants herein.

(ii) Any and all Litigation listed in Exhibit 3.18;

(iii) any and all Retained Liabilities;

(iv) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or
nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant on the part of CRSS under this
Agreement; and

(v) any claims of CRSS or any of its Affiliates against any
Corporation.

In determining the total dollar amount of all claims for which the Indemnified
Jacobs Parties are entitled to receive reimbursement pursuant to this Section
12.1 there shall be excluded any claims of $100,000.00, or less, for which
Jacobs would otherwise be entitled to reimbursement, but this limit shall not
exceed a total of $500,000.00 for all such claims.

12.2 General Indemnification Obligation of Jacobs. From and after the
Closing, Jacobs shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless CRSS and the CRSS
Subsidiaries and their successors

109
<PAGE>

and assigns (an "Indemnified CRSS Party") against and in respect of any and
all Liabilities incurred or suffered by any Indemnified CRSS Party that
result from, relate to or arise out of:

(i) any and all Liabilities and obligations of the Business to be
Acquired other than the Retained Liabilities;

(ii) any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or non-fulfillment
of any agreement or covenant on the part of Jacobs under this Agreement;

(iii) any acts, errors or omissions of Jacobs or any Affiliate or
subsidiary of Jacobs after the Closing Date, whether made against CRSS,
Jacobs, the Business to be Acquired or any Affiliate or subsidiary of any of
the foregoing ; provided, however, that, with regard to any Assumed Contract
or Continuing Contract, the obligations of Jacobs will apply only to the
extent that the actions of Jacobs after the Closing Date are shown to be the
proximate cause of such claims; and

(iv) any Liability under the Existing Bonds, Letters of Credit
and Guarantees to the extent Jacobs has the obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified CRSS Party pursuant to Section 12.2 hereof with respect to the
underlying obligation; and

(v) any claim of any Corporation against CRSS or any of its
Affiliates.

12.3 Method of Asserting Claims, Etc. 

(i) In the event that any claim or demand for which CRSS would be
liable to an Indemnified Jacobs Party hereunder is asserted against or
sought to be collected from an Indemnified Jacobs Party by a third party,
the Indemnified Jacobs Party shall promptly notify CRSS of such claim or
demand, specifying the nature of such claim or demand and the amount or the
estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall
not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim and demand) (the "Claim
Notice"). CRSS shall have ten days from the personal delivery or mailing of
the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Jacobs
Party, (A) whether or not it disputes its liability to the Indemnified
Jacobs Party hereunder with respect to such claim or demand and (B)
notwithstanding any such dispute, whether or not CRSS desires, at its sole
cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Jacobs Party against such claim
or demand. If CRSS does not respond to such notice within the Notice

110
<PAGE>

Period, then CRSS shall be deemed to have disputed its liability.

(ii) If CRSS disputes its liability with respect to such claim or
demand or the amount thereof (whether or not CRSS desires to defend the
Indemnified Jacobs Party against such claim or demand), such claim or demand
shall not be settled without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Jacobs Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(iii) In the event that CRSS notifies the Indemnified Jacobs
Parties within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified
Jacobs Party against such claim or demand, then, except as hereinafter
provided, CRSS shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by
appropriate proceedings; provided, however, that CRSS shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Jacobs Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, consent to the entry of any judgment against
the Indemnified Jacobs Party or enter into any settlement or compromise that
does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Jacobs Party of a release, in form
and substance satisfactory to the Indemnified Jacobs Party, as the case may
be, from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. If any
Indemnified Jacobs Party desires to participate in, but not control, any
such defense or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and expense.

(iv) If any material claim for which CRSS has accepted the duty
of indemnifying an Indemnified Jacobs Party involves a Person that is or was
during the three years immediately preceding the Closing Date a customer of
the Business to be Acquired (a "Customer"), then CRSS shall not, without
first consulting with the Indemnified Jacobs Party, institute any lawsuit or
other legal proceeding against any such Customer.

In addition, and without prejudice to the foregoing, CRSS shall,
in the case of claims by a Customer against CRSS or any of its Affiliates,
permit Jacobs to have the sole right to control the defense or settlement of
such claim (including the sole right to settle or otherwise terminate the
proceedings) in exchange for Jacobs' agreement to indemnify CRSS and its
Affiliates as to such claim in such manner as CRSS may reasonably require.

In case of a claim by CRSS or any of its Affiliates against a
Customer, CRSS shall assign such claim to Jacobs, if Jacobs so requests, in
return for the payment

111
<PAGE>

by Jacobs to CRSS of the amount of the claim as reasonably determined by
CRSS.

(v) In the event an Indemnified Jacobs Party shall have a claim
against CRSS hereunder that does not involve a claim or demand being
asserted against or sought to be collected from it by a third party, the
Indemnified Jacobs Party shall promptly send a Claim Notice with respect to
such claim to CRSS. The foregoing shall not serve to create any Liability or
obligation of CRSS to provide indemnity to an Indemnified Jacob Party except
as expressly provided in Section 12.1.

(vi) All claims for indemnification by an Indemnified CRSS Party
under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved under the procedures set
forth in this Section 12.3 by substituting in the appropriate place
"Indemnified CRSS Party" for "Indemnified Jacobs Party" and variations
thereof and "Jacobs" for "CRSS".

(vii) In addition to the notice requirements of Section 12.3(i),
Jacobs shall use its best efforts to notify CRSS of any circumstances from
which a Third Party Claim may reasonably be expected to arise with respect
to which Jacobs puts its insurance carrier on notice of such circumstances.

12.4 Compensation for Claims. 

(i) Upon a final determination of liability under Section 12.3
hereof whether by agreement of the Parties or by a final judgment of a
court, with all possibilities of appeal having been exhausted, the Party
found liable shall pay to the party to whom indemnification is awarded
within ten days after such determination, the amount so awarded.

(ii) Upon the payment in full of any claim, the entity making
payment shall be subrogated to the rights of the Indemnified Party against
any Person with respect to the subject matter of such claim.

12.5 No Waiver of Subrogation. Nothing herein shall be construed as a
waiver of any right of subrogation to which any insurance company may be
entitled under any insurance policy maintained by Jacobs or CRSS. Neither Jacobs
nor CRSS shall be obligated to make any claim against any insurance company
should it elect not to do so. The indemnification set forth in Section 12.1 and
12.2 above shall extend to cases of the indemnitee's concurrent negligence.

12.6 Cooperation of the Parties. Each Party shall give the other Party
its full cooperation in defending all claims by third parties subject to
indemnification hereunder, including

112
<PAGE>

furnishing witnesses and documentary evidence to the extent available.

12.7 Claims Against Former Corporation Employees. If Jacobs makes any
claim against CRSS or any of its Affiliates with respect to any matter or
occurrence arising prior to the Closing, then CRSS shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, make any claim against any former officer, director or
employee of any of the CRSS Companies who are employed by Jacobs or any
subsidiary of Jacobs following the Closing with respect to such claim of Jacobs,
notwithstanding that CRSS or any of its Affiliates may have placed reliance upon
any such person before entering into this Agreement, but this Section shall not
apply to claims arising from intentional acts or omissions of such former
officers, directors or employees or counterclaims against such former officers,
directors or employees in litigation brought by them.

12.8 Limitation on Indemnification. CRSS shall not be required to
indemnify the Jacobs Indemnified Party hereunder to the extent of the aggregate
contingency reserves as shown on the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet
or, with respect to Assumed Contracts and Continuing Contracts, the contingency
reserves shown on their respective Profits Plans as of the Closing Date, which
Profit Plans shall be consistent with the Closing Date Consolidating Balance
Sheet, and to the extent of such reserves the Jacobs Indemnified Party shall be
deemed not to have suffered any indemnifiable loss.

12.9 Survival of Representations; Time Limitations. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.8, 3.15 and 3.16(i),
which shall survive until two years after the Closing Date, and except for the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.18 or 3.27, which shall
survive until four years after the Closing Date, all representations and
warranties made by any party to this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall survive
the Closing hereunder and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of
any party hereto for a period of twelve months after the Closing Date. CRSS and
Jacobs shall have no liability under this Article Twelve for misrepresentation
or breach of any representation or warranty unless notice of a claim for
indemnity shall have been given to it within the applicable survival period;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall limit the time during
which either party may bring action for indemnification under Sections 12.1 or
12.2, except under Sections 12.1(iv) or 12.2(ii).

12.10 Attorneys' Fees. If any legal action or any arbitration or other
proceeding is brought by either party with respect to this Agreement, or because
of an alleged dispute, breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with
any of

113
<PAGE>

the provisions of this Agreement, the court shall award the successful or
prevailing party in addition to any other relief to which it or they may be
entitled, reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in that action or
proceeding including fees and costs incurred on appeal and in collecting any
judgment, as equitably determined by the court and the court shall so provide in
its judgment.

12.11 Remedies Exclusive. The remedies provided in this Agreement
shall be exclusive and shall preclude the assertion by any party hereto of any
other rights or the seeking of any other remedies against the other party
hereto; provided, that this Section shall not preclude either party from
asserting that it was fraudulently induced by the other party to enter into this
Agreement or from seeking injunctive relief.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN: COSTS

13.1 Brokers' Commissions. Neither Jacobs nor CRSS knows of any Person
who is entitled to claim a commission or finder's fee with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement except that CRSS will be obligated
to Merrill Lynch Investment Banking Group for such fees. CRSS on the one hand
and Jacobs on the other hand each agree to indemnify and hold harmless the other

of any brokerage commission or finder's fee alleged to be payable because of any
act, omission or statement of the indemnifying party.
