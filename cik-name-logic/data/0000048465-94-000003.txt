FOR RELEASE UPON RECEIPT:

AUSTIN, MINN. (June 9, 1994) -- Hormel Foods
Corporation announced today it is seeking to purchase most
of the consumer foods businesses comprising Nalley's Fine
Foods Division and Nalley's Canada Limited, currently
owned by Curtice-Burns, Inc., Rochester, N.Y. The purchase
of Nalley's by Hormel Foods is subject to the prior
acquisition of Curtice-Burns by Dean Foods Company,
Franklin Park, Ill.

Nalley's Fine Foods, headquartered in Tacoma, Wash., is a
strong regional processor and marketer of consumer-branded
chili, stew, microwave meals, salad dressings, pickles,
peanut butter, dips and salsa.

"Hormel Foods' interest is in acquiring the assets of
Nalley's in order to obtain several well-established
consumer brands in the Pacific Northwest," said V. Allan
Krejci, director of public relations. "These valuable
product additions are compatible with our current mix of
high-quality, consumer-oriented foods and, coupled with
our marketing, sales and distribution strengths, clearly
extend the Company's focus in a geographic area we are
striving to improve."

Joel W. Johnson, president and chief executive officer,
expressed pleasure with the proposed purchase. "The
acquisition of these high quality, well-recognized brands
in the Northwest will provide incremental volume to our
already successful and growing Grocery Products Division
and Foodservice Group," he stated. "Hormel Foods is
impressed with the consistently strong performance of the
Nalley's organization."

Core brands of Nalley's Fine Foods Division that have
attained leadership status in the Pacific Northwest
include Nalley's canned meats and entrees; Bernstein's
pourable dressing; Nalley's spreadable dressing; Farman's
and Nalley's pickles, and Adams natural peanut butter, all
of which are sold through retail and foodservice channels.
Total sales of these and other branded products included
in the proposed purchase exceed $180 million.

Krejci noted that the purchase is contingent on
negotiation of definitive agreements; completion of due
diligence; required government consent to the transaction,
and approval by the Hormel Foods Board of Directors. No
price or other terms of the impending agreement were
disclosed.
