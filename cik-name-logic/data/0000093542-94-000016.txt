LILLIPUT GROUP plc

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

AT 31 DECEMBER 1993

(1992 AND COMPANY INFORMATION UNAUDITED)
--------------------------------------
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

a) Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in
accordance with applicable accounting standards.

b) Basis of consolidation
The group accounts consolidate the accounts of Lilliput Group plc and all
its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year. The 1992
accounts were drawn up to 3 January 1993.

c) Research and development
Research and development expenditure is written off as it is incurred.

d) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold
land, at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less residual
value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful
life. The expected useful lives are:

Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings the term of the lease in equal annual
instalments
Plant, machinery and equipment 4 to 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years

e) Leased assets
Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases, which are
those where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
asset have passed to the group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and
are depreciated over their useful lives.

The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the
profit and loss account over the period of the contract or lease and
represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments
outstanding.

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a
straight line basis over the term of the lease.

f) Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost
comprises amounts incurred in bringing each product to its present location
and condition as follows:

Raw materials - purchase cost on a first-in, first
out basis
Work in progress and finished goods - cost of direct materials and
labour plus attributable overheads
based on the normal level of
activity.

Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs
expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

g) Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method on all timing
differences to the extent that they are expected to reverse in the future
without being replaced, calculated at the rate at which it is anticipated
the timing differences will reverse.

-32-
<PAGE>
h) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the
date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is
covered by a forward exchange contract. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward
contract rate. Investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings are
translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the investment.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.

On consolidation, the accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings
are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets
is taken directly to reserves. All other translation differences are taken
to the profit and loss account.

i) Pensions
The group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions are
charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable in accordance
with the rules of the scheme.

2. TURNOVER AND SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS

Turnover represents the amounts derived from the provision of goods and
services which fall within the group's ordinary activities, stated net of
value added tax.

All of the turnover, operating profit and net operating assets (i.e.,
excluding those assets and liabilities on which interest is earned or paid
respectively) relate to the manufacture and sale of miniature cottages as
collectables and giftware, and are analysed as follows:

entitlement to performance related bonuses for the year ended 31 December
1993. Had they not done so, they would have received bonuses totalling
(pounds)50,000. The bonus payable for that year relates to the achievement
of targets set for profit before taxation at the company's US subsidiary
undertaking.
On 26 August 1993, J A Russell, A R Dunning, R E Freestone, D J Tate
and P G Thomas were each granted options over 10,000 "B" ordinary shares at

26. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK AND US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom ("UK
GAAP") which differ from United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("US GAAP"). The principal differences as they apply to the
Group are summarised below:

However, these differences do not have any significant impact on profit for
the year ended December 31, 1993, or on shareholders equity at that date.

Deferred taxation

The Group provides for deferred taxation using the liability method only
where, in the opinion of the Directors, it is probable that the taxation
liability will crystallise within the foreseeable future. Under US
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") 109, deferred taxation
is computed using the liability method under which deferred taxation
liabilities on temporary differences are fully provided and future taxation
benefits are recognised as deferred taxation assets to the extent that
their realisation is more likely than not.

Ordinary dividends

In the consolidated financial statements, final Ordinary dividends are
provided for in the year in respect of which they are recommended by the
Board of Directors for approval by the shareholders. Under US GAAP,
dividends are not provided for until declared.

Consolidated statement of cash flows

The consolidated statements of cash flows prepared under UK GAAP, present
substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP by FAS
95, "Statement of Cash Flows". These Standards differ, however, with
regard to classification of items within the statements and as regards the
definition of cash and cash equivalents.

Under US GAAP,cash and cash equivalents would not include bank overdrafts
and borrowings with initial maturities of less than three months. Under UK
GAAP, cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, returns
on investments and servicing of finance, taxation investing activities and
financing activities. US GAAP, however, requires only three categories of
cash flow activity to be reported, operating, investing and financing.
Cash flows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of
finance shown under UK GAAP would, with the exception of dividends paid, be
included as operating activities under US GAAP. The payment of dividends
would be included as a financing activity under US GAAP. Under US GAAP,
capitalised interest is treated as part of the cost of the asset to which
it relates and thus included as part of investing cash flows, under UK GAAP
all interest is treated as part of returns on investments and servicing of
finance.

Concentrations of credit risk

Potential concentrations of credit risk to the Group consist principally of
short term cash investments, trade loans and trade receivables.

The Group only deposits short term cash surpluses with high credit quality
banks and institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure
to any one bank or institution. Trade receivables comprise a large,
widespread customer base.

<PAGE>

At December 31, 1993, the Group did not consider there to be any
significant concentration of credit risk.

Segmental information

The total assets of the Group split by geographical location are as

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
to the Board of Directors Lilliput Group plc

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Lilliput
Group plc as of December 31, 1993 and the related consolidated statements
of income, total recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the year
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards
which do not differ in any significant respect from United States generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurances about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respect, the consolidated financial
position of Lilliput Group plc at December 31, 1993, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
Kingdom which differ in certain respects from those followed in the United
States (see Note 26 of Notes to the Accounts).

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION

The interim accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounting
policies set out in the Group's 1993 Annual Report. Fixed annual charges
are apportioned to the interim period on the basis of time elapsed. Other
expenses are accrued in accordance with the same principles used in the
preparation of the annual accounts. The taxation charge is calculated by
applying the directors' best estimate of the annual effective tax rate to
the profit for the period.

3. EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE

shareholders for the period and on 23,269,420 (1993: 18,716,189) ordinary
shares, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in use, as
adjusted, during the period.

4. PAYMENT OF DIVIDEND

The interim dividend of 1.65p per share will be paid on 14 October 1994 to

5. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK AND US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom which
differ from United States generally accepted accounting principles. The
principal accounting and financial reporting differences as they apply to
the Group consist of the following:

Accounting for deferred taxation

Accounting for Ordinary dividends

Classification and definition of items included in the
consolidated statement of cash flows

Disclosure of concentration of credit risks

Disclosure of business segmental information

The above differences do not have a significant impact on profit for the
nine months ended 30 September 1994, or on shareholders equity at that
date.

PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

STANHOME INC. AND LILLIPUT GROUP plc

SEPTEMBER 30, 1994

The historical condensed consolidated balance sheets of Stanhome Inc. and

Lilliput Group plc ("Lilliput") have been consolidated into a pro forma

condensed consolidated balance sheet using the consolidated balance sheet

at the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year for each entity

(September 30, 1994 for both). The Lilliput balance sheet has been

translated to U.S. dollars, using FASB 52 guidelines, and reclassified to

the Stanhome Inc. reporting format. An exchange rate of 1.5795 dollars per

pound was used. The pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet has

been prepared assuming the transaction was consummated at the balance sheet

date and includes adjustments which give effect to events that are

attributable to the transaction whether they have a continuing or non

recurring impact. The excess of the purchase price over the net book value

acquired was recorded as goodwill, in other assets. The adjustment of the

allocation of the purchase price may change as a result of future

determinations as to the fair value of the net assets acquired, but the

Company believes that there is not a substantial difference between fair

value and net book value of the net assets acquired. This statement should

be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial

statements of Stanhome Inc. included in its latest Form 10-Q and Lilliput

included in this Form 8-K/A.
