ITEM OF INFORMATION

Item 5. Other Events

GTE South Incorporated today announced that its results for the
fourth quarter of 1993 will include a one-time pre-tax
restructuring charge of $99.6 million related primarily to the
implementation of its re-engineering plan over the next three
years. The restructuring charge will reduce fourth quarter and
full year net income by $61.3 million.

The re-engineering plan will redesign and streamline processes in
order to improve customer-responsiveness and product quality,
reduce the time necessary to introduce new products and services
and further reduce costs. The re-engineering plan includes $39.2
million to upgrade or replace existing customer service and
administrative systems and enhance network software, $44.4
million for employee separation benefits associated with
workforce reductions and $12.0 million primarily for the
consolidation of facilities and operations and other related
costs. The charge for employee separation benefits includes
$22.4 million related to the recognition of previously deferred
postretirement health and life insurance costs for separating
employees.
