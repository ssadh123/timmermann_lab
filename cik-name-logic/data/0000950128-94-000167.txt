ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On or about November 23, 1994, two purported class action lawsuits were
commenced in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania against PNC Bank Corp. (the "Corporation") and Thomas H. O'Brien
(the Corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) and, in one case,
Robert L. Haunschild (the Corporation's Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer), alleging purported violations of federal securities laws
relating to disclosures regarding the Corporation's net interest income,
interest rate risk, future prospects and related matters, and seeking, among
other things, unquantified damages on behalf of purchasers of the Corporation's
securities during specified portions of 1994. The Corporation believes there 
are meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and intends to defend them
vigorously.
