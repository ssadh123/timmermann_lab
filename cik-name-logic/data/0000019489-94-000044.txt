CHASE REPORTS EARNINGS FOR SECOND QUARTER 1994,
UP 32% TO $307 MILLION

The Chase Manhattan Corporation today reported second quarter 1994 net
income of $307 million ($1.46 per share), up 32% from the $233 million
($1.20 per share) reported for the second quarter of 1993.

Thomas G. Labrecque, Chase Chairman said, "Chase's second quarter 1994
results represent solid financial performance in difficult markets. Our
revenue growth, particularly fee revenue, reflects the success of our
investment strategies in our core businesses. In addition, our asset
quality measures continue to improve, further reducing our credit costs."

Second Quarter Highlights - 1994 vs. 1993:
- improved profitability measures: return on assets and return on common
equity increased to 1.05% and 16.1%, respectively;
- continued strong growth in fees and commissions - up 24%: major
categories showed increases including consumer banking - up 44%, trust
and fiduciary - up 26%, and investment banking - up 36%;
- trading revenue of $151 million - achieved under adverse market
conditions;
- a lower provision for possible credit losses of $150 million, down $75
million;
- continued decline of nonperforming assets, including a 28% decrease in
domestic commercial real estate nonperforming assets during the
quarter.

<PAGE> 2 
For the first six months of 1994, Chase reported consolidated net income of
$671 million ($3.27 per share), up 74% from the $386 million ($1.95 per
share) reported for the same period of 1993.

During second quarter 1994 Chase exchanged its eligible loans for
Brady bonds and past-due interest bonds pursuant to the Brazilian debt
restructuring. The Brady bonds are included in Chase's Trading Account
Assets. The past-due interest bonds are carried in the investment
securities available for sale portfolio and resulted in an unrealized gain
of approximately $46 million after taxes, being reflected in stockholders'
equity.

NET INTEREST REVENUE - TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS
Net interest revenue, on a taxable equivalent basis, was $924 million for
the second quarter of 1994, compared with $902 million for the second
quarter of 1993. Net interest margin was 3.91%, compared with 4.10%
reported for the second quarter of 1993. Average interest-earning assets
were $94.8 billion, compared with $88.2 billion for the same period last
year. Average loans increased to $60.6 billion for the current quarter
from the $59.8 billion level reported for the second quarter of 1993.

For the first six months of 1994, net interest revenue, on a taxable
equivalent basis, was $1,882 million, compared with $1,958 million for the
same period last year, which included $142 million of interest revenue from
Brazil PDI bonds. The net interest margin was 4.05% for the first six
months of 1994, compared with 4.52% (4.19% excluding Brazil PDI bonds) for
the same period last year. Average interest-earning assets for the first
six months of 1994 were $93.8 billion, compared with $87.4 billion for the
first six months of 1993. For the first six months of 1994, average loans
were $60.9 billion, compared with $61.0 billion reported for the first six
months of 1993.

</TABLE>

Fees and commissions were $480 million for the second quarter of 1994, up
24% over the second quarter of 1993. Total consumer banking fees,
including credit card and mortgage banking fees, increased 44%. Mortgage
banking fees improved substantially over the same period last year due to
the 1993 acquisition of Troy & Nichols and the absence of accelerated
writedowns of mortgage servicing assets in 1994.

Trust and fiduciary fee revenue increased 26% over the second quarter of
1993 primarily due to increased customer transaction volumes in the Global
Securities Services and Global Private Banking businesses. Investment
banking fee revenue from global corporate finance activities increased 36%
over the same period last year. This increase reflected improved
transaction volumes, particularly in loan syndication and project finance.

For the first six months of 1994, fees and commissions were $926 million,
up 23%, reflecting increases in all categories of fee revenue.

</TABLE>

Total other revenue for the second quarter of 1994 was $169 million, up $51
million, from the same period in 1993. Included in other revenue of $98
million was a $55 million gain from the sale of Chase Arizona, a domestic
banking subsidiary.

Total other revenue for the first six months of 1994 totaled $398 million,
up $164 million, or 70%, from $234 million for the first six months of
1993.

OPERATING EXPENSES
Total operating expenses were $1,073 million for the second quarter of 1994
and $995 million for the second quarter of 1993. Operating expenses for
the second quarter of 1994 included $23 million of ORE valuation losses and
expenses, compared with $37 million for the same period last year. The
expense to revenue ratio, excluding ORE expenses, was 61% for the current
quarter.

Operating expenses for the second quarter of 1994 reflected Chase's
continued funding of strategic growth programs in its core businesses.
These programs contributed to the fee revenue growth realized this year.

For the first six months of 1994, other operating expenses were $2,131
million, compared with $1,978 (excluding first quarter 1993 provision for
ORE held for accelerated disposition) for the same period of 1993.

INCOME TAXES
The second quarter of 1994 provision for income taxes was $188 million
representing an effective tax rate of 38%, compared with a tax provision of
$134 million for the second quarter of 1993.

For the first six months of 1994, the provision for income taxes was $412
million, compared with a net income tax benefit of $40 million for the same
period last year. Excluding the tax benefits applicable to the special
provision for the accelerated disposition portfolio, Chase's tax provision
for the first six months of 1993 would have been approximately $271
million. In addition, Chase adopted SFAS 109 in the first quarter of 1993
resulting in a $500 million net benefit reflected as a cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle.

PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES AND NET LOAN CHARGE-OFFS
The provision for possible credit losses was $150 million, or $10 million
lower than the first quarter of 1994 and $75 million lower than the second

quarter of 1993.

DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ASSETS
Chase continues to reduce its exposure to real estate risk. During the
second quarter of 1994, domestic commercial real estate assets decreased
$634 million to $3.0 billion at June 30, 1994. Contributing to this
decline were approximately $499 million of net repayments and sales of
outstanding assets, including $6 million of interest applied to principal,
and $135 million of charge-offs and valuation losses.

</TABLE>

We substantially completed the liquidation of assets held for accelerated
disposition during the second quarter of 1994 through repayments and
sales. At June 30, 1994, the carrying value of such assets was $45
million.

At June 30, 1994, approximately $1.6 billion of the total $2.4 billion of
domestic commercial real estate loans have been identified as being
consistent with Chase's ongoing core real estate portfolio activities.
The remaining noncore real estate loans of approximately $820 million
consist of approximately $490 million of performing loans and $330 million
of nonaccrual loans. The carrying value of these nonaccrual loans at June
30, 1994 was approximately 70% of their contractual amount. Chase
generally allocates a portion of its total reserve for possible credit
losses to its real estate portfolio. At June 30, 1994, the reserve for
possible credit losses for this noncore real estate portfolio segment was
$250 million and Management expects this reserve to cover any potential
future losses related to these loans.

The ratio of the remaining reserve for possible credit losses to the
balance of nonaccrual loans was 222% at June 30, 1994.

(a) On January 1, 1994, Chase adopted FASB Interpretation No. 39. As a
result of such adoption, Chase's Trading Account Assets and
Liabilities increased approximately $13 billion at June 30, 1994 and
$10 billion at March 31, 1994. This had the effect of decreasing the
common and total equity ratios and the Tier 1 leverage ratios.

(b) Adjusted to reflect the redemption of all $227 million of Chase's
outstanding Series F Preferred Stock, announced on May 10, 1994.
