JUDGE SCHEDULES SEPTEMBER 12 TRIAL
IN COLUMBIA GAS LITIGATION

WILMINGTON, DEL. -- U. S. District Court Judge Joseph H.
Farnan, Jr., yesterday set September 12, 1994, for the start of the trial in
the litigation involving challenges to certain transactions between Columbia
Gas Transmission Corp. and its parent company, The Columbia Gas System, Inc.,
and another Columbia Gas subsidiary, Columbia Natural Resources.

Columbia Gas Chairman John H. Croom said: "Columbia is pleased
with the court's swift action in this matter. Yesterday's decision by Federal
District Court Judge Joseph Farnan to establish a definite trial schedule will
go a long way toward meeting the bankruptcy court's and Columbia's objective of
expediting Columbia's bankruptcy proceeding."

In its complaint, originally filed in March 1992, Columbia
Transmission's Unsecured Creditors' Committee challenged the validity of $1.7
billion in secured and unsecured debt Columbia Transmission owes to the parent
company, its payment of dividends and interest to the parent company and its
transfer of natural resource properties to another affiliate.

The Columbia Gas System, Inc. (NYSE:CG), and Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp. have been operating as debtors in possession under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since July 31, 1991.
