restating the Company's unaudited results for 1993, 1992 and 1991 and its
unaudited balance sheets as of September 30, 1993 and December 31, 1992 to
reflect Waters and Biosearch as discontinued operations. The results of
operations of these discontinued businesses since November 11, 1993 have been
deferred pending finalization of the divestitures.

On April 22, 1994, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had
approved the use of the anticipated net proceeds from the sale of Waters for
the repurchase of Company stock. A copy of that press release is attached as

restated purchase and sale agreement dated as of March 31, 1994 (executed
June 28, 1994) and as amended on August 11, 1994. On August 18, 1994, the
Company issued a press release announcing the consummation of the sale. A
copy of that press release is attached as Exhibit 99(b) hereto and is
incorporated by reference. The sale price, which was established through
arms' length negotiations following the solicitation, receipt and
consideration of proposals from various interested parties, was $340,000,000.

MILLIPORE CORPORATION
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. The Company has sold Waters for $330,000,000 in cash and $10,000,000 in
preferred stock. The Company has sold Biosearch for $1,000,000 in cash
and 4,000 shares of non-voting preferred stock redeemable in four equal
annual installments of $10,000,000. The sale of Waters and Biosearch
resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately $300,000,000. The pro
forma financial statements assume the following:

- The divestitures are assumed to have generated a $10,000,000 after
tax gain. The gain is reflected as an adjustment to shareholders'
equity as of the beginning of 1993 and 1994.

- Accounts receivable balances from Waters and Biosearch customers
which have been retained by the Company are classified as accounts
receivable-other.

- The preferred stock referred to above has been recorded at its
estimated market value of $18,000,000 and has been classified in
other assets.

- The Company purchased 3,500,000 shares of its common stock at the
maximum price under the tender offer of $60.00 per share
($210,000,000).

- Expenses directly related to the share repurchase offer are assumed
to be $500,000 and are charged against additional paid in capital.

- None of the 1,300,000 shares exercisable by employees of the
Company under the Company's employee stock option plan are assumed
to be exercised in the stock tender offer.

Adjustments have been recorded in the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial statements to reflect the receipt of the net
proceeds, the disposition of the net assets of the businesses and the
recording of accruals to cover the costs associated with the
transactions. The pro forma results assume no reinvestment of the
excess proceeds over the purchase price of the shares. There can be no
assurance that the Company will purchase 3,500,000 shares or the price
at which the shares will be repurchased.

2. Net income has been adjusted by the Company's results of its
Chromatography and Bioscience divisions which were previously reported
as discontinued operations.

3. The unaudited pro forma income from continuing operations per share is
based upon the average number of common shares outstanding for the six
months ended June 30, 1994 and the year ended December 31, 1993 reduced
by the common stock repurchased.
