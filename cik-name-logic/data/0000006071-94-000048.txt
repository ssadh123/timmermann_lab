Item 5: OTHER EVENTS

Beginning on September 12, 1994, Ames will distribute to its banks 
and other lenders, principal trade vendors and factors, summaries of 
its unaudited financial results for the four and thirty weeks ended 
August 27, 1994. These monthly and year-to-date results 
(collectively, the "monthly results") are attached hereto as Exhibit 
20 and are incorporated by reference herein.

Compared with the projections contained in the Form 8-K dated May 27, 
1994 (referred to herein as the "Plan"), sales for the four weeks 
ended August 27, 1994 were $6.3 million less than Plan and EBITDA (as 
defined in Exhibit 20) was $.9 million less than Plan. In August, 
the unfavorable sales variance was primarily due to shortfalls in 
home products and convenience goods. The August gross margin rate 
was also less than Plan due primarily to higher-than-planned 
markdowns in apparel. The unfavorable impact on the August EBITDA 
from the lower-than-planned sales and gross margin rate was partially 
offset by lower-than-planned expenses. Store non-payroll, field and 
home office expenses were all less than Plan in August.

Sales for the thirty weeks ended August 27, 1994 were $18.5 million 
less than Plan and EBITDA was $.6 million less than Plan. The 
year-to-date unfavorable sales variance was due primarily to 
shortfalls in crafts and convenience goods. The lower year-to-date 
gross margin rate was due to higher-than-planned markdowns, 
particularly in apparel. The unfavorable impact on the year-to-date 
EBITDA from the lower-than-planned sales and gross margin rate was 
partially offset by lower-than-planned expenses and additional gains 
on property sales. Year-to-date store, field and home office 
expenses were all less than Plan.

As of August 27, 1994, LIFO inventories were $19.3 million greater 
than Plan, primarily in hardline categories. The Company decided to 
temporarily build inventory levels above those projected in the Plan 
to support several new sales promotions for the Fall and Christmas 
seasons. Trade payables were $26.2 million greater than Plan due 
primarily to the higher-than-planned inventory purchases and improved 
payment terms. Outstanding borrowings under the Company's revolving 
line of credit as of August 27, 1994 were $17.9 million less than 
Plan due primarily to the better-than-planned trade payable terms.

Ames is distributing the monthly results to its banks and other 
lenders, principal trade vendors and factors to facilitate their 
credit analyses. The summary results SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR
ANY OTHER PURPOSE and should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994, the 
Company's Form 10-Q for the first and second fiscal quarters ended 
April 30 and July 30, 1994, respectively, and the Company's Form 8-K 
dated May 27, 1994. The monthly results are being reported publicly 
solely because they are being distributed to a large number of the 
Company's vendors for purposes of their credit analyses.

During the pendency of its reorganization case, Ames disclosed 
publicly its monthly results through filings with the Office of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee and continued to report publicly its monthly 
results during the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994. Although Ames 
expects to continue to make its monthly results public for the fiscal 
year ending January 28, 1995, Ames does not believe it is obligated 
to provide such information indefinitely, other than as required by 
applicable regulations, and Ames may cease making such disclosures 
and updates at any time. The monthly results were not examined, 
reviewed or compiled by Ames' independent certified public 
accountants. Moreover, Ames does not believe that it is obligated to 
update the monthly results to reflect subsequent events or 
developments. The reported monthly results are subject to future 
adjustments, if any, that could materially affect such results. 
However, in the opinion of the Company, the monthly results contain 
all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) 
necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods 
presented.
