CCB FINANCIAL AND SECURITY CAPITAL BANCORP
ANNOUNCE ENHANCEMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA BANKING
FRANCHISE THROUGH COMBINATION

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE November 7, 1994

Durham, North Carolina -- CCB Financial Corporation
(CCBF:Nasdaq) and Security Capital Bancorp (SCBC:Nasdaq) of
Salisbury, N.C., jointly announced today an agreement to
merge.

Under terms of a definitive agreement, CCB will issue
.500 shares of its common stock in exchange for each share
of common stock of Security Capital in a tax-free exchange.
The merger, which is based on a fixed exchange ratio, will
be accounted for as a pooling of interests. Based on the
Friday closing stock price of CCB Financial of $39.125, the
transaction is valued at approximately $235 million.

As part of the transaction, CCB announced that it
anticipates repurchasing up to 9% of the common shares of
stock issued in the merger. CCB is planning to effect this
open market repurchase prior to the completion of the
transaction.

Ernest C. Roessler will continue as president and chief
executive officer and David B. Jordan will become vice
chairman of CCB Financial Corporation. William L. Burns,
Jr. will continue as chairman of CCB Financial Corporation.
Lloyd G. Gurley, president, and Ralph A. Barnhardt, vice
chairman of Security Capital, will become executive vice
presidents of CCB Financial Corporation.

Security Capital is a $1.2-billion bank holding company
operating 46 offices in 30 communities located in 13
counties in the south central and western Piedmont regions
of North Carolina through its four banking subsidiaries:
Security Capital Bank and OMNIBANK, SSB, Salisbury; Citizens
Savings, SSB, Concord; and Home Savings Bank, SSB, Kings
Mountain. Security Capital holds approximately 6% of the
deposits in the Charlotte metropolitan statistical area. At
or for the nine months ended September 30, 1994, Security
Capital had an equity to assets ratio of 10.15%, non-
performing assets as a percentage of total assets of .36%,
<PAGE>
and a return on average assets before nonrecurring charges
of approximately 1.50%.

"The combination with Security Capital continues our
strategy of building a solid presence in the best markets in
the state of North Carolina, primarily along the I-85/I-40
corridor from Raleigh to Charlotte," said Ernest C.
Roessler, president and chief executive officer of CCB
Financial. "With Security Capital, CCB Financial will have
over $1 billion in deposits in the rapidly growing Charlotte
area market. We believe that the combined operations in
this market have the potential to accelerate the growth
levels currently being realized by each company
individually."

Roessler continued, "We see great potential for the
combined companies. The management teams of both CCB and
Security Capital have currently identified significant
expense savings that can result from the merger. These
synergies, combined with accelerated growth in our combined
Charlotte area franchise, will result in a transaction that
will be accretive to CCB's earnings per share in the longer
term."

David B. Jordan noted, "We are pleased to give our
shareholders, employees and communities the opportunity to
join a company with CCB's successful track record. By
combining with CCB, we feel that we have helped solidify CCB
Financial as one of North Carolina's premier banking
companies. The combined franchises are a natural fit with
minimum overlap of branch offices."

The transaction, which is subject to, among other
things, approval by regulatory authorities and stockholders
of both companies, is expected to be completed during the
second quarter of 1995.

CCB Financial, with $3.4 billion in assets, currently
operates 112 offices in North Carolina. Combined with
Security Capital, CCB will have $4.6 billion in assets and
will serve over 50% of North Carolina's population.
