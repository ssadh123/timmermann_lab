[LETTERHEAD OF RIGGS NATIONAL CORPORATION APPEARS HERE]

For Immediate Release, Monday, May 9, 1994

Riggs National Corporation today reported that Paul M. Homan has decided to
end his association with the Riggs organization. His helping to return Riggs to
firmer financial footing is consistent with his prior achievements in the
banking industry.

In ending his association with Riggs, Mr. Homan has resigned as president,
chief executive officer and a director of the company's principal banking
subsidiary, The Riggs National Bank of Washington, D.C., and as a director and
vice chairman of the parent company.

Joe L. Allbritton, chairman and chief executive officer of Riggs National
Corporation, said, "Riggs is achieving substantial progress in positioning
itself for long-term profitable growth. We have developed and are implementing
a three-year capital plan, have greatly improved credit quality, and have put in
place highly skilled managers throughout the organization. The effects of this
progress are reflected in Riggs's return to profitability over the last three
quarters and the highest capital ratios in our history.

"We are grateful for Paul Homan's contribution, and his departure is wholly
voluntary. He joined our organization nearly a year ago with a reputation for
expertise in rebuilding the financial strength of banking organizations. He
has met our expectations in this regard. Our focus now is on using our
enhanced capabilities to take advantage of Riggs's position in the Washington,
D.C., marketplace and to move forward as a supercommunity bank."

Mr. Allbritton will assume, on an interim basis, the responsibilities of
president and chief executive officer of Riggs-Washington. The search committee
of the board of directors will meet on Wednesday to begin the search for a
permanent president and chief executive.

In an unrelated matter, Riggs reported that George W. Grosz, executive vice
president of Riggs's Financial Services Group, recently resigned to accept the
position of president of another financial entity. Peter M. Welber, senior vice
president and a Riggs banker for 21 years, will assume Mr. Grosz's
responsibilities on an acting basis.
