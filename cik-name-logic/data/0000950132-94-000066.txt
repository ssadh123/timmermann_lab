UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT

February 2, 1994

Salomon Brothers Inc
Goldman, Sachs & Co.
Lehman Brothers Inc.
c/o Salomon Brothers Inc
7 World Trade Center
New York, New York 10048

Dear Sirs:

From time to time USX Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing
Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as
the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions
stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to
the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters"
with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein)
certain of its debt securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to
such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated
Securities").

The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities
shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or
pursuant to the indenture (the "Indenture") identified in such Pricing
Agreement.

1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time
to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as
representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement
relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term
"Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of
the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated
as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as
an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation
of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the
Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the
Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing
Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each
Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such
Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated
Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated
Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the
names of the Representatives of such Underwriter and the principal amount of
such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set
forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and
payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not
set forth in the Indenture and the registration statement and prospectus with
respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement
shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and
may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid
transmission device designed to produce a written record of
communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this
Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the
Underwriters that:

(a) A registration statement in respect of the Securities has been
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); such
registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in
the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives
and, excluding exhibits to such registration statement, but including all
documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained therein, to
the Representatives for each of the other Underwriters, have been declared
effective by the Commission in such form; no other document with respect to
such registration statement and no other document required to be
incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted
for filing with the Commission; and no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such registration statement has been issued and no
proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the
Commission (any preliminary prospectus included in such registration
statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the rules
and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act"), being hereinafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus";
the various parts of such registration statement, including all exhibits
thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus
contained in the registration statement at the time such part of the
registration statement became effective but excluding Form T-1, each as
amended at the time such part of the registration statement became
effective, being hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"; the
prospectus relating to the Securities, in the form in which it has most
recently been filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission on or
prior to the date of this Agreement, being hereinafter called the
"Prospectus"; any reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus or the
Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents
incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the applicable form under the
Act, as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the
case may be; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any
Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and
include any documents filed after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus
or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in
such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any
reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to
refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the
Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement; and any reference to the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented shall be deemed to refer to the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities in the
form in which it is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
the Act in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof, including any documents
incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such filing);

(b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when
they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may
be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by
reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto,
when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as
the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements
of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not

2
<PAGE>

misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall
not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an
Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly
for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such
Securities;

(c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform, and any
further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of
the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust
Indenture Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder
and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to the
Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of the applicable
filing date as to the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto,
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and
warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company
by an Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives
expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to
such Securities;

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has sustained
since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any material loss or
interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other
calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or
court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth
in or contemplated by the Prospectus; and, since the respective dates as of
which information is given in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, there has not been any material change in the capital stock or
long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any material
adverse change, or any development likely to result in a prospective
material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management,
financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth in or
contemplated by the Prospectus;

(e) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as
a corporation in good standing under the laws of Delaware, with all
corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its
business as described in the Prospectus;

(f) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the
Prospectus, and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company
have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and
non-assessable;

(g) The Securities have been duly authorized, and, when Designated
Securities are issued and delivered pursuant to this Agreement and the
Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities, such
Designated Securities will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued
and delivered and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of
the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, which will
be substantially in the form filed as an exhibit to the Registration
Statement; the Indenture has been duly authorized and duly qualified under
the Trust Indenture Act and, at the Time of Delivery for such Designated
Securities (as defined in Section 4 hereof), the Indenture will constitute
a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the
Indenture conforms, and the Designated Securities will conform, to the
descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented
with respect to such Designated Securities;

(h) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the
Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture, this
Agreement and any Pricing Agreement, and the consummation of the
transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or
result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party
or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets
of the Company is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of
the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the

3
<PAGE>

Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or
governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of
its properties; and no consent, approval, authorization, order,
registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental
agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Pricing Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have
been, or will have been prior to the Time of Delivery, obtained under the
Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals,
authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under
state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and
distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters; and

(i) Other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or
governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, would have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and, to the best of the
Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental
authorities or by others.

3. Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to any
Designated Securities and authorization by the Representatives of the release of
such Designated Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer such
Designated Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented.

4. Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to
the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in definitive form to the extent
practicable, and in such authorized denominations and registered in such names
as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice
to the Company, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the
Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such
Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by certified or
official bank check or checks, payable to the order of the Company in the funds
specified in such Pricing Agreement, all at the place and time and date
specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such other place and time and date as
the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and
date being herein called the "Time of Delivery" for such Securities.

5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any Designated
Securities:

(a) To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in relation
to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the
Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second
business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement
relating to the applicable Designated Securities or, if applicable, such
earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further
amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as
amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to

shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Securities promptly
after reasonable notice thereof, to advise the Representatives promptly of
any such amendment or supplement after such Time of Delivery and furnish
the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and
any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the

in connection with the offering or sale of such Securities, and during such
same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration
Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the
Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of
the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing
or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities, of the
suspension of the qualification of such Securities for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for
any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or
supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional
information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of
any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating
to the Securities or suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its
best efforts to obtain its withdrawal;

(b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the
Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Securities for
offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the
Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit
the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as
long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Securities,
provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to
qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of
process in any jurisdiction;

(c) To furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may from
time to time reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus is
required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the
Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of
which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered,
not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during
such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the
Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in
order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act,
to notify the Representatives and to file such document and to prepare and
furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities
as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably
request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which
will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance;

(d) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as
practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the
effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158 (c)),
an earning statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be
audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder (including at the option of the
Company Rule 158); and

(e) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing
Agreement for such Designated Securities and continuing to and including
the earlier of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for such
Designated Securities, as notified to the Company by the Representatives,
and (ii) the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, not to offer,
sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the
Company which mature more than one year after such Time of Delivery and
which are substantially similar to such Designated Securities, without the
prior written consent of the Representatives.

6. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the
Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements
and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the
registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in
connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration

Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement
among Underwriters, this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, any Indenture, any

this Section, Section 8 and Section 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of
their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer
taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses
connected with any offers they may make.

result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of,

loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel
to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to

fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein

Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or

Statement or the date of the most recent report filed with the Commission
containing financial statements and incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement, if the date of such report is later than such
effective date, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to
the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and with respect to such letter
dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the
Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance
satisfactory to the Representatives;

(e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have
sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire,
explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or
from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order to decree,
otherwise than as set forth in or contemplated by the Prospectus as amended
or supplemented, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which
information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there
shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development
likely to result in a prospective change, in or affecting the general
affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of

8
<PAGE>

operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth
in or contemplated by the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the effect
of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in the
reasonable judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to
make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or
the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner
contemplated by the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;

(f) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the
Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating
accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized
statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission
for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization
shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review,
with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's
debt securities;

(g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the
Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following:
(i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally
on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial
banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State
authorities; or (iii) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving
the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national
emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause
in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or
inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the
Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the
Prospectus as amended and supplemented; and

(h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the
Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a
certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the
Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the
performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be
performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth
in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as
the Representatives may reasonably request.

8.(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which
such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary
prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will
reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss,
claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary
Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement,
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to
the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter
of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities.

(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each
director, officer and controlling person of the Company against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under
the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary
Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement,

9
<PAGE>

the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to
the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made
in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other
prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use
therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending
any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or
(b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying
party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof; but the failure as to notify the indemnifying party shall
not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party
otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought
against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the
commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate
therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with
counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the
consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and,
after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its
election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, in connection with any one
action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same
jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of
attorneys at any time for all indemnified parties, which firm shall be
designated in writing by the Representatives if the indemnified parties under
this Section 8 consist of any Underwriter or any of their respective controlling
persons, or by the Company, if the indemnified parties under this Section 8
consist of the Company or any of the Company's directors, officers or
controlling persons. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written
consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or
threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have
been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified
party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of
such proceeding.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable
to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or
(b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received
by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities
on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss,
claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however,
the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted
by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required
under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to
such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative
fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated
Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which

10
<PAGE>

resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the
other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds
from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to
the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters.
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and
the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the
Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if
the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be
deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action
or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter
shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any
damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the
Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are
several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect
to such Securities and not joint.

(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in
addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend,
upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any
Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the
Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which
the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same
terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.

9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the
Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing
Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in
their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to purchase such Designated Securities on
the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by
any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such
Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of
thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties
reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated
Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed
period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for
the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the
representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated
Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone
the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more
than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made
necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees
to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made
necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any
person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had
originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated
Securities.

(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains
unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of
the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each
non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated

11
<PAGE>

Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement
relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-
defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal
amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under
such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting
Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but
nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its
default.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased
exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated
Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not
exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting
Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities
shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any nondefaulting
Underwriter or Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and
the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and
contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a
defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties
and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth
in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to
this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf
of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company,
or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall
survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9
hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter
with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such pricing Agreement
except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof, but, if for any other
reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as
provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the
Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the
Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably
incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and
delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no
further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities
except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.

12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of
Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the
parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request,
notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such
Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be
designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.

All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in
writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or
facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the
Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail,
telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the
Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice
to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by
mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set
forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such
Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the
Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or
agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and
inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent
provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the
Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no
other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this
Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities
from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of
such purchase.

12
<PAGE>

14. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used
herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in
Washington, D.C. is open for business.

15. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one
or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts
shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and
return to us three counterparts hereof.

Very truly yours,

ESTABLISHMENT ACTION OF TERMS COMMITTEE AND RATE COMMITTEE
APPOINTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF USX CORPORATION
ON JULY 27,1993

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESOLVED, that there be, and there is hereby, created, approved and

(2) Interest on the Notes shall accrue from February 7, 1994, and be
payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing

payment. Each such February 15 or August 15 shall be an "Interest Payment
Date" for the Notes. The January 31 or July 31 (whether or not a Business
Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date shall be the
"Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.

RESOLVED, the forms of Underwriting Agreement and Pricing Agreement
between the Issuer and the Underwriters, presented to the Committees, covering
the sale by the Issuer and the purchase by the Underwriters of the Notes, hereby
are approved, and the Chairman or any Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors

Issuer, to execute and deliver an Underwriting Agreement and a Pricing
Agreement in substantially such form with such insertions, additions and

the same, such approval to be conclusively evidenced by his execution thereof.

RESOLVED, each of the officers of the Issuer hereby is authorized to
execute, deliver and file any and all instruments and documents and
amendments thereto and to do any and all acts or things in the name and on
behalf of the Issuer by him deemed necessary or advisable in connection with
the issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes and for the purpose of carrying
