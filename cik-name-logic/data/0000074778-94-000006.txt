FORM 8-K

CURRENT REPORT

Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): February 10, 1994

ORANGE AND ROCKLAND UTILITIES, INC.
(Exact name of Registrant as specified in its charter)

Incorporated in New York 1-4315 13-1727729
(State or Other (Commission (IRS Employer

Items 1. - 3. Not Applicable.

Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

On February 10, 1994, the Executive Committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company appointed the accounting firm of
Arthur Andersen & Co. to audit the books, records and accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries for the 1994 fiscal year. The
appointment of Arthur Andersen & Co. is subject to the approval
of the shareholders at the Annual Meeting to be held on April 13,
1994.

The accounting firm of Grant Thornton audited the Company's
consolidated financial statements for 1993 and prior years. Upon
recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors
decided to solicit bids for the performance of auditing services
for the Company for 1994. Bids were received from six public
accounting firms, including Grant Thornton. Based on a review of
the competing bids, the Audit Committee believed that the
selection of Arthur Andersen & Co. would be in the best interests
of the Company and recommended such selection to the Board of
Directors.

The reports of Grant Thornton on the Company's consolidated
financial statements for the past two fiscal years did not
contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and the
reports were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit
scope or accounting principles, except that the report for 1993
will be modified by inclusion of an explanatory paragraph
regarding the uncertainty of the pending investigations of the
Company and related litigation described in the Company's Current
Reports on Form 8-K dated August 16, October 6, November 23 and
December 16, 1993 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 1993. Since January 1, 1992, there
have been no disagreements with Grant Thornton on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved
to the satisfaction of Grant Thornton, would have caused Grant
Thornton to make reference to the subject matter of such
disagreements in connection with its report.

Items 5. - 6. Not Applicable.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Exhibit 16 - Letter from Grant Thornton - 
to be filed by amendment.

Item 8. Not Applicable.<PAGE>
