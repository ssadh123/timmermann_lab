Fortune Bancorp to merge

into AmSouth Bank of Florida today

CLEARWATER, FLORIDA, JUNE 23, 1994 --- Fortune Bank will merge into AmSouth
Bank of Florida at the close of business today. At that time hundreds of
Fortune and AmSouth employees will begin the process of converting Fortune's
offices in eight counties into full-service AmSouth offices.

Former Fortune offices will open as AmSouth banks on Friday, however the
conversion process will continue over the weekend. By Monday morning, the
conversion of Fortune customer accounts into corresponding AmSouth accounts will
be completed, and AmSouth's extensive product portfolio will be available at
former Fortune offices.

"We are delighted to welcome our Fortune Bank customers, employees and
shareholders into the AmSouth family," E. W. Stephenson, Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer of AmSouth Bank of Florida, said.

Roy J. McCraw, Jr., president of Fortune Bank, will serve as AmSouth's
senior executive for the West Coast area after the merger.

"We have worked to make the transition to AmSouth services as smooth as
possible for our customers, and now look forward to providing them with more
services and greater convenience than ever before," McCraw said.

Fortune Bank has 46 offices. Due to the proximity of some of these offices
with existing AmSouth offices, 18 Fortune or AmSouth offices will be
consolidated July 21. After these consolidations, customers will be able to
access their accounts at 69 AmSouth branch locations in the west coast area.
Statewide, customers will be able to bank at over 130 branch locations and will
have access to over 270 AmSouth ATMs in four southern states.

After the merger of Fortune Bank, which has assets of $2.7 billion, AmSouth
Bancorporation's assets will total approximately $17 billion, and AmSouth Bank
of Florida's assets will be approximately $6.5 billion.

Bank of Tennessee with 21 offices, and AmSouth Bank of Georgia with six offices.
