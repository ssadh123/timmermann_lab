ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On December 5, 1994, California Energy Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Registrant"), CE Acquisition Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant (the
"Purchaser"), and Magma Power Company, a Nevada corporation ("Magma"),
executed an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 5, 1994 (the
"Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Purchaser has commenced the Offer
(as defined below) and, as soon as practicable after consummation of the
Offer, will merge with and into Magma (the "Merger"). Magma will survive the
Merger and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on December 9, 1994, the Registrant and
the Purchaser commenced a tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase 12,400,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Magma (the "Shares"),
for $39.00 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon.
The 12,400,000 Shares sought pursuant to the Offer constitute approximately
51% of the Shares on a fully diluted basis. The Offer will expire at 12:00
midnight, New York City time, on Monday, January 9, 1995, unless the Offer is
extended.

Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, each outstanding Share (other than
Shares held by the Registrant and the Purchaser) will be converted in the
Merger into the right to receive, at the option of the Registrant, (i) the
All Cash Component Amount (as defined below), net in cash, without interest
thereon, or (ii) both (A) the Mixed Cash Component Amount (as defined below),
net in cash, without interest thereon, and (B) the number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.0675 per share, of the
Registrant (the "Registrant Common Stock") equal to the quotient of (I)
$39.00 less (II) the Mixed Cash Component Amount divided by the Average
Closing Price (as defined below) (the All Cash Component Amount or (ii)(A)
and (ii)(B), collectively, as applicable, being the "Merger Consideration").
The "Mixed Cash Component Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the quotient
of (A) (x) $28.50 multiplied by the number of Shares outstanding at the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) less (y) $39.00
multiplied by the number of Shares owned by Registrant and any of its
affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the number
of Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by the
Registrant and any of its affiliates). The "All Cash Component Amount" shall
mean an amount equal to the quotient of (A)(x) $38.75 multiplied by the
number of Shares outstanding at the Effective Time less (y) $39.00 multiplied
by the number of Shares owned by the Registrant and any of its affiliates
immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the number of Shares
outstanding at the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by the Registrant
and any of its affiliates). The "Average Closing Price" shall mean the
average closing price of Registrant Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange during the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth business
day prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that if such average
closing price exceeds $18.73, the Average Closing Price shall be $18.73, and
if such average closing price is less than $14.27, the Average Closing Price
shall be $14.27 (such proviso being the "Collar Provision").

The foregoing formula for determining the consideration to be paid in the
Merger was determined so that (i) if CECI determines to pay the Merger
Consideration with a combination of cash and CECI Common Stock, the
consideration paid by CECI in the Offer and the Merger would consist, on a
blended basis, of $28.50 per Share in cash and $10.50 per Share in market
value of CECI Common Stock, based on the Average Closing Price and subject to
the Collar Provision, and (ii) if CECI determines to pay only cash
consideration in the Merger, the blended consideration paid by CECI in the
Offer and the Merger would be $38.75 per Share. The consideration to be paid
in the Offer and the Merger, including the terms of the Collar Provision, was
negotiated on an arms' length basis between CECI and the Company. The purpose
of the Collar Provision is to limit the number of shares of CECI Common Stock
required to be issued in the Merger if the Average Closing Price is less than
$14.27 and to establish a minimum number of shares of CECI Common Stock
required to be issued in the Merger if the Average Closing Price exceeds
$18.73.

The Purchaser estimates that the total amount of funds required to
purchase all Shares sought pursuant to the Offer will be approximately $483.6
million. The Purchaser estimates that approximately an additional $212.5
million will be required to effectuate the Merger or, if CECI elects to pay
only cash consideration in the Merger, approximately an additional $463
million will be required.

THE HOLDERS OF SHARES RECEIVING SUCH CONSIDERATION (OTHER THAN CECI AND ITS
AFFILIATES).

The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (1) there being validly
tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the Offer that number of
Shares which, together with Shares beneficially owned by the Purchaser,
represents at least a majority of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted
basis (such condition being referred to as the "Minimum Tender Condition"),
and (2) the Purchaser being satisfied that it has obtained financing
sufficient to enable it to consummate the Offer (such condition being
referred to as the "Financing Condition"). See Section 12.

CECI, the Purchaser and the Company have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of December 5, 1994 (the "Merger Agreement"),
providing for, among other things, the Offer and the Merger. Pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, the Purchaser will, as soon as practicable following
consummation of the Offer, consummate a merger (the "Merger") with the
Company. In the Merger, each outstanding Share (other than Shares held by
CECI, the Purchaser or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of CECI,
Shares held in the treasury of the Company and Shares held by stockholders
who properly exercise dissenters' rights under the Nevada General Corporation
Law (the "NGCL")) will be converted into the right to receive, at CECI's
option, either (i) the All Cash Component Amount (as defined below), net in
cash, without interest thereon, or (ii) both (A) the Mixed Cash Component
Amount (as defined below), net in cash, without interest thereon, and (B) the
number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value
$0.0675 per share, of CECI ("CECI Common Stock") equal to the quotient of (I)
$39.00 less (II) the Mixed Cash Component Amount divided by the Average
Closing Price (as defined below) (the All Cash Component Amount or (ii)(A)
and (ii)(B), collectively, as applicable, being the "Merger Consideration").
The "Mixed Cash Component Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the quotient
of (A) (x) $28.50 multiplied by the number of Shares outstanding at the
Effective Time (as defined below) less (y) $39.00 multiplied by the number of
Shares owned by CECI and any of its affiliates immediately prior to the
Effective Time, divided by (B) the number of Shares outstanding at the
Effective Time (other than Shares owned by CECI and any of its affiliates).
The "All Cash Component Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the quotient of
(A) (x) $38.75 multiplied by the number of Shares outstanding at the
Effective Time less (y) $39.00 multiplied by the number of Shares owned by
CECI and any of its affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time,
divided by (B) the number of Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (other
than Shares owned by CECI and any of its affiliates). The "Average Closing
Price" shall mean the average closing price of CECI Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") during the 15 consecutive trading days
ending on the fifth

1

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

business day prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that if such
average closing price exceeds $18.73, the Average Closing Price shall be
$18.73, and if such average closing price is less than $14.27, the Average
Closing Price shall be $14.27 (such proviso being referred to herein as the
"Collar Provision").

The foregoing formula for determining the consideration to be paid in the
Merger was determined so that (i) if CECI determines to pay the Merger
Consideration with a combination of cash and CECI Common Stock, the
consideration paid by CECI in the Offer and the Merger would consist, on a
blended basis, of $28.50 per Share in cash and $10.50 per Share in market
value of CECI Common Stock, based on the Average Closing Price and subject to
the Collar Provision, and (ii) if CECI determines to pay only cash
consideration in the Merger, the blended consideration paid by CECI in the
Offer and the Merger would be $38.75 per Share. The consideration to be paid
in the Offer and the Merger, including the terms of the Collar Provision, was
negotiated on an arms' length basis between CECI and the Company. The purpose
of the Collar Provision is to limit the number of shares of CECI Common Stock
required to be issued in the Merger if the Average Closing Price is less than
$14.27 and to establish a minimum number of shares of CECI Common Stock
required to be issued in the Merger if the Average Closing Price exceeds
$18.73.

The Purchaser estimates that the total amount of funds required to
purchase all Shares sought pursuant to the Offer will be approximately $483.6
million. The Purchaser estimates that approximately an additional $212.5
million will be required to effectuate the Merger or, if CECI elects to pay
only cash consideration in the Merger, approximately an additional $463
million will be required. The Purchaser will obtain such funds through
borrowings from commercial banks and other financial institutions; through a
capital contribution by CECI from CECI's general corporate funds, which at
September 30, 1994 aggregated $316.3 million; and, if the Purchaser elects to
pay only cash consideration in the Merger, through a public offering or
private placement of CECI Common Stock or other equity securities of CECI. It
is CECI's current intention to pay the Merger Consideration solely in cash,
although such intention is subject to change based on market conditions and
other factors. The Purchaser anticipates that approximately one-half of the
cash required to purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger will be
provided through a secured bank credit facility on terms and conditions to be
determined. See Section 13.

Certain other conditions to consummation of the Offer are described in
Section 12. The Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any one or
more of the conditions to the Offer. See Section 12.

THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN IMPORTANT
INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE WITH
RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

THE TENDER OFFER

1. TERMS OF THE OFFER; EXPIRATION DATE; PRORATION. On December 5, 1994,
CECI, the Purchaser and the Company announced that they had signed the Merger
Agreement and that the Purchaser would commence the Offer. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if the Offer is extended
or amended, the terms and conditions of any extension or amendment), the
Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for an aggregate of 12,400,000
Shares (or such greater number of Shares as the Purchaser may elect to accept
for payment and pay for pursuant to the Offer) tendered on or before the
Expiration Date (as defined below) and not theretofore withdrawn in
accordance with Section 3. The term "Expiration Date" means 12:00 Midnight,
New York City time, on Monday, January 9, 1995, unless and until the
Purchaser, in its sole discretion, shall have extended the period of time for
which the Offer is open, in which event the term "Expiration Date" shall mean
the latest time and date at which the Offer, as so extended by the Purchaser,
shall expire. For purposes of the Offer, a "business day" means any day other
than a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday and consists of the time period
from 12:01 A.M. through 12:00 Midnight, New York City time. Pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, the Purchaser is required to use its best efforts to
consummate the Offer as promptly as practicable and, if the Expiration Date
is extended beyond February 28, 1995, the Company has the right to terminate
the Merger Agreement and, pursuant to the Standstill Agreement (as defined
below), to require the Purchaser to terminate the Offer and refrain from
purchasing Shares for a period of three years. See Section 11.

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

Consummation of the Offer is conditioned upon, among other things,
satisfaction of the Minimum Tender Condition and the Financing Condition. If
any or all of such conditions or any or all of the other conditions set forth
in Section 12 are not satisfied on or prior to the Expiration Date, the
Purchaser may elect to (i) extend the Offer and retain all tendered Shares
until the expiration of the Offer, as extended, subject to the terms of the
Offer (including any rights of the stockholders to withdraw their Shares),
(ii) terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any Shares and return all
tendered Shares to tendering stockholders or (iii) waive any or all other
conditions and, subject to complying with applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), accept for payment
all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn.

If more than 12,400,000 Shares shall be properly tendered on or prior to
the Expiration Date and not withdrawn, and the acquisition of such number of
Shares satisfies the Minimum Tender Condition, the Purchaser will, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, purchase 12,400,000 Shares
on a pro rata basis (with adjustments to avoid purchases of fractional
Shares) based upon the number of Shares properly tendered on or prior to the
Expiration Date and not withdrawn. If exactly 12,400,000 Shares are properly
tendered on or prior to the Expiration Date and not withdrawn, and the
acquisition of such number of Shares satisfies the Minimum Tender Condition,
the Purchaser will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer, accept for payment and purchase all such Shares so tendered. If fewer
than 12,400,000 Shares shall have been properly tendered on or prior to the
Expiration Date and not withdrawn and the number of Shares so tendered and
not withdrawn shall not have satisfied the Minimum Tender Condition, the
Purchaser may (i) terminate the Offer and return all tendered Shares to
tendering shareholders, (ii) extend the Offer and retain all such Shares
until the expiration of the Offer, as extended, subject to the terms of the
Offer (including any rights of stockholders to withdraw their Shares), or
(iii) waive the Minimum Tender Condition and purchase all properly tendered
Shares. See Section 12.

Due to the difficulty of determining the precise number of Shares properly
tendered and not withdrawn, if proration is required the Purchaser does not
expect to announce the final results of proration or pay for any Shares until
at least seven Nasdaq National Market ("NNM") trading days after the
Expiration Date. Preliminary results of proration will be announced by press
release as promptly as practicable after the Expiration Date. Holders of
Shares may obtain such preliminary information when it becomes available from
the Information Agent and may be able to obtain such information from their
brokers.

The Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole judgment, at any
time or from time to time, and regardless of whether any of the events set
forth in Section 12 shall have occurred or shall have been determined by the
Purchaser to have occurred, (i) to extend the period of time during which the
Offer is open and thereby delay acceptance for payment of, and the payment
for, any Shares, by giving oral or written notice of such extension to the
Depositary and (ii) to amend the Offer in any respect (but only, in the case
of an amendment that decreases the consideration to be paid in the Offer or
imposes additional conditions from those set forth in Section 12, with the
consent of the Company) by giving oral or written notice of such amendment to
the Depositary. The rights reserved by the Purchaser in this paragraph are in
addition to the Purchaser's rights to terminate the Offer pursuant to Section
12. Any such extension, amendment or termination will be followed as promptly
as practicable by public announcement thereof, such announcement in the case
of an extension to be issued not later than 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on
the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date. The
manner in which the Purchaser will make such public announcement may, if
appropriate, be limited to a release to the Dow Jones News Service. The
reservation by the Purchaser of the right to delay acceptance for payment of
or payment for any Shares is subject to the provisions of applicable law,
which require that the Purchaser pay the consideration offered or return the
Shares deposited by or on behalf of stockholders promptly after termination
or withdrawal of the Offer.

If the Purchaser decides to increase or decrease the consideration to be
paid in the Offer, or to increase or decrease the number of Shares being
sought (other than an increase in the number of Shares being sought that does
not exceed 2% of the number of Shares outstanding), and if at the time that
notice of such increase or decrease is first published, sent or given to
holders of Shares in the manner specified

3

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

above, the Offer is scheduled to expire at any time earlier than the
expiration of a period ending on the tenth business day from, and including,
the date that such notice is first so published, sent or given, the Offer
will be extended until the expiration of such period of ten business days. If
the Purchaser waives any material condition to the Offer (including the
Minimum Tender Condition), or amends the Offer in any other material respect,
the Purchaser will extend the Offer and disseminate additional tender offer
materials to the extent required to comply with the Commission's
interpretation of Rules 14d-4(c) and 14d-6(d) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The minimum period during which
an offer must remain open following material changes in the terms of the
offer or information concerning the offer, other than a change in price or a
change in percentage of securities sought, will depend upon the facts and
circumstances, including the relative materiality of the change in terms or
information.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will promptly furnish CECI
and the Purchaser with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of
all record holders of Shares and security position listings of Shares held in
stock depositories, each as of a recent date, and will promptly furnish CECI
and the Purchaser with such additional information, including updated lists
of stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such
other information and assistance as CECI and the Purchaser and their agents
may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the
record and beneficial holders of Shares.

2. ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if the Offer is extended
or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or amendment), the
Purchaser will accept for payment, and will pay for, Shares validly tendered
before the Expiration Date and not properly withdrawn in accordance with
Section 3 (including Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn during any
extension of the Offer, if the Offer is extended, subject to the terms and
conditions of such extension) as soon as practicable after the Expiration
Date. In addition, the Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole
discretion, to delay the acceptance for payment of or payment for Shares in
order to comply, in whole or in part, with any other applicable law. Any such
delays will be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act (relating to the Purchaser's obligation to pay for or return tendered
Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer).

The per Share consideration paid to any stockholder pursuant to the Offer
will be the highest per Share consideration paid to any other stockholder
pursuant to the Offer. In all cases, payment for Shares accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the
Depositary of (i) certificates for such Shares (or timely confirmation (a
"Book-Entry Confirmation") of the book-entry transfer of such Shares into the
Depositary's account at The Depository Trust Company, Midwest Securities
Trust Company or Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (collectively, the
"Book-Entry Transfer Facilities")), pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 4, (ii) a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal
(or facsimile thereof) with any required signature guarantees, or an Agent's
Message (as defined below) in connection with a book-entry transfer, and
(iii) any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal.

The term "Agent's Message" means a message, transmitted by a Book-Entry
Transfer Facility to, and received by, the Depositary and forming a part of a
Book-Entry Confirmation, which states that such Book-Entry Transfer Facility
has received an express acknowledgment from the participant in such
Book-Entry Transfer Facility tendering the Shares, that such participant has
received and agrees to be bound by the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and
that the Purchaser may enforce such agreement against the participant.

Payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer may be
delayed in the event of proration due to the difficulty of determining the
number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn. See Section 1.

For purposes of the Offer, the Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted
for payment, and thereby purchased, Shares properly tendered to the Purchaser
and not withdrawn, if, as and when the Purchaser gives oral or written notice
to the Depositary of its acceptance for payment of the tenders of such
Shares.

4

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

Payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made by
deposit of the purchase price therefor with the Depositary, which will act as
agent for the tendering stockholders for purposes of receiving payment from
the Purchaser and transmitting payment to tendering stockholders. UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCE WILL THE PURCHASER PAY INTEREST ON THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE
SHARES, REGARDLESS OF ANY DELAY IN MAKING SUCH PAYMENT.

If any tendered Shares are not accepted for payment pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Offer for any reason (including because of proration)
or are not paid for because of invalid tender, or if certificates are
submitted representing more Shares than are tendered, certificates
representing unpurchased or untendered Shares will be returned, without
expense to the tendering stockholder (or, in the case of Shares tendered by
book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's account at a
Book-Entry Transfer Facility as described in Section 4, such Shares will be
credited to an account maintained within such Book-Entry Transfer Facility),
as soon as practicable following the expiration, termination or withdrawal of
the Offer and determination of the final results of proration.

As required by Commission rules, if the Purchaser were to vary the terms
of the Offer by increasing the consideration to be paid per Share, the
Purchaser will pay such increased consideration for all Shares purchased
pursuant to the Offer, whether or not such Shares have been tendered prior to
such increase in consideration.

The Purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or from
time to time in part, to one or more direct or indirect subsidiaries of CECI,
the right to purchase all or any portion of the Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve the Purchaser
of its obligations under the Offer and will in no way prejudice the rights of
tendering stockholders to receive payment for Shares validly tendered and
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer.

3. WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3,
tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable. Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn at any time before the Expiration Date
and, unless theretofore accepted for payment by the Purchaser as provided
herein, may also be withdrawn at any time after February 6, 1995.

If, for any reason whatsoever, acceptance for payment of any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer is delayed, or if the Purchaser is unable to
accept for payment or pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, then,
without prejudice to the Purchaser's rights set forth herein, the Depositary
may, nevertheless, on behalf of the Purchaser, retain tendered Shares, and
such Shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent that the tendering
stockholder is entitled to and duly exercises withdrawal rights as described
in this Section 3. Any such delay will be accompanied by an extension of the
Offer to the extent required by law.

In order for a withdrawal to be effective, a written, telegraphic or
facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the
Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer
to Purchase. Any notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the person
having tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be
withdrawn and, if certificates for Shares have been tendered, the name of the
registered holder of Shares as set forth in the tendered certificate, if
different from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If certificates
for Shares ("Certificates") have been delivered or otherwise identified to
the Depositary, then, before the physical release of such Certificates, the
serial numbers shown on such Certificates must be submitted to the Depositary
and the signatures on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by a firm
which is a bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association or other
entity which is a member in good standing of the Securities Transfer Agent's
Medallion Program (collectively, "Eligible Institutions"), unless such Shares
have been tendered for the account of an Eligible Institution. If Shares have
been delivered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry delivery as set
forth in Section 4, any notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and
the number of the account at the appropriate Book-Entry Transfer Facility to
be credited with the withdrawn Shares and otherwise comply with such
Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures. Withdrawal of tenders of Shares
may not be rescinded, and any Shares properly withdrawn will be deemed not to
be validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. Withdrawn Shares may, however,
be retendered by repeating one of the procedures described in Section 4 at
any time before the Expiration Date.

5

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of
any notice of withdrawal will be determined by the Purchaser, in its sole
discretion, whose determination shall be final and binding. None of the
Purchaser, CECI, the Dealer Manager, the Depositary, the Information Agent or
any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects
or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or will incur any liability for
failure to give any such notification.

4. PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING SHARES. To tender Shares validly pursuant to
the Offer, a stockholder must cause a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), with any required signature
guarantees, or an Agent's Message in connection with a book-entry delivery of
Shares, and any other required documents, to be received by the Depositary at
one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase
and must either cause certificates for tendered Shares to be received by the
Depositary at one of such addresses or cause such Shares to be delivered
pursuant to the procedures for book-entry delivery set forth below (and a
Book-Entry Confirmation to be received by the Depositary), in each case
before the Expiration Date, or (in lieu of the foregoing) such stockholder
must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedure set forth below.

The Depositary will establish accounts with respect to the Shares at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facilities for purposes of the Offer within two business
days after the date of this Offer to Purchase. Any financial institution that
is a participant in any of the Book-Entry Transfer Facilities' systems may
make book-entry delivery of the Shares by causing such Book-Entry Transfer
Facility to transfer such Shares into the Depositary's account in accordance
with such Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedure for such transfer.
However, although delivery of Shares may be effected through book-entry
transfer into the Depositary's account at a Book-Entry Transfer Facility, the
Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly
executed, with any required signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message in
connection with a book-entry delivery of Shares, and any other required
documents, must, in any case, be transmitted to and received by the
Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer
to Purchase before the Expiration Date, or the tendering stockholder must
comply with the guaranteed delivery procedure described below.

DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH
SUCH BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY'S PROCEDURES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE DELIVERY
TO THE DEPOSITARY.

Signatures on all Letters of Transmittal must be guaranteed by an Eligible
Institution, except in cases where Shares are tendered (i) by registered
holders of Shares (which term includes any participant in a Book-Entry
Transfer Facility whose name appears on a security position listing as the
owner of the Shares) who has not completed either the box entitled "Special
Payment Instructions" or the box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions" on
the Letter of Transmittal or (ii) for the account of an Eligible Institution.
See Instruction 1 of the Letter of Transmittal. If the Certificates are
registered in the name of a person other than the signer of the Letter of
Transmittal, or if payment is to be made to a person other than the
registered owner of the Certificates surrendered, then the Certificates must
be endorsed or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, in either case
signed exactly as the name or names of the registered owner or owners appear
on the Certificates, with the signature(s) on the Certificates or stock
powers guaranteed as aforesaid. See Instruction 5 of the Letter of
Transmittal.

THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARES, THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND ANY OTHER
REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER
FACILITY, IS AT THE OPTION AND RISK OF THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDER, AND
DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY.
IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED,
PROPERLY INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

UNLESS AN EXEMPTION APPLIES UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW AND REGULATIONS
CONCERNING "BACKUP WITHHOLDING" OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX, THE DEPOSITARY WILL BE
REQUIRED TO WITHHOLD, AND WILL WITHHOLD, 31% OF THE GROSS PROCEEDS OTHERWISE
PAYABLE TO A STOCKHOLDER OR OTHER PAYEE WITH RESPECT TO SHARES PURCHASED
PURSUANT TO THE OFFER IF THE STOCKHOLDER DOES NOT PROVIDE HIS TAXPAYER
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION
NUMBER) AND CERTIFY THAT SUCH NUMBER IS CORRECT. EACH TENDERING STOCKHOLDER
SHOULD COMPLETE AND SIGN THE MAIN SIGNATURE FORM AND THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9
INCLUDED AS PART OF THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, SO AS TO PROVIDE THE
INFORMATION AND CERTIFICATION NECESSARY TO AVOID BACKUP WITHHOLDING, UNLESS
AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION EXISTS AND IS PROVED IN A MANNER SATISFACTORY TO THE
PURCHASER AND THE DEPOSITARY.

<PAGE>

If a stockholder desires to tender Shares pursuant to the Offer and such
stockholder's Certificates are not immediately available or such stockholder
cannot deliver the Certificates and all other required documents to the
Depositary before the Expiration Date, such Shares may nevertheless be
tendered, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) such tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution; and

(b) a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery, substantially in the form provided by the Purchaser, is received
by the Depositary, as provided below, on or before the Expiration Date;
and

(c) the certificates for all tendered Shares, in proper form for
transfer (or a Book-Entry Confirmation), together with a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof)
with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry
transfer, an Agent's Message) and all other documents required by the
Letter of Transmittal are received by the Depositary within six NNM
trading days after the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery to the Depositary.

The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand or transmitted
by telegram, facsimile transmission or mail to the Depositary and must
include a guarantee by an Eligible Institution in the form set forth in the
Notice of Guaranteed Delivery.

In all cases, payment for Shares tendered and accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the
Depositary of (i) Certificates, or a Book-Entry Confirmation of such Shares,
(ii) a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or
facsimile thereof) (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's
Message) and (iii) any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal.
Accordingly, payment might not be made to all tendering stockholders at the
same time, and will depend upon when Certificates or Book-Entry Confirmations
of such Shares are received by the Depositary.

By executing a Letter of Transmittal as set forth above, the tendering
stockholder irrevocably appoints designees of the Purchaser, and each of
them, as his attorneys-in-fact and proxies, in the manner set forth in the
Letter of Transmittal, each with full power of substitution, to the full
extent of such stockholder's rights with respect to the Shares tendered by
such stockholder and accepted for payment by the Purchaser and with respect
to any and all other Shares or other securities issued or issuable in respect
of such Shares on or after the date of this Offer to Purchase. All such
powers of attorney and proxies shall be considered irrevocable and coupled
with an interest in the tendered Shares. Such appointment will be effective
when, and only to the extent that, the Purchaser accepts such Shares for
payment. Upon such appointment, all prior proxies given by such stockholder
will be revoked, and no subsequent proxies may be given by such stockholder
(and if given, will not be deemed effective). The Purchaser's designees will
be empowered, among other things, to exercise all voting and other rights of
such stockholder as they in their sole discretion may deem proper at any
annual, special or adjourned meeting of the stockholders of the Company or
any consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise. The Purchaser reserves
the right to require that, in order for the Shares to be deemed validly
tendered, immediately upon the Purchaser's acceptance for payment of such
Shares, the Purchaser must be able to exercise full voting and other rights
of a record and beneficial holder with respect thereto.

All questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of
receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender of Shares will be
determined by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, whose determination
shall be final and binding. The Purchaser reserves the absolute right to
reject any and all tenders determined by it not to be in proper form or the
acceptance for payment of which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be
unlawful. The Purchaser also reserves the absolute right to waive any of the
conditions of the Offer or any defect or irregularity in the tender of any
Shares of any particular stockholder whether or not similar defects or
irregularities are waived in the case of other stockholders. None of the
Purchaser, CECI, the Depositary, the Dealer Manager, the Information Agent or
any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects
or irregularities in tenders or shall incur any liability for failure to give
any such notification. The Purchaser's interpretation of the terms and
conditions of the Offer (including the Letter of Transmittal and of the
instructions thereto) will be final and binding.

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

The valid tender of Shares pursuant to one of the procedures described
above will constitute the tendering stockholder's acceptance of the terms and
conditions of the Offer. The Purchaser's acceptance for payment of Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer will constitute a binding agreement between
the tendering stockholder and the Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer.

5. CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES. The following summary is a
general discussion of the material federal income tax consequences to
stockholders of the Company who tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer.
The discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), applicable Treasury regulations thereunder, administrative
procedures, rulings and decisions in effect on the date hereof, all of which
are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) by legislation,
administrative action or judicial decision. No ruling has or will be
requested from the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") regarding the
anticipated tax consequences described herein. The discussion set forth below
does not discuss all aspects of federal income taxation that may be relevant
to a particular stockholder in light of his personal investment circumstances
or to certain types of stockholders subject to special treatment under the
federal income tax laws (for example, tax-exempt organizations, foreign
corporations and individuals who have received Shares as compensation or who
are not citizens or residents of the United States) and does not discuss any
aspect of state, local or foreign taxation. The discussion is limited to
those stockholders who hold the Shares as capital assets (generally, property
held for investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.
STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR INDIVIDUAL TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE
SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE
APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

Exchange of Shares for Cash. The exchange of Shares by tendering
stockholders will be a taxable event for federal income tax purposes, and may
also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign tax
laws. A tendering stockholder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to
the difference between the amount of cash received by the stockholder
pursuant to the Offer and the aggregate tax basis in the Shares tendered by
the stockholder and purchased pursuant to the Offer. Gain or loss will be
calculated separately for each block of Shares tendered by the stockholder
and purchased pursuant to the Offer.

Gain or loss recognized by a tendering stockholder will be capital gain or
loss if the Shares at the Expiration Date are held as capital assets. Such
capital gain or loss will be classified as a long-term capital gain or loss
to the extent that the tendered Shares have a holding period of more than one
year at the time of their purchase pursuant to the Offer. Long-term capital
gains recognized by a tendering individual stockholder will be subject to tax
at a maximum marginal federal rate of 28%. Short-term capital gains
recognized by a tendering individual stockholder will be subject to tax at a
maximum marginal federal rate of 39.6%. Net capital gains recognized by a
tendering corporate stockholder will be subject to tax at a maximum marginal
federal rate of 35%.

Tax Effects of the Merger. As described in Section 11 of this Offer to
Purchase, each outstanding Share (other than Shares held by CECI, the
Purchaser or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of CECI, Shares held in
the treasury of the Company and Shares held by stockholders who properly
exercise dissenters' rights under the NGCL) will be converted in the Merger
into the right to receive, at the option of CECI, either (i) a combination of
cash and CECI Common Stock (the "Mixed Cash Option") such that the
consideration paid by CECI in the Offer and the Merger would consist, on a
blended basis, of $28.50 per Share in cash and $10.50 per Share in market
value of CECI Common Stock, based on the Average Closing Price and subject to
the Collar Provision, or (ii) cash (the "All Cash Option") such that the
blended consideration paid by CECI in the Offer and the Merger would be
$38.75 per Share. See Section 11. The Merger will be a taxable transaction
for federal income tax purposes. If the All Cash Option is selected by CECI,
a stockholder exchanging Shares for cash pursuant to the Merger will
recognize gain or loss in the Merger equal to the difference between the
amount of cash received by the stockholder in the Merger and the aggregate
tax basis in the Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss will
be calculated separately for each block of Shares exchanged. If the Mixed
Cash Option is selected by CECI, a stockholder exchanging Shares for cash and
CECI Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in the
Merger equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the cash and the fair
market value of the CECI Common Stock received in the Merger and (ii) the
holders' adjusted tax basis

8

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

for the Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger. As with the All Cash Option,
gain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of Shares
exchanged. A holder's tax basis in the CECI Common Stock received pursuant to
the Merger will equal the fair market value of such CECI Common Stock as of
the Effective Time, and the holder's holding period for such CECI Common
Stock will commence as of the Effective Time. For tax purposes, the fair
market value of the CECI Common Stock will be determined as of the Effective
Time and, whether or not the Collar Provision is applicable, may differ from
the Average Closing Price used for purposes of determining the number of
Shares to be issued in the Merger.

Backup Withholding. To prevent "backup withholding" of federal income tax
on payments of cash to a stockholder of the Company who exchanges Shares for
cash in the Offer, a stockholder of the Company must, unless an exception
applies under the applicable law and regulations, provide the payor of such
cash with such stockholder's correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN")
on a Substitute Form W-9 and certify under penalties of perjury that such
number is correct and that such stockholder is not subject to backup
withholding. A Substitute Form W-9 is included in the Letter of Transmittal.
If the correct TIN and certifications are not provided, a $50 penalty may be
imposed on a stockholder of the Company by the Service, and cash received by
such stockholder in exchange for Shares in the Offer may be subject to backup
withholding at the rate of 31%. Amounts paid as backup withholding do not
constitute an additional tax and would be allowable as a credit against the
stockholder's federal income tax liability.

6. PRICE RANGE OF SHARES; DIVIDENDS. The Shares are quoted on the NNM. The
following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the reported high and
low sales prices per Share, and the amount of cash dividends paid per Share
for each such period. The information for the fiscal years ended December 31,
1991, 1992 and 1993 is derived from the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1992 and 1993. The information for
subsequent periods is derived from information reported in published
financial sources.

On December 2, 1994, the last full trading day prior to CECI's issuance of
the press release announcing its intention to commence the Offer, the
reported closing sale price per Share on the NNM was $35.50. On September 19,
1994, the day of CECI's issuance of its press release announcing the

9

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

transmission of a letter to the Company containing a proposal to acquire the
Company in a transaction in which stockholders would receive cash and shares
of CECI Common Stock having a combined cash and market value of $35 per
Share, the reported closing sale price per Share on the NNM was $27.50. The
Offer represents a 42% premium over the reported closing sale price per Share
on September 19, 1994. STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO OBTAIN A CURRENT MARKET
QUOTATION FOR THE SHARES.

7. EFFECT OF THE OFFER ON THE MARKET FOR THE SHARES AND EXCHANGE ACT
REGISTRATION. The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer will reduce the
number of Shares that might otherwise trade publicly and may reduce the
number of holders of Shares, which could adversely affect the liquidity and
market value of the remaining Shares held by the public.

After consummation of the Offer, the Shares may no longer meet the
requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the
"NASD") for continued inclusion on NNM, which require that an issuer have at
least 200,000 held shares, held by at least 400 stockholders or 300
stockholders of round lots, with a market value of $1 million and have net
tangible assets of at least either $2 million or $4 million, depending on
profitability levels during the issuer's four most recent fiscal years. If
NNM were to cease to publish quotations for the Shares, it is possible that
the Shares would continue to trade in the over-the-counter market and that
price or other quotations would be reported by other sources. The extent of
the public market for the Shares and the availability of such quotations
would depend, however, upon such factors as the number of stockholders and/or
the aggregate market value of such securities remaining at such time, the
interest in maintaining a market in the Shares on the part of securities
firms, the possible termination of registration under the Exchange Act as
described below, and other factors. The Purchaser cannot predict whether the
reduction in the number of Shares that might otherwise trade publicly would
have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or
marketability of, the Shares or whether it would cause future market prices
to be greater or lesser than the Offer price.

The Shares are currently "margin securities" under the rules of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"),
which has the effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend
credit on the collateral of such securities for the purpose of buying,
carrying, or trading in securities ("purpose loans"). Depending upon factors
similar to those described above regarding NNM quotations, the securities
might no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the
Federal Reserve Board's margin regulations and therefore could no longer be
used as collateral for purpose loans made by brokers. In addition, if
registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act were terminated, the Shares
would no longer constitute "margin securities."

The Shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act. Such
registration may be terminated upon application of the Company to the
Commission if the outstanding Shares are not listed on a national securities
exchange and there are fewer than 300 holders of record of the Shares. The
termination of the registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act would
substantially reduce the information required to be furnished by the Company
to holders of the Shares and would make certain of the provisions of the
Exchange Act, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section
16(b), the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement in connection with
stockholders' meetings and the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange
Act with respect to "going private" transactions, no longer applicable to the
Shares. Furthermore, "affiliates" of the Company and persons holding
"restricted securities" of the Company may be deprived of the ability to
dispose of the securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. If registration of the securities under the Exchange Act
were terminated, the securities would no longer be "margin securities" or
eligible for NNM reporting. The Purchaser intends to seek to cause the
Company to terminate the registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as
soon as practicable after consummation of the Offer.

8. CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANY. According to the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993 (the
"1993 10-K"), the Company is a Nevada corporation with its principal

or, to the best knowledge of the Purchaser, any of the persons listed in

10. BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER; CONTACTS WITH THE COMPANY. In May 1991,
representatives of CECI and the Company entered into discussions and meetings
to explore the possibility of combining the companies, and the two companies
exchanged certain information concerning their respective businesses

13

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

for the purpose of considering such a business combination or other
acquisition transaction. At the end of May 1991, the discussions were
terminated as a result of the inability of the parties to reach agreement
concerning price and certain other terms.

In August 1991, the Company's representatives contacted CECI for the
purpose of again exploring the possibility of combining the companies. In
September 1991, a number of conversations between CECI's and the Company's
representatives were held regarding a possible merger of the Company with and
into CECI. Based upon those conversations, on September 26, 1991, after
receiving the approval of CECI's Executive Committee, CECI transmitted a
proposed letter of intent to the Company. The proposed letter of intent
contemplated a consensual merger of the Company with and into CECI. Pursuant
to the proposed merger, each outstanding Share would have been exchanged for
approximately two shares of CECI Common Stock in a transaction accounted for
on a pooling of interests basis. Such a transaction would have represented a
value of $30.25 for each Share (approximately a 20% premium to the
then-prevailing market price) based upon the then current market values of
the respective companies' common stocks.

Upon its receipt of the proposed letter of intent, the Company indicated
to CECI that the proposal would be considered and, after certain discussions
by representatives of the parties in the intervening days, on October 2,
1991, the Company advised CECI that the Company's Board had considered CECI's
proposal and that the Company had no interest in pursuing the proposed
pooling of interests combination transaction.

In August 1993, David L. Sokol, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
President of CECI, contacted Paul M. Pankratz, then Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company in order to propose a meeting to discuss
various matters of mutual interest. At a meeting in San Diego in September
1993, Mr. Sokol and Steven A. McArthur, Senior Vice President, General
Counsel and Secretary of CECI, and Mr. Pankratz, Ralph W. Boeker, President
of the Company, and Jon R. Peele, Executive Vice President and General
Counsel of the Company, discussed principally the possibility of joint
venturing or other cooperation in respect of certain pending power
development projects in the Philippines and the possible sharing of legal
costs and information in respect of certain domestic regulatory proceedings
in which the companies had a common interest. During the course of those
discussions, Mr. Sokol suggested to the Company's management that such
potential cost savings were illustrative of certain of the synergies that a
combination of the companies could achieve. However, no agreements or
understandings were reached between CECI and the Company as a result of these
discussions. In addition, at that meeting CECI suggested to the Company that
it consider utilizing PKS as the Company's general contractor in respect of
the Company's pending projects in the Philippines. The Company's management
agreed to meet with PKS regarding its possible role as a contractor in the
Philippines. The meeting between the Company and PKS was held in the fall of
1993, but no agreements or understandings were reached with PKS and no
further discussions were held in respect of such matters.

In January 1994, Mr. Sokol again contacted Mr. Pankratz by telephone in an
effort to resume the foregoing discussions and, at Mr. Pankratz's suggestion,
Mr. Sokol was asked to contact Mr. Boeker, the President and recently
appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company, to discuss these matters
further. In an April 1994 telephone conversation between Mr. Sokol and Mr.
Boeker, the possibility of cooperation with respect to international joint
ventures between the companies and other possible synergies between the
companies were again generally discussed, but no agreements or understandings
were reached. At Mr. Boeker's suggestion, it was tentatively agreed that they
would resume their discussions in July 1994.

On or about June 20, 1994, Mr. Sokol contacted Mr. Boeker and proposed a
meeting between members of management of the two companies to discuss the
possible combination of CECI and the Company.

On August 9, 1994, Mr. Sokol was advised that Mr. Boeker had declined a
scheduled August 11 meeting, and that the Company's decision to cancel was
principally due to the desire of the Company's management to dedicate their
full attention to the pending financing of the Company's Malitbog project in
the Philippines. Accordingly, Mr. Boeker suggested that he would schedule a
meeting with Mr. Sokol toward the end of September 1994, which is when the
Company expected to close the financing.

14

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

On September 15, 1994, Mr. Sokol contacted a member of the Company's
Board, in an effort to determine whether the Company had a serious interest
in discussing a negotiated combination of the companies within a time frame
that would recognize CECI's desire to make certain decisions regarding the
strategic direction it wished to pursue in the changing global marketplace.
The director stated that he was aware of certain of the past discussions
between the companies, but would ask the Company's management to respond
directly to Mr. Sokol's inquiry.

Later that same day, Messrs. Pankratz and Boeker called Mr. Sokol and
advised him that the closing of the financing for the Company's Malitbog
project had been delayed and was expected to occur on or about November 18,
1994 and suggested that they would be available to meet with Mr. Sokol
shortly after the closing of such financing. Mr. Sokol stated that CECI was
considering a number of strategic alternatives, including a possible
combination with the Company, and that CECI's strategic planning had reached
a stage where a prompt decision concerning entering into negotiations
regarding any possible combination with the Company was required. Mr. Sokol
further stated his belief that it was unnecessary to wait until after the
closing of the Malitbog financing because CECI was prepared to negotiate in
good faith on a basis that would value the Company as though such financing
had closed. Messrs. Boeker and Pankratz reiterated that they would agree to
meet only after the Malitbog closing and Mr. Sokol concluded the call by
reiterating CECI's need to act upon certain of its strategic alternatives on
a prompt basis.

On September 19, 1994, Mr. Sokol wrote to Messrs. Pankratz and Boeker
proposing to acquire all outstanding Shares for $35 per Share comprised of
$25.00 in cash and $10.00 in market value of CECI Common Stock. On September
20, 1994, Mr. Pankratz responded that the Company's Board would consider the
proposal and respond after completion of its evaluation.

During the week of September 19, 1994, representatives of CECI contacted
management of The Dow Chemical Company ("Dow"), the beneficial owner of
approximately 21% of the Shares, to determine Dow's reaction to CECI's
proposal of September 19, 1994. The CECI representatives were told Dow was
evaluating the Offer. During the week of September 26, 1994, CECI's financial
representatives contacted management of Dow to inquire as to the
circumstances surrounding a recent sale by Dow of 857,143 Shares for $28.25
per Share and an associated option agreement to acquire such Shares at the
same price, which Dow had reported in filings with the Commission, and in
particular whether any impediments existed to Dow's ability to freely dispose
of such Shares and whether any structural changes to CECI's merger proposal
would be helpful in this regard. Dow reported that it was considering such
issues in the context of CECI's proposal.

On September 28, 1994, after telephone discussions between CECI's
financial advisors and the Company's financial advisors regarding CECI's
request to arrange a meeting between the parties, Messrs. Sokol and McArthur,
together with representatives from CECI's financial advisors, met with
representatives from the Company's financial advisor in order to introduce
CECI and to further elaborate and answer questions with respect to the
details of CECI's proposal. CECI provided the representatives from the
Company's financial advisors with copies of a draft merger agreement for
review by the Company's Board.

On October 3, 1994, the Company's financial advisors informed CECI's
financial advisors that the Company's Board had authorized the Company to
enter into a "poison pill" Rights Plan (the "Rights Agreement") at its Board
meeting which concluded on such date, but that the Company's Board had also
authorized the Company's financial advisors to meet with CECI's financial
advisors as soon as possible and, accordingly, a meeting was scheduled for
the morning of October 4, 1994. CECI subsequently learned through press
reports that the Company had amended its Bylaws to require that stockholder
action occur only at a regular or special meeting of stockholders rather than
by way of a written consent solicitation and that the Company also had filed
a complaint against CECI seeking a declaratory judgment that (i) the
Company's Board had properly discharged its fiduciary duties in adopting the
Rights Agreement and an amendment to the Company's Bylaws and, accordingly,
such agreement and amendment were valid and binding, and (ii) the Merger
Moratorium Statute (as defined below) is valid and not in violation of the
Commerce Clause and Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.

On October 4, 1994, at the meeting between CECI's financial advisors and
the Company's financial advisors, the Company's financial advisors summarized
the actions taken at the Company's Board meeting held on October 2, 1994 and
October 3, 1994, and indicated that although the Company's Board had not
rejected CECI's proposal, the Company's Board would prefer that CECI withdraw
its merger proposal. The Company's financial advisors then indicated that the
Company's Board believed that CECI's proposed price was too low and
referenced the Company's future opportunities but declined to provide any
specific information or financial analysis indicating what price the
Company's Board would consider favorably with respect to a sale of the
Company or as to why CECI's proposed price did not correctly value the
Company's businesses.

In light of the defensive actions taken by the Company, on October 6, 1994
the Purchaser commenced a cash tender offer for 12,400,000 Shares at $35 per
Share (the "Previous Offer").

On October 11, 1994, the Company filed with the Commission a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the "Previous
Schedule 14D-9") pursuant to the Exchange Act, which included the
recommendation of the Company's Board that the Company's stockholders reject
the Previous Offer.

On October 13, 1994, CECI announced the filing of a preliminary proxy
statement with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act in order to
solicit written requests from the Company's stockholders for the call of a
Special Meeting of the Company's stockholders (the "Special Meeting"). The
purpose of the Special Meeting was to provide the Company's stockholders the
opportunity to consider and vote on CECI's proposals which, if approved,
would help facilitate consummation of the Previous Offer.

On October 21, 1994, the Purchaser increased the price per Share to be
paid in the Previous Offer to $38.50 per Share. On October 31, 1994, CECI
learned that the Company's Board had again recommended that its stockholders
reject the Previous Offer.

On November 1, 1994, CECI announced that it had put its best offer on the
table and that it intended to withdraw its acquisition proposal if it had not
signed a merger agreement with the Company or received sufficient written
requests to call the Special Meeting by December 2, 1994. Throughout November
1994, CECI solicited written consents for the call of the Special Meeting,
which solicitation was actively opposed by the Company.

As of the close of business on December 2, 1994, CECI had neither entered
into a merger agreement with the Company nor received sufficient written
requests to call the Special Meeting. Consequently, CECI announced by press
release, and Mr. Sokol placed telephone calls to Messrs. Pankratz and Boeker
and to a representative of Dow to advise them, that CECI had withdrawn its
acquisition proposal and had terminated the Previous Offer. As a result of
these telephone conversations, and follow up telephone conversations among
the parties and their advisors, CECI and the Company arranged to meet the
following day in New York to explore the possibility of a negotiated
acquisition of the Company by CECI.

From December 3, 1994 through the morning of December 5, 1994,
representatives of CECI and the Company, together with their legal and
financial advisors, met to negotiate the terms of a proposed acquisition of
the Company by CECI. The Company's Board met to consider and approve the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby on December 4 and
5, 1994. Following continued negotiations regarding the definitive
agreements, the Merger Agreement was signed on the morning of December 5,
1994.

11. PURPOSE OF THE OFFER; THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

General. The purpose of the Offer is to acquire majority control of the
Company as the first step in the acquisition of the entire equity interest in
the Company. The purpose of the Merger is to acquire all Shares not
beneficially owned by the Purchaser following consummation of the Offer.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CECI, the Purchaser and the Company have
agreed to effectuate the Merger in accordance with the provisions of the
Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable following consummation of the
Offer. Following is a description of the material terms of the Merger
Agreement.

<PAGE>

The Offer and the Merger. The Merger Agreement provides for the making of
the Offer by the Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Offer to Purchase. The Merger Agreement further provides that
as promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
described below (the "Effective Time"), the Purchaser will be merged with and
into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation
following the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). As a result of the
Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of CECI. In
addition, the directors of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective
Time will become the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers of the Company immediately before the Effective Time will be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party to Effect the Merger.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (i)
the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, (ii) approval and adoption of
the Merger and the Merger Agreement by the requisite vote of the Company's
stockholders, (iii) approval of the issuance of CECI Common Stock in order to
effectuate the Merger by the requisite vote of CECI's stockholders, (iv) the
CECI Common Stock issuable to the Company's stockholders in the Merger having
been authorized for listing on the NYSE upon official notice of issuance, (v)
the registration statement to be filed with the Commission by CECI on Form
S-4 under the Securities Act for the purpose of registering the shares of
CECI Common Stock to be issued in the Merger shall have become effective in
accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act and no stop order
suspending such effectiveness shall have been issued by the Commission and
remain in effect, and (vi) that there shall not be in effect (a) any
judgment, decree or order issued by any Federal, state or local court of
competent jurisdiction, or (b) any statute, rule or regulation enacted or
promulgated by any Federal, state, local or legislative, administrative or
regulatory body of competent jurisdiction, that in either of cases (a) or (b)
prohibits the consummation of the Merger or makes such consummation illegal.

The Merger Consideration. In the Merger, each outstanding Share (other
than Shares held by CECI, the Purchaser or any other direct or indirect
subsidiary of CECI, Shares held in the treasury of the Company and Shares
held by stockholders who properly exercise dissenters' rights under the
NGCL), will be converted into the right to receive, at CECI's option, either
(i) the All Cash Component Amount, net in cash, without interest thereon, or
(ii) both (A) the Mixed Cash Component Amount, net in cash, without interest
thereon, and (B) the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of CECI
Common Stock equal to the quotient of (I) $39.00 less (II) the Mixed Cash
Component Amount divided by the Average Closing Price.

The foregoing formula for determining the consideration to be paid in the
Merger was determined so that (i) if CECI determines to pay the Merger
Consideration with a combination of cash and CECI Common Stock, the
consideration paid by CECI in the Offer and the Merger would consist, on a
blended basis, of $28.50 per Share in cash and $10.50 per Share in market
value of CECI Common Stock, based on the Average Closing Price and subject to
the Collar Provision, and (ii) if CECI determines to pay only cash
consideration in the Merger, the blended consideration paid by CECI in the
Offer and the Merger would be $38.75 per Share. The consideration to be paid
in the Offer and the Merger, including the terms of the Collar Provision, was
negotiated on an arms' length basis between CECI and the Company. The purpose
of the Collar Provision is to limit the number of shares of CECI Common Stock
required to be issued in the Merger if the Average Closing Price is less than
$14.27 and to establish a minimum number of shares of CECI Common Stock
required to be issued in the Merger if the Average Closing Price exceeds
$18.73. It is CECI's current intention to pay the Merger Consideration solely
in cash, although such intention is subject to change based on market
conditions and other factors.

Company Stock Options. Each option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company Stock Option Plans (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled by the
Company and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such option shall be
entitled to receive from the Company at the Effective Time, or as soon as
practicable thereafter, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares previously subject to such option and (y) the excess, if
any, of $39.00 or, if CECI has elected the All Cash Component Amount, $38.75,
over the exercise price per Share previously applicable to such option. Each
unvested share of deferred stock

17

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

under the Company's 1994 Equity Participation Plan (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) or as otherwise described in the Company Disclosure Schedule (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a "Deferred Share") shall be cancelled by the Company
and each holder of a cancelled Deferred Share shall be entitled to receive at
the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter from the Company an
amount in cash equal to $39.00 or, if CECI has elected the All Cash Component
Amount, $38.75.

Board Representation. The Merger Agreement provides that, subsequent to
consummation of the Offer, the Purchaser will be entitled to that percentage
of the number of seats on the Company's Board (rounded to the nearest whole
seat) as reflects the percentage of the outstanding Shares then owned by the
Purchaser, but in no event less than a majority of the entire Board of
Directors of the Company (regardless of vacancies). In order to provide the
Purchaser with such representation on the Company's Board, the Company may be
required to increase the size of the Company's Board or to secure the
resignation of one or more directors; provided, however, that such
resignations will not cause the number of Disinterested Directors (as defined
below) to be less than two. If the Purchaser acquires Shares pursuant to the
Offer and determines to obtain majority representation on the Company's
Board, the Company will be required to send to stockholders the information
required by Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act, and CECI and the Purchaser
will be required to furnish to the Company all such information with respect
to itself and its directors, officers and affiliates. Following the election
or appointment of the Purchaser's nominees and prior to the Effective Time,
any amendment of the Merger Agreement or the Company's Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws, any termination of the Merger Agreement by the
Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of CECI or the Purchaser, or waiver of any
of the Company's rights under the Merger Agreement, and any other consent or
action of the Company's Board under the Merger Agreement will require the
concurrence of a majority (which shall be at least two) of the directors of
the Company then in office who are not designees of CECI or the Purchaser
("Disinterested Directors").

CECI has agreed to use its best efforts to nominate and cause up to two
nominees of the Company to be elected or appointed as members of CECI's Board
of Directors.

Other Proposals. The Merger Agreement further provides that neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective directors,
officers, agents, financial advisors or otherwise may, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of
proposals or offers from any person relating to any Competing Transaction (as
defined below), or participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any other person any information (except for information which has been
previously publicly disseminated by the Company in the ordinary course of
business) with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist
or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any
other person to do or seek any of the foregoing. The Company's Board may (i)
review and act upon (which actions may include, without limitation, providing
confidential information, negotiating a transaction and entering into an
agreement for a transaction) an unsolicited proposal by any other person
relating to any of the transactions referred to in the preceding sentence, if
the Company's Board determines in good faith, after consultation with and
based upon the advice of its financial and legal advisors, that failing to
review and act upon such proposal would constitute a breach of fiduciary
duty, and (ii) comply with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
regard to a tender or exchange offer, and such review, conduct or compliance
will not violate the Merger Agreement. "Competing Transaction" shall mean any
of the following involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries: (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or other similar
transaction; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or
other disposition of 50% or more of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of
transactions; (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer for 50% or more of the
Shares or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in
connection therewith; (iv) any person having acquired beneficial ownership or
the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any "group" (as such term is
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder) having been formed which beneficially owns or has the
right to acquire benefical ownership of, 50% or more of the Shares; or (v)
any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the
foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

The Company has agreed to notify CECI immediately if any inquiries are
received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or
discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with the Company, in each
case in connection with any acquisition, business combination or purchase of
all or any significant portion of the assets of, or any equity interest in,
the Company or any subsidiary.

Representations and Warranties. The Merger Agreement contains customary
representations and warranties of the parties thereto, including
representations by each of the Company and CECI as to the absence of certain
changes or events concerning its business, compliance with law, approval of
the Offer and the Merger by the Company for purposes of certain Nevada
antitakeover statutes, energy regulatory status, environment, employee
benefit plans, insurance, taxes, related party transactions, the status of
development and construction projects and the status of operating projects.

Access to Information. The Merger Agreement provides that through the
Effective Time, each of CECI and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, auditors, attorneys
and agents to, afford the officers, employees, auditors, attorneys and agents
of the other party (the "Respective Representatives") complete access at all
reasonable times and on reasonable notice to its officers, employees, agents,
accountants, properties, offices and other facilities and to all books and
records, and shall furnish such Respective Representatives with all
financial, operating and other data and information and all information
relating to the regulatory status of its plants (whether held by it, a
subsidiary, or agents thereof) as the other party, through its officers,
employees, agents or accountants, may reasonably request. All information
obtained by CECI or the Company is required to be kept confidential in
accordance with confidentiality agreements dated December 4, 1994 entered
into between CECI and the Company.

Employee Benefits. The Merger Agreement provides that CECI shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to (x) honor all employment,
change in control, deferred compensation, pension, retirement and severance
agreements in effect on December 5, 1994 between the Company or one of its
subsidiaries and any employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries, or
maintained for the benefit of any employee of the Company or one of its
subsidiaries, and (y) honor all bonus determinations for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 1994 made by the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior
to December 5, 1994 with respect to the bonus plans and arrangements of the
Company and its subsidiaries. For a period of one year commencing on the
Effective Time, CECI shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide active
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries with benefits (including,
without limitation, welfare benefits) that are no less favorable, taken as a
whole, than the benefits provided under the Company Benefit Plans (as defined
in the Merger Agreement) (other than equity-based plans and bonus plans) as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date. To the extent that service
is relevant for eligibility, vesting or benefit calculations or allowances
(including, without limitation, entitlements to vacation and sick days) under
any plan or arrangement maintained in order to provide the benefits described
in the preceding sentence, such plan or arrangement shall credit employees
for service on or prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. CECI shall as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
cause the Surviving Corporation to (or the Company may prior to the Effective
Time) amend each demand note made in favor of the Company by an employee of
the Company or one of its subsidiaries to provide that (x) such demand note
will not be repayable on demand from the Company and (y) upon the involuntary
termination without cause of the employment of such employee, all sums owed
under such demand note shall be payable in equal quarterly installments over
a period of not less than 36 months. With respect to each employee of the
Company (other than employees of the Company which are parties to a "change
in control" or "severance" agreement) who is, within the one year period
following the closing of the Offer, either (i) terminated without cause or
(ii) terminated as a result of a reduction in force, CECI shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to make the following payments: (1) if, upon the
effective date of such employee's termination, such employee has less than
one year's service with the Company, a payment equal to three months base
salary plus an amount equal to one-fourth of the prior year's targeted bonus
for such employee, payable in twelve equal installments over the twelve
months following such termination; or (2) if, upon the effective date of such
employee's termination, such employee has one year or more of service with
the Company, a payment equal to six months base salary plus an amount equal
to one-fourth of the prior year's targeted bonus for each such employee,
payable in twelve equal installments over the twelve months following such
termination. For the purposes of subclauses (1) and (2), if an employee was
not eligible for a bonus in the referenced prior year, then the targeted
bonus for the current year shall be used. An employee shall not be eligible
for the payments specified in subclauses (1) or (2) if such employee's
termination relates to a reduction in force referred to subclause (ii) above
and such employee has been offered a comparable position (in terms of
compensation) by CECI at any location; provided, however, that no such
amounts referenced in (1) and (2) will be payable if, in the good faith
determination of the Company, the employee's job performance did not merit
continued employment or offer of relocation to a comparable position. An
employee may not receive the foregoing severance payments and simultaneously
receive any severance payments under the Company's severance policy described
in the first two sentences of this paragraph.

Disposition of Pending Litigation. The Merger Agreement provides that the
parties will jointly file a stipulation of dismissal without prejudice of, or
take other reasonable steps necessary to terminate without prejudice, the
action entitled Magma Power Company v. California Energy Company, Inc., et
al., Case No. CV-N-94-00719-DWH, pending in the United States District Court
for the District of Nevada, including any and all claims and counterclaims
asserted against the Company, its directors, its officers, CECI and the
Purchaser, with each party bearing its own costs and attorneys' fees.

Amendment. The Merger Agreement may be amended by action taken by CECI and
the Purchaser, and by action taken by or on behalf of the Company's Board at
any time before the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after approval
of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made
which would materially adversely impact the interests of the Company's
stockholders or reduce the amount or change the type of consideration into
which each Share will be converted upon consummation of the Merger.

Termination. The Merger Agreement provides that it may be terminated at
any time before the Effective Time in the following circumstances: (a) by
mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of CECI and the Company; or (b) by
the Company or CECI if the Offer shall not have been consummated by February
28, 1995; or (c) by the Company or CECI if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or prior to September 30, 1995; or (d) by either CECI or the
Company if a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental, regulatory or
administrative agency or commission shall have issued an order, decree or
ruling or taken any other action (which order, decree or ruling the parties
hereto shall use their best efforts to lift), in each case permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall
have become final and nonappealable; or (e) by CECI if (i) the Company's
Board withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation of the Merger
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby or shall have
resolved to do any of the foregoing or (ii) the Company's Board recommends to
the holders of Shares any proposal with respect to a merger, consolidation,
share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; or (f) by CECI if, without the Company's consent, any person has
acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of
or any "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) has been formed which
beneficially owns, or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, more
than 10% of the Shares; or (g) by the Company or CECI if (i) a corporation,
partnership, person or other entity or group shall have made a bona fide
offer that the Company's Board determines in its good faith judgment and in
the exercise of its fiduciary duties, after consultation with and based upon
the advice of its financial and legal advisors, is more favorable to the
Company's stockholders than the Offer and the Merger or (ii) any person
(including, without limitation, the Company or any affiliate thereof), other
than CECI or any affiliate of CECI, shall have become the beneficial owner of
more than 50% of the then outstanding Shares; or (h) by either CECI or the
Company if the other party shall have breached the Merger Agreement in any
material respect and such breach continues for a period of ten days after the
receipt of notice of the breach from the nonbreaching party.

Termination Fee For CECI. The Merger Agreement provides that if it is
terminated pursuant to clauses (e) or (g) or terminated by CECI pursuant to
clause (h) of the preceding paragraph, the Company will be required to pay
CECI a termination fee of $8,000,000 plus CECI's actual documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred since September 13, 1994 in connection with
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including,
without limitation, legal and professional fees and expenses.

Termination Fee For The Company. The Merger Agreement provides that if by
December 19, 1994, CECI has not delivered to the Company either a revised
Commitment Letter (as defined below) or definitive loan documentation
reflecting the financing contemplated by such Commitment Letter which, in
each case, (i) does not contain any due diligence conditions regarding CECI
and the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) has a definition of "material
adverse effect" and/or "material adverse change" that substantially conforms
in all material respects with the definition of Material Adverse Effect
(other than as provided in subclause (i) of the definition provided below)
contained in the Merger Agreement with

22

respect to CECI and the Company, then CECI will be required to pay the
Company a termination fee of $8,000,000 if (i) the Offer expires or is
terminated without the Purchaser having accepted for payment the Shares
tendered pursuant thereto or (ii) the Merger Agreement is terminated by
either CECI or the Company because the Offer has not been consummated by
February 28, 1995 ((i) and (ii) collectively, the "Offer Termination
Events"); provided, however, that the $8,000,000 termination fee will not be
required to be paid if failure to consummate the Offer results from one or
more of the following: (i) a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company shall exist or shall have occurred and be continuing on or prior to
the relevant Offer Termination Event; (ii) the Company shall have materially
breached the Merger Agreement and CECI shall have terminated the Merger
Agreement pursuant to clause (h) of the paragraph entitled "Termination"
above; or (iii) generally accepted accounting principles would require a
restatement of the Company's audited financial statements contained in the
Company SEC Reports (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

When used in connection with CECI and the Purchaser, the term "Material
Adverse Effect" means any change or effect, when taken together with all
other adverse changes and effects relating to CECI or the Purchaser, which
are not individually or in the aggregate deemed to have a Material Adverse
Effect, that is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the
business, operations, properties, condition (financial or otherwise), assets
or liabilities (including, without limitation, contingent liabilities) of
CECI and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that the
occurrence of any or all of the following shall not constitute a Material
Adverse Effect: (i) any change in any law applicable to CECI or any CECI
subsidiary or by which any property or asset of CECI or any CECI subsidiary
is bound, (ii) a failure to receive any contract for which CECI or any CECI
subsidiary has submitted or will submit a competitive bid, (iii) the loss of
any contract or arrangement (whether by revocation, lapse or invalidity) with
respect to a project that CECI or a CECI subsidiary has under development,
other than any such loss resulting from a breach by CECI of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.22 or 3.23 of the
Merger Agreement (relating to the status of CECI's development and
construction projects and its operating projects), (iv) a failure to close
any public or private financing of any project in which CECI or any CECI
subsidiary owns a direct or indirect interest or (v) the termination of the
employment of any employee, officer, director or consultant of CECI or any
CECI subsidiary.

When used in connection with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the
term "Material Adverse Effect" means any change or effect, when taken
together with all other adverse changes and effects relating to the Company
and its subsidiaries, that is or is reasonably likely to be materially
adverse to the business, operations, properties, condition (financial or
otherwise), assets or liabilities (including, without limitation, contingent
liabilities) of the Company and the subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided,
however, that the occurrence of any or all of the following shall not
constitute a Material Adverse Effect: (i) any change in any law applicable to
the Company or any subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any subsidiary is bound, (ii) a failure to receive any contract or
award for which the Company or any subsidiary has submitted or will submit a
competitive bid, (iii) the loss of any contract or arrangement (whether by
revocation, lapse or invalidity) with respect to a project that the Company
or any subsidiary has under development, other than any such loss related to
the Malitbog project or Fish Lake project and other than any such loss
resulting from a breach by the Company of the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 4.22 and 4.23 of the Merger Agreement (relating to the
status of the Company's development and construction projects and its
operating projects), (iv) an unfavorable ruling by the California Public
Utilities Commission with respect to the Company's California plants under
the pending Biennial Resource Plan Update, (v) a loss of, or unfavorable
ruling in, the Company's pending litigation against Southern California
Edison Company, but only insofar as such litigation seeks to increase the
energy price payable for deliveries over nameplate capacity and not insofar
as any unfavorable ruling affects the validity or enforceability of any
contract subject thereto or the enforceability of any material term thereof,
(vi) a failure to close any public or private financing of any project in
which the Company or any subsidiary owns a direct or indirect interest (other
than as a result of a loss with respect to the Malitbog project or the Fish
Lake project or as a result of a breach by the Company of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 4.22 or 4.23 of the Merger Agreement
(relating to the status of the Company's development and construction
projects and its operating projects)), or (vii) the termination of the
employment of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any subsidiary.

Miscellaneous. The Merger Agreement contains customary indemnification
provisions pursuant to which the directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries
and agents of the Company and its subsidiaries are required to be indemnified
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and regardless of whether
the Merger becomes effective, by the Company and, after the Effective Time,
by the Surviving Corporation and CECI, from costs or expenses (including
attorney's fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, and liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including liabilities under the
securities laws in connection with the Merger. In addition, except as set
forth above, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be paid by the party
incurring such costs and expenses.

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the text of the Merger Agreement, which has been
filed by the Purchaser and CECI as Exhibit (c)(3) to the Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule 14D-1 of the Purchaser and CECI filed with the
Commission in connection with the Offer (the "Schedule 14D-1"). Such Exhibit
may be examined, and copies may be obtained, in the manner set forth in
Section 8 of the Offer to Purchase (except that it will not be available at
the regional offices of the Commission).

Confidentiality and Standstill Agreements. CECI and the Company have
entered into a confidentiality agreement, dated December 4, 1994, pursuant to
which CECI has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of proprietary
information that may be disclosed to CECI and its representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In
addition, CECI and the Company have entered into a standstill agreement,
dated December 5, 1994 (the "Standstill Agreement"), pursuant to which CECI
has agreed that neither CECI nor any of its subsidiaries will, for a period
of three years from December 5, 1994, among other things, acquire any
securities of the Company or participate in any proxy solicitation with
respect to voting securities of the Company, except in connection with the
Offer and the Merger or a tender offer for all Shares at a price no less than
$38.75 per Share net to the seller in cash.

Required Vote. The Purchaser intends to vote all Shares held by it
following consummation of the Offer in favor of the Merger. Accordingly, if
the Purchaser acquires a majority of the outstanding Shares pursuant to the
Offer or otherwise, it will, under Nevada law as currently in effect, have
sufficient Shares to approve the Merger without the affirmative vote of any
other stockholder.

Dissenters' and Related Rights. Holders of Shares do not have appraisal
rights as a result of the Offer. However, in the event the Merger is
consummated, any Shares held by a holder who has demanded and perfected such
holder's demand for appraisal of such holder's Shares in accordance with the
NGCL and as of the Effective Time has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost
such holder's right to such appraisal will not be converted into or represent
a right to receive the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement, but
the holder thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
the NGCL. If any holder of Shares who demands appraisal of such holder's
shares under the NGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holder's right to appraisal, then as of the
Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such
holder's Shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such Shares.

The Company will give CECI (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Shares, and withdrawals of such
demands, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the NGCL. The Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and
will not, except with the prior written consent of CECI, settle or offer to
settle any such demands.

The Purchaser cannot make any representation as to the outcome of such
appraisal of fair value as determined by the Nevada courts in connection with
the Merger, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could
result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or equivalent to,
the

24

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

consideration per Share provided in the Offer. In an appraisal proceeding,
moreover, the Purchaser may argue that for purposes of such proceeding the
fair value of the Shares in connection with the Merger is less than the
consideration per Share provided in the Offer.

The Minimum Tender Condition. The Minimum Tender Condition requires that
the number of Shares tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the
Offer, together with the Shares beneficially owned by the Purchaser,
represent at least a majority of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted
basis. According to the Merger Agreement, as of September 30, 1994, there
were 24,042,915 Shares outstanding. According to the Merger Agreement, as of
December 2, 1994, there were 582,478 Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to
options and deferred stock awards under the Stock Option Plans (as defined in
the Merger Agreement), or otherwise described in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and there were 996,943 Shares reserved for future issuance under
the Stock Option Plans. The Purchaser beneficially owns 200,000 Shares,
representing, based on information in the Merger Agreement, approximately 1%
of the outstanding Shares and approximately 1% of the outstanding Shares on a
fully diluted basis, in each case excluding treasury shares. The Shares
beneficially owned by the Purchaser and CECI were acquired in open market
purchases. For purposes of the Offer, "fully diluted basis" assumes that all
outstanding stock options and deferred stock awards are presently
exercisable.

Based on the foregoing and assuming no additional Shares or rights to
acquire Shares have been issued since September 30, 1994 (other than Shares
issued pursuant to the exercise of the stock options referred to above and
deferred stock options), if the Purchaser purchases 12,400,000 Shares (the
"Minimum Number of Shares") pursuant to the Offer, the Minimum Tender
Condition would be satisfied. The Purchaser is only seeking to purchase the
Minimum Number of Shares pursuant to the Offer. If for any reason the
purchase of 12,400,000 Shares pursuant to the Offer would not satisfy the
Minimum Tender Condition, the Purchaser may elect, subject to complying with
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, (i) to purchase
additional Shares in the Offer such that the aggregate number of Shares
purchased pursuant to the Offer would satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition,
(ii) to terminate the Offer, not accept for payment any Shares and return all
tendered Shares to tendering stockholders or (iii) to waive or reduce the
Minimum Tender Condition and waive any or all other conditions and accept for
payment all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn.

Rule 13e-3. The Merger will have to comply with any applicable federal
law. The Commission has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act which is
applicable to certain "going private" transactions and which may under
certain circumstances be applicable to the Merger. However, Rule 13e-3 would
be inapplicable if (i) the Shares are deregistered under the Exchange Act
prior to the Merger or other business combination or (ii) the Merger or other
business combination is consummated within one year after the purchase of the
Shares pursuant to the Offer and the amount paid per Share in the Merger or
other business combination is at least equal to the amount paid per Share in
the Offer. If applicable, Rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that
certain financial information concerning the fairness of the proposed
transaction and the consideration offered to minority stockholders in such
transaction be filed with the Commission and disclosed to stockholders prior
to consummation of the transaction.

Plans for the Company. In connection with the Offer, CECI and the
Purchaser have reviewed, and will continue to review, on the basis of
publicly available information, various possible business strategies that
they might consider in the event that the Purchaser acquires control of the
Company, whether pursuant to the Offer or otherwise. In addition, CECI and
the Purchaser intend to conduct a detailed review of the Company and its
assets, corporate structure, dividend policy, capitalization, operations,
properties, policies, management and personnel and consider and determine
what, if any, changes would be desirable in light of the circumstances which
then exist. Such strategies could include, among other things, changes in the
Company's business, corporate structure, certificate of incorporation,
Bylaws, capitalization, management or dividend policy. The Purchaser will not
be able to effect any such changes or transactions until it has purchased
Shares pursuant to the Offer and obtained control of the Company's Board.

Except as indicated in this Offer to Purchase, the Purchaser has no
present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in an
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization,

25

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

liquidation, relocation of operations, or sale or transfer of assets,
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any material changes in
the Company's corporate structure or business or the composition of the
Company's Board or the Company's management or personnel.

12. CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER. Notwithstanding any other provision
of the Offer, the Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or
pay for, or may delay the acceptance for payment of or payment for, tendered
Shares, or may, in the sole discretion of the Purchaser, terminate or amend
the Offer as to any Shares not then paid for if (i) at the Expiration Date
the Minimum Tender Condition or the Financing Condition shall not have been
satisfied or (ii) on or after December 9, 1994 and at or before the
acceptance of payment for any of such Shares, any of the following events
shall occur:

(a) there shall be instituted or pending any action or proceeding by
any government or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign,
or by any other person, domestic or foreign, before any court or
governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign, (i) challenging or
seeking to make illegal, to delay or otherwise directly or indirectly to
restrain or prohibit the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment
of or payment for some of or all the Shares by the Purchaser or any other
affiliates of CECI, the consummation by the Purchaser of the Merger or
seeking to obtain material damages, (ii) seeking to prohibit the ownership
or operation by the Purchaser of all or any material portion of the
business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries or of the
Purchaser, or to compel the Purchaser to dispose of or hold separately all
or any material portion of the business or assets of the Purchaser or the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or seeking to impose any material
limitation on the ability of the Purchaser or any other affiliates of CECI
to conduct their business or own such assets, (iii) seeking to impose or
confirm limitations on the ability of the Purchaser or any other
affiliates of CECI effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the
Shares, including, without limitation, the right to vote any Shares
acquired by any such person on all matters properly presented to the
Company's stockholders, (iv) seeking to require divestiture by the
Purchaser or any other affiliates of CECI of any Shares, or (v) seeking
any material diminution in the benefits expected to be derived by the
Purchaser or any affiliates of CECI as a result of the transactions
contemplated by the Offer or the Merger.

(b) there shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation,
interpretation, judgment, order or injunction, enacted, enforced,
promulgated, amended, issued or deemed applicable (i) to the Purchaser or
(ii) to the Offer or the Merger by any court, government or governmental,
administrative or regulatory authority or agency, domestic or foreign,
other than the routine application of the waiting period provisions of the
HSR Act to the Offer or to the Merger, which might, directly or
indirectly, result in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (i)
through (v) of paragraph (a) above;

(c) it shall have been publicly disclosed or the Purchaser shall have
otherwise learned that (i) any person, entity (including the Company or
any of its subsidiaries) or "group" (within the meaning of Section
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) shall have acquired or proposed to acquire
beneficial ownership of more than 20% of any class or series of capital
stock of the Company (including the Shares), through the acquisition of
stock, the formation of a group or otherwise, or shall have been granted
any right, option or warrant, conditional or otherwise, to acquire
beneficial ownership of more than 20% or any class or series of capital
stock of the Company (including the Shares) other than acquisitions for
bona fide arbitrage purposes only and except as disclosed in a Schedule
13D or 13G on file with the Commission on December 5, 1994, (ii) any such
person, entity or group which before December 5, 1994 had filed such a
Schedule with the Commission, has acquired or proposes to acquire, through
the acquisition of stock, the formation of a group or otherwise,
beneficial ownership of an additional 5% or more of any class or series of
capital stock of the Company (including the Shares), or shall have been
granted any right, option or warrant, conditional or otherwise, to acquire
beneficial ownership of an additional 5% or more of any class or series of
capital stock of the Company (including the Shares); provided, however,
that if such person or group acquired the Shares without the Company's
consent and the Company has not taken any action under its Rights Plan to
exempt such acquisition from the terms thereof, the foregoing condition
shall be inapplicable.

26

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

(d) the Company shall have failed to comply in any material respect
with any of its obligations under the Agreement or any representation or
warranty of the Company in such Agreement shall not be true and correct in
any material respect and such failure to comply or be true and correct
shall have a Material Adverse Effect;

(e) a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company shall have
occurred;

(f) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms; or

(g) the Company's Board shall have withdrawn, modified or amended in
any unfavorable respect its recommendation of the Offer or shall have
resolved to do so or shall have entered into an agreement with a third
party with respect to a Competing Transaction;

which, in the good faith judgment of CECI or the Purchaser in any such case,
and regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by CECI
and the Purchaser) giving rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to
proceed with the Offer and/or with such acceptance for payment or payment.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of CECI and the
Purchaser and may be asserted by CECI or the Purchaser or may be waived by
CECI or the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time
in its sole discretion.

13. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS. The Purchaser estimates that the total
amount of funds required to purchase all Shares sought pursuant to the Offer
will be approximately $483.6 million. The Purchaser estimates that
approximately an additional $212.5 million will be required to effectuate the
Merger or, if CECI elects to pay only cash consideration in the Merger,
approximately an additional $463 million will be required. The Purchaser will
obtain such funds through borrowings from commercial banks and other
financial institutions; through a capital contribution by CECI from CECI's
general corporate funds, which at September 30, 1994 aggregated $316.3
million; and, if the Purchaser elects to pay only cash consideration in the
Merger, through a public offering or private placement of CECI Common Stock
or other equity securities of CECI. It is CECI's current intention to pay the
Merger Consideration solely in cash, although such intention is subject to
change based on market conditions and other factors.

The Purchaser anticipates that approximately one-half of the cash required
to purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger will be provided
through a secured bank credit facility on terms and conditions to be
determined. CECI has received a fully underwritten financing commitment
letter from Credit Suisse (the "Commitment Letter") which states that Credit
Suisse will provide, on specified terms and subject to customary conditions,
up to $500,000,000 in secured bank financing in connection with the Offer and
the Merger. Such funds, together with a portion of CECI's general corporate
funds, will be sufficient to pay the cash portion of the consideration for
the Offer and the Merger and related expenses.

The Commitment Letter contemplates (i) a facility of up to $250,000,000 to
capitalize the Purchaser for the purpose of financing the Offer (the "Tender
Facility") and (ii) facilities of up to $500,000,000 for, among other things,
refinancing the Tender Facility and effectuating the Merger (the "Merger
Facilities" and, together with the Tender Facility, the "Facilities").

The term of the Tender Facility will be 12 months, extendible for a term
of up to three years from the initial funding at the mutual consent of CECI
and Credit Suisse. The Tender Facility will be a margin loan collateralized
by the Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and subject to Regulation U
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

The Merger Facilities will be composed of (i) up to a 6-year amortizing
term loan ("Term Loan A") in an expected amount of up to $500,000,000 less
the amount of Term Loan B (as defined below) and (ii) up to a 8-year
amortizing term loan ("Term Loan B") in an expected amount not to be less
than $150,000,000. The Merger Facilities are to be amortized from internally
generated funds of the Company and will be secured by an assignment and
pledge of the stock of the Company and all unencumbered assets of the
Company.

27

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

Interest on loans borrowed under the Facilities will be payable at spreads
of 2.50% above LIBOR (adjusted for reserves) or 1.25% above Base Rate for
loans under the Tender Facility, 2.50% above LIBOR (adjusted for reserves) or
1.50% above Base Rate for Term Loan A, and 3.00% above LIBOR (adjusted for
reserves) or 2.00% above Base Rate for Term Loan B. CECI may elect to incur
loans at either LIBOR or Base Rate.

Credit Suisse's commitment to provide the Facilities is subject to certain
customary conditions, including without limitation (a) a capital investment
in the Purchaser in an amount and form satisfactory to Credit Suisse, (b) the
absence of certain material adverse changes and (c) Credit Suisse's
satisfaction with its due diligence with respect to CECI and the Company.

The definitive documentation relating to the Facilities will contain
representations, warranties, covenants, events of default and conditions
customary for transactions of this size and type.

CECI has agreed to pay certain fees to Credit Suisse with respect to the
Facilities which, in the aggregate, are not material to the transactions
described herein.

The foregoing description of the Commitment Letter is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the text thereof filed as Exhibit (b)(1) to the
Schedule 14D-1 of the Purchaser and CECI filed with the Commission in
connection with the Offer, copies of which may be obtained from the offices
of the Commission in the manner set forth in Section 8 of the Offer to
Purchase (except that such information will not be available at the regional
offices of the Commission). When definitive agreements relating to the
Facilities are executed, copies will be filed as exhibits to amendments to
the Schedule 14D-1.

14. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. If, on or after the date of this Offer to
Purchase, the Company should split, combine or otherwise change the Shares or
its capitalization, or shall disclose that it has taken any such action,
then, subject to the provisions of Section 12, the Purchaser may, in its sole
judgment, make such adjustments as it deems appropriate to reflect such
split, combination or other change in the purchase price and the other terms
of the Offer (including, without limitation, the number and type of
securities offered to be purchased, the amounts payable therefor and the fees
payable hereunder).

If, on or after the date of this Offer to Purchase, the Company should
declare or pay any cash or stock dividend or other distribution on or issue
any rights with respect to the Shares, payable or distributable to
stockholders of record on a date before the transfer to the name of the
Purchaser or its nominee or transferee on the Company's stock transfer
records of the Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, then,
subject to the provisions of Section 12, (i) the purchase price per Share
payable by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer will be reduced by the amount
of any such cash dividend or cash distribution and (ii) the whole of any such
non-cash dividend, distribution or right will be received and held by the
tendering stockholder for the account of the Purchaser and shall be required
to be promptly remitted and transferred by each tendering stockholder to the
Depositary for the account of the Purchaser, accompanied by appropriate
documentation of transfer. Pending such remittance, the Purchaser will be
entitled to all rights and privileges as owner of any such non-cash dividend,
distribution or right and may withhold the entire purchase price or deduct
from the purchase price the amount or value thereof, as determined by the
Purchaser in its sole discretion.

The Company has agreed in the Merger Agreement not to take any of the
foregoing actions without the prior written consent of CECI.

15. CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS. Except as otherwise disclosed herein, on the
basis of an examination of publicly available filings with respect to the
Company, the Purchaser is not aware of any licenses or other regulatory
permits which appear to be material to the business of the Company and which
might be adversely affected by the acquisition of Shares by the Purchaser
pursuant to the Offer or of any approval or other action by any governmental,
administrative or regulatory agency or authority which would be required for
the acquisition or ownership of Shares by the Purchaser as contemplated
herein. Should any such approval or other action be required, it is currently
contemplated that such approval or action would be sought. The Purchaser is
unable to predict whether it may determine that it is required to delay the
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer pending such approval
or other action. There cannot be any assurance that any such approval or
other action, if needed, would be obtained without

28

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

substantial conditions or that adverse consequences might not result to the
Company's business or that certain parts of the Company's business might not
have to be disposed of if such approvals were not obtained or such other
actions were not taken, any of which could cause the Purchaser to elect to
terminate the Offer pursuant to Section 12.

Pending Litigation. On October 3, 1994, the Company filed a complaint
entitled Magma Power Company v. California Energy Company, Inc., Case No.
CV-N-94-06160, against CECI in the Second Judicial District Court of the
State of Nevada in and for the County of Washoe. The complaint seeks a
declaratory judgment that (i) the Company's Board properly discharged its
fiduciary obligations in adopting the Rights Agreement and an amendment to
the Company's Bylaws and, accordingly, such documents were valid and binding,
and (ii) the Merger Moratorium Statute is valid and not in violation of the
Commerce Clause and Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. CECI
removed this action to the United States District Court for the District of
Nevada (Case No. CV-N-94-00719-DWH).

On October 17, 1994, CECI filed its answer and counterclaims in response
to the Company's complaint. The counterclaims name the Purchaser as an
additional counterclaim plaintiff and the Company's directors as counterclaim
defendants in addition to the Company. CECI's counterclaims seek primarily:
(i) a declaratory judgment that certain actions taken by the Company,
including the amendment to the Company's Bylaws purporting to preclude the
Company stockholders from taking action by written consent, and
implementation of its "poison pill" Rights Agreement, are void and ultra
vires, and constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by the Company's Board; (ii)
an injunction requiring the Company's Board to rescind the amendment to the
Company's Bylaws which purports to eliminate the power of stockholders to act
by written consent, the "golden parachute" severance agreements granted to 15
members of the Company's management and the indemnification agreements
granted to each member of the Company's Board; (iii) an injunction enjoining
the operation of the "poison pill" Rights Agreement and directing the
Company's Board to redeem the "Rights" provided for in that Agreement; (iv) a
declaratory judgment that the Merger Moratorium Statute is unconstitutional
under the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause of the United States
Constitution; (v) an injunction enjoining the Company's Board from invoking
the terms of the Merger Moratorium Statute or otherwise obstructing the
Offer; and (vi) an injunction requiring the Company to correct all false and
misleading statements in the Previous Schedule 14D-9 and the amendments
thereto.

On October 17, 1994, the Company filed an amended complaint, which, in
addition to the relief requested in its original complaint, seeks (i)
declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to certain purportedly false
and misleading disclosures in CECI's and the Purchaser's Schedule 14D-1 and
the Offer to Purchase therein; and (ii) declaratory and injunctive relief
with respect to certain allegedly false and misleading statements made in
CECI's preliminary Request Solicitation Statement filed with the Commission
pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act on October 13, 1994.

On October 19, 1994, CECI and the Purchaser filed their answer to the
Company's amended complaint and amended their counterclaims which, in
addition to the relief requested in the original counterclaims, seek an
injunction requiring the Company to correct additional false and misleading
statements reflected in an amendment to its Schedule 14D-9 and in other
statements made by the Company.

On October 25, 1994, CECI and the Purchaser filed their second amended
counterclaims which, in addition to the relief requested in the original and
amended counterclaims, seek an injunction requiring the Company to refrain
from (i) taking actions to damage its international development projects,
including the Karaha project, or (ii) taking other actions designed to waste
corporate assets and block the Offer and the Merger.

On December 8, 1994, the parties to the action filed a stipulation and
joint motion requesting that the Court stay all proceedings in the action.
The Merger Agreement provides that the parties will hereafter request that
the Court dismiss the action without prejudice.

On September 20, 1994, William Steiner, a stockholder of the Company,
filed a class action complaint entitled William Steiner, et al. v. Paul M.
Pankratz, et al., Case No. 680986, against the Company and its

29

<PAGE>

directors in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the
County of San Diego, alleging, among other things, that the Company's
stockholders have been, and continue to be, deprived of the opportunity to
fully realize the benefits of their investment in the Company as a result of
the directors' refusal to properly consider CECI's offer for the Company,
which actions are alleged to constitute unfair dealing and a breach of
fiduciary duty. As relief, the complaint seeks an order directing the
Company's directors to carry out their fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders by cooperating fully with CECI or any other entity making a bona
fide offer for the Company, as well as damages and costs. On December 2,
1994, defendants in William Steiner filed a motion to stay the proceedings in
this case in light of the parallel litigation pending in the Nevada courts.

On October 4, 1994, Charles Miller, a stockholder of the Company, filed a
class action complaint entitled Charles Miller, et al. v. Magma Power
Company, et al., Case No. CV94-06187, against the Company, its directors and
The Dow Chemical Company in the Second Judicial District Court of the State
of Nevada in and for the County of Washoe, alleging, among other things, that
the defendants' unwillingness to seriously consider CECI's proposal to
acquire the Company and its implementation of defensive measures constitute
breaches of the fiduciary duty owed to the Company's stockholders. As relief,
the complaint seeks a declaration that defendants have breached their
fiduciary duties, an order directing the defendants to fairly evaluate
alternatives designed to maximize value for the Company's stockholders, and
an injunction with respect to the implementation of the Company's "poison
pill" or other defensive measures, as well as damages and costs.

On November 2, 1994, the plaintiffs in Charles Miller voluntarily
dismissed their state court action, in favor of bringing an action in the
United Stated District Court for the District of Nevada.

On October 28, 1994, stockholders William Steiner and Charles Miller filed
a class action complaint entitled William Steiner and Charles Miller v. Magma
Power Co., Case No. CV-N-94-773-ECR, against the Company, its directors and
The Dow Chemical Company, in the United States District Court for the
District of Nevada, alleging essentially the same facts as in the two
previously filed stockholder litigations. As relief, the complaint seeks an
order directing the defendants to fairly evaluate alternatives designed to
maximize shareholder value, an injunction with respect to implementation of
the Company's Poison Pill, declaration that the Company has violated Sections
14(d) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act, and an injunction barring the defendants
from engaging in any solicitations in opposition to CECI until they comply
with the provisions of the Exchange Act, as well as damages and costs. On
November 18, 1994, the court granted a motion by the plaintiffs in Steiner
and Miller to consolidate this action for all pretrial purposes with Magma
Power Company v. California Energy Company, Inc, et al.

State Takeover Laws. The Company is incorporated under the laws of the
State of Nevada. In connection with its approval of the Offer and the Merger,
the Company's Board acted to render inapplicable to the Offer and the Merger
Sections 78.378 through 78.3793, inclusive (the "Control Share Statute"), and
Sections 78.411 through 78.444, inclusive (the "Merger Moratorium Statute"),
of the NGCL, which, under certain circumstances, could have, among other
things, (i) precluded CECI and the Purchaser from voting Shares purchased
pursuant to the Offer and (ii) prevented CECI and the Purchaser from
consummating the Merger for a period of at least three years following the
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer.

A number of states (including Nevada) have adopted laws and regulations
containing restrictions that apply to offers to acquire securities of
corporations which are incorporated and/or have assets, stockholders and/or
conduct business therein. In 1982, the United States Supreme Court in Edgar
v. Mite Corp. invalidated on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business
Takeovers Statute which, as a matter of state securities law, imposed
procedural requirements of additional filings, a waiting period and a
fairness hearing on tender offers, on the ground that the requirements
imposed by the state takeover statute which made takeovers of corporations
meeting certain requirements more difficult, conflicted with federal law. The
reasoning in that decision is likely to apply to other state takeover
statutes that purport to impose similar requirements on the Offer.

In 1987, the United States Supreme Court in CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of
America held that the State of Indiana could, as a matter of corporate law
and, in particular, those aspects of corporate law

30

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

concerning corporate governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential
acquiror from voting on the affairs of a target corporation, without the
prior approval of a majority vote of those stockholders of the corporation
who had no interest in the acquisition and who were neither officers nor
directors and employees of the corporation, provided that such laws were
applicable only to Indiana corporations. (The Control Share Statute, which
has been rendered inapplicable to the Offer by the Company's Board, is
substantially similar to the statute upheld in CTS Corp.) Subsequently,
certain United States District Courts have ruled that state takeover
statutes, even of the type upheld in CTS Corp., are unconstitutional insofar
as they apply to corporations incorporated outside that state. In TLX
Acquisition Corp. v. Telex Corp., a United States District Court in Oklahoma
ruled that Oklahoma takeover statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they
applied to corporations incorporated outside Oklahoma in that they would
subject such corporations to inconsistent regulations. Similarly in Tyson
Foods, Inc. v. McReynolds, a United States District Court in Tennessee ruled
that four Tennessee takeover statutes were unconstitutional as they applied
to corporations incorporated outside Tennessee. This decision was affirmed by
the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The reasoning of
these cases may indicate that application of the takeover statutes of states
other than Nevada to the Offer could be unconstitutional.

Various states, including Nevada, also have enacted merger moratorium
statutes that regulate the circumstances under which a corporation may merge
or enter into other business combinations with an acquiror of certain
percentages of their outstanding stock. In Amanda Acquisition Corp. v.
Universal Foods Corp., the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit held that the state of Wisconsin could, as a matter of state law,
prohibit for a period of three years, a Wisconsin corporation from entering
into certain business combinations, including a merger, with a holder of 10%
or more of the outstanding stock of the corporation, unless the corporation's
Board of Directors had approved the transaction prior to the time the
acquiror purchased its 10% interest in the corporation. Certiorari to the
United States Supreme Court was denied. (The Merger Moratorium Statute, which
has been rendered inapplicable to the Merger by the Company's Board, is
substantially similar to the statute upheld in Amanda Acquisition Corp.)

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries conduct business in a number
of states throughout the United States, some of which have enacted takeover
statutes. The Purchaser does not know whether any or all of these statutes
will by their terms apply to the Offer. To the extent that state takeover
statutes and regulations purport to apply to the Offer and the Merger, and
contain provisions that impose requirements that conflict with the United
States Constitution or conflict with the federal securities laws applicable
to the Offer and the Merger, the Purchaser believes that such statutes and
regulations are unconstitutional and/or preempted by federal law. Should the
Company, any government agency or official or any other person seek to apply
any such statute to the Offer, the Purchaser will take such action as then
appears desirable and may contest the validity of such statutes and the
application of such statutes to the Offer in appropriate judicial or
administrative proceedings. If it is asserted that one or more state takeover
laws is applicable to the Offer and an appropriate court does not determine
that it is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the Offer, the Purchaser may
be required to file certain information with, or receive approvals from, the
relevant state authorities, and, if enjoined, the Purchaser may be unable to
purchase Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer or may be delayed in
consummating the Offer. In the circumstances described above, the Purchaser
may not be obliged to purchase any Shares tendered. See Section 12.

Antitrust. Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended (the "HSR Act"), certain acquisition transactions may not be
consummated unless certain information has been furnished to the Federal
Trade Commission ("FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and certain waiting period requirements
have been satisfied. As a result of termination of the HSR Act waiting period
in connection with the Previous Offer, no waiting period is required in
connection with the Offer.

The Antitrust Division, the FTC and state authorities frequently
scrutinize the legality under the antitrust laws of transactions such as the
acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer. At any time before or after the
consummation of any of such transactions, the Antitrust Division, the FTC or
state authorities could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest,

31

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

including seeking to enjoin the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise or the consummation of the Merger, or seeking the divestiture of
Shares acquired by the Purchaser or the divestiture of substantial assets of
the Company. Private parties may also seek to take action under the antitrust
laws. The Purchaser believes that the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the
Offer will not violate the antitrust laws. However, and notwithstanding
termination of the HSR Act waiting period in connection with the Previous
Offer, there can not be any assurance that a challenge to the Offer on
antitrust grounds will not be made, or if such a challenge is made, what the
result will be. See Section 12 for certain conditions of the Offer, including
conditions with respect to injunctions and certain governmental actions.

16. FEES AND EXPENSES. Gleacher & Co. Inc. ("Gleacher") is acting as
financial advisor to the Purchaser and CECI in connection with the

persons against certain losses, claims, damages or liabilities and expenses

and certain related persons against certain losses, claims, damages or
liabilities and expenses in connection with the Offer, including certain

MacKenzie Partners, Inc. has been retained by the Purchaser to act as the
Information Agent in connection with the Offer. The Information Agent may
contact holders of Shares by mail, telephone, facsimile, telegraph and

out-of-pocket expenses and will be indemnified against certain liabilities
and expenses in connection therewith, including certain liabilities under the
federal securities laws.

In addition, IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Company has been retained as the
Depositary. The Depositary has not been retained to make solicitations or

reasonable and customary compensation for its services, will be reimbursed
for certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will be indemnified against
certain liabilities and expenses in connection therewith, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Neither CECI nor the Purchaser will pay any fees or commissions to any
broker or dealer or other person (other than the Dealer Manager and
Information Agent) for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to the Offer.
Brokers, dealers, commercial banks and trust companies will be reimbursed by
the Purchaser for customary mailing and handling expenses incurred by them in
forwarding offering materials to their customers.

17. MISCELLANEOUS. The Offer is being made to all holders of Shares. The
Purchaser is not aware of any state where the making of the Offer is
prohibited by administrative or judicial action pursuant to a state statute.
If the Purchaser becomes aware of any state where the making of the Offer is
so prohibited, the Purchaser will make a good faith effort to comply with any
such statute or seek to have such statute declared inapplicable to the Offer.
If, after such good faith effort, the Purchaser cannot comply with any

32

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

applicable statute, the Offer will not be made to (nor will tenders be
accepted from or on behalf of) the holders of Shares in such state. In any
jurisdiction the securities, blue sky or other laws of which require the
Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer shall be deemed to
be made on behalf of the Purchaser by Gleacher or one or more registered
brokers or dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.

The Purchaser has filed with the Commission the Schedule 14D-1, pursuant
to Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, furnishing certain additional

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned hereby tenders to CE Acquisition Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Purchaser") and a wholly owned subsidiary of California
Energy Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CECI"), the above described
shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Shares"), of Magma
Power Company, a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to the
Purchaser's offer to purchase 12,400,000 Shares at a price of $39.00 per
Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated
December 9, 1994 (the "Offer to Purchase") (receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged) and in this Letter of Transmittal (which together with the
Offer to Purchase constitutes the "Offer"). The undersigned understands that
the Purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole and from
time to time in part, to one or more direct or indirect subsidiaries of CECI,
the right to purchase Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such
transfer or assignment will not relieve the Purchaser of its obligations
under the Offer or prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive
payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer.

Subject to, and effective upon, acceptance for payment of the Shares
tendered herewith in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon
the order of, the Purchaser all right, title and interest in and to all the
Shares that are being tendered hereby and that are being accepted for
purchase pursuant to the Offer (and any and all dividends, distributions,
stock splits, other Shares, rights or other securities issued or issuable in
respect of the Shares on or after December 9, 1994) which are payable or
distributable to stockholders of record on a date prior to the transfer into
the name of the Purchaser or its nominees or transferees on the Company's
stock transfer records of the Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer (a
"Distribution"), and irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Depositary the
true and lawful attorney-in-fact and proxy of the undersigned with respect to
such Shares (and any dividends, distributions, other Shares, rights or
securities, including Distributions) with full power of substitution and
resubstitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable
power coupled with an interest), to (a) deliver certificates for such Shares
(and any such dividends, distributions, other Shares, rights or securities,
including Distributions), or transfer ownership of such Shares on the account
books maintained by a Book-Entry Transfer Facility, together in either such
case with all accompanying evidences of transfer and authenticity, to or upon
the order of the Purchaser upon receipt by the Depositary, as the
undersigned's agent, of the purchase price (adjusted, if appropriate, as
provided in the Offer to Purchase), (b) present such Shares (and any
dividends, distributions, other Shares, rights or securities, including
Distributions) for transfer on the books of the Company and (c) receive all
benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such
Shares (and any such dividends, distributions, other Shares, rights or
securities, including Distributions), all in accordance with the terms of the
Offer.

<PAGE>

The undersigned hereby irrevocably appoints David L. Sokol, Steven A.
McArthur and John G. Sylvia and each of them, or any other designees of the
Purchaser, the attorneys-in-fact and proxies of the undersigned, each with
full power of substitution and resubstitution (such power of attorney being
deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest), to vote or act
by written consent in such manner as each such attorney and proxy or his
substitute shall in his sole discretion deem proper, and otherwise to act
with respect to all the Shares tendered hereby that have been accepted for
payment by the Purchaser prior to the time of such vote or action (and any
and all non-cash dividends, distributions, other Shares, rights or securities
issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after December 9, 1994), at any
meeting of stockholders (whether regular or special and whether or not an
adjourned meeting) of the Company, or consent in lieu of any such meeting, or
otherwise. All such powers of attorney and proxies are irrevocable and
coupled with an interest in the tendered Shares and are granted in
consideration of, and are effective when, and only to the extent that, the
Purchaser accepts such Shares for payment. Such acceptance for payment shall
revoke any other proxies granted by the undersigned at any time with respect
to such Shares (and any such non-cash dividends, distributions, other Shares,
rights or other securities, including Distributions) and no subsequent
proxies or written consents will be given (and if given will be deemed not to
be effective) with respect thereto by the undersigned.

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has
full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares
tendered hereby (and any and all dividends, distributions, other Shares,
rights or other securities issued or issuable in respect thereof, including
Distributions, on or after December 9, 1994) and that, when the same are
accepted for payment by the Purchaser, the Purchaser will acquire good and
unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all pledges, liens,
restrictions, charges, proxies and encumbrances and the same will not be
subject to any adverse claim.

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

Upon request, the undersigned will execute and deliver any additional
documents deemed by the Depositary or the Purchaser to be necessary or
desirable to complete the sale, assignment and transfer of the Shares
tendered hereby (and any and all dividends, distributions, such other Shares,
rights or other securities, including Distributions). In addition, the
undersigned shall promptly remit and transfer to the Depositary for the
account of the Purchaser any and all other Shares or other securities,
including Distributions, issued to the undersigned on or after December 9,
1994 in respect of Shares tendered hereby, accompanied by appropriate
documentation of transfer, and, pending such remittance or appropriate
assurance thereof, the Purchaser shall be entitled to all rights and
privileges as owner of any such other Shares or other securities and may
withhold the entire consideration or deduct from the consideration the amount
or value thereof, as determined by the Purchaser in its sole discretion.

All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred in this Letter of
Transmittal shall not be affected by, and shall survive, the death or
incapacity of the undersigned and any obligation of the undersigned hereunder
shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs, executors,
administrators and legal and personal representatives of the undersigned.
Except as stated in the Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal, this
tender is irrevocable. The undersigned understands that tenders of Shares
pursuant to any one of the procedures described in the Offer to Purchase and
in the instructions hereto will constitute a binding agreement between the
undersigned and the Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer.

Unless otherwise indicated herein under "Special Payment Instructions,"
please issue the check for the purchase price and/or return any certificates
for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment in the name(s) of the
registered holder(s) appearing under "Description of Shares Tendered."
Similarly, unless otherwise indicated under "Special Delivery Instructions,"

for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment (and accompanying documents,

are completed, please issue the check for the purchase price, and/or return

book-entry transfer may request that any Shares not accepted for payment be
returned by crediting such account maintained at a Book-Entry Transfer
Facility as such stockholder may designate by making an appropriate entry

Purchaser has no obligation pursuant to the Special Payment Instructions to
transfer any Shares from the name of the registered holder thereof if the
Purchaser does not accept for payment any of the Shares so tendered.

FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

or other entity which is a member in good standing of the Securities Transfer

name of, a person other than the registered holder(s). Signatures on such
certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution

certificates for Shares not tendered or purchased are to be registered in the
name of, any person other than the registered holder, or if tendered
certificates are registered in the name of any person other than the
person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any stock
transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder or such other
person) payable on account of the transfer to such person will be deducted
from the purchase price unless satisfactory evidence of the payment of such
taxes or exemption therefrom is submitted.

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS INSTRUCTION 6, IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY FOR
TRANSFER TAX STAMPS TO BE AFFIXED TO THE CERTIFICATES LISTED IN THIS LETTER
OF TRANSMITTAL.

reject any and all tenders determined by it not to be in the appropriate form
or the acceptance for purchase of which may, in the opinion of its counsel,
be unlawful. As set forth in the Offer to Purchase,

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

the Purchaser also reserves the absolute right to waive any of the conditions
of the Offer or any defect or irregularity in the tender of any Shares of any
particular stockholder whether or not similar defects or irregularities are
waived in the case of other stockholders. The Purchaser's interpretations of
the terms and conditions of the Offer (including these instructions) will be
final and binding. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities must be cured
within such time as the Purchaser shall determine. None of the Purchaser, the
Dealer Manager, the Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person
will be under any duty to give notice of any defects or irregularities in
tenders or shall incur any liability for failure to give any such
notification. Tenders shall not be deemed to have been made until all defects
and irregularities have been cured or waived.

10. 31% BACKUP WITHHOLDING; SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9. Under federal income tax
laws, a stockholder whose tendered Shares are accepted for payment is
required to provide the Depositary with such stockholder's correct taxpayer
identification number ("TIN") on Substitute Form W-9 below and certify under
penalties of perjury that such number is correct and that such stockholder is
not subject to backup withholding. If the Depositary is not provided with the
correct TIN and certifications are not provided, the Internal Revenue Service
may subject the stockholder or other payee to a $50 penalty. In addition,
payments that are made to such stockholder or other payee with respect to
Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer may be subject to 31% backup
withholding.

Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and
certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an
exempt recipient, the stockholder must submit a Form W-8, signed under
penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt status. A Form
W-8 can be obtained from the Depositary. See the enclosed "Guidelines for
Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for
more instructions.

If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 31%
of any such payments made to the stockholder or other payee. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of persons
subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld.
If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained
from the Internal Revenue Service.

The box in Part 3 of the Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the
tendering stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a TIN or
intends to apply for a TIN in the near future. If the box in Part 3 is
checked, the stockholder or other payee must also complete the Certificate of
Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number below in order to avoid backup
withholding. Notwithstanding that the box in Part 3 is checked and the
Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number is completed, the
Depositary will withhold 31% of all payments made prior to the time a
properly certified TIN is provided to the Depositary. The stockholder is
required to give the Depositary the TIN (e.g., social security number or
employer identification number) of the record owner of the Shares or of the
last transferee appearing on the transfers attached to, or endorsed on, the
Shares. If the Shares are in more than one name or are not in the name of the
actual owner, consult the enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer
Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for additional guidance on
which number to report.

11. LOST, DESTROYED OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES. If any certificate(s)
representing Shares has been lost, destroyed or stolen, the stockholder
should promptly notify the Information Agent. The stockholder will then be
instructed as to the steps that must be taken in order to replace the
certificate(s). This Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot be
processed until the procedures for replacing lost or destroyed certificates
have been followed.

IMPORTANT: THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL (OR A FACSIMILE THEREOF) OR AN
AGENT'S MESSAGE, TOGETHER WITH CERTIFICATES OR CONFIRMATION OF BOOK-ENTRY
TRANSFER AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE
DEPOSITARY, OR THE NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE
DEPOSITARY, ON OR PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE.

Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer.

Holders of Shares whose certificates for such Shares ("Share
Certificates") are not immediately available or who cannot deliver their
Share Certificates and all other required documents to the Depositary on or
prior to the Expiration Date, or who cannot complete the procedures for
book-entry transfer on a timely basis, must tender their Shares according to
the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth in Section 4 of the Offer to
Purchase.

THIS MATERIAL IS BEING FORWARDED TO YOU AS THE BENEFICIAL OWNER OF SHARES
CARRIED BY US IN YOUR ACCOUNT BUT NOT REGISTERED IN YOUR NAME. A TENDER OF
SUCH SHARES CAN BE MADE ONLY BY US AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD AND PURSUANT TO
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS. THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IS FURNISHED TO YOU FOR YOUR
INFORMATION ONLY AND CANNOT BE USED BY YOU TO TENDER SHARES HELD BY US FOR
YOUR ACCOUNT. ACCORDINGLY, WE REQUIRE INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHETHER YOU WISH TO
TENDER ANY OR ALL OF SUCH SHARES HELD BY US FOR YOUR ACCOUNT, UPON THE TERMS
AND SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE OFFER.

Please note the following:

1. The Purchaser is offering to purchase 12,400,000 Shares at $39.00
per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer.

2. The Offer, the proration period and withdrawal rights will expire
at 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, on Monday, January 9, 1995, unless
the Offer is extended.

3. The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (1) there being
validly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the Offer that
number of Shares which, together with Shares beneficially owned by the
Purchaser, represents at least a majority of the Shares outstanding on a
fully diluted basis, and (2) the Purchaser being satisfied that it has
obtained financing sufficient to enable it to consummate the Offer. The
Offer is also subject to certain other terms and conditions.

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

4. Tendering stockholders will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees
or commissions or, except as set forth in Instruction 6 of the Letter of
Transmittal, stock transfer taxes on the purchase of Shares pursuant to
the Offer.

5. Payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will
be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) certificates
for such Shares or timely confirmation of the book-entry transfer of such
Shares into the Depositary's account at The Depository Trust Company,
Midwest Securities Trust Company or Philadelphia Depository Trust Company
(collectively, the "Book-Entry Transfer Facilities"), pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase, (ii) the
Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and
duly executed, with any required signature guarantees or an Agent's
Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) (as described in Section 4
of the Offer to Purchase) in connection with a book-entry transfer, and
(iii) any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal.
Accordingly, payment may not be made to all tendering stockholders at the
same time depending upon when certificates for, or confirmations of
book-entry transfer of, such Shares into the Depositary's account at a
Book-Entry Transfer Facility are actually received by the Depositary.

If you wish to have us tender any or all of the Shares held by us for your
account, please so instruct us by completing, executing and returning to us
the instruction form contained in this letter. If you authorize a tender of
your Shares, all such Shares will be tendered unless otherwise indicated in
such instruction form. Please forward your instructions to us in ample time
to permit us to submit a tender on your behalf prior to the expiration of the
Offer. The Letter of Transmittal is furnished to you for your information
only and cannot be used by you to tender Shares held by us for your account.

The Purchaser is not aware of any state where the making of the Offer is
prohibited by administrative or judicial action pursuant to state statute. If
the Purchaser becomes aware of any state where the making of the Offer is so
prohibited, the Purchaser will make a good faith effort to comply with any
such statute or seek to have such statute declared inapplicable to the Offer.
If, after such good faith effort, the Purchaser cannot comply with any
applicable statute, the Offer will not be made to (nor will tenders be
accepted from or on behalf of) the holders of Shares in such states. In those
jurisdictions where the laws require the Offer to be made by a licensed
broker or dealer, the Offer is being made on behalf of the Purchaser by
Gleacher & Co. Inc. or one or more registered brokers or dealers that are
licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.

o Payments to partnerships not engaged in a trade or business in the U.S.
and which have at least one nonresident partner.
o Payments of patronage dividends where the amount received is not paid
in money.
o Payments made by certain foreign organizations.
o Payments made to a nominee.

Payments of interest not generally subject to backup withholding include the
following:
o Payments of interest on obligations issued by individuals.
NOTE: You may be subject to backup withholding if this interest is $600 or
more and is paid in the course of the payer's trade or business and you
have not provided your correct taxpayer identification number to the payer.

<PAGE>

o Payments of tax-exempt interest (including exempt interest dividends
under section 852).
o Payments described in section 6049(b)(5) to nonresident aliens.
o Payments on tax-free covenant bonds under section 1451.
o Payments made by certain foreign organizations.
o Payments made to a nominee.

Exempt payees described above should file Form W-9 to avoid possible
erroneous backup withholding. FILE THIS FORM WITH THE PAYER, FURNISH YOUR
TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER, WRITE "EXEMPT" ON THE FACE OF THE FORM, AND
RETURN IT TO THE PAYER, IF THE PAYMENTS ARE INTEREST, DIVIDENDS, OR PATRONAGE
DIVIDENDS. ALSO SIGN AND DATE THE FORM.

Certain payments other than interest, dividends, and patronage dividends
that are not subject to information reporting are also not subject to backup
withholding. For details, see the regulations under sections 6041, 6041A(a),
6045, and 6050A.

PRIVACY ACT NOTICE--Section 6109 requires most recipients of dividends,
interest, or other payments to give taxpayer identification numbers to payers
who must report the payments to the IRS. The IRS uses the numbers for
identification purposes. Payers must be given the numbers whether or not
recipients are required to file tax returns. Beginning January 1, 1993,
payers must generally withhold 31% of taxable interest, dividends, and
certain other payments to a payee who does not furnish a taxpayer
identification number to a payer. Certain penalties may also apply.

PENALTIES

(1) PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO FURNISH TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER--If you
fail to furnish your taxpayer identification number to a payer, you are
subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due
to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

(2) CIVIL PENALTY FOR FALSE INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO WITHHOLDING--If you
make a false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no
imposition of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.

(3) CRIMINAL PENALTY FOR FALSIFYING INFORMATION--Falsifying certifications or
affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or
imprisonment.

NOTICE OF OFFER TO PURCHASE FOR CASH

12,400,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OF
MAGMA POWER COMPANY

AT
$39.00 NET PER SHARE
BY
CE ACQUISITION COMPANY, INC.

A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMPANY, INC.

CE Acquisition Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
``Purchaser'') and a wholly owned subsidiary of California Energy
Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (``CECI''), hereby offers to purchase
12,400,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the
``Shares''), of Magma Power Company (the ``Company''), a Nevada corporation, at
a price of $39.00 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest
thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to
Purchase dated December 9, 1994 (the ``Offer to Purchase'') and in
the related Letter of Transmittal (which together constitute the ``Offer'').

THE OFFER, THE PRORATION PERIOD AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS
WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON
MONDAY, JANUARY 9, 1995, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, BY UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THOSE
PRESENT, HAS DETERMINED THAT THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE
BEST INTERESTS OF, THE COMPANY AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS, HAS APPROVED THE OFFER AND
THE MERGER AND RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS ACCEPT THE OFFER AND TENDER THEIR
SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER.

THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (1) THERE BEING
VALIDLY TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE
OFFER THAT NUMBER OF SHARES WHICH, TOGETHER WITH SHARES BENEFICIALLY
OWNED BY THE PURCHASER, REPRESENTS AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE
SHARES OUTSTANDING ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS (SUCH CONDITION BEING REFERRED TO
AS THE ``MINIMUM TENDER CONDITION''), AND (2) THE PURCHASER BEING
SATISFIED THAT IT HAS OBTAINED FINANCING SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE IT TO CONSUMMATE
THE OFFER.

The purpose of the Offer is to acquire majority control of the
Company as the first step in the acquisition of the entire equity
interest in the Company. On December 5, 1994, CECI and the Company entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ``Merger Agreement'') pursuant to
which the Company will, as soon as practicable following consummation of the
Offer, consummate a merger (the ``Merger'') with the Purchaser.
In the Merger, each remaining outstanding Share (other than Shares
held by CECI, the Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of CECI, Shares held in the treasury of the Company and
Shares held by stockholders who properly exercise dissenters'
rights under the Nevada General Corporation Law (the ``NGCL'')) will be
converted into the right to receive, at the option of CECI, (i) the
All Cash Component Amount (as defined below), net in cash, without interest
thereon, or (ii) both (A) the Mixed Cash Component Amount (as defined
below), net in cash, without interest thereon, and (B) the number of fully paid
and nonassessable shares of CECI Common Stock equal to the quotient
of (I) $39.00 less (II) the Mixed Cash Component Amount divided by the
Average Closing Price (as defined below) (the All Cash Component
Amount or (ii) (A) and (ii) (B), collectively, as applicable, being the
``Merger Consideration''). The ``Mixed Cash Component Amount''
shall mean an amount equal to the quotient of (A) (x) $28.50 multiplied by the
number of Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) less (y) $39.00 multiplied by the number of Shares owned by CECI and
any of its affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided
by (B) the number of Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (other than
Shares owned by CECI and any of its affiliates). The ``All Cash
<PAGE>

Component Amount'' shall mean an amount equal to the quotient of (A) (x) $38.75
multiplied by the number of Shares outstanding at the Effective
Time less (y) $39.00 multiplied by the number of Shares owned by CECI and any
of its affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B)
the number of Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (other than Shares owned
by CECI and any of its affiliates). The ``Average Closing Price'' shall
mean the average closing price of shares of common stock, par value $0.0675 per
share, of CECI (the ``CECI Common Stock'') on the New York Stock Exchange
during the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth business day prior
to the Effective Time; provided, however, that if such average
closing price exceeds $18.73, the Average Closing Price shall be $18.73, and if
such average closing price is less than $14.27, the Average Closing
Price shall be $14.27.

The Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole judgment,
at any time or from time to time and regardless of whether any of
the events set forth in Section 12 of the Offer to Purchase shall have occurred
or shall have been determined by the Purchaser to have occurred, (i)
to extend the period of time during which the Offer is open and thereby delay
acceptance for payment of, and the payment for, any Shares, by
giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositary (as defined
in the Offer to Purchase) and (ii) subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, to amend the Offer in any respect by giving oral or written notice
of such amendment to the Depositary. Any such extension, amendment or
termination will be followed as promptly as practicable by public announcement
thereof, such announcement in the case of an extension to be issued not
later than 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the next business day after the
previously scheduled Expiration Date (as defined in the Offer to
Purchase). During any such extension, all Shares previously tendered and not
withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer, subject to the right of a
tendering stockholder to withdraw such stockholder's Shares.

If more than 12,400,000 Shares shall be properly tendered on or
prior to the Expiration Date and not withdrawn in accordance with
Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase, and the acquisition of such number of
Shares satisfies the Minimum Tender Condition, the Purchaser will, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, purchase 12,400,000
Shares on a pro rata basis (with adjustments to avoid purchases of
fractional Shares) based upon the number of Shares properly tendered on or
prior to the Expiration Date and not withdrawn. If exactly 12,400,000 Shares
are properly tendered on or prior to the Expiration Date and not withdrawn, and
the acquisition of such number of Shares satisfies the Minimum
Tender Condition, the Purchaser will, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer, accept for payment and purchase all such
Shares so tendered. If fewer than 12,400,000 Shares shall have been properly
tendered on or prior to the Expiration Date and not withdrawn, and
the number of Shares so tendered and not withdrawn shall not have satisfied the
Minimum Tender Condition, the Purchaser may, subject to the terms
of the Merger Agreement, (i) terminate the Offer and return all tendered
Shares to tendering stockholders, (ii) extend the Offer and retain all
such Shares until the expiration of the Offer, as extended, subject to the
terms of the Offer (including any rights of stockholders to withdraw their
Shares), or (iii) waive the Minimum Tender Condition and purchase all properly
tendered Shares. Due to the difficulty of determining the precise number of
Shares properly tendered and not withdrawn, if proration is required, the
Purchaser does not expect to announce the final results of proration or pay
for any Shares until at least seven Nasdaq National Market trading days after
the Expiration Date. Preliminary results of proration will be announced
by press release as promptly as practicable after the Expiration Date.
Holders of Shares may obtain such preliminary information when it
becomes available from the Information Agent and may be able to obtain such
information from their brokers.

For purposes of the Offer, the Purchaser will be deemed to have
accepted for payment, and thereby purchased, Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn as, if and when the Purchaser gives oral or written
notice to the Depositary of the Purchaser's acceptance of such
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer. In all cases, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer, payment for Shares
purchased pursuant to the Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price
therefor with the Depositary, which will act as agent for tendering
stockholders for the purpose of receiving payment from the Purchaser and
transmitting payment to validly tendering stockholders. Under no circumstances
will interest on the purchase price for Shares be paid by the Purchaser
by reason of any delay in making such payment or for any other
reason. In all cases, payment for Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer will
be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of (a) certificates for
such Shares (``Certificates'') or a book-entry confirmation of the book-entry
transfer of such Shares and into the Depositary's account at the
Depository Trust Company, the Midwest Securities Trust Company or the
Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (collectively, the ``Book-Entry Transfer
Facilities''), pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Offer to Purchase,
(b) a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof) properly completed
and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees, or an Agent's
Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) in connection with a book-entry
transfer, and (c) any other documents required by such Letter of Transmittal.

If, for any reason whatsoever, acceptance for payment of any Shares
tendered to the Offer is delayed, or if the Purchaser is unable to
accept for payment or pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, then,
without prejudice to the Purchaser's rights set forth in the Offer
to Purchase, the Depositary may, nevertheless, on behalf of the Purchaser,
retain tendered Shares and such Shares may not be withdrawn except to the
extent that the tendering stockholder is entitled to and duly exercises
withdrawal rights as described in Section 3 of the Offer to
Purchase. Any such delay will be by an extension of the Offer to the extent
<PAGE>

required by law.

If certain events occur, the Purchaser will not be obligated to
accept for payment or pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer. If any tendered Shares are not purchased pursuant to the Offer for any
reason (including because of proration) or are not paid for because
of invalid tender, or if Certificates are submitted representing more Shares
than are tendered, Certificates representing unpurchased or untendered
Shares will be returned, without expense to the tendering stockholder (or, in
the case of Shares delivered by book-entry transfer into the
Depositary's account at a Book-Entry Transfer Facility pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase, such Shares will be
credited to an account maintained within such Book-Entry Transfer Facility), as
soon as practicable following the expiration, termination or withdrawal of the
Offer and determination of the final results of proration.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase,
tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable.
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn at any time prior
to 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, on Monday, January 9, 1995
(or if the Purchaser shall have extended the period of time for which the
Offer is open, at the latest time and date at which the Offer, as
so extended by the Purchaser, shall expire) and, unless theretofore accepted
for payment and paid for by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, may
also be withdrawn at any time after February 6, 1995. In order for a withdrawal
to be effective, a written, telegraphic or facsimile transmission notice of
withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses
set forth on the back cover of the Offer to Purchase. Any notice of
withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares to be
withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn, and if Certificates for Shares
have been tendered, the name of the registered holder of the Shares
as set forth in the tendered Certificate, if different from that of
the person who tendered such Shares. If Certificates for Shares have been
delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary, then prior to
the physical release of such Certificates, the serial numbers shown on such
Certificates evidencing the Shares to be withdrawn must be
submitted to the Depositary and the signature on the notice of withdrawal must
be guaranteed by a firm which is a bank, broker, dealer, credit union,
savings association or other entity that is a member in good standing of
the Securities Transfer Agent's Medallion Program (an ``Eligible
Institution''), unless such Shares have been tendered for the account of an
Eligible Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the
procedures for book-entry transfer set forth in Section 4 of the Offer to
Purchase, any notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and number of the
account at the appropriate Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the
withdrawn Shares and otherwise comply with such Book-Entry Transfer
Facility's procedures. Withdrawal of tenders of Shares may not be rescinded,
and any Shares properly withdrawn will be deemed not to be validly
tendered for purposes of the Offer. Withdrawn Shares may, however,
be retendered by repeating one of the procedures in Section 4 of
the Offer to Purchase at any time before the Expiration Date. The Purchaser, in
its sole judgment, will determine all questions as to the form and
validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal, and such
determination will be final and binding. Any Shares properly
withdrawn will be deemed not validly tendered for the purposes of the Offer,
but may be retendered at any subsequent time prior to the Expiration Date by
following the procedures described in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase.

The information required to be disclosed by Rule 14d-6(e)(1)(vii)
of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is contained in the Offer to Purchase and is incorporated
herein by reference.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will furnish CECI and
the Purchaser with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of all record holders of Shares and security position listings of
Shares held in stock depositories. Upon compliance by the Company,
the Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and other relevant
materials will be mailed to record holders of Shares and will be
furnished to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar
persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the
stockholder list, or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a
clearing agency's security position listing for subsequent transmittal to
beneficial owners of Shares.

THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ANY
DECISION IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

Information Agent or the Dealer Manager at their respective

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

CALIFORNIA ENERGY AND MAGMA POWER REACH
MERGER AGREEMENT AT $39 PER SHARE

OMAHA, NE, and SAN DIEGO, CA, December 5, 1994 -- California
Energy Company, Inc. (NYSE, PSE, LSE: CE) and Magma Power Company
(NASDAQ:MGMA) today announced that they had entered into a
definitive merger agreement which provides for Magma shareholders
to receive a price of $39 net per share in a combination of
$28.50 in cash and $10.50 in market value of California Energy
common stock, or approximately $950 million in aggregate value on
a fully-diluted basis.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, California Energy will
commence no later than Friday, December 9 a cash tender offer for
a majority of Magma's common stock at $39 per share in cash. The
tender offer will remain open for 20 days and, if over-
subscribed, will be pro-rated. As soon as practicable thereafter,
California Energy will complete the acquisition of all remaining
shares in a second step merger transaction by issuing for each
Magma share a combination of cash and California Energy common
shares totalling $39, or, at its option, approximately $38.50 per
share in cash. If California Energy stock is to be received in
the merger, the number of shares to be issued will be increased
or decreased by up to 13.5% based on the difference between
$16.50 and the average daily closing price of California Energy
during the fifteen trading days ending on the fifth business day
prior to the consummation of the merger.

California Energy's tender offer is subject to the valid tender
of shares representing a majority of the voting power of Magma,
funding of financing, and other customary closing conditions. In

addition, the merger (though not the tender) is conditioned, if
California Energy shares are to be issued, on approval of
California Energy shareholders. Under the agreement, Magma has
agreed to render Magma's shareholders rights plan inapplicable to
the tender offer and merger and to waive applicable Nevada anti-
takeover statutes. The Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust waiting
period has expired with respect to the transaction. The parties
have also agreed to terminate all litigation between them.

The agreement has been approved by the Boards of Directors of
both companies. Magma Power's Board has determined, after
thoroughly exploring alternatives in consultation with its
independent financial advisors, that the terms of the offer and
merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, its
stockholders and recommends that stockholders tender their Magma
shares into California Energy's tender offer.

Following the merger, the combined companies will have projected
annual revenues in excess of $400 million, its facilities will
produce in excess of 545MW of power and will have an additional
530MW of power under construction. The combined companies will
constitute the largest independent geothermal power company in
the world with operations in the U.S., Philippines and Indonesia.

David L. Sokol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
California Energy said, "The combination of our two organizations
creates a geothermal company with unparalleled technical,
geological, developmental and operational skills. We fully
believe that this merger will accelerate the achievement of our
strategic objectives and will enhance our international expansion
efforts. We welcome the family of talented Magma employees onto
our team and we anticipate a smooth transition."

Paul Pankratz, Chairman of Magma, said: "We believe this
transaction reflects Magma's inherent strengths and outstanding
prospects. The combined company will be the largest and most
technically advanced global competitor in the geothermal energy
industry -- well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities
worldwide."

Ralph Boeker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Magma,
said: "Magma brings excellent people, technology and projects
into this combination. We look forward to working with
California Energy to ensure the success of this great combined
company."

described in the attached term sheets (the "Term Sheets"). This commitment is
subject to (i) the preparation, execution and delivery of mutually acceptable
loan and security documentation incorporating substantially the terms and
conditions outlined in the Term Sheets, (ii) the absence of a material adverse

SUMMARY OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
UP TO $250,000,000 TENDER OFFER FACILITY

<S> <C>
Borrower: California Energy Company on a non-recourse basis in form satisfactory to the Agent.

Agent/Arranger/
Underwriter: Credit Suisse

Lenders: The Agent and any other financial institutions to which the facility may be syndicated by
the Agent.

Facility: Up to a $250,000,000 12-month tender offer facility (the "Facility") subject to
Regulation U and renewable/extendable for a term of up to three-years from initial
funding at the mutual consent of both the Borrower and Lenders.

Use of Proceeds: The Borrower proposes to capitalize CE Acquisition Company, Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary ("Newco"), for the purpose of tendering for 51% of the stock of Magma
Power Company (the "Target"). A condition of the tender will be the execution and
delivery of a definitive merger agreement between Newco and the Target (the "Merger
Agreement Condition"), although that condition may be waived by the Borrower as
contemplated in the Offer to Purchase of the Borrower and Newco dated October 6,
1994, as it may be amended, (the "Offer to Purchase") under the caption "The Merger
Agreement Condition." No material amendment to the Offer to Purchase shall be
effective for purposes of this term sheet without the prior written consent of the Bank.
If the Merger Agreement Condition is not waived, the form of the merger agreement
shall be satisfactory to the Agent. Funds provided by the Facility will be advanced by
the Borrower to Newco to purchase a secured note of Newco (the "Newco Secured
Tender Note"). The proceeds from the sale of the Newco Secured Tender Note will be
used, together with the Borrower's capital investment in Newco and other available
moneys which will be in an amount and form satisfactory to the Agent, to purchase the
tendered stock of the Target, and to pay related fees and costs of the transaction. The
economic terms of the Newco Secured Tender Note will mirror the terms of the Facility.

Borrowing Options: Adjusted LIBOR and Base Rate.

California Energy Company

"Adjusted LIBOR" means the average (rounded upward to the next higher 1/16 of 1%)
of the rates offered to the reference Lenders in the London interbank market for deposits
in an amount and maturity corresponding to the interest period for the advance. LIBOR
will be adjusted for reserves and other regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

"Base Rate" means the higher of the Agent's prime rate or the federal funds rate +
0.50% per annum.

Applicable
Interest Margins: LIBOR + 2.50%
Base Rate + 1.25%

Computation of
Interest: Interest on Base Rate loan segments will be payable quarterly in arrears and calculated
on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 365/366 day year.

Interest on LIBOR loan segments will be payable in arrears (i) at the end of each
applicable interest period and (ii) in the case of any interest period longer than three
months, every three months during such period. Interest on LIBOR loan segments will
be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360 day year.

Default Rate: All applicable margins will be increased by 2.00% per annum and all loan segments shall
be maintained as Base Rate loan segments effective in the case of LIBOR loan segments
at the end of each then existing period.

Scheduled
Amortization: The Facility will not be subject to a scheduled amortization prior to its maturity.

Mandatory
Prepayments: Subject to mandatory prepayment as a whole in connection with (i) any sale of any of the
ownership interest of the Target by Newco; (ii) a permanent injunction of the merger
between Newco and the Target; and (iii) the closing of the merger between Newco and

Newco to Borrower.

Optional
Prepayments: Optional prepayments will be permitted at any time in excess of a threshold amount
without premium or penalty other than payment of applicable "breakage" costs on LIBOR
loan segments. Required notice to the Agent will be (i) one Business Day prior to the
date of prepayment of any Base Rate loan segment and (ii) three Business Days prior to
the date of prepayment of any LIBOR loan segment.

<PAGE>

CONFIDENTIAL

California Energy Company

Application of
Prepayments: All principal reductions shall be permanent. Prepayments will be applied first to Base
Rate loan segments and then to LIBOR loan segments. The prepayment of LIBOR loan
segments will be subject to the payment of "breakage" costs if the date of prepayment
is not the last day of an interest period unless, at the option of the Borrower, the
prepayment amount is escrowed with the Agent and invested in United States Treasury
Securities to the last day of the applicable interest period.

Security: The Facility will be secured by an assignment and a pledge of the Newco Secured Tender
Note, including the Target stock pledged as security thereunder in form satisfactory to
Agent. Payments on the collateral will be paid directly to the Agent, as collateral agent
for the Lenders. The Borrower will provide for the payment of interest on the Facility
in a manner satisfactory to the Agent. The Facility will be non-recourse to the Borrower,
and the Lenders will agree to make an appropriate election under Section 1111(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code to continue such non-recourse status in any proceeding involving
Borrower as Debtor under the Bankruptcy Code.

The Company also engages Gleacher & Co. (together with Lehman
Brothers) to advise on arranging debt financing for the
transaction. The Company will pay to Gleacher & Co. a fee equal
to 0.25% of the principal amount of debt directly arranged by the
Lehman Brothers and Gleacher & Co. team in the transaction.

Other Matters

In addition to any fees that may be payable to Gleacher & Co.,
the Company agrees to reimburse Gleacher & Co. for all reasonable
travel and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with Gleacher & Co.'s engagement hereunder, including
all reasonable fees and disbursements of Gleacher & Co.'s legal
counsel and any other professional advisors.

Gleacher & Co. shall provide reasonable documentation with
respect to out-of-pocket expenses and obtain the Company's
approval before incurring significant costs in connection with
attorneys and other professional advisors. Gleacher & Co. will
consult with the Company before selecting attorneys and other
professional advisors.

In connection with the foregoing and for no additional
compensation, Gleacher & Co. will, upon request, render a
fairness opinion, or opinions, which may be in such form as
Gleacher & Co. shall determine and may be qualified in such a
manner as Gleacher & Co. deems appropriate.

The Company recognizes and confirms that in advising the Company
in completing its engagement hereunder, Gleacher & Co. will be
using and relying on non-public data, material and other
information furnished to Gleacher & Co. by the Company. It is
understood that in performing this engagement Gleacher & Co. may
reasonably rely upon any information so supplied without
independent verification. Gleacher & Co. will hold in confidence
all non-public information received from the Company and will not
use such information in a manner adverse to the Company, or for
any purpose not contemplated by this letter or otherwise required
by law. Upon the Company's request, Gleacher & Co. will promptly
return or destroy all such information and all copies thereof and
will confirm to the Company in writing that Gleacher & Co. has
complied with the requirements of this sentence.

The Company acknowledges that all advice given by Gleacher & Co.

<PAGE>

Page 3

in connection with its engagement hereunder is intended solely
for the benefit and use of the management and Board of Directors
of the Company in considering any transaction to which such
advice relates and, except as may be required by applicable law,
the Company agrees that no such advice shall be used for any
other purpose or be reproduced, disseminated, quoted or referred
to at any time, in any manner or for any purpose, nor shall any
public references to Gleacher & Co. be made by or on behalf of
the Company, in each case without Gleacher & Co.'s prior written
consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The foregoing
shall not prohibit the Company from disclosing any such advice or
opinions to the extent such disclosure may be required by law,
provided that the Company shall notify Gleacher & Co. prior to
any such disclosure and, if time permits and Gleacher & Co. so
desires, offer Gleacher & Co. an opportunity to comment on such
disclosure and/or take appropriate steps to preserve the
confidentiality of such matters.

The Company recognizes that Gleacher & Co. has been retained only
by the Company and that its engagement is not deemed to be on
behalf of and is not intended to confer rights upon any other
shareholder of the Company, or any other person not a party
hereto as against Gleacher & Co. or any of its affiliates, the
respective limited and general partners, directors, officers,
agents and employees of Gleacher & Co. or its affiliates or each
other person, if any, controlling either of Gleacher & Co. or any
of its affiliates. Unless otherwise expressly stated in writing
by Gleacher & Co., no one other than the Company, is authorized
to rely upon this engagement of Gleacher & Co. or any statements
or conduct by Gleacher & Co.

In connection with matters described in this letter, the Company
and Gleacher & Co. have entered into a separate letter agreement,
dated the date hereof, providing for indemnification,
contribution and reimbursement of Gleacher & Co. and certain
other individuals and entities.

Any right to trial by jury with respect to any claim or action
arising out of this agreement or conduct in connection with the
engagement is hereby waived by the parties hereto and their
affiliates. This agreement shall be deemed made in New York.
This agreement and all controversies arising from or related to
performance under this agreement shall be governed by the laws of
the state of New York, without regard to such state's rules
concerning conflicts of laws. All controversies arising from or
related to performance under this agreement shall be adjudicated
in State or Federal court within the State of New York.

Gleacher & Co. may assign its rights and obligations under this
letter agreement to any partnership of which Gleacher & Co. is
the general partner or to any other entity which succeeds to the
business of Gleacher & Co. so long as Mr. Eric J. Gleacher is a

without the consent of the Company. The Company shall not be
obligated to pay Gleacher & Co. any additional fees pursuant to
this agreement as a result of such assignment. The provisions of
this agreement (including the attached letter agreement) shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns,

without cause by the Company or by Gleacher & Co. at any time.
Upon termination, this agreement shall have no further force or
effect except that (i) any fees earned or payable pursuant to
this letter agreement as of the date of termination and any out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by Gleacher & Co. prior to the date
of termination shall be paid or reimbursed in accordance with the
terms of this agreement; (ii) in the case of termination by the
Company, Gleacher & Co. shall be entitled to any fees that would

Gentlemen:

In connection with the activities of Gleacher & Co. Inc.
("Gleacher & Co.") pursuant to a letter agreement, dated as of
the date hereof, between California Energy Company, Inc. (The
"Company") and Gleacher & Co., as the same may be amended from
time to time, including without limitation any activities of
Gleacher & Co. in connection with any transaction contemplated by
such letter agreement, whether occurring before, at or after the
date hereof, the Company agrees for a period of six years from
the date of termination of Gleacher & Co.'s engagement hereunder,
to indemnify and hold harmless Gleacher & Co. and its affiliates,
the respective limited and general partners, directors, officers,
agents and employees of Gleacher & Co. and its affiliates and
each other person, if any, controlling Gleacher & Co. or any of
its affiliates (hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"indemnified parties"), to the full extent lawful, from and
against any losses, damages, liabilities, expenses or claims (or
actions in respect thereof, including, without limitation,
shareholder and derivative actions) related to or otherwise
arising out of such engagement or Gleacher & Co.'s role in
connection therewith, relating to an action commenced within six
years following the termination of Gleacher & Co.'s engagement
and will undertake the legal defense of any indemnified party
(with counsel, which may be outside counsel to the Company,
reasonably acceptable to such indemnified party) and reimburse
any indemnified party for all other reasonable expenses as they
are incurred by any indemnified party in connection with
investigating, preparing or defending any claim, action,
proceeding or investigation, in connection with pending or
threatened litigation to which any indemnified party is or may be
made a party, arising in connection with or related to Gleacher &
Co.'s engagement or Gleacher & Co.'s role in connection
therewith. If, in the written opinion of counsel to any
indemnified party, there is a significant potential for a
conflict of interest between any of the indemnified parties and
the Company, then the Company will pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of one national and local separate counsel acting for
all such indemnified parties. For any action commenced after
three years from the date of termination of Gleacher & Co.'s
engagement, Gleacher & Co. will contribute up to $500,000 to the
costs of defending such action. The Company will not, however,
be responsible for any losses, damages, liabilities, expenses or
claims to the extent they are finally judicially determined to
have resulted from any indemnified party's bad faith or gross
negligence. The Company also agrees that no indemnified party

<PAGE>

Gleacher & Co. Inc.
September 23, 1994
Page 2

will have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract,
tort or otherwise) to the Company for or in connection with such
engagement except to the extent that any such liability for
losses, damages, liabilities, expenses or claims incurred by the
Company result from such indemnified party's bad faith or gross
negligence.

In the event that the foregoing indemnity is unavailable to any
indemnified party for any reason or insufficient to hold any
indemnified party harmless, then the Company agrees to contribute
to any such losses, damages, liabilities, expenses, claims or
actions and will do so in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received (or anticipated to be
received) by, and the relative fault of, the indemnified parties,
on the one hand, and the Company and the Company's
securityholders, on the other, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations, from any actual or proposed
transaction. The Company and Gleacher & Co. agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does
not take account of the equitable considerations referred to
above.

The Company agrees that it will not, without the prior written
consent of Gleacher & Co., which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened
claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether
or not Gleacher & Co. is an actual or potential party to such
claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of Gleacher & Co. from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding
unless the claims not released relate to the bad faith or gross
negligence of any indemnified party.

The foregoing agreement shall be in addition to any rights that
any indemnified party may have at common law or otherwise, and
shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may
otherwise have. The Company hereby consents to personal
jurisdiction, service and venue in any court in which any claim
which is subject to this agreement is brought against Gleacher &
Co. or the Company. ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO
ANY CLAIM OR ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT IS WAIVED.
Gleacher & Co. may assign its rights and obligations under this
letter agreement to any partnership of which Gleacher & Co. is
the general partner or to any other entity, of which Eric J.
Gleacher is a partner or principal, which succeeds to the

business of Gleacher & Co., in each case, without the consent of
the Company. This agreement shall remain in full force and
effect following the completion or termination of Gleacher &
Co.'s engagement and shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and personal
representatives of the Company and any indemnified party.

Very truly yours, Accepted:

Exhibit 99.(c)(2)

LEHMAN BROTHERS

September 27, 1994

California Energy Company, Inc.
10831 Old Mill Road
Omaha, Nebraska 68154

Attention: Mr. David L. Sokol
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Dear David:

This letter agreement (this "Agreement") will confirm
the understanding and agreement between Lehman Brothers Inc.
("Lehman Brothers") and California Energy Company, Inc. (the
"Company" or "CEC"):

1. The Company hereby engages Lehman Brothers to
render financial advisory services to the Company
concerning its acquisition of Magma Power Company
("Magma").

2. Lehman Brothers hereby accepts the engagement and,
in that connection, agrees to:

(a) provide advisory services, in conjunction
with Gleacher and Company ("Gleacher"),
including general business and financial
analysis, transaction feasibility analysis
and pricing of the prospective acquisition of
Magma; and

(b) assist, in conjunction with Gleacher, in
corporate capital planning for such
acquisition, including the identification of
commercial bank acquisition financing, and
assist in the arrangement of such financing.

3. For purposes of this Agreement, an "acquisition"
of Magma shall mean any transaction or series or
combination of transactions, other than in the
ordinary course of business, whereby, directly or
indirectly, control of a majority equity interest
in Magma or any of its businesses or assets is
transferred to the Company or any of its

1

<PAGE>

affiliates for consideration, including, without
limitation, a sale or exchange of capital stock or
assets, a merger or consolidation, a tender or
exchange offer, a leveraged buy-out, or any
similar transaction.

4. The term of Lehman Brothers' engagement hereunder
shall extend from the date hereof until terminated
as set forth below. Subject to the provisions of
paragraphs 5 through 14, which shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, either party may
terminate Lehman Brothers' engagement hereunder at
any time by giving the other party at least 10
days' prior written notice.

5. As compensation for the services rendered by
Lehman Brothers hereunder, the Company shall pay
Lehman Brothers as follows:

(a) If an acquisition of Magma occurs either

(i) during the term of Lehman Brothers
engagement hereunder, or

(ii) at any time during a period of six
months following the effective date of
termination of Lehman Brothers'
engagement hereunder

then the Company shall pay to Lehman Brothers a
financial advisory fee equal to $1,000,000,
payable at the closing of such acquisition.

(b) In conjunction with such acquisition, Lehman
Brothers will also act as the lead arranger
for the placement of any commercial bank
financing necessary for the Company to
complete the acquisition. In consideration
thereof, the Company will pay Lehman Brothers
a fee equal to one quarter of 1% (0.25%) of
the total principal amount of any such
commercial bank financing arranged by Lehman
Brothers and Gleacher. Compensation which is
payable pursuant to this subparagraph (b)
shall be paid by the Company upon the closing
of the acquisition; provided, however, that
the aggregate compensation payable to Lehman
Brothers under this Agreement shall not
exceed $2,250,000.

6. The Company shall:

2

<PAGE>

(a) indemnify Lehman Brothers and hold it
harmless against any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities to which Lehman
Brothers may become subject arising in any
manner out of or in connection with the
rendering of services by Lehman Brothers
hereunder, except to the extent it is finally
judicially determined that such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities resulted from
the negligence or willful misconduct of
Lehman Brothers; and

(b) subject to the Company's right to assume
Lehman's legal defense pursuant to the
following paragraph, reimburse Lehman
Brothers promptly for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by it in
connection with investigating, preparing to
defend or defending, or providing evidence in
or preparing to serve or serving as a witness
with respect to, any lawsuits,
investigations, claims or other proceedings
arising in any manner out of or in connection
with the rendering of services by Lehman
Brothers hereunder (including, without
limitation, in connection with the
enforcement of this Agreement and the
indemnification obligations set forth
herein); provided, however, that in the event
a final judicial determination is made to the
effect specified in subparagraph 6(a) above,
Lehman Brothers will promptly remit to the
Company any amounts reimbursed under this
subparagraph 6(b); and provided further that,
with respect to claims made after three years
from the date hereof, Lehman brothers shall
contribute $50,000 to the defense thereof.

The Company agrees that the indemnification and
reimbursement commitments set forth in this
paragraph 6 shall apply whether or not Lehman
Brothers is a formal party to any such lawsuits,
claims or other proceedings and that such
commitments shall extend upon the terms set forth
in this paragraph to any controlling person,
affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent of
Lehman Brothers (each, with Lehman Brothers, an
"Indemnified Person"). The Company further agrees
that, without Lehman Brothers' prior written
consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, it will not enter into any settlement of
a lawsuit, claim or other proceeding arising out

3

<PAGE>

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
unless such settlement includes an explicit and
unconditional release from the party bringing such
lawsuit, claim or other proceeding of all
Indemnified Persons, except to the extent the
claims not released relate to Lehman Brothers'
negligence or willful misconduct.

If indemnification is to be sought hereunder by an
Indemnified Person, then such Indemnified Person
shall notify the Company of the commencement of
any action or proceeding in respect thereof;
provided, however, that the failure so to notify
the Company shall not relieve the Company of any
liability that it may have to such Indemnified
Person pursuant to this paragraph 6 except to the
extent the Company has been prejudiced in any
material respect by such failure or from any
liability that it may have to such Indemnified
Person other than pursuant to this paragraph 6.
Notwithstanding the above, following such
notification, the Company may elect in writing to
assume the defense of such action or proceeding,
and, upon such election, it shall not be liable
for any legal costs subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Person (other than reasonable costs of
investigation or providing evidence) in connection
therewith, unless (i) the Company has failed to
provide counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Person in a timely manner, (ii)
counsel which has been provided by the Company
reasonably determines that its representation of
such Indemnified Person would present it with a
conflict of interest or (iii) outside counsel to
the Indemnified Person provides a written opinion
that there is a significant potential for a
conflict of interest. In connection with any one
action or proceeding, the Company shall not be
responsible for the fees and expenses of more than
one separate law firm in any one jurisdiction for
all Indemnified Persons.

7. The Company and Lehman Brothers agree that if any
indemnification or reimbursement sought pursuant
to the preceding paragraph 6 is judicially
determined to be unavailable for a reason other
than the negligence or willful misconduct of
Lehman Brothers, then, whether or not Lehman
Brothers is the Indemnified Person, the Company
and Lehman Brothers shall contribute to the
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
for which such indemnification or reimbursement is

4

<PAGE>

held unavailable (i) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits to
the Company on the one hand, and Lehman Brothers
on the other hand, in connection with the
transactions to which such indemnification or
reimbursement relates, or (ii) if the allocation
provided by clause (i) above is judicially
determined not to be permitted, in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the
relative faults of the Company on the one hand,
and Lehman brothers on the other hand, as well as
any other equitable considerations; provided,
however, that in no event shall the amount to be
contributed by Lehman Brothers pursuant to this
paragraph exceed the amount of the fees actually
received by Lehman Brothers hereunder.

8. Except as contemplated by the terms hereof or as
required by applicable law or pursuant to an order
entered or subpoena issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction, Lehman Brothers shall keep
confidential all material non-public information
provided to it by the Company, and shall not
disclose such information to any third party,
other than to such of its employees and advisors
as Lehman Brothers determines to have a need to
know.

9. Except as required by applicable law, any advice
to be provided by Lehman Brothers under this
Agreement shall not be disclosed publicly or made
available to third parties without the prior
approval of Lehman Brothers, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, and accordingly such
advice shall not be relied upon by any person or
entity other than the Company.

10. The Company agrees that Lehman Brothers has the
right following the closing of an acquisition to
place advertisements in financial and other
newspapers and journals at its own expense
describing its services to the Company hereunder,
provided that Lehman Brothers will submit a copy
of any such advertisements to the Company for its
prior approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

11. The Company and Lehman Brothers each represent to
the other that, except for Gleacher, there is no
other person or entity that is entitled to a
finder's fee or any type of brokerage commission

5

<PAGE>

in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as a result of any agreement or
understanding with it.

12. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer or does confer on any person or
entity other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors and assigns, and to the
extent expressly set forth herein, the Indemnified
Persons, any rights or remedies under or by reason
of this Agreement or as a result of the services
to be rendered by Lehman Brothers hereunder. The
Company further agrees that neither Lehman
Brothers nor any of its controlling persons,
affiliates, directors, officers, employees or
agents shall have any liability to the Company or
any person asserting claims on behalf of or in
right of the Company for any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the services to be
rendered by Lehman Brothers hereunder, except to
the extent it is finally judicially determined
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses resulted from the negligence or willful
misconduct of Lehman Brothers.

13. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any other provisions
of this Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect.

14. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except in writing signed by each of the parties
and shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State
of New York. Any right to trial by jury with
respect to any lawsuit, claim or other proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the services to be rendered by Lehman Brothers
hereunder is expressly and irrevocably waived.

If the foregoing correctly sets forth the understanding
and agreement between Lehman Brothers and the Company, please so
indicate in the space provided for that purpose below, whereupon

6

this letter shall constitute a binding agreement as of the date
hereof.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 5, 1994 (this
"Agreement"), among CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMPANY, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), CE ACQUISITION COMPANY, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and MAGMA POWER COMPANY, a Nevada
corporation (the "Company").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have each approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Merger Sub will
make a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire 12,400,000 shares of the
issued and outstanding common stock, $0.10 par value, of the Company, including
the associated Preferred Stock purchase rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant
to the Rights Agreement dated October 6, 1994 between the Company and Chemical
Trust Company of California, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement") (the
"Company Common Stock"; all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and the associated Rights being hereinafter collectively referred to as
the "Shares") for $39.00 per Share, or such higher price as may be paid in the
Offer (the "Per Share Cash Amount"), net to the seller in cash, subject to (i)
there being validly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the
Offer that number of Shares which, together with Shares beneficially owned by
Merger Sub, represents at least a majority of the Shares outstanding on a fully
diluted basis (the "Minimum Tender Condition") and (ii) Merger Sub having
obtained sufficient financing to enable it to consummate the Offer (the
"Financing Condition");

WHEREAS, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the Boards of
Directors of the Company and Merger Sub have each approved the merger (the
"Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company following completion of the
Offer in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
("Delaware Law") and the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada
("Nevada Law") and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to
recommend acceptance of the Offer and the Merger to the holders of Shares and
has determined that the consideration to be paid for each Share in the Offer
and the Merger is fair to the holders of such Shares;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

<PAGE>

ARTICLE I
THE TENDER OFFER

SECTION 1.01. The Offer. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 hereof and none of the
events set forth in Annex I hereto shall have occurred or be existing, Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, commence the Offer as promptly
as practicable, but in no event later than five business days after the date
hereof. The obligation of Parent to accept for payment any Shares tendered
shall be subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Annex I,
including the Minimum Tender Condition. Parent expressly reserves the right to
waive any such condition, to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer,
or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer (provided
that no change may be made that decreases the price per Share payable in the
Offer or that imposes additional conditions to the Offer from those set forth
in Annex I hereto). Merger Sub covenants and agrees that, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, unless the Company otherwise consents in
writing, Merger Sub will accept for payment and pay for Shares as soon as it is
permitted to do so under applicable law. The Per Share Cash Amount shall be
net to the seller in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable Federal
back-up withholding or stock transfer taxes payable by the seller. The Company
agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (as
hereinafter defined) will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

(b) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the
"Offer to Purchase") having the conditions and provisions set forth in Annex I
hereto. As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and
Merger Sub shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule 14D-1 (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-1") with respect to the Offer. The
Schedule 14D-1 will comply in all material respects with the provisions of, and
satisfy in all material respects the requirements of, such Schedule 14D-1 and
all applicable Federal securities laws and will contain (including as an
exhibit) or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase (or portions
thereof) and forms of the related letter of transmittal (which documents,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, and any other SEC schedule
or form that is filed in connection with the Offer and related transactions,
are referred to collectively herein as the "Offer Documents"). Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company represents and warrants that the information
provided and to be provided by it and/or by its auditors, attorneys, financial
advisors or other consultants or advisors specifically for use in the Schedule
14D-1 and the Offer Documents on the date filed with the SEC and on the date
first published, sent or given to the Company's stockholders shall not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to
correct any

<PAGE>

3
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-1 or the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect and to supplement the information provided by it
specifically for use in the Schedule 14D-1 or the Offer Documents to include
any information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule 14D-1, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given the right to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-1 before filing with
the SEC.

SECTION 1.02. Company Action. (a) The Company hereby approves of
and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Board of
Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held on December 5,
1994, at which a majority of the Directors were present, duly approved and
adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, recommended that the stockholders of the Company accept
the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer, and determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of
the Company. The Company further represents that Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman
Sachs") has rendered to the Board of Directors of the Company its opinion as of
December 5, 1994, to the effect that the consideration to be received by the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to
such stockholders (other than Parent and its affiliates).

(b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Schedule 14D-1
with respect to the Offer, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9") that will comply in all material respects with the provisions
of all applicable Federal securities laws. The Company agrees to mail such
Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company promptly after the
commencement of the Offer. The Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents shall
contain the recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company described
in Section 1.02(a) hereof. The Schedule 14D-9, on the date filed with the SEC
and on the date first published, sent or given to the Company's stockholders,
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to written information
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9. The Company agrees promptly to correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that it shall become false or misleading in any material respect, and
each of Parent and Merger Sub, with respect to written information supplied by
it specifically for use in the

<PAGE>

4

Schedule 14D-9, shall promptly notify the Company of any required corrections
of such information and cooperate with the Company with respect to correcting
such information and to supplement the information contained in the Schedule
14D-9 to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
the Company's stockholders to the extent required by applicable Federal
securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub, and their counsel, shall be given an
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before filing with the
SEC.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly upon
execution of this Agreement furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and security
position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent
date, and shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such additional
information, including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and
security position listings, and such other information and assistance as Parent
and Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.

SECTION 1.03. Directors. (a) Promptly upon the purchase by Merger
Sub of a majority of the outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer, and from
time to time thereafter as Shares are acquired by Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall
be entitled, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), to designate such number of
directors, rounded to the nearest whole number (any number ending with .5 being
rounded to the next highest whole number), on the Board of Directors of the
Company as will give Merger Sub representation on the Board of Directors equal
to that number of directors which equals the product of the total number of
directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors appointed
or elected pursuant to this sentence and including current directors serving as
officers of the Company) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number
of Shares beneficially owned by Merger Sub or any affiliate of Merger Sub
(including for purposes of this Section 1.03 such Shares as are accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer, but excluding Shares held by the Company or any
of its affiliates) bears to the number of Shares outstanding, but in no event
less than a majority of the entire Board of Directors of the Company
(regardless of vacancies). At such times, the Company will also cause (i) each
committee of the Board of Directors, (ii) if requested by Merger Sub, the board
of directors of each of the Company's Subsidiaries (as defined below) and (iii)
if requested by Merger Sub, each committee of such board to include persons
designated by Merger Sub constituting the same percentage of each such
committee or board as Merger Sub's designees are of the Board of Directors.
The Company shall, upon request by Merger Sub, promptly increase the size of
the Board of Directors or exercise its best efforts to secure the resignations
of such number of directors as is necessary to enable Merger Sub designees to
be elected to the Board of Directors and shall cause

<PAGE>

5

Merger Sub's designees to be so elected; provided, however, that such
resignations shall not cause the number of Disinterested Directors (as defined
below) to be less than two. Subject to applicable law, the Company shall
promptly take all action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Section 1.03 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to
stockholders promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or an amendment
thereof or an information statement pursuant to Rule 14f-1 if Merger Sub has
not theretofore designated directors) such information with respect to the
Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03. Parent
and Merger Sub will supply the Company and be solely responsible for any
information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(b) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees
pursuant to this Section 1.03 and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment of
this Agreement or the Restated Articles of Incorporation or Restated Bylaws of
the Company, any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by
the Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of Parent or Merger Sub or waiver of any of the Company's rights
hereunder, and any other consent or action by the Board of Directors hereunder,
will require the concurrence of a majority (which shall be at least two) of the
directors of the Company then in office who are not designees of Parent or
Merger Sub (the "Disinterested Directors").

such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect

this Agreement.

SECTION 2.05. Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws; Directors and
Officers. (a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent before the Effective
Time, at the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately before the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
permitted by law and such Articles of Incorporation; provided, however, that
Article One of the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended to read as follows: "FIRST: The name of the corporation is Magma

Corporation, in each case until their successors are elected or appointed and
qualified. If, at the Effective Time, a vacancy shall exist on the Board of
Directors or in any office of the Surviving Corporation, such vacancy may
thereafter be filled in the manner provided by law or the By-laws of Merger
Sub.

SECTION 2.06. Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) All Shares which are held by the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company, and any Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary
of Parent, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(b) Subject to Section 2.09, each remaining outstanding Share shall
be converted in the Merger into the right to receive that amount of cash and
that number of shares of common stock, par value $0.0675 per share, of Parent
(the "Parent Common Stock") equal to, at the option of Parent, (i) the All Cash
Component Amount (as defined below), net in cash, without interest thereon, or
(ii) both (A) the Mixed Cash Component Amount (as defined below), net in cash,
without interest thereon, and (B) the number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (I) $39.00 less (II) the
Mixed Cash Component Amount divided by the Average Closing Price (as defined
below) (the All Cash Component Amount or (ii)(A) and (ii)(B), collectively, as
applicable, being the "Merger Consideration"). The "Mixed Cash Component
Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the quotient of (A) (x) $28.50 multiplied
by the number of Shares outstanding at the Effective Time less (y) $39.00
multiplied by the number of Shares owned by Parent and any of its affiliates
immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the number of Shares
outstanding at the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent and any of
its affiliates). The "All Cash Component Amount" shall mean an amount equal to
the quotient of (A) (x) $38.75 multiplied by the number of Shares outstanding
at the Effective Time less (y) $39.00 multiplied by the number of Shares owned
by Parent and any of its affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time,
divided by (B) the number of Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (other
than Shares owned by Parent and any of its affiliates). The "Average Closing
Price" shall mean the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") during the 15 consecutive trading days ending
on the fifth business day prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
if such average closing price exceeds $18.73, the Average Closing Price shall
be $18.73, and if such average closing price is less than $14.27, the Average
Closing Price shall be $14.27.

(c) All Shares to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be canceled

<PAGE>

8

and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except the right to receive for each of the Shares,
upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.08, the
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock as contemplated by Section 2.09.

(d) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub
shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, $.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 2.07. Dissenting Company Common Stock. (a) Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any Shares held by a holder
who has demanded and perfected his demand for appraisal of his shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with Nevada Law and as of the Effective Time
has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his right to such appraisal
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.06(b), but the holder
thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Nevada Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section
2.07, if any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal of
his shares under Nevada Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) his right to appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time
or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such holder's shares
of Company Common Stock shall automatically be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.06(b), without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing such shares of Company Common Stock.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
Nevada Law received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Nevada
Law. The Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal and shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, settle or offer to settle any such demands.

SECTION 2.08. Surrender of Company Common Stock; Stock Transfer
Books. (a) Before the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall designate
a bank or trust company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock
(the "Exchange Agent") to receive the funds and securities necessary to make
the payments contemplated by Section 2.06. Such funds shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation, provided that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or of any agency thereof and backed by the full

<PAGE>

9

faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or
Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in deposit accounts,
certificates of deposit or banker's acceptances of, repurchase or reverse
repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from,
commercial banks with capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating in
excess of $200 million (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank which are then publicly available at the SEC or otherwise).

(b) Each holder of a certificate or certificates representing any
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock ("Certificates") canceled upon the
Merger pursuant to Section 2.06(b) may thereafter surrender such Certificate or
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holder, to effect the
surrender of such Certificate or Certificates on such holder's behalf for a
period ending one year after the Effective Time.

Any portion of the Merger Consideration which remains unclaimed by
the former stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand of Parent. Parent agrees that
promptly after the Effective Time it shall cause the distribution to holders of
record of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time appropriate materials
to facilitate such surrender, including (i) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal duly executed and any other required documents, the holder of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive for each of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates the Merger Consideration
and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
surrendered, Certificates shall represent solely the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock as contemplated by Section 2.09 with respect to each of the shares
contemplated thereby.

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of canceled
Shares is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name a
surrendered Certificate or instrument is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the Certificate or instrument so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes
required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate or instrument surrendered or shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been
paid or is not payable.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any
further registration

<PAGE>

10

of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.06(b). No interest shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon
the surrender of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately before the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

SECTION 2.09. No Fractional Shares. No Certificates or scrip
representing less than one share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.06(b). In lieu of any such fractional share,
each holder of Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of Certificates for exchange
pursuant to Section 2.06(b) shall be paid upon such surrender cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on
behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate fractional Parent Common Stock
issued pursuant to this Section 2.09. As soon as practicable following the
Effective Time the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number
of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent
over (ii) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be
distributed to holders of Company Common Stock (such excess being herein called
the "Excess Shares"), and the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former holders
of Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at the prevailing prices
on the NYSE. The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
executed on the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. The Exchange Agent shall deduct from the proceeds of the sale of
the Excess Shares all commissions, transfer taxes and other reasonable out-of-
pocket transaction costs, including any expenses of the Exchange Agent,
incurred in connection with such sale of Excess Shares. Until the net proceeds
of such sale have been distributed to the former stockholders of the Company,
the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former
stockholders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash to be paid to former stockholders of the Company in lieu of any fractional
interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance with this
Agreement such amounts to such former stockholders.

SECTION 2.10. Stock Options; Deferred Stock. Immediately prior to

liabilities (including, without limitation, contingent liabilities) of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that the

is bound, (ii) a failure to receive any contract for which Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary has submitted or will submit a competitive bid, (iii) the loss of
any contract or arrangement (whether by revocation, lapse or invalidity) with

of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that in the

letters of credit or other indebtedness (including guarantees) for any amount
greater than $1,000,000. Since September 30, 1994, neither Parent nor any of

liabilities disclosed on Schedule 3.06.

SECTION 3.07. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since September
30, 1994, except as contemplated in this Agreement or as specifically disclosed
in the Parent SEC Reports or the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule 14D-1 that
was originally filed by Parent and Merger Sub with the SEC on October 6, 1994

Schedule 3.07, there has not been:

(a) any Material Adverse Effect;

(b) any redemption or other acquisition of Parent Common Stock by
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries (other than pursuant to a plan of
repurchase under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act) or any declaration or
payment of any dividend or other distribution in cash, stock or property
with respect to Parent Common Stock;

(c) any entry into any material commitment or transaction
(including, without limitation, any borrowing or capital expenditure)
other than in the ordinary course of business or as contemplated by this

Reports, the Previous 14D-1, or as disclosed on Schedule 3.09, there are no
claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the best

likely to, prevent or delay the performance of this Agreement. As of the date

SECTION 3.16. Energy Regulatory Status. (a) Each of the
operational electric generation facilities ("Plants") owned in whole or part,
directly or indirectly by: (i) Parent, or (ii) any legal entity in which
Parent directly or indirectly owns more than 50% of the voting stock or other

a "qualifying small power production facility" ("Small Power QF"), as such term
is defined in the Federal Power Act, as amended ("FPA"), and the regulations
thereunder, and has continuously been in compliance with the requirements for
being a Small Power QF since it commenced sales of electricity.

(b) The owner of each of the Plants under development by Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary and located in the United States will, no later than the
date operations commence, either qualify as a "qualifying small power producer"
or an "exempt wholesale generator" ("EWOG"), as such terms are defined in FPA,
the regulations under the FPA, and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, as amended ("PUHCA").

(c) The owner of each of the Plants under development by Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary and located outside the United States will, no later than
the date operations commence, either qualify as an EWOG or a "foreign utility
company", as such term is defined under PUHCA and the regulations thereunder.

(d) Neither Parent nor any "affiliate" of Parent is a "public
utility company" or a "public utility holding company", as such terms are
defined in PUHCA and the regulations thereunder, a "public utility" as defined
in the FPA and the regulations thereunder, or subject to regulations by any
state public utilities commission or similar state regulatory body.

(e) Each of the Plants obtained any necessary certificates or

SECTION 3.17. Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters. (a) With
respect to each U.S. or foreign employee benefit plan, program, arrangement and
contract (including, without limitation, any "employee benefit plan", as

as amended ("ERISA")) and any executive

<PAGE>

20

compensation arrangement, whether or not funded, maintained or contributed to
by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or with respect to which Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4069, 4212(c) or 4204 of
ERISA, as well as any employee benefit plan that is subject to Section 412 of
the Code or Title IV of ERISA and which is maintained or contributed to by any
other trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is treated as a
single employer with Parent under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code
(each such trade or business being referred to herein as a "Code Affiliate")
(the "Parent Benefit Plans"), Parent has made available to the Company a true
and correct copy of (i) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), (ii) such Parent Benefit Plan, (iii)
each trust agreement relating to such Parent Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recent
summary plan description for each Parent Benefit Plan for which a summary plan
description is required, (v) the most recent actuarial report or valuation
relating to a Parent Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, if any, (vi)
the most recent determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to
any Parent Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and (vii)
the most recent annual and periodic accounting of related plan assets, if any.

(b) With respect to the Parent Benefit Plans, no event has occurred
and, to the knowledge of Parent, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances, in connection with which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary could
be subject to any liability under the terms of such Parent Benefit Plans,
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law which would have a Material Adverse
Effect. No claim has been asserted or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened,
by the IRS, the Department of Labor or any participant of a Parent Benefit Plan
that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has, with respect to any Parent Benefit
Plan, engaged in or been a party to any "prohibited transaction," as such term
is defined in Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA, which would
result in the imposition of either a penalty assessed pursuant to Section
502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by section 4975 of the Code, in each case
applicable to Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any Parent Benefit Plan. Each
Parent Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code does
so qualify, and the trusts created thereunder are exempt from tax under Section
501(a) of the Code, and each such Parent Benefit Plan will be amended in the
manner required by the Code by December 31, 1994, and has been or will be
submitted to the IRS on or prior to March 31, 1995 for a determination letter
confirming that such Parent Benefit Plan meets the currently applicable
requirements for qualification and exemption from taxation under Section 401(a)
and 501(a) of the Code. No Parent Benefit Plan has plan assets invested in any
insurance company which is or has been in insolvency proceedings within the
last 3 years. No Parent Benefit Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code has
incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in ERISA), whether or
not waived. Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries or Code
Affiliates has at any time since 1987 maintained or contributed to any Parent
Benefit Plan, including without limitation any "multiemployer plan" (as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA), which (i) is a "defined benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 414(j) of the Code) or (ii) is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

Parent Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining or other labor union
contract applicable to persons employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, no
collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary and neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary knows of any activities
or proceedings of any labor union to organize any of their respective
employees. As of the date hereof, (i) Parent and all of the Parent
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
laws relating to employment and employment practices, wages, hours, and terms
and conditions of employment, (ii) there are no material charges with respect
to or relating to Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries pending before the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any state, local or foreign agency
responsible for the prevention of unlawful employment practices, and (iii)
there is no labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary pending or, to Parent's knowledge, threatened which may interfere
with the respective business activities of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries,
except where such non-compliance, charge, dispute, strike or work stoppage

ARTICLE IV
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule previously
delivered by the Company to Parent (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

SECTION 4.01. Corporate Organization; Subsidiaries. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation
and has the requisite corporate power and authority and any material necessary
governmental authority to own, operate or lease the properties that it purports
to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and
is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned, operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failure which, when taken together
with all other such failures, would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below) on the Company. The term "Subsidiary" means any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other legal entity of which the Company or, if
the context requires, the Surviving Corporation (either alone or through or
together with any other Subsidiary) owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more
of the stock or other equity interests, or owns, directly or indirectly,
interests such that the holders are generally entitled to vote for the election
of 50% of the board of directors or other governing body, of such corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other legal entity. When used in connection with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the term "Material Adverse Effect"
means any change or effect, when taken together with all other adverse changes
and effects relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, that is or is
reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the business, operations,
properties, condition (financial or otherwise), assets or liabilities
(including, without limitation, contingent liabilities) of the Company and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that the occurrence of any or
all of the following shall not constitute a Material Adverse Effect: (i) any
change in any law applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any

<PAGE>

25

Subsidiary is bound, (ii) a failure to receive any contract or award for which
the Company or any Subsidiary has submitted or will submit a competitive bid,
(iii) the loss of any contract or arrangement (whether by revocation, lapse or
invalidity) with respect to a project that the Company or any Subsidiary has
under development, other than any such loss related to the Malitbog project or
Fish Lake project and other than any such loss resulting from a breach by the
Company of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.22 and
4.23 hereof, (iv) an unfavorable ruling by the California Public Utilities
Commission with respect to the Company's California plants under the pending
Biennial Resource Plan Update, (v) a loss of, or unfavorable ruling in, the
Company's pending litigation against Southern California Edison Company, but
only insofar as such litigation seeks to increase the energy price payable for
deliveries over nameplate capacity and not insofar as any unfavorable ruling
affects the validity or enforceability of any contract subject thereto or the
enforceability of any material term thereof, (vi) a failure to close any public
or private financing of any project in which the Company or any Subsidiary owns
a direct or indirect interest (other than as a result of a loss with respect to
the Malitbog project or the Fish Lake project or as a result of a breach by the
Company of the representation and warranties set forth in Section 4.22 or 4.23
hereof), or (vii) the termination of the employment of any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary. A true and complete
list of all the Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation

operation of law on any of the Company's properties.

SECTION 4.09. Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports, the Previous 14D-9 or as disclosed on Schedule 4.09, there are no
claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the best
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, before any court, administrative, governmental or regulatory
authority or body, domestic or foreign, which are reasonably likely, in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect or would, and are reasonably
likely to, prevent or delay the performance of this Agreement. As of the date
hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
property is subject to any order, judgment, injunction or decree, having a
Material Adverse Effect.

relating to such Company Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recent summary plan
description for each Company Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description
is required, (v) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a
Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, if any, (vi) the most recent
determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and (vii) the most
recent annual and periodic accounting of related plan assets, if any.

(b) With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
could be subject to any liability under the terms of such Company Benefit
Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law which would have a Material
Adverse Effect. No claim has been asserted, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened by the IRS, the Department of Labor or

<PAGE>

any participant of a Company Benefit Plan that the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries has, with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, engaged in or been
a party to any "prohibited transaction", as such term is defined in Section
4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA, which could result in the imposition
of either a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA or a tax imposed
by Section 4975 of the Code, in each case applicable to the Company, any
Subsidiary or any Company Benefit Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code does so qualify, and the trusts
created thereunder are exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, and
each such Company Benefit Plan will be amended in the manner required by the
Code by December 31, 1994, and has been or will be submitted to the IRS on or
prior to March 31, 1995 for a determination letter confirming that such Company
Benefit Plan meets the currently applicable requirements for qualification and
exemption from taxation under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code. No
Company Benefit Plan has plan assets invested in any insurance company which is
or has been in insolvency proceedings within the last 3 years. No Company
Benefit Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code has incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as defined in ERISA), whether or not waived. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Code Affiliates has at any time since
1987 maintained or contributed to any Company Benefit Plan, including without
limitation any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA),

Code) or (ii) is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

labor union contract applicable to persons employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries knows of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to

and all of its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable laws relating to employment and employment practices, wages, hours,
and terms and conditions of employment, there are no material charges with
respect to or relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending before
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any state, local or foreign
agency responsible for the prevention of unlawful employment practices, and
there is no labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened which
may interfere with the respective business activities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, except where such noncompliance, charge, dispute, strike or work
stoppage would not have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, to
the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or their respective representatives or employees, has committed any unfair
labor practices in connection with the operation of the respective businesses
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and there is no charge or complaint against
the Company or its Subsidiaries by the National Labor Relations Board or

<PAGE>

34

any comparable state agency pending or threatened in writing, except where such
unfair labor practice, charge or complaint would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

(d) The Company has made available to Parent (i) copies of all
employment agreements with officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii)

date hereof, with respect to the assets, properties or operations of each of
the Company and the Subsidiaries are set forth on Schedule 4.18 and are in full

the properties and businesses of each of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

SECTION 4.19. Taxes. (a) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.19, and
except as would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and each of the Subsidiaries have timely filed

below) required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and each of the
Subsidiaries or their respective operations or assets, and such Tax Returns are

be conducted does not and will not conflict with any patents, patent rights,
licenses, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights or
copyrights of others known to the Company or the Subsidiaries in any way
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No material infringement
of any proprietary right owned by or licensed by or to the Company or any of

No. CV-N-94-00719-DWH pending in the United States District Court for the
District of Nevada, including any and all claims and counterclaims asserted
against the Company, its directors, its officers, Parent and Merger Sub, with
each party bearing its own costs and attorneys' fees. The Company agrees that
it will not settle any litigation currently pending, or commenced after the
date hereof, against the Company or any of its directors by any stockholder of
the Company relating to the Offer or this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of Parent.

(b) The Company will not voluntarily cooperate with any third party
that has sought or may hereafter seek to restrain or prohibit or otherwise
oppose the Offer or the Merger and will cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to
resist any such effort to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Offer or
the Merger, unless failing to so cooperate with such third party or cooperating
with Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, would constitute a breach of
fiduciary duty of the Board of Directors of the Company or otherwise violate
any applicable law or rules.

SECTION 6.10. Employee Benefits. (a) Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to (x) honor all employment, change
in control, deferred compensation, pension, retirement and severance agreements
in effect on the date hereof between the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and
any employee of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or maintained for the
benefit of any employee of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, all of which
have been made available to Parent, and (y) honor all bonus determinations for
the fiscal year ending December 31, 1994 made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof with respect to the bonus plans and
arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) For a period of one year commencing on the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide active employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with benefits (including, without limitation,
welfare benefits) that are no less favorable, taken as a whole, than the
benefits provided under the Company Benefit Plans (other than equity-based
plans and bonus plans) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.
To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or benefit
calculations or allowances (including, without limitation, entitlements to
vacation and sick days) under any plan or arrangement maintained in order to
provide the benefits described in the preceding sentence, such plan or
arrangement shall credit employees for service on or prior to the Effective
Time with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent shall as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
cause the Surviving Corporation to (or the Company may prior to the Effective
Time) amend each demand note made in favor of the Company by an employee of the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries (each of which has been made available to
Parent) to provide that (x) such demand note will not be repayable on demand
from the Company and (y) upon the involuntary termination without cause of the
employment of such employee, all sums owed under such demand note shall be
payable in equal quarterly installments over a period of not less than 36
months.

(d) With respect to each employee of the Company (other than
employees of the Company which are parties to a "change in control" or
"severance" agreements referred to in the Previous 14D-9) who is, within the
one year period following the closing of the Offering, either (i) terminated
without cause or (ii) terminated as a result of a reduction in force, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make the following payments:

(1) if, upon the effective date of such employee's
termination, such employee has less than one year's service with the
Company, a payment equal to three months base salary plus an amount
equal to one-fourth of the prior years targeted bonus for such
employee, payable in twelve equal installments
over the twelve months following such termination; or

<PAGE>

46

(2) if, upon the effective date of such employee's
termination, such employee has one year or more of service with the
company, a payment equal to six months base salary plus an amount
equal to one-fourth of the prior years targeted bonus for each such
employee, payable in twelve equal installments over the twelve
months following such termination.

For the purposes of subclauses (1) and (2), if an employee was not
eligible for a bonus in the referenced prior year, then the targeted bonus for
the current year shall be used. An employee shall not be eligible for the
payments specified in subclauses (1) or (2) if such employee's termination
relates to a reduction in force referred to subclause (ii) above and such
employee has been offered a comparable position (in terms of compensation) by
Parent at any location; provided however, that no such amounts referenced in
(1) and (2) will be payable if, in the good faith determination of the Company,
the employee's job performance did not merit continued employment or offer of
relocation to a comparable position. An employee may not receive the severance
payments contemplated by this Section 6.10(d) and also receive any severance
payments under the Company's severance policy covered by Sections 6.10(a) and
(b) and identified on a schedule hereto.

SECTION 6.11. Certain Action of Parent and Merger Sub. Promptly
following the execution of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall suspend
their solicitation of requests for the call of a special meeting of the
Company's stockholders and their solicitation of proxies to elect nominees to
the Company's Board of Directors.

or of Merger Sub, or to compel Merger Sub to dispose of or hold separately all
or any material portion of the business or assets of Merger Sub or the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or seeking to impose any material limitation on the

the right to vote any Shares acquired by any such person on all matters
properly presented to the Company's stockholders, (iv) seeking to require
divestiture by Merger Sub or any other affiliates of Parent of any Shares, or
(v) seeking any material diminution in the benefits expected to be derived by

promulgated, amended, issued or deemed applicable (i) to Merger Sub or (ii) to
the Offer or the Merger by any court, government or governmental,
administrative or regulatory authority or agency, domestic or foreign, other
than the routine application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to
the Offer or to the Merger, which might, directly or indirectly, result in any
of the consequences referred to in clauses (i) through (v) of paragraph (a)
above;

(c) it shall have been publicly disclosed or Merger Sub shall have
otherwise learned that (i) any person, entity (including the Company or any of

I-1

<PAGE>

formation of a group or otherwise, or shall have been granted any right, option
or warrant, conditional or otherwise, to acquire beneficial ownership of more
than 20% or any class or series of capital stock of the Company (including the
Shares) other than acquisitions for bona fide arbitrage purposes only and
except as disclosed in a Schedule 13D or 13G on file with the SEC on December

any right, option or warrant, conditional or otherwise, to acquire beneficial

party with respect to a Competing Transaction;

which, in the good faith judgment of Parent and Merger Sub with respect to each
and every matter referred to above and regardless of the circumstances
(including any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub) giving rise to any
such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with such
acceptance for payment or payment.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and
Merger Sub and may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub or may be waived by
Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
