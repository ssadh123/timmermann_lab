Since May 12, 1994, representatives of Kash n' Karry Food Stores, Inc. 
(the "Company") have engaged in discussions with certain holders of the 
Company's Senior Floating Rate Notes due August 2, 1996 (the "Old Senior 
Floating Rate Notes"), its 12 3/8% Senior Fixed Rate Notes due February 1, 
1999 (the "Old Senior Fixed Rate Notes"), and its 14% Subordinated Debentures 
due February 1, 2001 (the "Old Subordinated Debentures"), (those holders being 
hereinafter referred to as the "Unofficial Bondholders' Committee"), with 
respect to a proposed capital restructuring of the Company.

On July 27, 1994, the Company and the Unofficial Bondholders' Committee 
agreed in principle to the restructuring of the Company (the "Restructuring"), 
which would be implemented through the consummation of a "prepackaged" plan of 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Plan"). Under 
the agreement in principle, which was memorialized by a term sheet circulated 
among the Unofficial Bondholders' Committee, upon confirmation of the Plan:

(1) Each $1,000 principal amount of the Company's Old Senior Floating 
Rate Notes would be exchanged for (a) new Senior Floating Rate Notes due 
December 31, 2002 (the "New Senior Floating Rate Notes") in an original 
principal amount equal to $1,000 plus 100% of the accrued interest under the 
Old Senior Floating Rate Notes from and including February 3, 1994, through 
but not including the petition date, or, at such holder's election, (b) new 
11.5% Senior Fixed Rate Notes due December 31, 2002 (the "New Senior Fixed 
Rate Notes") in the same original principal amount;

(2) Each $1,000 principal amount of the Company's Old Senior Fixed 
Rate Notes would be exchanged for (a) New Senior Floating Rate Notes in an 
original principal amount equal to $1,000 plus 100% of the accrued interest 
under the Old Senior Fixed Rate Notes from and including February 2, 1994, 
through but not including the petition date, or, at such holder's election, 
(b) New Senior Fixed Rate Notes in the same original principal amount;

(3) the Old Subordinated Debentures would be exchanged for 
newly-issued common stock of the Company representing 85 percent of the common 
stock to be outstanding on the effective date of the Plan (the "Effective 
Date");

(4) Green Equity Investors, L.P., would invest $10 million cash in 
exchange for newly-issued common stock of the Company representing 15 percent 
of the common stock to be outstanding on the Effective Date;

(5) all of the existing preferred stock, common stock, and options 
and warrants to purchase common stock of the Company would be extinguished; 
and 

(6) the rights of trade creditors and other secured creditors of the 
Company would be unimpaired.

<PAGE>
The Company intends to solicit acceptances of the Plan from all creditors 
that would be impaired under the Plan. If, as a result of such solicitation, 
the voting requirements prescribed by Section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code are 
satisfied, the Company intends to file with the Bankruptcy Court a voluntary 
petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and to 
seek, as promptly thereafter as is practicable, confirmation by the Bankruptcy 
Court of the Plan. 

Consummation of the Restructuring will be subject to a number of 
contingencies, including confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court, and 
there can be no assurance as to when the Restructuring will be consummated, or 
whether it will be consummated as contemplated in the agreement in principle.

On July 27, 1994, the Company obtained a commitment from BankAmerica 
Business Credit, Inc. to provide the Company with debtor-in-possession 
financing in the form of a revolving credit facility of up to $40 million, 
subject to certain terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that the 
Bankruptcy Court will approve the debtor-in-possession financing.

As part of the Restructuring, Ronald J. Floto was replaced as Chairman of 
the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, effective as 
of August 1, 1994. Anthony R. Petrillo succeeds Mr. Floto as acting Chairman 
of the Board and acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Thomas A. 
Whipple, already Executive Vice President-Marketing, was appointed Chief 
Operating Officer of the Company.
