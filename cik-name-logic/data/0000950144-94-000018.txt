Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors
Peoples Financial Services, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peoples
Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1992. 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Peoples Financial
Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1992, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 1992 and 1991

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Peoples Financial Services, Inc. (the "Company") was organized in
March, 1990, for the purpose of becoming a holding company for
Peoples Bank and Trust of the Cumberlands (the "Bank"). The
Bank is a state chartered bank organized in June 1988. The
accounting and reporting policies of Peoples Financial
Services, Inc. and subsidiary conform to generally accepted
accounting principles. The following is a description of the
more significant of those policies which the Company follows in
preparing and presenting its consolidated financial statements.

(a) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Peoples Financial Services, Inc. and
Peoples Bank and Trust of the Cumberlands, its
wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated in
consolidation.

(b) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents include cash, interest-bearing deposits in
other banks, and federal funds sold. Generally federal
funds are sold for one-day periods.

Cash and due from banks include legal reserve requirements
which must be maintained on an average basis in the form
of cash and balances due from the Federal Reserve Bank
and other banks in the amount of $204,000 and $67,000 at
December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

(c) SECURITIES

Securities are classified as investment securities or
securities available for sale and primarily consist of
U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. Government
agencies and mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-
backed securities are comprised substantially of
participating interests in pools of long-term first
mortgage loans originated and serviced by the issuers of
the securities.

Management determines the appropriate classification of
securities at the time of purchase. If management has
the intent and the Company has the ability at the time
of purchase to hold securities until maturity, they are
classified as investments and carried at amortized
historical cost. Securities to be held for indefinite
periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity
are classified as available for sale and carried at the
lower of cost or market value. Securities held for
indefinite periods of time include securities that
management intends to use as part of its asset/liability
management strategy and that may be sold in response to
changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment risk and
other factors related to interest rate and resultant
prepayment risk changes.

Premiums and discounts are amortized using the
straight-line method, which approximates the interest
method, over the remaining period to contractual
maturity, adjusted for prepayments. Gains and losses on
the sale of securities available for sale are determined
using the specific identification method and are
included in other operating income, including
adjustments to lower of aggregate cost or market.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(d) LOANS RECEIVABLE

Loans receivable are recorded at the unpaid principal
balance owed by borrowers less deferrals, unearned
interest, the allowance for loan losses and purchase
discounts. Discounts on loans purchased are accreted to
interest income using the interest method over the
remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for
prepayments. Unearned income on consumer loans is
recognized over the lives of the loans using the
interest method.

The allowance for loan losses is based upon analyses of the
loans receivable portfolio and is maintained at a level
considered adequate by management to provide for
probable loan losses. The analyses include management's
consideration of such factors as economic conditions,
loan portfolio characteristics, prior loan loss
experiences, and results of reviews of the portfolio.
The allowance is increased by provisions charged against
income and reduced by net charge-offs. While management
believes it has established the allowance for possible
loan losses in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and has taken into account the
views of its regulators and the current economic
environment, there can be no assurance that in the
future the Bank's regulators or its economic environment
will not require further increases in the allowance.

Loans which management has doubts as to the borrower's
ability to repay principal or interest are placed on
nonaccrual status. Interest payments received on
nonaccrual loans are recognized as income on a cash
basis.

(e) LOAN ORIGINATION AND COMMITMENT FEES AND RELATED COSTS

Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized in
income using the interest method, over the contractual
lives of the loans, adjusted for estimated prepayments
based on the Bank's historical prepayment experience.
Commitment fees and costs relating to commitments whose
likelihood of exercise is remote are recognized over the
commitment period on a straight-line basis. If the
commitment is subsequently exercised during the
commitment period, the remaining unamortized commitment
fee at the time of exercise is recognized over the life
of the loan as an adjustment of yield. Deferred fees
relating to loans on nonaccrual status are not
amortized.

(f) INCOME TAXES

Deferred income taxes are recognized for income and expense
items that are reported in different years for financial
reporting purposes and income tax purposes using the tax
rate applicable to the year of the calculation.

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
SFAS No. 109 requires a change from the deferred method
to the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Under the asset and liability method,
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences of "temporary differences" by applying
enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and
liabilities. Under SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. If
necessary, deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance to an amount that is more likely
than not to be realized.

The Company will adopt SFAS No. 109 in the first quarter of
1993. Upon adoption, the principles of this statement
may be applied retroactively through restatement of
previously issued statements, or on prospective basis
through a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle. It is estimated that adoption of SFAS No.
109 will result in an incremental increase in the net
deferred tax asset of approximately $80,000, subject to
any valuation allowance, the precise amount of which has
not been determined. It is expected that this amount
will be reported separately as the cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle in the consolidated
statement of earnings and will result in an increase in
net earnings for the year ending December 31, 1993.

(G) PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Premises and equipment are carried at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. These assets
are depreciated using accelerated methods under the
guidelines of the Internal Revenue Service. The
difference between depreciation calculated using the
accelerated method and that under generally accepted
accounting principles is insignificant.

</TABLE> 

At December 31, 1992 and 1991, loans on which the accrual of interest had been 
discontinued totaled $98,000 and $71,074, respectively. During the
years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, gross interest income that would have
been recorded on loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis if the loans had
been current throughout the periods, and the amount of interest income that
was recorded for such loans during these periods was not material. There
were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers on nonaccrual
status.

In the ordinary course of business, the Bank makes loans
to directors and executive officers and their related interests. Such
loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest and
collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with
other borrowers and did not involve more than the normal risk of
collectibility or present other unfavorable features. Loans to directors and
executive officers and their related interests are as follows:

(4) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK
AND SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company is a party to financial instruments with 
off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of 
business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in 
interest rates. These financial instruments include 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of 
credit. Those instruments involve, to varying 
degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in 
excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated 
balance sheets. The contractual notional amounts of 
those instruments reflect the extent of involvement 
the Company has in particular classes of financial 
instruments. 

The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of 
nonperformance by the other party to the financial 
instrument for commitments to extend credit and 
standby letters of credit is represented by the 
contractual notional amount of those instruments. 
The Company uses the same credit policies in making 
these commitments and conditional obligations as it 
does for on-balance-sheet instruments. 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a 
customer as long as there is no violation of any 
condition established in the contract. Commitments 
generally have fixed expiration dates or other 
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. 
Since some commitments are expected to expire without 
being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not 
necessarily represent future cash requirements. The 
Company evaluates each customer's credit worthiness 
on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral 
obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon 
extension of credit is based on management's credit 
evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies 
but may include property, plant, and equipment and 
income-producing commercial properties. 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments 
issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of 
a customer to a third party. The credit risk 
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially 
the same as that involved in extending loan 
facilities to customers. 

Outstanding standby letters of credit as of December 31, 
1992 and 1991, amounted to $142,000 and $190,000, 
respectively. Outstanding commitments to lend at 
fixed and variable rates were $530,000 and $623,000 
at December 31, 1992. Outstanding commitments to 
lend at variable rates were $1,600,000 at December 
31, 1991. The fixed-rate commitments at December 31, 
1992 ranged from 6.5% To 9.0%. Undisbursed advances 
on customer lines of credit were $4,275,000 at 
December 31, 1992 and $3,700,000 at December 31, 
1991. The outstanding standby letters of credit, 
commitments and undisbursed customer lines of credit 
generally have terms of one year or less. The Bank 
does not anticipate any losses as a result of these 
transactions. 

Most of the Company's business activity is with customers 
located within the state of Tennessee. A majority of 
the loans are secured by residential or commercial 
real estate or other personal property. The loans 
are expected to be repaid from cash flow or proceeds 
from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers. 
The Company grants residential, consumer, and 
commercial loans to customers primarily throughout 
east Tennessee.

(6) ACQUISITIONS

On February 1, 1993, the Company sold 31,225 shares of
newly-issued common stock in connection with the 
acquisition of Citizens Federal Savings Bank, Rockwood, 
Tennessee, (CFSB) pursuant to a definitive agreement 
entered into by the Company and CFSB in May, 1992. In 
connection with the acquisition, the Company and CFSB 
adopted a Plan of Conversion/Acquisition (Plan) whereby 
CFSB was converted from a federally-chartered mutual 
institution to a federally-chartered stock institution. 
Pursuant to the Plan, shares of capital stock of the 
Company were offered initially for subscription to 
eligible members of CFSB and to certain other persons as 
of specified dates and subject to various subscription 
priorities as provided in the Plan. The capital stock was 
offered at a price determined by the Company's Board of 
Directors based upon an appraisal made by an independent 
appraisal firm. The offering raised gross proceeds of 
approximately $1,405,000, all of which was used in the 
acquisition of CFSB. This business combination will be 
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests and, accordingly, the
Company's historical financial statements presented in future 
reports will be restated to include the accounts and results 
of operations of CFSB. 

In connection with the offering the Company filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As 
of December 31, 1992, the Company had incurred costs of 
$96,856 associated with the offering, which are included 
in other assets. All costs incurred associated with the 
sale of stock and acquisition were deferred and deducted 
from the proceeds of the sale of stock. 

The following unaudited pro forma data summarizes the combined
results of operations of the Company and CFSB as if the
combination had been consummated on December 31, 1992.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

On May 31, 1991, the Company's Bank subsidiary acquired and assumed
from the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) certain assets and
liabilities of the former Tennessee Federal Savings Bank, Bartlett,
Tennessee (TFSB). The Bank paid to the RTC $414,000 for the right to
acquire and assume certain assets and liabilities of TFSB. The
aggregate amount of liabilities assumed approximated $18,788,000 and
the assets acquired approximated $15,886,000, including $11,450,000
of net loans. Also acquired was $2,829,000 in cash equivalents and
$1,575,000 in federal funds sold. As part of the purchase and
assumption agreement with the RTC, the Bank's excess in the fair
value of liabilities assumed from the RTC over the fair value of
assets acquired is funded by the RTC. The Bank has recorded a
receivable of $2,507,853 at December 31, 1991 due from the RTC to
recognize the net liabilities assumed and other miscellaneous items
due from the RTC. Since the RTC paid cash to the Bank for the
difference between the fair value of liabilities and assets, no
goodwill was recorded in connection with this acquisition. Discount
recorded on loans amounted to $2,053,000. The discount is being
accreted to yield a constant rate over the expected life of the loans
acquired. The amount due from the RTC was received in 1992 and
included $400,000 paid by the RTC to the Bank as consideration for a
settlement and release agreement between the RTC and the Bank with
respect to the purchase and assumption agreement.

The transaction was accounted for as a purchase whereby assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their
estimated fair market value as of the acquisition date. Results
of operations of the acquired assets and liabilities have been
included in the Company's consolidated statements of earnings since
acquisition.

(9) RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS

Dividends paid by the Bank are the primary source of funds
available for payment of normal operating expenses of
the Company. Applicable Tennessee statutes and regulations
impose restrictions on the amounts that may be declared by a
subsidiary bank. Under the most restrictive of the statutes
and regulations, the subsidiary bank could declare dividends up
to approximately $3,700,000 and $2,900,000 at December 31, 1992
and 1991, respectively.

(10) CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Regulatory capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board for
bank holding companies which were in effect at December
31, 1992, required a minimum of 5.5 percent for a primary
capital ratio (essentially equity plus the allowance for
loan losses), 6.0 percent for a total capital ratio
(primary capital plus qualifying debt), and 8.0 percent
risk-based capital. The risk-based guideline is based on
the assignment of risk weights to assets and off-balance
sheet items depending on the level of credit risk
associated with them. The Company's capital ratios were
in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements at
December 31, 1992.

(11) STOCK OPTIONS

A senior officer of the Company, as part of his employment
contract, has the option to purchase 2,000 shares of
common stock at the original issue price of $25 per share.
This option may be exercised after the officer completes
ten years of continuous service with the Company. The
option may not be exercised before 1998.

Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements

(1.) Peoples Financial Services, Inc.

Peoples Financial Services, Inc. (the Company), chartered by the state
of Tennessee, was formed in 1989 for the purpose of becoming a holding company
for Peoples Bank & Trust of the Cumberlands (Peoples). Peoples is a state
chartered bank organized in June, 1988. On February 1, 1993, the Company
consummated the acquisition of Citizens Federal Savings Bank (CFSB) of
Rockwood, Tennessee, upon its conversion from a federal mutual to a federal
stock savings bank, resulting in CFSB being held as a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. The acquisition of CFSB was accounted for as a pooling of
interest. See note 4.

(2.) Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were
prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and therefore do not
include all disclosures necessary for a complete presentation of financial
condition, results of operations, and statement of cash flows in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. However, all adjustments which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the
interim financial statements have been included. All such adjustments are of a
normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for the interim periods
are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the
entire year.

(3.) Earnings per Share

Earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings of the company
by the weighted-average common shares outstanding of the company's stock.
Earnings per share includes the earnings from CFSB beginning February 1, 1993,
the date of conversion of CFSB to a stock institution.

The following is a calculation of weighted-average shares:

<PAGE> 28

(4.) Acquisition

On February 1, 1993, the Company sold 31,225 shares of newly-issued
common stock at $45 per share in connection with the acquisition of CFSB
pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into by the Company and CFSB in May,
1992. In connection with the acquisition, the Company and CFSB adopted a Plan
of Conversion/Acquisition (Plan) whereby CFSB was converted from a federally-
chartered mutual institution to a federally-chartered stock institution.
Pursuant to the Plan, shares of capital stock of the Company were offered
initially for subscription to eligible members of CFSB and to certain other
persons as of specified dates and subject to various subscription priorities as
provided in the Plan. The capital stock was offered at a price determined by
the Company's Board of Directors based upon an appraisal made by an independent
appraisal firm. All of the gross proceeds raised in the offering were used in
the acquisition of CFSB. This business combination has been accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests and, accordingly, the Company's historical consolidated
financial statements for the periods prior to the combination have been
restated to include the accounts and results of operations of CFSB.

In connection with the offering, the Company filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering raised
gross proceeds of $1,405,125. All costs incurred associated with the sale of
stock were deferred and deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the stock and
totalled $510,840. Costs associated with the acquisition in the amount of
$30,248 were charged to operations during the year ended December 31, 1992.

The results of operations previously reported by the separate
enterprises and the combined amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements are summarized below.

For the purpose of granting eligible members of CFSB a priority in the
unlikely event of future liquidation, CFSB at the time of conversion
established a liquidation account equal to its retained earnings as of the date
of the latest consolidated balance sheet used in the Company's final conversion
prospectus. In the event of future liquidation of the converted CFSB (and only
in such event), an eligible deposit account holder who continues to maintain
his deposit account shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the
liquidation account in the proportionate amount of the adjusted balance of
deposit accounts held at that time before any liquidation distributions may be
made with respect to capital stock. After the conversion, no dividends may be
paid to the stockholder of CFSB (Peoples Financial) if such dividends reduce
retained earnings of CFSB below the amount required for the liquidation
account.

</TABLE>

At September 30, 1993 and December 31, 1992, loans on which the
accrual of interest had been discontinued totaled $160,718 and $161,429,
respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 1993 and the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1992, gross interest income that would have been
recorded on loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis if the loans had been
current throughout the periods, and the amount of interest income that was
recorded for such loans during these periods, was not material. There were no
commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers on nonaccrual status.

(6.) Income Taxes

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS No. 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
which requires a change from the deferred method of accounting for income taxes
of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11, to the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method of
SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between

F-26
<PAGE> 31
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.

The cumulative amount, net of a valuation allowance in the amount of
$44,489, is $27,324, or $.12 per share, and is shown as the cumulative effect
of change in accounting principle in the consolidated income statements. Prior
years' financial statements have not been restated to apply the provisions of
SFAS No. 109.

At September 30, 1993, deferred tax assets, net of a valuation
allowance of $44,489, were $175,086, and deferred tax liabilities were $9,164.
The Company believes that the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation
allowance, will be realized.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors
Citizens Federal Savings Bank
Rockwood, Tennessee

We have audited the accompanying consolidated Balance Sheets Of Citizens
Federal Savings Bank and subsidiaries (the Bank) as of December 31,
1992 and 1991, and the related consolidated statements of operations, retained
earnings, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period then
ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Bank's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the overall accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

As discussed in note 16, the Bank entered into a supervisory agreement with the
Office of Thrift Supervision in 1991. To comply with the agreement's
requirement to increase regulatory capital ratios, the Bank entered into an
acquisition agreement under which the Bank would convert from mutual to stock
form and be acquired by Peoples Financial Services, Inc., as discussed in note
15. The conversion and acquisition was consummated on February 1, 1993, and 
resulted in an increase of capital above the requirement set forth in the
supervisory agreement. Failure to comply with the remaining provisions of the
agreement could expose the Bank to possible further regulatory sanctions and
enforcement actions.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Citizens
Federal Savings Bank and subsidiaries at December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 1992 and 1991

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of Citizens Federal Savings Bank
and its subsidiaries (the Bank) conform to generally accepted
accounting principles and to general practice within the thrift
industry, where applicable, and to accounting rules prescribed by the
Office of Thrift Supervision. The following is a description of the
more significant of those policies which the Bank follows in
preparing and presenting its consolidated financial statements.

(A) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Citizens Federal Savings Bank and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Citizens Capital Corporation and Citizens Service Corporation. All
significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.

During 1992 and 1990, respectively, Citizens Capital Corporation and
Citizens Service Corporation, formerly wholly-owned subsidiaries,
were merged into Citizens Federal Savings Bank. Citizens Capital
Corporation and Citizens Service Corporation have been included in
the consolidated financial statements since their incorporation,
and the mergers do not affect the comparability of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

(B) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents
consist of cash on hand and interest-bearing deposits with banks,
with original maturities of less than ninety days.

(C) INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS HELD FOR SALE

Investments consist of U.S. Government and agency obligations.
Management determines the appropriate classification of investments
at the time of purchase. If management has the intent and the Bank
has the ability at the time of purchase to hold securities until
maturity, they are classified as investment securities and carried
at amortized historical cost. Securities to be held for indefinite
periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are
classified as held for sale and carried at the lower of cost or
market value. Securities held for indefinite periods of time
include securities that management intends to use as part of its
asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold in
response to changes in interest rates, the need to increase
regulatory capital, and other similar factors.

Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized into interest
income by a method which approximates the interest method over the
remaining contractual terms of the respective securities. Gains
and losses from the sale of investments are determined using the
specific identification method.

(D) MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

Mortgage-backed securities represent participating interests in pools
of long-term first mortgage loans originated and serviced by the
issuers of the securities. These securities are carried at cost,
adjusted for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums,
since it is management's intention and the Bank has the ability to
hold them to maturity. Discounts are accreted and premiums are
amortized into interest income by a method which approximates the
interest method over the remaining contractual terms of the
respective securities adjusted for actual prepayments. Gains and
losses from the sale of mortgage-backed securities are determined
using the specific identification method.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(E) LOANS RECEIVABLE AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans receivable are stated at unpaid principal balances, net of
discounts, deferred loan origination fees, and the allowance for
loan losses. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost
or fair value. Management determines the appropriate
classification at the date of origination.

Unamortized discounts on consumer loans are recognized over the
contractual lives of the loans using a method which approximates
the interest method.

Uncollectible interest on loans that are contractually ninety days or
more past due is charged off or an allowance is established. The
allowance is established by a charge to interest income equal to
all interest previously accrued, and income is subsequently
recognized only to the extent cash payments are received until, in
management's judgment, the borrower's ability to make periodic
interest and principal payments is back to normal, in which case
the loan is returned to accrual status.

(F) LOAN ORIGINATION FEES AND RELATED COSTS

Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized in income using the
interest method over the contractual lives of the loans, adjusted
for expected prepayments and loan sales. If deferred fees are
associated with a loan placed on nonaccrual status, amortization of
the fees is ceased.

(G) LOAN SERVICING FEES

Fees arising from servicing loans for others are recognized as earned.

(H) OFFICE PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

Office properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is computed primarily on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets.

(I) REAL ESTATE OWNED

Real estate acquired either through loan foreclosure or in-substance
foreclosure is initially recorded at the lower of the related loan
balance, less any specific allowance for loss, or fair value at the
date of foreclosure. Costs relating to developing and improving
property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding
property are expensed.

Valuations are periodically performed by management. If the carrying
value of a property exceeds its fair value, an allowance is
established through a provision for losses charged to earnings.

(J) ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON LOANS AND REAL ESTATE OWNED

Provisions for losses on loans and accrued interest are charged to
earnings when it is determined that the investment in such assets
is greater than their fair value.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The allowance for estimated loan losses is based upon analyses of the
loan receivable portfolio and is maintained at a level considered
adequate by management to provide for potential loan losses. The
analyses include management's consideration of such factors as
economic conditions, loan portfolio characteristics, prior loan
loss experiences, and results of reviews of the portfolio.

Management believes that the allowances for losses on loans and real
estate owned are adequate. While management uses available
information to recognize losses on loans and real estate owned,
future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on
changes in future economic conditions. In addition, various
regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination
process, periodically review the Bank's allowances for losses on
loans and real estate owned. Such agencies may require the Bank to
recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments of
information available to them at the time of their examination.

(K) INVESTMENTS REQUIRED BY LAW

The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, is
required to acquire and hold shares of stock in the Federal Home
Loan Bank, subject to certain minimum levels. The stock is carried
at cost and dividends are recognized as income when received.

(L) TAXES ON INCOME

Deferred income taxes are provided on items which are reported in
different years for tax purposes than for financial statement
purposes.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board in February 1992. Statement 109 requires a change from the
deferred method to the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred
income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of "temporary
differences" by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and
liabilities. Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred taxes of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.

Statement 109 must be adopted in 1993. Upon adoption, the provisions
of the Statement may be applied without restating prior years'
financial statements or may be applied retroactively by restating
any number of consecutive prior years' financial statements. The
Bank has not determined the impact that Statement 109 will have on
its consolidated financial statements or the method that it will
use to initially apply the Statement.

(M) DEFERRED EXPENSES

Deferred debt issuance costs, adjusted for amortization, are
classified as other assets. These costs are recognized on a
straight-line method over the contractual term of the related debt.
As early retirement of the debt occurs, the amortization period is
adjusted to coincide with the expected term of the debt.

related to loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis. No income was 
recorded on loans in nonaccrual status during 1992, 1991, and 1990. As of
December 31, 1992, there were no commitments to extend additional credit to
borrowers who had loans in nonaccrual status.

In the ordinary course of business, the Bank makes loans to directors and 
executive officers and their related interests. Such loans were made on
substantially the same terms, including interest and collateral, as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other borrowers and 
did not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility or present other
unfavorable features. Loans to directors and executive officers and their
related interests are as follows:

(9) BONDS PAYABLE

During 1985, the Bank initiated a long-range restructuring
program which resulted in the formation of
Citizens Capital Corporation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary. In conjunction with the
restructuring, the Bank exchanged approximately
$12.8 million in first mortgage loans for
guaranteed mortgage pass- through certificates
issued by the Federal National Mortgage
Association (FNMA certificates) with an effective
yield of approximately 8.8 percent. The FNMA
certificates were transferred to Citizens Capital
Corporation, which issued approximately $9.6
million in bonds payable, secured by the FNMA
certificates. The bonds bore interest at 11.375
percent, and were scheduled to mature on February
1, 2003.

During 1992, the Bank paid in full its obligation under the
bonds prior to the merger of Citizens Capital
Corporation into the Bank. The FNMA certificates
held by Citizens Capital Corporation were
transferred to the Bank.

The reasons for the differences between actual income tax expense
(benefit) and the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate
to the earnings (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) are as follows:

<TABLE> 
<CAPTION>

1992 1991 1990

-------- ------- --------
Actual income tax expense (benefit) $ 106,793 97,962 (66,409)
======== ======= ========
</TABLE>
The Bank is allowed a special bad debt deduction for tax
purposes limited generally to the greater of 8%
of otherwise taxable income or actual loss experience. 
The Bank used the experience method in 1992, 1991, and
1990. If the amounts that qualify as deductions for
Federal income tax purposes under the percentage method
are later used for purposes other than for bad debt
losses, they will be subject to Federal income tax at
the then current corporate rate. Retained earnings at
December 31, 1992 and 1991, includes approximately
$550,000 and $475,000, respectively, for which federal
income tax has not been provided.

(11) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION

The Bank has a noncontributory, defined-benefit retirement
plan for substantially all eligible employees. The
Bank is a member of the Financial Institutions
Retirement Fund, which is a nonprofit pension trust
through which the Federal Home Loan Bank, savings banks
and similar institutions may cooperate in providing for
the retirement of their employees. No contributions
were required in 1992, 1991, and 1990. The Bank's
policy is to fund pension costs as accrued.

As of December 31, 1991 the Bank had recorded a liability
for deferred directors' compensation of $161,820. In
January 1992, the Bank paid its deferred compensation
obligation to its directors and terminated all deferred
compensation agreements. Deferred compensation expense
amounted to $0, $61,679 and $28,563 for the years ended
December 31, 1992, 1991 and 1990, respectively.

(13) FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act
of 1991 (FDICIA) was signed into law on December 19,
1991. FDICIA includes provisions requiring "prompt
corrective action" for insured depository institutions
that do not meet certain capitalization criteria.
Regulations implementing the prompt corrective action
provisions of FDICIA became effective on December 19,
1992. In addition to the prompt corrective action
requirements, FDICIA includes significant changes to
the legal and regulatory environment for insured
institutions, including reductions in insurance
coverage for certain kinds of deposits, increased
supervision by the federal regulatory agencies,
increased reporting requirements for insured
institutions, and new regulations concerning internal
controls, accounting, and operations.

The prompt corrective action regulations define specific
capital categories based on an institution's capital
ratios. The capital categories, in declining order,
are "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized,"
"undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized,"
and "critically undercapitalized." To be considered
"adequately capitalize," an institution must generally
have a leverage ratio of at least 4%, a Tier 1 risk-
based capital ratio of at least 4%, and a total
risked-based capital ratio of at least 8%. An
institution is deemed to be "critically
undercapitalized" if it has a tangible equity ratio of
2% or less.

After consideration of the capital infusion received on
February 1, 1993, as discussed in note 15, the Bank
meets the criteria for "adequately capitalized" as
defined by FDICIA and the minimum capital level
required by the supervisory agreement discussed in note
16.

(14) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK AND
SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with
off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business
to meet the financing needs of its customers and to
reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates. These financial instruments consist of
commitments to extend credit and undisbursed lines of
credit. The commitments involve elements of credit and
interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized
in the consolidated balance sheets. The contract or
notional amounts of those instruments reflect the
extent of involvement the Bank has in particular
classes of financial instruments.

The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to the financial
instrument for commitments to extend credit and unused
lines of credit is represented by the contractual
notional amount of those instruments. The Bank uses
the same credit policies in making these commitments
and conditional obligations as it does for
on-balance-sheet instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a
customer as long as there is no violation of any
condition established in the contract. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
Since many of the commitments are expected to expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts
do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The Bank evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on
a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral
obtained if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension
of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of
the borrower. Collateral held varies but may include
property, plant, or equipment.

The Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans of
approximately $633,000 at December 31, 1992. The
commitments were composed entirely of fixed rate loans
with interest rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.875%. The
Bank had undisbursed advances on customer lines of
credit of approximately $594,000 and $215,000 at
December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively. There were
no commitments to purchase or sell loans at December
31, 1992.

Most of the Bank's business activity is with customers
located within Roane County and adjacent counties in
East Tennessee. A majority of the loans are secured by
residential or commercial real estate or other
commercial property. The loans are expected to be
repaid from cash flow or proceeds from the sale of
selected assets of the borrower. The Bank grants
residential, consumer, and commercial loans to
customers in Roane County and adjacent counties.

The Bank has four loans with an aggregate net carrying
value of $2,122,771 at December 31, 1992 that are
secured by commercial real estate located in Texas,
Mississippi, Virginia, and Florida.

(15) CONVERSION/ACQUISITION

In order to increase its regulatory capital levels to
comply with the supervisory agreement described in note
16, on May 20, 1992, the Bank entered into an
acquisition agreement under which the Bank would
convert from mutual to stock form and be acquired by
Peoples Financial Services, Inc. (Peoples).
Previously, in April 1992, the Bank filed an
application with the OTS to convert from mutual to
stock form under the modified conversion regulations,
but the OTS determined that the Bank could not utilize
the modified conversion regulations. Under the terms
of the agreement with Peoples, shares of Peoples common
stock were offered to eligible members of Citizens
Federal. Any shares not purchased by eligible members
of Citizens Federal were sold through a direct
community offering by Peoples. At the time of the
acquisition by Peoples, Citizens Federal converted from
a Federally-chartered mutual savings bank to a
Federally-chartered stock savings bank. The
acquisition by Peoples received approval from all
required regulatory authorities and was consummated on
February 1, 1993. As a result of the stock offering,
gross proceeds of approximately $1,405,000 were
generated.

As of December 31, 1992, the Bank had incurred $367,567 of
costs associated with the conversion / acquisition, of
which $30,248 was charged to operations and $337,219
had been deferred. All deferred conversion costs have
been netted against the proceeds of the stock offering
by Peoples subsequent to the conversion / acquisition.
After netting deferred conversion costs against the
proceeds of the stock offering, the Bank increased its
capital by approximately $896,000. As a result of the
capital infusion, the Bank increased its tangible
capital above the level required by the supervisory
agreement.

For the purpose of granting eligible members of the Bank a
priority in the event of future liquidation, the Bank
at the time of conversion established a liquidation
account equal to its retained earnings as of the date
of the latest consolidated balance sheet used in the
final conversion offering circular. In the event of
future liquidation of the converted bank (and only in
such event), an eligible deposit account holder who
continues to maintain his deposit account shall be
entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation
account, in the proportionate amount of the adjusted
balance from deposit accounts held at that time, before
any liquidation distributions may be made with respect
to capital stock. After the conversion, no dividends
may be paid to stockholders if such dividends reduce
retained earnings of the Bank below the amount required
for the liquidation account.

(16) SUPERVISORY AGREEMENT

The Bank entered into a supervisory agreement with the
Office of Thrift Supervision in September 1991. The
agreement requires the Bank to:

o Plan for an increase in tangible capital to at least
five percent of total assets by December 31, 1992.

o Plan for the reduction of classified assets, which are
principally comprised of loans secured by commercial
real estate located outside Tennessee (note 14), to
less than 100% of tangible capital plus general
valuation allowances by December 31, 1992.

o Modify certain lending and operating practices. None
of the required modifications is expected to
significantly impact operations or earnings.

Management has taken substantive steps to comply with each
of the requirements discussed above.

with and shall comply in all material respects with applicable law and the
regulations governing its preparation.

cause to be taken any action, whether before or after the Effective Time, that
would disqualify the Merger as a "pooling of interests" for accounting purposes

to be delivered to Corporation a list, reviewed by PFS's counsel, identifying
all affiliates of PFS (as such term is used in Rules 144 and 145 promulgated by

received in the Merger until such time as financial results covering at least
30 days of combined operations of Corporation and PFS shall be published and

becomes an affiliate of Corporation) following the Effective Time, (i) will not
offer to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the shares of Corporation Common
Stock received pursuant to the Merger in violation of the Securities Laws, (ii)
will acknowledge the placement of a legend on the certificate(s) representing
the "affiliate's" shares of Corporation Common Stock referring to the issuance
of such shares in a transaction to which

8
<PAGE> 9
said Rule 145 is applicable, and (iii) will acknowledge the giving of
stop-transfer instructions to Corporation's transfer agent with respect to the
"affiliate's" certificates evidencing Corporation Common Stock received in the
Merger, which shall be effective absent evidence of compliance with said Rule
145. Corporation shall during the period any "affiliates" hold shares of
Corporation Common Stock so restricted comply with the requirements of Rule
144(c) under the Securities Act of 1933 to allow such shares of Corporation
Common Stock held by such "affiliates" to be transferrable by the "affiliates"
in compliance with paragraphs (c), (e), (f) and (g) of Rule 144.

3.10 Employee Benefits. At, or as soon as administratively
feasible after, the Effective Time, employees and officers of PFS and each PFS

Subsidiary, including, but not limited to, participation in Corporation's
Employee Stock Ownership Plan, Savings Investment Plan, life, medical and
hospitalization and disability insurance, and sick pay, vacation, personal
leave and severance benefits, on a non-discriminatory and substantially similar
basis. For purposes of providing such benefits to employees and officers of

Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting,
and benefit amounts paid or privileges provided.

3.11 Dividends. Beginning with the second calendar
quarter of 1994 and for each succeeding calendar quarter thereafter prior to
the calendar quarter in which the Effective Time shall occur, PFS may declare
and pay dividends on shares of PFS Common Stock in an amount not to exceed $.72
per share of PFS Common Stock; provided, however, except as hereinbelow
provided, PFS shall not declare or pay any dividends or make any distributions
in any amount on PFS Common Stock in the quarter in which the Effective Time
shall occur and in which the shareholders of PFS Common Stock are entitled to
receive regular quarterly dividends on the shares of Corporation Common Stock
into which the shares of PFS Common Stock have been converted. It is the
intent of this Section 3.11 to provide that the holders of PFS Common Stock
will receive either the payment of cash dividends on their shares of PFS Common
Stock or the payment of cash dividends as the holders of shares of Corporation
Common Stock received in the Exchange for the calendar quarter in which the
Effective Time shall occur, but will not receive and will not become entitled
to receive for the same calendar quarter both the payment of a cash dividend as
a holder of PFS Common Stock and the payment of a cash dividend as a holder of
Corporation Common Stock.

3.12 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to

9
<PAGE> 10
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger, each party to
this Agreement shall take all such necessary action.

disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other plan,
arrangement or understanding (whether or not legally binding)
providing benefits to any current or former employee or director of
PFS or any PFS Subsidiary (collectively, "Benefit Plans"). Except as
Previously Disclosed, there exist no employment, consulting,
severance, termination or indemnification agreements, arrangements or
understandings between PFS or any PFS Subsidiary and any officer,
director or key employee of PFS or any PFS Subsidiary.

[ii] PFS has Previously Disclosed a list and brief
description of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA")) (sometimes

15
<PAGE> 16
referred to herein as "Pension Plans"), all "employee welfare benefit 
plans"(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other Benefit 
Plans maintained, or contributed to, by PFS or any PFS Subsidiary for 
the benefit of any officers or employees of PFS or any PFS Subsidiary.
PFS has delivered to Corporation true, complete and correct copies of 
(1) each Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Benefit Plans, 
descriptions thereof), (2) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 
filed with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Benefit 
Plan, (if any such report was required), (3) the most recent summary 
plan description for each Benefit Plan for which such summary plan
description is required, and (4) each trust agreement and group annuity
contract relating to any Benefit Plan. No Benefit Plan provides 
medical or hospitalization benefits to retirees or other former 
employees, other than medical benefits required to be provided to 
qualified beneficiaries under the provisions of Section 4980B(f) of 
the Code and paid for entirely by the individual electing such 
coverage under Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

[iii] Each Benefit Plan has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms. Except as Previously
Disclosed, PFS, each PFS Subsidiary and all the Benefit Plans are in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. All
reports, returns and similar documents with respect to the Benefit
Plans required to be filed with any governmental agency or distributed
to any Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely filed or
distributed. There are no investigations by any governmental agency,
termination proceedings or other claims (except claims for benefits
payable in the normal operation of the Benefit Plans), suits or
proceedings against or involving any Benefit Plan or asserting any
rights or claims to benefits under any Benefit Plan that could give
rise to any liability, and, to the best knowledge of PFS, there are
not any facts that could give rise to any liability in the event of
any such investigation, claim, suit or proceeding.

[iv] All Pension Plans have been the subject of
determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect
that such Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from Federal income
taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. No
such determination letter has been revoked nor, to the best knowledge
of PFS, has revocation been threatened, nor has any such Pension Plan
been amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its
qualification or materially increase its costs.

[v] No Pension Plan that PFS, any PFS Subsidiary
or any other company under common control with PFS (within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) maintains, or to

16
<PAGE> 17
which PFS, any PFS Subsidiary or any other company under common control
with PFS (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) is 
obligated to contribute, other than any Pension Plan that is a 
"multiemployer plan" (as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of 
ERISA) (collectively, the "Multiemployer Pension Plans"), had, as of the
respective last annual valuation date for each such Pension Plan, an
"unfunded benefit liability" (as such term is defined in Section 
4001(a)(18) of ERISA). Except as Previously Disclosed, PFS is not aware
of any facts or circumstances that would change the funded status of any
such Pension Plan. None of the Pension Plans has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived. All contributions to,
and payments from, the Benefit Plans required to be made in accordance
with the Benefit Plans and, when applicable, Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, have been timely made, and there has been no
application for or waiver of the minimum funding standards imposed by
Section 412 of the Code with respect to any Pension Plan. All such
contributions to, and payments from, the Benefit Plans (except those
payments to be made from a trust qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code), for any period ending before the Effective Time that are not yet,
but will be, required to be made, will be properly accrued and reflected
in the proper books and records of PFS at the Effective Time. None of
PFS, any PFS Subsidiary or any officer of PFS or any PFS Subsidiary or
any of the Benefit Plans of PFS and any PFS Subsidiary which are subject
to ERISA, including the Pension Plans, or any trusts created thereunder,
any administrator or, to the best knowledge of PFS, any trustee thereof,
has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of
fiduciary responsibility under Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of ERISA that
could subject PFS, any PFS Subsidiary or any officer of PFS or any PFS 
Subsidiary to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section 502(i) or (1) of
ERISA. Neither any of such plans nor any of such trusts have been 
terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event" (as that term is 
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect thereto during the last 
five years. Neither PFS, any PFS Subsidiary, any administrator, nor, to
the best knowledge of PFS, any trustee or other fiduciary, of any 
Benefit Plan nor any agent of any of the foregoing has engaged in any 
transaction or acted or failed to act in a manner that could subject PFS
or any PFS Subsidiary to any material liability for breach of fiduciary
duty under ERISA or any other applicable law. Neither PFS nor any PFS
Subsidiary (or any other employer that since September 2, 1974 has ever
been treated as a "single employer" under Section 414(b)(c) or (m) of the
Code with PFS or any PFS

17
<PAGE> 18
Subsidiary) has ever been required to contribute to any Multiemployer 
Pension Plans.

[vi] With respect to any Pension Plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA (including for purposes of clause (1) below, any
Pension Plan maintained or contributed to by PFS or any other company
under common control with PFS within the meaning of Section 414 of the
Code and, for purposes of clause (2) below, any Pension Plan
maintained or contributed to by PFS or any other company under common
control with PFS within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA):
PFS has not incurred any material liability on or prior to the date
hereof (1) to such Pension Plan or (2) to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation other than for the payment of premiums, all of which have
been paid when due. PFS has furnished to Corporation the most recent
actuarial report or valuation with respect to each Pension Plan that
is a "defined benefit pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA). The information supplied to the actuary by PFS for use in
preparing those reports or valuations was complete and accurate and
PFS has no reason to believe that the conclusions expressed in those
reports or valuations are incorrect.

[vii] With respect to any Benefit Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan: (1) no such Benefit Plan is unfunded or funded
through a welfare benefits fund, as such term is defined in Section
419(e) of the Code, (2) each such Benefit Plan that is a group health
plan, as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code,
complies with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the
Code and (3) each such Benefit Plan (including any such Plan covering
retirees or other former employees) may be prospectively amended or
terminated without material liability to PFS or any PFS Subsidiary on
or at any time after the Effective Time.

[viii] Each employee bonus or profit sharing plan
providing benefits to any current or former officer, director or
employee of PFS or any PFS Subsidiary is terminable by PFS or such PFS
Subsidiary without notice at any time.

M. Labor Matters.

[i] PFS and each PFS Subsidiary is in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable laws respecting employment
and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages
and hours and occupational safety and health;

[ii] There is no unfair labor practice charge or
complaint or any other matter against or involving PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of PFS, threatened

18
<PAGE> 19
before the National Labor Relations Board or any court of law;
[iii] Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary is a party
to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement or any similar
labor union arrangement;

[iv] There are no charges, investigations,
administrative proceedings or formal complaints of discrimination
(including discrimination based upon sex, age, marital status, race,
color, religion, national origin, sexual preference, disability,
handicap or veteran status) pending or, to the knowledge of PFS
threatened, before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any
federal, state or local agency or court against PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary;

[v] There have been no governmental audits of the
equal employment opportunity practices of PFS or any PFS Subsidiary
and, to the knowledge of PFS, no basis for any such claim exists; and

[vi] PFS and each PFS Subsidiary is in compliance in
all material respects with the requirements of the Americans With
Disabilities Act.

N. Brokers. Neither PFS, any PFS Subsidiary, nor any of
their respective officers, directors or employees, has employed any broker,
finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for fees or commissions
payable to any broker, finder or financial advisor in connection with the
negotiations relating to or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

O. Assets. PFS and each PFS Subsidiary has good and
marketable title to all of the properties and assets, real and personal,
tangible and intangible, reflected on the PFS Financial Statements or acquired
after the dates thereof, free and clear of all liens, charges, security
interests, encumbrances and claims, except for [i] liens for current taxes not
yet due and payable, [ii] pledges to secure deposits and other liens incurred
in the ordinary course of its business, and [iii] such imperfections or
irregularities of title, easements, claims, liens, charges, security interests
and encumbrances, if any, as do not materially affect the use of the properties
or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair
business operations at such properties. All leases by which either of PFS or
any PFS Subsidiary leases real or personal property as lessee (other than
leases that are the equivalent of extensions of credit) are valid without
default in any material respect thereunder by the lessee or, to the best
knowledge of PFS, the lessor, and are in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms.

P. Material Contracts. Except as Previously Disclosed,
neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary is a party to any:

19
<PAGE> 20

[i] agreement, arrangement or commitment not made
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

[ii] employment agreement or any bonus, incentive,
deferred compensation, severance pay, profit sharing, retirement,
stock purchase, stock option agreement or arrangement or employee
benefit plan for or in respect of any employee or former employee;

[iii] collective bargaining agreement or other
agreement with any labor union or labor organization;

[iv] material agreement, indenture or other
instrument relating to the borrowing of money, or the guaranty of any
obligation for the borrowing of money or any agreement that involves a
potential material liability (other than in the ordinary course of its
business);

[v] any agreement, contract or commitment
containing any covenant materially limiting the freedom of PFS or any
PFS Subsidiary to engage in any line of business in any geographic
area or to compete with any person; or

[vi] agreement for loans or the provision,
purchase or sale of goods, services or property, or other contract or
commitment with any director or officer.

Q. Good Standing of Contracts. No event or condition has
occurred or exists, or, to the best knowledge of PFS, is alleged by any of the
other parties thereto to have occurred or existed, which constitutes, or with
lapse of time or giving of notice or both might constitute, a default or breach
under any of the leases, contracts or agreements to which PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary is a party, which default is reasonably likely to result in a
material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operation or
business of PFS or any PFS Subsidiary.

R. Insurance. PFS has Previously Disclosed true and
complete copies of all policies of fire, theft, liability and other insurance
and bonds maintained with respect to the assets or businesses of PFS and each
PFS Subsidiary, the effective dates thereof and the premiums payable with
respect thereto. All such policies and bonds are valid and enforceable and in
full force and effect and neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has received any
notice of premium increases or cancellations with respect to any of such
policies and bonds. To the best knowledge of PFS, neither PFS nor any PFS
Subsidiary is liable for any material retroactive premium adjustments with
respect to any of its insurance policies or bonds.

20
<PAGE> 21
S. Tax Matters. Each member of the consolidated group
of which PFS is a member or has ever been a member (the "Group") has timely
filed or caused to be filed all federal, state, foreign and local income,
franchise, gross receipts, payroll, sales, use, withholding, occupancy, excise,
real and personal property, employment and other tax returns, tax information
returns and reports required to be filed, and has paid, or made adequate
provisions for the payment of, all taxes, duties or assessments of any nature
whatsoever, interest payments, penalties and additions (whether or not
reflected in its returns as filed) due and payable (and/or properly accruable
for all periods ending on or before the date of this Agreement) to any city,
county, state, foreign country, the United States or any other taxing
authority. The most recent PFS Financial Statements reflect an adequate
reserve for all taxes payable by PFS and each PFS Subsidiary accrued through
the date of such Financial Statements. No material deficiencies for any taxes
have been proposed, asserted or assessed against PFS or any PFS Subsidiary that
are not adequately reserved for. Except with respect to claims for refund, the
federal income tax returns of PFS and each PFS Subsidiary consolidated in such
returns have been examined by and settled with the United States Internal
Revenue Service (the "IRS"), or the statute of limitations with respect to such
years has expired (and no waiver extending the statute of limitations has been
requested or granted) for all years through 1989. The consolidated federal
income tax returns of the Group have not been audited during the last five (5)
fiscal years of PFS. No audit, examination or investigation is presently being
conducted or, to the best knowledge of PFS, threatened by any taxing authority;
no unpaid tax deficiencies or additional liabilities of any sort have been
proposed by any governmental representative; and no agreements for the
extension of time for the assessment of any amounts of tax have been entered
into by or on behalf of any member of the Group.

T. Fiduciary Activities. Each PFS Subsidiary's
fiduciary and custodial activities have been and are being conducted in all
material respects in accordance with all applicable law.

U. Environmental Matters.

[i] PFS and each PFS Subsidiary is in substantial compliance
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations,
ordinances and requirements relating to the environment
("Environmental Laws");

[ii] No "Hazardous Wastes" (as hereinafter defined) have ever
been generated, transported, treated, stored, released or disposed of
on any real property owned or leased by PFS or PFS Subsidiary;

disposed or caused or permitted any person to transport or dispose of
any Hazardous Wastes other than in accordance with all Environmental
Laws;

[iv] Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has ever violated any
of the Environmental Laws;

[v] No asbestos, PCBs or other Hazardous Wastes or any
petroleum product or constituents thereof is present on, in or under
any of the property owned by PFS or any PFS Subsidiary, whether owned
or leased or held as OREO (as such term is customarily used) or in
which PFS or any PFS Subsidiary has any legal or equitable interest;

[vi] There are no loans or other credits included in the loan
portfolio of any PFS Subsidiary with respect to which PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary is or could incur or become responsible for liability under
the Environmental Laws; and

[vii] No Hazardous Wastes have ever been utilized on any of
the property now held or previously held by PFS or any PFS Subsidiary
as collateral or otherwise securing any loan made by PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary.

Hazardous Wastes" for purposes of this Agreement shall include,
without limitation: [i] hazardous substances or hazardous wastes, as those
terms are defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq., the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq., and any other applicable federal,
state or local law, rule, regulation, ordinance or requirement, all as amended
or hereafter amended; [ii] petroleum, including without limitation crude oil
or any fraction thereof which is liquid at standard conditions of temperature
and pressure (60 degrees Fahrenheit and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute);
[iii] any radioactive material , including without limitation any source,
special nuclear, or by-product material as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 2011 et
seq.; and [iv] asbestos or any asbestiform minerals in any form or condition.

V. Insider Loans. All loans, loan commitments and any
other extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit that are currently
outstanding by PFS or any PFS Subsidiary to directors, officers, or principal
shareholders of PFS or any PFS Subsidiary or any of their related interests,
were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and
collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with
other persons, and substantially comply with all applicable provisions of
federal and state law. Such loans, extensions and commitments do not involve
more than a normal risk of collectability.

22
<PAGE> 23
W. Adjustable Rate Mortgages. Each PFS Subsidiary has
properly calculated, in accordance with the contractual terms thereof and all
applicable law, all adjustments required in its portfolio of adjustable rate
mortgage notes.

X. Regulatory Matters. Neither PFS nor any PFS
Subsidiary has, through the date hereof, taken or agreed to take any action or
has knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would materially impede or delay
receipt of any approval referred to in Section 5.2E hereof.

Y. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as
disclosed in the PFS SEC Documents or Previously Disclosed, since December 31,
1992, PFS and the PFS Subsidiaries have not incurred any material liability,
except in the ordinary course of their business consistent with their past
practices, nor has there been any change, or any event involving a prospective
change, in the business, assets, financial condition or results of operations
of PFS or any of its PFS Subsidiaries that has had, or is reasonably likely to
have, a material adverse effect on PFS and PFS's Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Z. Full Disclosure. No representation or warranty of
PFS contained in this Agreement and no statement contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate or other instrument furnished to Corporation hereunder
contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or
will omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements contained
herein or therein not misleading.

business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or
the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
necessary.

accordance with their terms.

B. SEC Documents. Corporation has made available to PFS
a true and complete copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
definitive proxy statement filed by Corporation with the Commission since
January 1, 1991 (as such documents have since the time of their filing been
amended, the "Corporation SEC Documents"), which are all the documents that
Corporation was required to file with the Commission since such date. As of

24
<PAGE> 25
their respective dates, the Corporation SEC documents complied in all material
respects with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder applicable to such
Corporation SEC Documents, and none of the Corporation SEC Documents contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact

comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Commission) and fairly
present the consolidated financial position of Corporation and its consolidated
subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended. All material agreements,
contracts and other documents required to be filed as exhibits to any of the

Form 10-Q of the Commission) and will fairly present the consolidated financial
position of Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended.

disclosed in the Corporation SEC Documents, since December 31, 1992,

prospective change, in the business, assets, financial condition or results of

the Corporation Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

or any actions, suits, proceedings, arbitrations or investigations pending or,
to the best knowledge of Corporation, threatened against Corporation or any
Corporation Subsidiary or against any asset, interest or right of any such
company that might, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, results of operation or business of
Corporation or any Corporation Subsidiary, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any governmental entity or arbitrator outstanding
against Corporation or any Corporation Subsidiary having or which, insofar as
reasonably can be foreseen, in the future could have any such effect.

F. Employee Benefit Plans. Each bonus, pension, profit
sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock
purchase, stock option, phantom stock, retirement, vacation, severance,
disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other plan, arrangement
or understanding (whether or not legally binding) providing benefits to any
current or former employee or director of Corporation or any Corporation
Subsidiary has been administered in all material respects in accordance with
its terms and is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code.

Exhibit 2(b)

PLAN OF MERGER

THIS PLAN OF MERGER ("Plan") is made and entered into as of
this 27th day of December, 1993, by and between TRANS FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.,
a Kentucky corporation ("Corporation") and PEOPLES FINANCIAL SERVICES INC., a
Tennessee corporation ("PFS").

W I T N E S S E T H :

PFS is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of
the State of Tennessee, the authorized capital stock of which consists of [i]
100 shares of organizational common stock with $10.00 par value per share ("PFS
Organizational Common Stock") of which at the date hereof no shares are issued
and outstanding and [ii] 1,000,000 shares of common stock without par value
("PFS Common Stock"), of which at the date hereof 236,777 shares are issued and
outstanding and fully paid and nonassessable, and 3,111 shares are reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options.

The respective Boards of Directors of Corporation and PFS have
determined that it is desirable to effect a Plan and Agreement of
Reorganization (the "Agreement"), for the general welfare and advantage of
Corporation and PFS and their respective shareholders, under which plan PFS
would be merged into Corporation, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement
and this Plan.

The respective Boards of Directors of PFS and Corporation have
approved and adopted the Agreement and this Plan and have authorized the
execution hereof.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the
mutual agreements and undertakings herein contained, the parties hereby agree
as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan
and the Agreement, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), PFS shall be
merged with and into Corporation (the "Merger") in accordance with the
provisions of and with the effect provided in the Kentucky Business Corporation
Act (the "KBCA") and the Tennessee Business Corporation Act ("TBCA"). The
terms of the Merger shall be as set forth in the Agreement and in this Plan.
<PAGE> 2
1.2 Articles of Merger. Upon the terms and conditions set forth in
the Agreement and this Plan, Articles of Merger (the "Articles of Merger")
shall be duly prepared and executed by Corporation and PFS, and thereafter
delivered to the Secretary of States of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the
State of Tennessee for filing, as provided in the KBCA and the TBCA on the
Closing Date, as defined in the Agreement. The Merger shall become effective
upon filing with the Kentucky Secretary of State and the Tennessee Secretary of
State or at such time and date thereafter as is provided in the Articles of
Merger (the "Effective Time").

1.3 Effect of Filing.

A. At the Effective Time, [i] the separate existence of
PFS shall cease and PFS shall be merged with and into Corporation (sometimes
herein referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and [ii] the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

B. At the Effective Time, the officers and Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of those persons serving
as the officers and directors of Corporation immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

C. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will have
the effects set forth in Section 271B.11-060 of the KBCA and Section 48-21-107
of the TBCA and as otherwise provided by law.

ARTICLE 2

CONVERSION OF SHARES

2.1 Conversion of PFS Capital Stock.

A. Conversion of PFS Common Stock. Each share of PFS
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, automatically, by virtue of the Merger and at the Effective Time, be
exchanged for and converted, without any further notice to or on the part of
the holder thereof, into 5.5 shares of Corporation Common Stock, subject to
Sections 2.1.B and 2.1.C hereof (the "Exchange Ratio"). All shares of PFS
Common Stock shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and each
certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent
the right to receive the Corporation Common Stock into which such PFS Common
Stock has been converted. Certificates previously representing shares of PFS
Common Stock shall be exchanged for Corporation Common Stock issued in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance
with Section 2.2.

B. Reclassifications. If prior to the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Corporation Common Stock shall have been

<PAGE> 3
increased, decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities by reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or other like changes in
Corporation's capitalization, all without Corporation receiving consideration
therefor, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made in the
number and kind of shares of Corporation Common Stock to be thereafter
delivered pursuant to this Plan of Merger.

C. No Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip of any
kind will be issued by Corporation to any shareholder of PFS in respect of any
fractional interest in Corporation Common Stock arising out of the conversion
of PFS Common Stock into Corporation Common Stock in the Merger and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
rights of a shareholder of the Corporation. No holder of PFS Common Stock will
have any rights in respect of a fractional interest in Corporation Common Stock
arising out of the Merger except the right to receive in lieu thereof a cash
payment in a dollar amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the
average of the bid and asked price per share, as quoted by the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ"), for
Corporation Common Stock on the trading day which occurs immediately prior to
the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, "trading day" shall mean any
day on which securities are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

A. As of the Effective Time, the Corporation shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with Peoples Bank & Trust of the
Cumberlands, Cookeville, Tennessee (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of
the holders of PFS Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section
2.2, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of
Corporation Common Stock (such certificates for shares of Corporation Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section
2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of PFS Common Stock.

B. At and after the Effective Time, each person (other
than Corporation) who immediately prior to the Effective Time held of record
shares of PFS Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, upon the surrender of
the certificate(s) which represented such shares (individually a "Certificate"
and collectively the "Certificates") to Corporation, together with a letter of
transmittal (in the form contemplated by Section 2.2.C) duly executed, the
consideration specified in Section 2.1.

C. On, or within seven (7) days after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail or deliver to each holder

3
<PAGE> 4
(other than Corporation), who immediately prior to the Effective Time held of
record shares of PFS Common Stock, a form letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or payment therefor. No interest will be paid or accrue on any
consideration payable on the surrender of such Certificate. If delivery of
certificates of Corporation Common Stock is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be
a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of Corporation that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

D. At and after the Effective Time, holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of PFS except for
the right to receive upon such surrender the consideration specified in Section
2.1.

E. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
after the Effective Time with respect to Corporation Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Corporation Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.1.C until the holder of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following the surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
holder of such Certificate(s) representing whole shares of Corporation Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of
Corporation Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1.C and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Corporation Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Corporation Common Stock.

F. After the Effective Time, except to the extent
necessary to issue replacement Certificates for any Certificates which may have
been lost or stolen or to comply with the payment instructions contained in a
letter of transmittal contemplated by Section 2.2.C., there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of PFS of any
Certificates formerly

4
<PAGE> 5
evidencing the shares of PFS Common Stock which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

G. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the shareholders of PFS for six months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Corporation, upon demand, and any shareholders
of PFS who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter
look only to the Corporation for payment of their claim for Corporation Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Corporation Common Stock and
any dividends or distributions with respect to Corporation Common Stock.

H. Neither PFS nor the Corporation shall be liable to
any holder of shares of PFS Common Stock for such shares or Corporation Common
Stock into which they are converted (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash in lieu of fractional shares delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

2.3 Dissenting Shareholders. If any holder of shares of PFS
Common Stock shall, in accordance with the provisions of applicable law, seek
appraisal and perfect dissenting shareholder rights to be paid the fair value
of his or her shares ("Dissenting Shares"), then such holder shall be entitled
to receive such value as may be established pursuant to such provisions. PFS
shall give Corporation prompt notice of any written objections or demands
received from any shareholder pursuant to such provisions, and shall give
Corporation the opportunity to participate in all proceedings with respect to
any such objections or demands. PFS will pay its dissenting shareholders the
value of their stock out of its own funds. No funds will be supplied for that
purchase, directly or indirectly, by Corporation, nor will Corporation directly
or indirectly reimburse PFS for any payments to dissenters.
2.4 Corporation Common Stock. The shares of capital stock
of Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain issued and outstanding at the Effective Time and shall not be
effected by the Merger.

ARTICLE 3

TERMINATION

Anything contained in this Plan notwithstanding and
notwithstanding adoption hereof by the shareholders of PFS, this Plan may be
terminated and the Merger abandoned as provided in the Agreement.

5
<PAGE> 6
ARTICLE 4

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

The obligations of Corporation and PFS to effect the Merger as
herein provided shall be subject to satisfaction, unless duly waived, of the
conditions set forth in the Agreement.

ARTICLE 5

interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
