Item 5. Other Events

On January 5, 1994 Borden, Inc., announced that the Company recorded a fourth
quarter 1993 pretax charge of $752.3 million, $567.4 million after tax, to
provide for a restructuring and business divestiture program. The program
involves the divestment of North American snacks, seafood, jams and jellies and
other businesses, for which a charge of $637.4 million, $490.0 million after
tax, was recorded for estimated losses on disposal. The program also involves
organizational restructuring to achieve cost reductions, including severance
costs for workforce reduction, for which a charge of $114.9 million, $77.4
million after tax, was recorded.

Also in fourth quarter 1993, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $94.1
million, $64.6 million after tax for asset writedowns and changes in accounting
estimates, primarily relating to the cost of consumer and trade promotion.

The Company also announced that it had adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," retroactive to January 1, 1993. The cumulative effect of the
accounting change as of January 1, 1993 will reduce first quarter and 1993 net
income by $18.0 million. First quarter operating results will be restated to
reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change. The effect of the
change on current year results was not material.
