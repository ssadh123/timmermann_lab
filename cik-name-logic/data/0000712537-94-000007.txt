Reliable Financial Corporation
428 Station Street
Bridgeville, PA 15017-2002

Attention: Mr. Stephen Grippi
President and Chief Executive Officer

Letter of Intent

Gentlemen:

This will confirm the willingness of First Commonwealth
Financial Corporation ("FCFC") and Reliable Financial Corporation
("Reliable") to effect a merger between Reliable and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of FCFC to be created expressly for the merger,
and having the name "Interim Reliable, Inc.", on the following
terms and conditions:

(1) Upon the effective date of the merger (the
"Merger") of Reliable into Interim Reliable, Inc.
(the "Effective Date"), each outstanding share of
Reliable Common Stock, par value $.01 per share,
will be exchanged for 1.6 shares of FCFC Common
Stock, par value $5 per share (the "FCFC Common
Stock"). Fractional shares of FCFC Common Stock
will not be issued; in lieu thereof, FCFC will pay
cash for such fractional share at the rate of $19
for one whole FCFC share. On the Effective Date,
the name of Interim Reliable, Inc. will
automatically be changed to Reliable Financial 
Corporation.

(2) The transaction will be structured as a tax-free 
reorganization and the receipt by the Reliable
shareholders of the FCFC Common Stock in exchange
for their Reliable Common Stock will not be a
taxable event.

(3) The transaction will also be structured to qualify
for pooling of interests accounting treatment
under generally accepted accounting principles and
the accounting rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 20.1 (Continued)

Reliable Financial Corporation March 14, 1994

(4) The liquidation account established by Reliable on
March 30, 1992 in connection with its conversion
from the mutual to the stock form shall continue
to be maintained after the Effective Date in
accordance with the regulations of the Office of
Thrift Supervision.

(5) The Merger will, of course, be subject to the
approval of the Boards of Directors of Reliable
and FCFC, the Reliable shareholders, the Office of
Thrift Supervision, the Federal Reserve Board, the
Pennsylvania Department of Banking and such other
regulatory agencies as may be required, and to the
execution by Reliable and FCFC of a mutually
satisfactory and definitive Merger agreement,
containing such representations, warranties,
covenants, conditions and other provisions as
Reliable and FCFC may agree to.

(6) At the date of execution of the definitive Merger
agreement, the Board of Directors of Reliable
shall have received the opinion of its investment
advisor, Ryan Beck & Co., that the price to be
paid by FCFC represents fair value to Reliable
shareholders (the "fairness opinion"). In
addition, at closing of this transaction Reliable
shall have received an updated fairness opinion
from Ryan Beck that the transaction represents
fair value to the Reliable shareholders at the
time of closing. Receipt of each of these
opinions shall be a condition of closing in the
definitive agreement.

If the foregoing is acceptable to you, please so
indicate by signing a copy of this letter in the space provided
below and returning it to me. Upon receipt, we will be prepared
to meet with you and your representatives for the purpose of
preparing the definitive Merger agreement.

Exhibit 20.1 (Continued)

legally binding agreement of Reliable or FCFC, and Reliable and
FCFC expressly disclaim the creation of any legally binding
contractual or other obligation to each other or to third
parties.

Such obligations, if any, will arise only if and when a
definitive Merger agreement is signed by Reliable and FCFC.

Very truly yours,
