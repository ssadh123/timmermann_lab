not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is
understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section,
Section 8 and Section 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of
their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel,
transfer taxes on resale of any of the Series A Preferred
Securities by them, and any advertising expenses in connection with
offers they may make.

7. (a) The several obligations of the Underwriters
hereunder, as to Series A Preferred Securities to be delivered at

(liquidation value) of preferred interests by a special purpose
subsidiary of the Guarantor permitting the issuance of the Series
A Preferred Securities and the transactions relating thereto
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions herein
set forth and containing no provision unacceptable to you, it being
understood that the Notice in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (a copy of which has been delivered to you) does not
contain any such unacceptable provision, and that no subsequent
Notice shall be deemed to contain any such unacceptable provision,
unless you, within 24 hours after receiving a copy thereof from the
Guarantor, shall give notice to the Guarantor to the effect that
such Notice contains an unacceptable provision.

(ii) At such Time of Delivery, approval shall
have been given by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission of
the Section 1102 Application, and such approval shall be in full
force and effect.

<PAGE>

proceedings for that purpose shall be pending before, or
threatened by, the Commission;

qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;

(C) subsequent to the date of the most recent
financial statements incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus as of the date of this Agreement, there shall
have been no material adverse change or development which
it is reasonable to believe will result in a prospective
material adverse change in the financial condition,
business or results of operations of the Company or the
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, considered as a whole,
except as set forth in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by
reference therein, as of the effective date of this
Agreement;

(D) the Company and the Guarantor shall have
performed all agreements contained herein to be performed
by them at or prior to such date, including delivery of
the Securities; and

(B) a favorable opinion, dated at such Time
of Delivery, of Richards, Layton & Finger (Delaware
Counsel for the Company and the Guarantor) in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to you;

(C) a favorable opinion, dated at such Time
of Delivery, of corporate counsel for the Guarantor
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
you; and

(D) a favorable opinion, dated at such Time
of Delivery, of Drinker Biddle & Reath (Counsel for

satisfactory to you.

12

<PAGE>

(v) At the time that this Agreement is signed and
at such Time of Delivery, Coopers & Lybrand shall have furnished to
you a letter or letters, dated the respective date of delivery
thereof, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you.

(vi) At such Time of Delivery, the Series A
Preferred Securities to be delivered at such Time of Delivery shall

on the New York Stock Exchange;

(vii) The Guarantor shall have furnished or
caused to be furnished to you at such Time of Delivery certificates
of officers of the Guarantor satisfactory to you as to the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the Company and the
Guarantor herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the
performance by the Company and the Guarantor of all of their
obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of
Delivery, as to the matters set forth in this subsection (a) of
this Section 7 and as to such other matters as you may reasonably
request; and

(viii) After the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to such Time of Delivery (A) trading generally
shall not have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as
the case may be, the New York Stock Exchange or the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (B) trading of any
security issued by the Company or the Guarantor shall not have been
suspended on any exchange or in any other over-the-counter market,

Pennsylvania shall not have been declared by either Federal or New
York State or Pennsylvania authorities, and (E) there shall not
have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any
calamity or crisis of comparable magnitude that, in your judgment,
is material and adverse and, in the case of any of the events
specified in clauses (A) through (E), singly or together with any
other such event makes it, in your reasonable judgment,
impracticable or inadvisable to market the Series A Preferred
Securities to be delivered at such Time of Delivery on the terms
and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

(b) The obligations of the Company and Guarantor to
deliver the Securities to be delivered at each Time of Delivery are
subject to the following conditions:

(i) At such Time of Delivery, no stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall be
in effect and no proceedings for that purpose shall be pending
before, or threatened by, the Commission.

13

<PAGE>

(ii) At such Time of Delivery, there shall be
in full force and effect a Notice of Registration of a Securities
Certificate of the Guarantor in respect of the issuance of its
Subordinated Debentures and Guarantee(s) in connection with the
issuance of an aggregate principal amount of up to $350,000,000
(liquidation value) of preferred interests by a special purpose
subsidiary of the Guarantor permitting the issuance of the Series
A Preferred Securities and the transactions relating thereto
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions herein
set forth and containing no provision unacceptable to the
Guarantor, it being understood that the Notice in effect as of the
date of this Agreement does not contain any such unacceptable
provision, and that no subsequent Notice shall be deemed to contain
any such unacceptable provision, unless the Guarantor, within 24
hours after receiving a copy thereof, shall have given notice to
you to the effect that such Notice contains an unacceptable
provision;

(iii) At such Time of Delivery, approval shall
have been given by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission of
the Section 1102 Application, and such approval shall be in full
force and effect; and

(iv) At such Time of Delivery, the Company
shall receive payment for the Series A Preferred Securities to be
delivered at such Time of Delivery.

8. (a) The Company and the Guarantor agree jointly and
severally to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each
person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses based upon (x) any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement (including the Prospectus contained therein and including
any amendment or supplement to any thereof) or any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or, (y) to the extent not covered by clause (x), any
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary
Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto
or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading all in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, except in either case insofar as such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are caused by (i)
any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement
or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the
Company or Guarantor by any Underwriter expressly for use therein,
or (ii) the failure of any Underwriter to send to any purchaser to
whom it had sent a Preliminary Prospectus an amended prospectus as
shall have been furnished by the Company or the Guarantor for such

14

<PAGE>

purpose (excluding documents incorporated therein by reference), if
required by the Act, to the extent that the amended prospectus
would have cured the defect in the Preliminary Prospectus giving
rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or (iii) any
use of the Prospectus by any Underwriter after the expiration of
that period, if any, during which the Underwriter is required by
law to deliver a prospectus, unless the Company and Guarantor shall
have been advised in writing of such intended use.

(b) Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its controlling persons and partners and
the Guarantor and its controlling persons, directors, and officers
to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and
Guarantor to each Underwriter, but only with respect to any untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based
upon information furnished in writing to the Company or the
Guarantor by such Underwriter expressly for use in such
Registration Statement or Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus. In
case any action shall be brought against the Company or Guarantor
or any such controlling person, partner, director or officer in
respect of which he or it may seek indemnity or reimbursement from
any Underwriter on account of the agreement of such Underwriter
contained in this subsection (b), the Underwriter shall have the
rights and duties given to the Company and Guarantor, and the
Company and Guarantor and any such controlling person, partner,
director, or officer shall have the rights and duties given to the
Underwriter, by subsection (c) below.

(c) Each Underwriter agrees that, promptly upon the
receipt of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding
(including any governmental action) against such Underwriter or
against any person so controlling such Underwriter in respect of
which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought from the Company or
Guarantor on account of its agreement in the next preceding
subsection (a), timely notice will be given to the Company and the
Guarantor of the commencement thereof. Thereupon the Company and
the Guarantor shall be entitled to participate in (and, to the
extent that it shall desire, including the selection of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Underwriter or controlling person,
to direct) the defense thereof and shall in any event be liable to
pay all fees and expenses thereof. Any Underwriter or any such
controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel,
but if the Company or Guarantor has selected counsel in any such
case, such employment by an Underwriter or controlling person shall
be at its expense unless (i) the employment of such separate
counsel has been authorized in writing by the Company and Guarantor
and the Company and Guarantor shall have agreed to pay such expense
or (ii) the Underwriter or controlling person shall have been
advised by its counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses
available to it which are different from or additional to those
available to the Company or the Guarantor and in the reasonable
judgment of such counsel it is advisable for such indemnified party

15

<PAGE>

to employ separate counsel. It is understood that the Company and
Guarantor shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local
counsel) for all Underwriters and controlling persons, and that all
such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.
Such counsel shall be designated in writing by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
and consented to by the Company and Guarantor, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The Company and Guarantor shall not
be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding
effected without its written consent, but if settled with its
written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff
in any such action or proceeding, the Company and Guarantor agree
jointly and severally to indemnify and hold harmless each
Underwriter and each such controlling person, if any, from and
against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or
judgment. The Company and Guarantor shall not, without the prior
written consent of any such Underwriter or controlling person,
effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in
respect of which any such Underwriter or controlling person is or
could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought
hereunder by any such Underwriter or controlling person, unless
such settlement includes an unconditional release of any such
Underwriter or controlling person from all liability on claims that
are the subject matter of such proceeding.

(d) In order to provide for just and equitable
contribution in circumstances in which any indemnity provision
provided for in this Section 8 is for any reason held to be
unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in
accordance with its terms (including the requirements of subsection
(c) of this Section 8), each indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the
losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature
contemplated in said indemnity provision in such proportion as is
equitable and as shall reflect both the relative benefit received
by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the
Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, on the other hand
from the offering of the Securities, and the relative fault, if
any, of the Company and Guarantor on the one hand and of the
Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, on the other hand
in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in
such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit
received by the Company and Guarantor on the one hand and the
Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, on the other hand
in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed
to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the
offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by
the Company and the Guarantor bear to the total commissions,
concessions and discounts received by the Underwriter or

16

<PAGE>

Underwriters, as the case may be. The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand or the
Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, on the other hand
and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the
Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any
other method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to hereinabove. The amount paid
or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
liabilities, claims, damages and expenses referred to hereinabove
shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. No
Underwriter or person controlling such Underwriter shall be
obligated to make contribution hereunder which in the aggregate
exceeds the total public offering price of the Securities purchased
by such Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount
of any damages which such Underwriter and its controlling persons
have otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or
any substantially similar claim. The Underwriters' obligations to
contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchasing
obligations and not joint.

9. If any one or more of the Underwriters shall default in
its obligation to purchase the amount of Series A Preferred
Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of
Delivery, in accordance with the terms hereof, and the aggregate
number of Series A Preferred Securities which such defaulting
Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to
purchase is not more than one-eleventh of the aggregate number of
Series A Preferred Securities to be purchased on such date, the
other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions
that the number of Series A Preferred Securities which they have
respectively agreed to purchase at such Time of Delivery bears to
the aggregate number of Series A Preferred Securities which all
such non-defaulting Underwriters have collectively agreed to
purchase at such Time of Delivery, or in such other proportions as
you may specify, to purchase the Series A Preferred Securities
which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed
or refused to purchase at such Time of Delivery; provided that in
no event shall the number of Series A Preferred Securities that any
Underwriter has agreed to purchase at a Time of Delivery be
increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of

17

<PAGE>

one-tenth of such number of Series A Preferred Securities without
the written consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or
Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase any Series A
Preferred Securities and the aggregate number of Series A Preferred
Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed
but failed or refused to purchase exceeds one-eleventh of the
aggregate number of Series A Preferred Securities to be purchased
by all Underwriters hereunder at such Time of Delivery and
arrangements satisfactory to you, the Company and Guarantor for the
purchase of such Series A Preferred Securities are not made within
48 hours after such default, this Agreement (or, with respect to
the Second Time of Delivery, the obligations of the Underwriters to
purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Series A Preferred
Securities) will terminate without liability on the part of any
non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company and Guarantor for the
purchase or sale of any Series A Preferred Securities (or Optional
Series A Preferred Securities, as the case may be) under this
Agreement. Any action taken under this Section 9 shall not relieve
any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default
of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations,
warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor and
the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by
or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement,
shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by
or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any
Underwriter, or the Company, the Guarantor or any officer or
director or controlling person of the Company or the Guarantor, and
shall survive delivery of and payment for the Series A Preferred
Securities.

11. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section
9 hereof, the Company and the Guarantor shall not then be under any
liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Section 6 and
Section 8 hereof; but if, for any other reason, any Securities are
not delivered by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantor as
provided herein, the Company and the Guarantor jointly and
severally will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out-
of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and
disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters
in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the
Securities not so delivered, but the Company and the Guarantor
shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except
as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.

12. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of
each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled
to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on
behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you jointly or by
Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of you as the Underwriters.

All statements requests, notices and agreements hereunder
shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered

18

<PAGE>

or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the
Underwriters in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., at 85 Broad Street,
New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department:
and if to the Company or the Guarantor shall be delivered or sent
by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the
Guarantor set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention:
Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter
pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail,
telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address
set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting
such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company
or the Guarantor by you upon request. Any such statements,
requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt
thereof.

13. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to
the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company, the Guarantor and,
to the extent provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the
officers and directors of the Company and the Guarantor and each
person who controls the Company, the Guarantor or any Underwriter,
and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors
and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right
under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the
Series A Preferred Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed
a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

14. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used
herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the
Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.

15. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

16. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the
parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts
shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding,
please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof, and upon the
acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters,
this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding
agreement between each of the Underwriters, on the one hand, and
the Company and the Guarantor on the other. It is understood that
your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the
Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of
Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted

19

<PAGE>

to the Company and the Guarantor for examination upon request, but
without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers
thereof.

Very truly yours,
