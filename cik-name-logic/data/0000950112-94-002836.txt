Results of Operations
---------------------

The net income of Commercial Credit Company (the "Company") for the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 1994 was $57.8 million and $166.6
million, respectively, compared to $91.2 million and $215.2 million,
respectively, in the corresponding 1993 periods. The Company's income before
income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles for the three months and nine months ended September
30, 1994 was $94.8 million and $273.8 million, respectively, compared to
$151.5 million and $366.0 million, respectively, in the corresponding 1993
periods. The Company's revenues for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 1994 were $405.1 million and $1,181.9 million, respectively,
compared to $423.8 million and $1,192.3 million, respectively, in the
corresponding 1993 periods.

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 includes
approximately $5.2 million of dividend income from the equity securities of
The Travelers Inc., the Company's parent, that were exchanged for the 
Company's investment in The Travelers Corporation ("old Travelers"). Net 
income for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 includes $21.8 million 
of equity in the income of old Travelers and reported after-tax net 
investment portfolio gains of $7.6 million at Gulf Insurance Company, a 
subsidiary of the Company, and $22.7 million in the Consumer Finance Segment.
Also included in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 is 
an after-tax charge of $2.4 million related to a change in accounting for 
postretirement benefits (FAS No. 106) and an after-tax charge of $3.4 million
related to a change in accounting for postemployment benefits (FAS No. 112)
both of which were adopted during the fourth quarter of 1993 with 
retroactive application to January 1, 1993. Excluding these items, net 
income for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 decreased by $7.5 million
from the 1993 period, reflecting primarily higher net interest costs in the 
Corporate segment, offset in part by higher earnings in the Consumer 
Finance and Insurance Services segments.

At September 30, 1994 the Company had total debt consisting of certificates 
of deposit of $74.0 million, short-term borrowings of $2,491.3 million and 
long-term debt of $3,926.1 million. In addition the Company's total 
stockholder's equity at September 30, 1994 was $1,108.1 million.

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges
----------------------------------

The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994 was 1.85. This ratio has been computed by dividing
earnings available for fixed charges by fixed charges. For the purpose of
this ratio earnings available for fixed charges consist of pre-tax income
from continuing operations adjusted for undistributed equity earnings and
minority interest and fixed charges; and fixed charges consist of interest
expense and that portion of rentals deemed representative of the appropriate
interest factor.
