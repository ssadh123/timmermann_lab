USBANCORP ANNOUNCES DIVIDEND and STOCK
REPURCHASE PROGRAM

PITTSBURGH, PA -- USBANCORP, Inc. (NASDAQ NMS: UBAN) today announced its
quarterly cash dividend on Common Stock. The dividend is $0.22 per share and is
payable April 5, 1994 , to shareholders of record March 8, 1994. Since 1990, 
the dividend has been increased four times or by a total of 340%. On an 
annualized basis, the Company's current Common Stock dividend yield 
approximates 3.5% compared to an average Pennsylvania bank holding company 
yield of 2.5%.

USBANCORP, Inc. also announced that its Board of Directors has adopted a stock
repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may repurchase from time to 
time over the next twelve months up to 237,000 shares or 5% of its Common Stock,
par value $2.50. The Board has authorized a maximum cash outlay to support this
repurchase program of $6.5 million.

With this program, USBANCORP can purchase Common Stock in open market
transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated 
transactions. No shares will be purchased directly from affiliates of 
USBANCORP. Purchases will be executed as market conditions make such purchases
attractive to the Company's shareholders. Purchases under the Program may 
commence and terminate any number of times. At the end of 1993, USBANCORP had 
approximately 4.7 million shares of Common Stock outstanding.

Both announced actions reaffirm the USBANCORP commitment to and strategic focus
on providing a progressive total return to its shareholders. The Company's 
total shareholder return for the period 1988-1993 was 163.7% compared to the 
Standard & Poor's 500 Index total return of 125.6%.

USBANCORP, a community bank holding company, is the parent of U. S. Bank and
USBANCORP Trust Company in Johnstown and two Pittsburgh affiliates, Three Rivers
Bank and Community Bancorp, Inc.. The Company's subsidiaries provide full-
service banking to six Southwestern Pennsylvania counties through forty-one
community offices. The counties served include Allegheny, Cambria, Clearfield,
Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland. At December 31, 1993, USBANCORP had
total assets of $1.2 billion and shareholders' equity of $116.6 million or 
$24.67 per share.
