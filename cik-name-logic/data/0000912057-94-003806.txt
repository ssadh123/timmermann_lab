REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Times Mirror Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Times
Mirror Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Times
Mirror Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes H and K to the consolidated financial statements, in
1992 the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and
postretirement benefits other than pensions.

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany
transactions and balances. Affiliated companies in which the Company owns a 20
percent to 50 percent interest are accounted for by the equity method. The
Company's share of affiliates' operating results is included in "Other, net."

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1993 presentation.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted new accounting principles for
income taxes and postretirement benefits. These changes in accounting are
described in Note H and Note K, respectively.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash equivalents consist of investments that are readily convertible into
cash and generally have original maturities of three months or less.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market and are determined
under the first-in, first-out method for books and certain finished products,
and under the last-in, first-out method for newsprint, paper and certain other
inventories.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment are carried on the basis of cost. Generally,
depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis for buildings, machinery and
equipment.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

Goodwill recognized in business combinations accounted for as purchases
subsequent to October 31, 1970 ($700,904,000 at December 31, 1993, and
$727,331,000 at December 31, 1992--net of accumulated amortization of
$145,295,000 and $149,835,000, respectively) is being amortized over a period of
40 years. Goodwill arising from business combinations consummated prior to
November 1, 1970 is not being amortized because, in the opinion of management,
it has not diminished in value. Goodwill amortization expense, including amounts
related to discontinued operations, amounted to $26,737,000 for 1993,
$25,404,000 for 1992, and $25,648,000 for 1991.

Other intangibles arising in connection with acquisitions are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives from 3 to
21 years. Accumulated amortization was $98,597,000 and $96,453,000 at December
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Company assesses on an ongoing basis the recoverability of intangible
assets, including goodwill, based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows
for the applicable business compared to net book value. If the future
undiscounted cash flow estimate were less than net book value, net book value
would then be reduced to the undiscounted cash flow estimate. The Company also
evaluates the amortization periods of assets, including goodwill and other
intangible assets, to determine whether events or circumstances warrant revised
estimates of useful lives.

DEFERRED CHARGES

Deferred charges, principally book and training material preparation,
printing and duplication costs, are written off over the estimated product life
as the products are sold.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues from certain products sold with the right of return, principally
books, are recognized net of a provision for estimated returns. Magazine,
newspaper and other subscription revenues are deferred as unearned income at the
time of sale. As products are delivered to subscribers, a pro rata share of the
subscription price is included in revenue.

<PAGE>
THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE A -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Magazine subscription selling expenses are deferred as current or noncurrent
assets and charged to expense over the same period as the related revenue is
earned.

RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has defined benefit pension plans and various other contributory
and noncontributory retirement plans covering substantially all employees. In
general, benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on years of service
and the employee's compensation during the last five years of employment. In
determining net periodic pension expense (income), prior service costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years. The defined benefit plans are
funded on a current basis in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974. An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) provides benefits
in conjunction with certain defined benefits, and the fair value of ESOP assets
is recognized as an offset to required funding. The majority of the Company's
employees are covered by one defined benefit plan. Funding is not expected to be
required for this plan in the near future as this plan is overfunded.

Postretirement health care and life insurance benefits provided by the
Company were substantially reduced as a result of plan modifications in 1993.
Various unfunded postretirement health care plans cover employees hired before
January 1, 1993, or approximately half of the Company's current employees. The
plans have significantly different provisions for lifetime maximums, retiree
cost-sharing, health care providers, prescription drug coverage and other
benefits. Postretirement life insurance benefits are generally insured by life
insurance policies and cover employees who retired on or before December 31,
1993. Life insurance benefits vary by plan, ranging from $1,000 to $250,000.
Certain employees become eligible for the postretirement health care benefits if
they meet minimum age and service requirements and retire from full-time, active
service.

VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BENEFICIARY ASSOCIATION

The Company maintains a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA)
trust to fund certain health care benefits. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the
VEBA trust balance of $53,949,000 and $48,895,000, respectively, is included in
"Prepaid and other".

CASH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Under the Company's cash management system, the bank notifies the Company
daily of checks presented for payment against its primary disbursing accounts.
The Company transfers funds from other sources such a short-term investments or
commercial paper issuance, to cover the checks presented for payment. This
program results in a book cash overdraft in the primary disbursing accounts as a
result of checks outstanding. The book overdraft, which was reclassified to
accounts payable, was $41,733,000 and $33,112,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

NOTE C -- ACQUISITION
On October 30, 1992, the Company acquired Wm. C. Brown Communications, Inc.,
a leading publisher of college textbooks. This acquisition was accounted for by
the purchase method and resulted in a non-cash transaction of $30,112,000 for
liabilities assumed. The operations of this company are reflected in the
Company's financial statements from date of acquisition. This acquisition
resulted in goodwill of $66,653,000, which is being amortized over 40 years. Pro
forma results for 1992, assuming this acquisition occurred on January 1, are not
materially different from the results reported.

NOTE D -- RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
Over the past three years, the Company has undertaken a number of
restructuring actions aimed at streamlining or consolidating certain operational
and administrative processes as well as refocusing certain product offerings. In
each of these years, the Company has charged the estimated costs related to
these actions against operations. Remaining liabilities of $116,560,000 related
to these restructuring charges are included in the consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 1993. The majority of this amount will be spent during 1994, with
the remainder, principally related to lease payments, to be paid over lease
periods extending to 2002.

During 1993, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $80,164,000
($47,724,000 after taxes, or 37 cents per share). More than half of this amount
is for severance or pay-related actions and approximately forty percent relates
to leased facilities, product line changes and other costs necessary to
implement the Company's plans. The remainder includes various asset write-offs.

During 1992, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $202,700,000
($123,248,000 after taxes, or 96 cents per share). Nearly two-thirds of this
amount is for severance or pay-related actions. Approximately fifteen percent is
for leased facilities, while the remainder relates to product line changes and
other costs necessary to implement the restructuring plan at Matthew Bender.

During 1991, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $42,300,000
($25,514,000 after taxes, or 18 cents per share) primarily related to voluntary
early retirement and separation programs at the LOS ANGELES TIMES and THE
BALTIMORE SUN.

NOTE E -- NONRECURRING CHARGES
During 1991, the Company sold Broadcasting Publications, Inc. at a loss of
$20,614,000 and recorded a $65,000,000 write-down of the note and other assets
outstanding from the 1987 sale of THE DENVER POST. These items reduced income
from continuing operations before income taxes by $85,614,000 or $52,985,000 (42
cents per share) after applicable income taxes.

NOTE F -- INTEREST EXPENSE
For the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, interest expense of
$84,445,000, $78,244,000 and $90,261,000, respectively, was incurred; $391,000,
$3,963,000 and $13,537,000 of which was capitalized.

Commercial paper borrowings of $358,231,000 and $368,351,000 at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively, carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% in
1993 and 3.5% in 1992. The Company has agreements with several domestic and
foreign banks for unsecured long-term revolving lines of credit which support
its commercial paper borrowings. The domestic agreements, which expire April 27,
1995, provide for borrowings up to $240,000,000 at the banks' base rates. The
commitment fee is 3/20 of one percent per annum. The foreign agreements, which
expire May 25, 1995, provide for borrowings up to $150,000,000 at interest rates
based on, at the Company's option, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR),
certificate of deposit rates or the bank's base rate. The commitment fee is 1/16
of one percent per annum. As of December 31, 1993, the Company had not borrowed
under the agreements. Commercial paper borrowings aggregating $46,231,000 are
classified as long-term obligations at December 31, 1993, since the Company
intends to refinance this debt on a long-term basis. In addition, the Company
has $51,850,000 of unused standby letters of credit at December 31, 1993.

The ten-year notes are callable three years prior to maturity. A medium-term
note for $30,000,000 is callable two years prior to its maturity date of March
20, 1998. The 8.70% Notes are due at the option of the holder five years prior
to maturity. The 8.55% Notes were due at the option of the holder on June 1,
1993, and $500,000 was repaid on that date. The 8 1/4% Notes due April 1, 1996
were called March 1, 1993 and repaid on April 1, 1993. The 8% Notes due December
15, 1996 were called November 15, 1993 and repaid on December 15, 1993.

The Company has an interest rate swap agreement expiring January 22, 1996.
This agreement is for a $100,000,000 notional amount and exchanges payments to
the Company at a fixed rate of 7.4% for payments by the Company at a variable
rate based on a spread over three month LIBOR set in arrears.

The Company has guaranteed the debt of its Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP). Over the remaining term of the debt, interest is payable based on the
lesser of (a) 74 percent of the prime rate or

14

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE I -- DEBT (CONTINUED)
(b) 88 percent of the certificate of deposit rate. The Company has entered into
interest rate swap agreements that exchange interest payments at the prime rate
for payments at fixed rates. As a result of these agreements, the effective
interest rate on the ESOP loans varies, but in no event will it exceed 7.44%.

The Company's agreements with banks contain restrictive provisions relating
primarily to levels of indebtedness and maintenance of net worth. Under the most
restrictive of these agreements, consolidated debt may not exceed 135% of
consolidated net worth, and consolidated net worth must be at least
$1,250,000,000.

At December 31, 1993, the aggregate maturities of debt for the five
subsequent years are as follows (in thousands):

<TABLE>

1998.............................................................................. 140,000
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

The fair value of debt at December 31, 1993, based primarily on the
Company's current refinancing rates for publicly-issued fixed rate debt with
comparable maturities, approximates its carrying value of $1,131,810,000. The
fair value of off-balance-sheet financial instruments is not significant at
December 31, 1993.

In connection with the proposed reorganization (See Note Q), the Company has
commenced a tender offer for $399,500,000 aggregate principal amount of its
fixed-rate debt maturing from 1997 through 2001. The offer is scheduled to end
in mid-December 1994. Proceeds from private sales of short-term securities are
expected to fund the tender and these borrowings are expected to be repaid in
early 1995 when the cable merger is completed. In connection with the short-term
security issuances, the Company expects to increase its unsecured short-term
revolving bank lines of credit to an aggregate amount of $630,000,000. If the
entire $399,500,000 is tendered under the terms of the tender offer, the Company
expects to record an extraordinary loss of approximately $15,000,000 in the
fourth quarter of 1994. In connection with the tender, in September the Company
entered into interest rate swap agreements which commence in January 1995 and
exchange payments at fixed rates for payments at variable rates on an aggregate
principal amount of $200,000,000 of debt. These swaps are expected to be
redeemed upon the successful completion of the tender offer.

In early November 1994, the Company will also file a registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to long-term debt
securities that it intends to offer to exchange for $250,000,000 of its
outstanding long-term debt in connection with the cable television merger. With
respect to this debt, the Company entered into long-term interest rate swap
agreements commencing January 1995 which exchange payments at fixed rates for
payments at variable rates.

As contemplated by the cable merger agreement, the Company expects to borrow
up to approximately $1.36 billion prior to the merger and the related debt will
be assumed by Cox Cable. Part of the proceeds of these borrowings are expected
to be used to retire the short-term securities issued to finance the debt tender
and to redeem, when first callable on February 1, 1995, the $100,000,000 of
8 7/8% Notes due February 1, 1998.

NOTE J -- STOCK OPTION AND AWARD PLANS
The 1984 and 1988 Executive Stock Option Plans, as amended, and the 1992 Key
Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan (Incentive Plan) provide that options may be
granted to key employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a
price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted prior
to December 27, 1991 had a purchase price equal to 75 percent of the fair market
value at the date of grant. The Incentive Plan allows for the granting of
incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and deferred cash incentive
awards. Options that are not exercised expire ten years from the date of grant.
Options generally vest over a four-year period, except that incentive stock
options generally vest nine years and nine months from the date of grant.
Accelerated vesting for incentive stock options is available, based on
performance goals determined by the Board of Directors over a three-year
performance period. The following table sets forth information relative to the

for future grants under the 1984 and 1988 Executive Stock Option Plans and
1,269,024 shares of Series A common stock reserved for future grants under the
Incentive Plan.

The 1982 and 1987 Restricted Stock Plans provide for the sale of 2,800,000
shares of the Company's common stock to key employees, including officers, at a
price equal to par value. The Incentive Plan generally replaced the restricted
stock sales. At December 31, 1993, there were 1,241,280 shares of Series A
common stock reserved for future sales. The Company expects that future sales,
if any, will not be significant.

NOTE K -- RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
In 1985, the Company issued and sold shares of common stock at market value
of $150,000,000 to its ESOP. Repayment of the ESOP's bank debt has been
guaranteed by the Company. Company contributions are the primary source of funds
for the ESOP's repayment of its debt. Benefits provided by the ESOP are
coordinated with certain pension benefits. At December 31, 1993, the ESOP held
3,151,365 shares of Series A common stock and 2,427,512 shares of Series C
common stock. The ESOP currently covers approximately two-thirds of the
Company's employees.

Substantially all employees over age 21 with one year of service are
eligible to participate in the Company's Savings Plus Plan. Eligible employees
may contribute from 1 percent to 13 percent of their basic compensation. The
Company makes matching contributions equal to 50 percent of employee before-tax
contributions from 1 percent to 6 percent. Employees may choose among five
investment options, including a Company common stock fund, for investing their
contributions and the Company's matching contribution.

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106
(SFAS 106) "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," and recorded a cumulative charge of $218,307,000 ($133,376,000 net of
taxes, or $1.04 per share) as of January 1, 1992. SFAS 106 requires that
postretirement health care and life insurance be charged to expense over the
period the benefits are earned. The effect of this change in accounting
principle was to increase postretirement expense in 1992 by $20,221,000
($12,133,000 net of taxes, or 9 cents per share).

The net periodic postretirement benefit expense is as follows (in thousands):

Postretirement benefit expense in 1991, which was charged to expense as

At December 31, 1993, the health care cost trend rate of 12 percent was
assumed to ratably decline to 5.5 percent by 2004 and remain at that level. At
December 31, 1992, the health care cost trend rate of 13 percent was assumed to
ratably decline to 5 percent by 2005 and remain at that level.

Postretirement benefit liability........................................ $ 250,894 $ 252,300
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

The assumed health care cost trend rate can significantly affect
postretirement expense and liabilities. An increase of 1% in the health care
cost trend rate would increase 1993 net periodic postretirement expense by
$1,802,000 and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations as of
December 31,1993 by $15,184,000.

In December 1992 the Company amended its postretirement health care and life
insurance benefit plans to substantially reduce benefits. The effect of the plan
amendments, which reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by
approximately $114,011,000 at December 31, 1992, will be amortized over the
average remaining eligibility period of plan participants.

NOTE L -- LEASES
Rental expense under operating leases, including amounts related to
discontinued operations, amounted to $76,571,000, $79,034,000, and $76,541,000
for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Capital
leases and contingent rentals are not significant. The future minimum lease

NOTE P -- DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
As a result of the proposed reorganization described in Note Q, the
Company's cable television operations are now reported as discontinued
operations.

On March 29, 1993, the Company announced two agreements for the sale of its
four broadcast television stations to Argyle Television Holdings, Inc. (Argyle).
The sale of KTVI-TV, an ABC affiliate in St. Louis, Missouri, and WVTM-TV, an
NBC affiliate in Birmingham, Alabama, was completed in July. The sale of its
remaining two stations, KDFW-TV in Dallas, Texas, and KTBC-TV in Austin, Texas,
both CBS affiliates, was completed near the end of the year. The sale of the
four stations resulted in an after-tax gain of $131,702,000 net of income tax
expense of $76,928,000, or $1.02 per share. At year-end, the Company exercised
its option to increase the cash and decrease the securities portion of the sale
price and received $320 million in cash as well as warrants in Argyle. Most of
the proceeds were received in January 1994 and were used to redeem commercial
paper.

The results of operations of the Broadcast Television segment have been
reported as discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Income.
Prior year financial statements have been reclassified to present the segment as
a discontinued operation. Operating results of the discontinued operations were
as follows (in thousands):

NOTE Q -- PROPOSED REORGANIZATION
In June 1994, the Company signed an agreement to merge its cable television
operations with Cox Cable Communications, Inc. (Cox Cable). It is contemplated
that prior to the merger the Company will borrow approximately $1.36 billion.
The Company will then transfer all of its non-cable operations, including the
$1.36 billion in cash, into a newly formed entity, New Times Mirror, as part of
a tax-free reorganization. Old Times Mirror, then owning the Company's cable
television operations and obligated to pay the newly incurred debt, will be
merged into Cox Cable. Each share of the Company's Series A and Series C common
stock outstanding prior to the merger will be converted into one share of New
Times Mirror Series A or Series C common stock, respectively. As a result,
voting interests in New Times Mirror will remain the same as voting interests in
Old Times Mirror. In addition, all non-Chandler Trust shareholders will receive
common stock of Cox Cable with an estimated aggregate fair value of
$932,000,000. Due to certain constraints imposed by the terms of the Chandler
Trusts, in lieu of common stock of Cox Cable, the Chandler Trusts will receive
non-voting, Series A cumulative preferred stock in New Times Mirror. The fair
value of the preferred stock received by the Chandler Trusts will be
substantially equivalent to the fair value of the Cox Cable common stock
received by the other shareholders, after giving effect to their respective
proportionate interest in Old Times Mirror. The Company expects this transaction
will increase shareholders'

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE Q -- PROPOSED REORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)
equity by approximately $670,000,000 and result in a gain of about $1.62
billion. This transaction is expected to be consummated within the next three to
six months and is subject to certain conditions, including the receipt of
various regulatory approvals.

In connection with the settlement of reorganization-related litigation,
subsequent to the reorganization, shareholders will to be offered the
opportunity to exchange shares of Series A or Series C common stock for shares
of Series B cumulative preferred stock on a one-for-one basis. The Series B
preferred stock will have one vote per share.

At September 25, 1994, the Company had approximately $750,000,000 of
publicly-held notes outstanding. In early November 1994, the Company commenced a
tender offer for $399,500,000 aggregate principal amount of its fixed-rate debt
and expects to file a registration statement with respect to long-term debt
securities that it intends to offer to exchange for $250,000,000 of its
outstanding long-term debt (see Note I).

As previously reported, a number of lawsuits were filed in Delaware and
California seeking to enjoin the proposed reorganization (See Note R for further
information regarding these proceedings). The resolution of these lawsuits is
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

NOTE R -- CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in actions for libel and
other matters arising out of their business operations. In addition from time to
time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved as parties in various
governmental and administrative proceedings, including environmental matters.
The Company does not believe that any such proceedings currently pending will
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, although
an adverse resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters
could have a material impact on results of operations for that period.

A number of lawsuits were filed in Delaware and California in mid-1994
seeking to enjoin the proposed reorganization described in Note Q. On October
11, 1994, the Company announced an agreement to settle all of the shareholder
litigation related to this proposed reorganization. Under the terms of the
settlement, upon completion of the transactions, the Company will offer
shareholders Series B preferred stock. The Chandler Trusts have agreed not to
participate in this exchange offer. In addition, the settlement calls for the
Company, subject to the exercise of the fiduciary duties of its Board of
Directors, to pay an annual dividend of at least 24 cents per share on its
common stock for the three years following the closing of the merger and to pay
up to $6 million for plaintiffs' attorney fees and expenses, subject to court
approval. The settlement of the litigation is subject to the approval of the
Delaware Chancery Court and the California Superior Court in hearings to be
scheduled before year-end, as well as to certain other conditions. The
settlement of this litigation will not have an adverse material impact on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

NOTE S -- TRANSACTIONS WITH AN AFFILIATE
To assure a long-term supply of newsprint for the LOS ANGELES TIMES, the
Company has an agreement to purchase specified quantities of newsprint from a
supplier in which the Company has a 20 percent interest. The specified
quantities represent a majority of the LOS ANGELES TIMES' newsprint requirements
and are purchased at prevailing market prices.
