FOR RELEASE: Monday, October 17

Delmarva Power Announces
Results of Early Retirement Option

Delmarva Power & Light Co. today announced that 296 out of 360 eligible
employees--or 82%--took the early retirement option announced last spring by the
company. Most of the employees are scheduled to leave their jobs by
December 31, 1994.

"The results are about what we expected," said Howard E. Cosgrove,
chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Delmarva Power. "We will
miss the people. While we are losing a lot of experience and expertise, we have
the depth of resources to continue to manage our business successfully. We felt
this cost-cutting move was necessary to help position the company better for the
competition developing in the utility industry."

The company estimates it can save about $13 million to $17 million annually
through a reduced workforce.

Also, the company is evaluating the accounting for the early retirement
option costs, considering the increasing competition in the utility industry.
Depending on the outcome of this evaluation, the company may decide to write off
the cost of the early retirement package against third quarter 1994 earnings
instead of deferring the cost to be amortized over five years as previously
disclosed. The cost of the early retirement option is estimated to be about
$17.5 million.
