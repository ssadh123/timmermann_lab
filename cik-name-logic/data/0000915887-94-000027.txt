Item 5. Other Events

On May 17, 1994, members of the Haft family settled all
legal disputes among themselves relating to, among other things, their
ownership of and restrictions on their holdings of Common Stock of Dart
Group Corporation (the "Corporation"), including those reported in the
Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January
31, 1994 (the "Annual Report"). There now are no contractual restrictions
on the ability of any member of the Haft family to freely transfer his or
her Dart Class B or Class A Common Stock. (See Annual Report at pages 80-82
for a description of the ownership of common stock of the Corporation and
the dispute regarding transfer restrictions which was settled.) All shares
of the Corporation's Common Stock previously held by members of the family,
directly or through partnerships, will now be directly held and voted. (See
Annual Report at page 81, notes 4 and 6, for a description of these holdings
and the claims challenging prior distributions that have been settled.) 

In addition, the settlement agreements, by providing that
all claims between the family and between members of the family and the
Corporation (except for the federal lawsuit between Robert Haft and the
Corporation over his termination) were settled, resolves insofar as possible
the direct and derivative claims asserted by Robert M. Haft his lawsuit
filed in November 1993 in the Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle
County. (See Annual Report at pages 48-51 for a description of Mr. Haft's
Delaware Chancery lawsuit and the transactions challenged thereby.) While
Robert Haft's suit in the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware relating to his employment contracts (see Annual Report at page
50) has not been settled, the parties have agreed to submit the claims to a
non-binding mediation process. The derivative lawsuit filed by Alan R. Kahn
and Tudor Trust (see Annual Report at pages 50-51) is not affected by this
settlement.
