Item 5. Other Information Events.

The following information was included in Deere & Company's
press release
reporting earnings for the quarter.

The following information is disclosed on behalf of the
company's credit subsidiary,
John Deere Capital Corporation, in connection with the
disclosure requirements of
programs providing for the issuance of debt securities:

"John Deere Capital Corporation's net income was $23.0 million
in the first quarter
of 1994 compared with $27.4 million in the same period last year
excluding the
cumulative effect of accounting changes ($23.6 million after
the accounting
changes). Net income excluding the accounting changes was down
from last year,
primarily reflecting lower revenues from a smaller receivable
and lease portfolio
caused by the sales of retail notes in 1993, which was partially
offset by higher
securitization and servicing fee income from retail notes
previously sold but still
administered. Revenues totaled $104.7 million in the first
quarter of 1994 compared
with $115.1 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter
was down from $43.6
million last year to $35.9 million in 1994. 

Total receivable and lease acquisitions by the company
increased 11 percent for the
quarter. The higher acquisitions resulted mainly from an
increased volume of
agricultural and industrial notes. Acquisitions of revolving
charge receivables were
also higher in the first quarter compared to last year,
reflecting continuing growth in
this business.

Net credit receivables and leases financed by John Deere Capital
Corporation were
$3.477 billion at January 31, 1994 compared with $3.933 billion
one year ago. The
decrease in the portfolio was caused by note sales during 1993
as previously
mentioned. Net credit receivables and leases administered,
which include
receivables previously securitized and sold but still
administered, amounted to $4.656
billion at January 31, 1994 compared with $4.520 billion at
January 31, 1993.
