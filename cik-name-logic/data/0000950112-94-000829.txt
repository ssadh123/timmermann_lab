COMBINED COMPANY
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet at
December 31, 1993 gives effect to the completion of Viacom's tender offer for
Paramount Common Stock (the "Paramount Offer") the merger of a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Viacom Inc. with and into Paramount (the "Paramount Merger")
and the merger of Blockbuster with and into Viacom Inc. (the "Blockbuster 
Merger", and with the Paramount Merger, the "Mergers") as if these events had 
occurred on such date, and was prepared based upon the balance sheet of Viacom 
and unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheets of Blockbuster at 
December 31, 1993, and Paramount at January 31, 1994. Viacom's balance sheet 
also contains a pro forma adjustment for the sale of Viacom Class B Common 
Stock to Blockbuster subsequent to December 31, 1993 (See Note 1 herein).

The following unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the
year ended December 31, 1993 gives effect to the completion of the Paramount
Offer, the Paramount Merger, the Blockbuster Merger and the issuance of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock (together, "Preferred Stock") as if
they had occurred simultaneously at the beginning of the period presented. The
unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended December
31, 1993 was prepared based upon the statements of operations of Viacom and
Blockbuster for the year ended December 31, 1993, and of Paramount for the nine
months ended January 31, 1994 and three months ended April 30, 1993 combined.
These unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements, including the notes
thereto, of Viacom which are included herein, and the audited financial
statements and unaudited interim financial statements, including the notes
thereto, of Paramount, which are incorporated by reference.

The unaudited pro forma data are not necessarily indicative of the results
of operations or financial position of either Viacom and Paramount combined or
Viacom, Paramount and Blockbuster combined (the "Combined Company") that would
have occurred if the completion of the Paramount Offer, the Paramount Merger
and the Blockbuster Merger had occurred at the beginning of the period or the
date indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results
or financial position.

The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain
assumptions set forth herein, including the notes to the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial statements, which Viacom, Paramount and Blockbuster
believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The pro forma adjustments
reflect the consideration offered to Paramount stockholders in the Paramount 
Merger (the "Paramount Merger Consideration") and the consideration offered to
Blockbuster stockholders in the Blockbuster Merger (the "Blockbuster Merger
Consideration") (see "Notes 2 and 3", respectively). The Paramount and 
Blockbuster historical information have been adjusted for certain acquisitions,
and certain significant transactions which have occurred or which may occur 
(see Paramount and Blockbuster Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated 
Information.)

Both the Paramount Merger and the Blockbuster Merger will be accounted 
for by the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, Viacom's cost to 
acquire Paramount and Blockbuster, calculated to be approximately $9.9 billion 
and $5.8 billion, respectively, as of March 4, 1994, will be allocated to the 
assets and liabilities acquired according to their respective fair values with 
the excess to goodwill. Viacom's cost to acquire Paramount and Blockbuster 
pursuant to the respective merger agreements is subject to change based 
primarily upon the market value of Viacom Common Stock at the time of the 
respective mergers. A change in the fair market value of Viacom Common Stock 
will result in a corresponding change in the excess of unallocated acquisition 
cost over the net assets acquired and the related amortization thereof. The 
valuations and other studies, which will provide the basis for such an 
allocation, have not yet progressed to a stage where there is sufficient 
information to make an allocation in the accompanying unaudited pro forma 
combined condensed financial statements. Accordingly, the purchase accounting 
adjustments made in connection with the development of the unaudited pro forma 
combined condensed financial information are preliminary and have been made 
solely for the purposes of developing such unaudited pro forma combined 
condensed financial information. For the Paramount Merger, the approximate 
$5.8 billion pro forma excess of unallocated acquisition costs as of March 4, 
1994 is being amortized over 40 years at a rate of $143.8 million
per year. For the Blockbuster Merger,

4

<PAGE>

the approximate $3.6 billion pro forma excess of unallocated acquisition costs
as of March 4, 1994 is also being amortized over 40 years at a rate of $91
million per year. Such amortization period is based on Viacom's belief that the
combined company has substantial potential for achieving long-term appreciation
as a fully integrated, global entertainment and communications company. The
Mergers will permit the continued expansion of current lines of business, as
well as the development of new businesses, via the cross-promotion of the well
known franchises, trademarks and products of Viacom, Blockbuster and Paramount.
Additionally, the combined company will have enhanced and complimentary product
distribution capabilities which can be used to strategically exploit its
franchise trademarks and products on an accelerated basis. Viacom believes that
the combined company will benefit from the Mergers for an indeterminable period
of time of at least 40 years, and, therefore, a 40 year amortization period is
appropriate.

As is the case with all of Viacom's long-term assets and liabilities,
Viacom will perform periodic reviews of the goodwill arising from the Mergers to
ensure that this goodwill is carried at the lower of cost or market in light of
current business conditions.

After the consummation of the Mergers, Viacom will arrange for independent
appraisal of the significant assets, liabilities and business operations of
Blockbuster. Using this information, Viacom will make a final allocation of the
excess purchase price, including allocation to intangibles other than goodwill.
Viacom believes that any significant allocation of excess purchase price to
intangibles will be amortized over 40 years, and so any such allocation would
not cause a material difference in pro forma results.

to finance the purchase of Viacom Class B Common Stock, will be
refinanced on a long-term basis as part of an overall refinancing of

additional 5% cumulative dividend requirement of the $1.8 billion of Viacom

the year ended December 31, 1993 as if the transactions had occurred at the
beginning of the year.

(5) Other pro forma adjustments related to the Paramount Offer and the
Paramount Merger reflect the following:

(a) An increase in amortization expense of $143.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 1993 resulting from an increase in intangibles of
approximately $5.8 billion amortized over 40 years.

(b) Reflects an increase in interest expense of $241.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 1993 resulting from additional debt financing of
approximately $3.6 billion under the Merger Credit Agreement, the
issuance of Viacom Merger Debentures and a decrease of interest income
of $7.9 million resulting from the use of cash to finance the Paramount
Offer. The assumed interest rate on the debt financing under the Merger
Credit Agreement of 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 1993 was
calculated based on average historical London Interbank Offered Rates.
A change in the assumed interest rate of 1/8% will result in a change
in interest expense of $4.5 million on an annual basis.

(c) Pro forma income tax adjustments reflect the income tax effects
calculated at the statutory tax rate in effect during the period
presented. The effective income tax rate on a pro forma basis is
adversely affected by amortization of excess acquisition costs, which
are assumed to be not deductible for tax purposes.

(d) Intercompany transactions were immaterial in each of the statements
presented.

<PAGE>

(6) Other pro forma adjustments related to the Blockbuster Merger reflect
the following:

(a) Reclassification of the historical presentation of depreciation and
amortization of $410.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1993 to
conform the presentations of Viacom and Blockbuster financial
statements.

(b) An increase in amortization expense of $91 million for the year ended
December 31, 1993, resulting from an increase in intangible assets of
approximately $3.6 billion amortized over 40 years.

(c) Eliminates the 5% cumulative annual dividend on the $600 million
intercompany Series A Preferred Stock investment by Blockbuster in the
amount of $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1993.

(d) Reflects the income tax effects of certain pro forma adjustments
calculated at the statutory tax rate in effect during the period
presented. The effective income tax rate on a pro forma basis is
adversely affected by amortization of excess acquisition costs, which
are assumed to be not deductible for tax purposes.

(e) Intercompany transactions were immaterial in each of the statements
presented.

(7) Other items, net, of Viacom for the year ended December 31, 1993
reflects a net gain of $61.8 million due to the sale of the Viacom Cablevision
of Wisconsin, Inc. system and other non-recurring transactions.

(8) Pro forma primary earnings per common share is calculated based on the
weighted average number of shares of Viacom Common Stock outstanding, the number
of shares of Viacom Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Blockbuster
Merger and Paramount Merger and respective common share equivalents as if these
transactions occurred at the beginning of the period presented. Conversion of
the Series B Preferred Stock would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per
common share and therefore fully diluted earnings per common share is not
presented.

(9) Reflects operating losses at USA Networks, Paramount's 50%-owned cable
networks, due largely to a $78 million pre-tax charge, the majority of which was
recorded in December 1993, to adjust the carrying value of certain broadcast
rights to net realizable value because of the under-performance of certain
series programming of which Paramount recorded its share.

BLOCKBUSTER, SUPER CLUB AND
SPELLING ENTERTAINMENT
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The historical financial statements of Blockbuster include the financial
position and results of operations of WJB Video Limited Partnership and certain
of its affiliates ("WJB"), with which Blockbuster consolidated in August 1993. 
This transaction has been accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
of accounting and, accordingly, all of Blockbuster's historical financial data 
has been restated as if the companies had operated as one entity since 
inception.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet
presents the pro forma financial position of Blockbuster as of December 31,
1993. The balance sheet contains pro forma adjustments for certain significant
transactions which occurred in 1994, in connection with the Paramount Offer and
the Paramount Merger. These transactions include a $1.25 billion investment in
Viacom and additional borrowings of $1.25 billion and are reflected in the
balance sheet as if these transactions had been completed as of December 31,
1993. Spelling Entertainment Group Inc. (together with its subsidiary "Spelling
Entertainment") and Super Club Retail Entertainment Corporation and
subsidiaries ("Super Club") are included in Blockbuster's historical balance
sheet at December 31, 1993.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 presents the pro forma results
of continuing operations of Blockbuster as if the acquisition of Super Club and
the majority of the outstanding common stock of Spelling Entertainment had been
consummated at January 1, 1993. The following unaudited pro forma statement of
operations also contains pro forma adjustments for certain significant
transactions which occurred during 1993 or 1994 in connection with the Paramount
Offer and the Paramount Merger. These transactions include a $600 million and a
$1.25 billion investment in Viacom, additional borrowings of $600 million and
$1.25 billion, and the sale of 14,650,000 shares of Blockbuster Common Stock,
and are reflected in the pro forma condensed consolidated statement of 
operations as if these transactions had been consummated as of January 1, 1993. 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations
do not give effect to the estimated cost savings to be realized from the 
consolidation of certain Super Club operational and administrative functions, 
including the elimination of duplicate facilities and personnel, and management 
fees previously charged by related affiliates. These unaudited pro forma 
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with 
the respective historical financial statements and notes thereto of Blockbuster,
Super Club and Spelling Entertainment.

Income from continuing operations per common and common equivalent share is
based on the combined weighted average number of common shares and common share
equivalents outstanding which include, where appropriate, the assumed exercise
or conversion of warrants and options. In computing income from continuing
operations per common and common equivalent share, Blockbuster utilizes the
treasury stock method.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements were
prepared utilizing the accounting policies of the respective entities as
outlined in their historical financial statements except as described in the
accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements reflect Blockbuster's preliminary allocations of purchase prices
which will be subject to further adjustments as Blockbuster finalizes the
allocations of the purchase prices in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. All of the aforementioned acquisitions, excluding WJB,
were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated results of operations do not necessarily reflect
actual results which would have occurred if the aforementioned acquisitions had
taken place on the assumed dates, nor are they indicative of the results of
future combined operations. If either the Paramount Merger or the Blockbuster
Merger were not to occur, certain pro forma adjustments included in these
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements would change
significantly.

VIACOM INC. AND
VIACOM INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1) SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation -Viacom Inc. (together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, "Viacom Inc.") is a
holding company whose principal asset is the common stock of Viacom
International Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the
context otherwise requires, the "Company"). The Company is a diversified
entertainment and communications company with operations in four principal
segments: Networks, Entertainment, Cable Television and Broadcasting.

The primary differences between Viacom Inc.'s and the Company's financial
statements include the following factors: a) the capitalization of the two
companies -- the Company's shareholders' equity reflects the contribution to
capital of Viacom Inc.'s exchangeable preferred stock, which was exchanged for
15.5% Junior Subordinated Exchange Debentures due 2006 (the "Exchange
Debentures") on March 31, 1989 which in turn were fully redeemed during 1991;
b) during 1993, Viacom Inc. issued $1.8 billion of 5% cumulative convertible
preferred stock (see Note 6) and declared related preferred stock dividends of
$12.8 million, c) certain general and administrative expenses recorded by
Viacom Inc. of $5.0 million (1993), $9.0 million (1992) and $12.9 million
(1991), which include transactions associated with the long-term deferred
incentive compensation plans; and d) Viacom Inc. recorded net interest income
of $3.1 million (1993) and net interest expense of $45.2 million (1991).

Certain amounts reported on the balance sheet and statements of cash flows for
prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Viacom Inc., the Company and all investments of more than 50% in
subsidiaries and other entities. All significant intercompany transactions
have been eliminated. Investments in affiliated companies of more than 20% but
less than or equal to 50% are accounted for under the equity method.
Investments of 20% or less are accounted for under the cost method. In 1993,
the fiscal year end for certain foreign operations was changed from October 31
to December 31.

Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents are defined as short-term (3 months or
less) highly liquid investments.

Program Rights - The Company acquires rights to exhibit programming on its
broadcast stations or cable networks, and produces its own programs. The costs
incurred in acquiring and producing programs are capitalized and amortized over
the license period or over the estimated exhibition life of the program. Costs
related to the production of programs are either charged to earnings or
capitalized to the extent they are estimated to be recoverable from future
revenue. Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross
amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the
program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing.

Program Distribution - Fees for distributing television shows and feature films
are recognized upon billing over contractual periods generally ranging from
one to five years, except that such fees for internally produced programs are
recognized when such programs are delivered and fees for barter advertising
revenue are recognized when the programs are available and a noncancellable
contract has been executed. Receivables reflect gross billings, which include
the owners' share. Amounts due to owners are recorded as liabilities in
"Owners' share of distribution revenue" or are deducted from "Distribution fees
advanced and committed, current."

Minimum guarantees to owners are recorded as liabilities and are liquidated by
payments in accordance with contract terms. A corresponding asset is recorded
as "Distribution fees advanced and committed" and is reduced by the owners'
share of billings until fully recovered or amortized as operating expenses
against the Company's share of total estimated billings based on the ratio of
total estimated costs to total estimated billings.

Prepaid distribution costs incurred on behalf of the owners are recovered from
the owners' share of billings or amortized as operating expenses against the
Company's share of total estimated billings based on the ratio of total
estimated costs to total estimated billings.

26

<PAGE>

VIACOM INC. AND
VIACOM INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

All amortization estimates are reviewed periodically by management and are
adjusted prospectively. Minimum guarantees or other costs estimated not to be
recoverable from total estimated billings are expensed in the period any
shortfall is determined.

Depreciation and Amortization - Depreciation is computed principally by the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging principally from 3 to
15 years. Capitalized lease amortization of $5.5 million (1993) and $3.0
million (1992) is included in depreciation expense. Depreciation expense was
$92.8 million (1993), $81.5 million (1992) and $70.1 million (1991).

Intangibles resulting from business acquisitions are generally amortized over
40 years. Accumulated amortization relating to intangibles at December 31 was
$412.5 million (1993) and $361.1 million (1992) .

Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies - Equity in loss of affiliated companies
is primarily comprised of the Company's one-third interest in Lifetime, the 50%
interest in Comedy Central, the 50% interest in Nickelodeon (UK) during 1993
and the 49.99% interest in MTV EUROPE prior to August 30, 1991. (See Note 3.)

Provision for Doubtful Accounts - The provision for doubtful accounts charged
to expense was $16.7 million (1993), $9.4 million (1992) and $15.9 million
(1991).

Net Earnings (Loss) per Common Share - Earnings (loss) per share is calculated
based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.
The effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and conversion of
convertible debentures is not material for each of the years presented. For
1993, the assumed conversion of the Preferred Stock (as defined in Note 2)
would have an antidilutive effect on fully-diluted earnings per common share.
Therefore, the effects of such assumption are not reflected in net earnings
(loss) per common share.

Interest Rate Protection Agreements - The amount to be paid or received is
accrued as interest rates change and is recognized over the life of the
agreements as an adjustment to interest expense.

2) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On March 11, 1994, Viacom Inc. acquired, pursuant to a tender offer (the
"Paramount Offer"), 61,657,432 shares of Paramount common stock, constituting a
majority of the shares outstanding, at a price of $107 per share in cash. The
Paramount Offer was financed by (i) the sale of Preferred Stock (see "Note 6"),
proceeds of which are reflected as cash and cash equivalents on the balance
sheet as of December 31, 1993, (ii) the sale of Viacom Class B Common Stock to
Blockbuster and (iii) borrowings under a credit agreement (as described below).
The Paramount Offer was made pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of February 4, 1994 (the "Paramount Merger Agreement")
between Viacom Inc. and Paramount. Subject to certain conditions, Paramount
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Viacom Inc. (the "Paramount Merger")
at the effective time of a merger between Paramount and a subsidiary of Viacom
Inc. (the "Paramount Effective Time") which is expected to occur in the second
quarter of 1994. Pursuant to the Paramount Merger Agreement, each share of
Paramount common stock outstanding at the time of such merger (other than
shares held in the treasury of Paramount or owned by Viacom Inc. and other than
shares held by any stockholders who shall have demanded and perfected appraisal
rights) will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.93065 of a share of
Viacom Class B Common Stock, (ii) $17.50 principal amount of 8% exchangeable
subordinated debentures of Viacom Inc., (iii) 0.93065 of a contingent value
right ("CVR"), (iv) 0.5 of a warrant to purchase one share of Viacom Class B
Common Stock at any time prior to the third anniversary of the Paramount Merger
at a price of $60 per share, and (v) 0.3 of a warrant to purchase one share of
Viacom Class B Common Stock at any time prior to the fifth anniversary of the
Paramount Merger at a price of $70 per share. If the debentures are issued
prior to the completion of the purposed merger of Viacom Inc. and Blockbuster,
the debentures will be exchangeable, at the option of Viacom Inc., into 5%
exchangeable preferred stock of Viacom Inc. on or after January 1, 1995 if the
proposed merger with Blockbuster has not previously been consummated.

27

<PAGE>

VIACOM INC. AND
VIACOM INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Each CVR will represent the right to receive the amount, if any, by which the
Target Price exceeds the greater of the Current Market Value and the Minimum
Price (see defined terms in following paragraph). The CVRs will mature on the
first anniversary of the Paramount Effective Time (the "Maturity Date");
provided, however, that Viacom Inc. may, at its option, (i) extend the Maturity
Date to the second anniversary of the Paramount Effective Time (the "First
Extended Maturity Date") or (ii) extend the First Extended Maturity Date to the
third anniversary or the Paramount Effective Time (the "Second Extended
Maturity Date"). Viacom Inc., at its option, may pay any amount due under the
terms of the CVRs in cash or in the equivalent value of registered securities
of Viacom Inc., including without limitation, common stock, preferred stock,
notes, or other securities.

The "Minimum Price" means (a) at the Maturity Date, $36, (b) at the First
Extended Maturity Date, $37 and (c) at the Second Extended Maturity Date, $38.
Target Price means (a) at the Maturity Date, $48, (b) at the First Extended
Maturity Date, $51, and (c) at the Second Extended Maturity Date, $55. The
"Current Market Value" means the average market price of Viacom Class B Common
Stock for a specified period.

On January 7, 1994, Viacom Inc. and Blockbuster entered into an agreement and
plan of merger (the "Blockbuster Merger Agreement") pursuant to which
Blockbuster will be merged with and into Viacom Inc. (the "Blockbuster
Merger"). At the effective time of the Blockbuster Merger, each share of
Blockbuster common stock outstanding at the time of the Blockbuster Merger
(other than shares held in the treasury of Blockbuster or owned by Viacom Inc.
and other than shares held by any stockholders who shall have demanded and
perfected appraisal rights, if available) will be converted into the right to
receive (i) 0.08 of a share of Viacom Class A Common Stock, (ii) 0.60615 of a
share of Viacom Class B Common Stock, and (iii) up to an additional 0.13829 of
a share of Viacom Class B Common Stock, with the exact fraction of a share
being dependent on the market prices of Viacom Class B Common Stock during the
year following the effective time of the Blockbuster Merger, and with the right
to receive such additional fraction of a share to be evidenced by one variable
common right ("VCR"). The VCRs mature on the first anniversary of the
Blockbuster Merger ("VCR Conversion Date").

The mergers pursuant to the Paramount Merger Agreement and Blockbuster Merger
Agreement (collectively, the "Mergers") have been unanimously approved by the
Boards of Directors of each of the respective companies. The obligations of
Viacom Inc., Blockbuster and Paramount to consummate the mergers are subject to
various conditions, including obtaining requisite stockholder approvals.
Viacom Inc. intends to vote its shares of Paramount in favor of the merger and
NAI has agreed to vote its shares of Viacom Inc. in favor of the Mergers;
therefore, stockholder approval of the Paramount Merger is assured, and
approval by Viacom Inc. of the Blockbuster Merger is also assured.

The Mergers will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The
unaudited condensed pro forma data for the year ended or at December 31, 1993
presented below assumes the Mergers occurred on January 1, 1993 for statement
of operations data or at December 31, 1993 for balance sheet data. Intangible
assets are expected to be amortized over 40 years on a straight-line basis.
The unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the
combined results of operations or financial position of Viacom Inc., Paramount
and Blockbuster (the "Combined Company") following the Mergers that would have
occurred if the completion of the Mergers had occurred on the dates previously
indicated nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results of
the Combined Company.

On March 10, 1994, Blockbuster purchased approximately 22.7 million shares of
Viacom Class B Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.25 billion,
or $55 per share. If (with certain exceptions) the Blockbuster Merger
Agreement is terminated and in the event that Viacom Class B Common Stock
trades (for a specified period) at a level below $55 per share during the one
year period after such termination, Viacom Inc. may be obligated to make
certain payments of up to maximum of $275 million, at its option, in cash or
securities, or to sell certain assets to Blockbuster. The Viacom Class B
Common Stock purchased by Blockbuster will be canceled upon consummation of the
Blockbuster Merger.

On February 15, 1994, Blockbuster entered into a credit agreement with certain
financial institutions named therein, pursuant to which such financial
institutions have advanced to Blockbuster, on an unsecured basis, an aggregate
of $1.0 billion to finance a portion of the purchase of the shares under the
Subscription Agreement (the "Blockbuster Facility"). The Blockbuster Facility
contains certain events of default, including a change of control default,
which will require either a waiver in connection with the Blockbuster Merger or
the refinancing of the indebtedness incurred by Blockbuster under the
Blockbuster Facility.

On March 11, 1994, Viacom Inc. borrowed $3.6 billion under a credit agreement
dated as of November 19, 1993, as amended on January 4, 1994 and February 15,
1994, among Viacom Inc., the banks named therein, and The Bank of New York,
Citibank, N.A. and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as Managing Agents
(the "Merger Credit Agreement").

The Merger Credit Agreement provides that, in order to pay for the Paramount
Offer and related expenses, up to $3.7 billion may be borrowed, repaid and
reborrowed until November 18, 1994, at which time all amounts outstanding will
become due and payable.

The Merger Credit Agreement provides that Viacom Inc. may elect to borrow at

certain limitations. The "Base Rate" will be the higher of (i) the Citibank

rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.9375% dependent on the senior unsecured long-term
debt rating assigned to Viacom Inc. The Merger Credit Agreement provides that
Viacom Inc. will pay each bank a facility fee on such bank's commitment until
November 18, 1994.

The Merger Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among other
things require Viacom Inc. to meet certain financial ratios.

As of December 31, 1993, Viacom Inc. has promissory notes outstanding in the
aggregate amount of $26 million, in order to finance expenses associated with
the Mergers and expects to obtain additional financing as required to finance
such expenses.

========== ==========

(a) -- At December 31, 1993, there were aggregate borrowing
facilities of $1.9 billion and $300 million under (i) an unsecured credit
agreement guaranteed by Viacom Inc. (amended and restated as of January 17,
1992, (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") among the Company the named banks
("Banks"), Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank") as agent and The Bank of New York
("BONY") as co-agent and (ii) an unsecured credit agreement, dated June 2,
1993, among the Company and the named banks and BONY and Citibank as agents
(the "Loan Facility Agreement"). The Loan Facility Agreement has a 364-day
term and is identical to the Credit Agreement in all other material terms and
conditions. Borrowings of $1.765 billion were outstanding under the Credit
Agreement as of December 31, 1993, including $274 million aggregate principal
amount assumed by five subsidiaries of the Company ("Subsidiary Obligors").
Borrowings of $150 million were outstanding under the Loan Facility Agreement
as of December 31, 1993, $135 million of which were classified as long-term.

The following is a summary description of the amended and restated Credit
Agreement. The description does not purport to be complete and should be read
in conjunction with the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement provides for three facilities:

Facility A - $700 million under a term loan having a final
maturity of June 30, 1999;

Facility B - $926 million under a revolver, which converts on
January 1, 1995 into a term loan having a final
maturity of June 30, 1999; and

Facility B-1 - $274 million under a term loan having a final
maturity of June 30, 1999.

The interest rate on all loans made under the three facilities is based upon
Citibank, N.A.'s base rate, the domestic certificate of deposit rate or the
London Interbank Offered Rate and is affected by the Company's leverage ratio.
At December 31, 1993, the London Interbank Offered Rates (upon which the
Company's borrowing rate was based) for borrowing periods of one month and two
months were 3.25% and 3.3125%, respectively. The Company is permitted to issue
commercial paper with a maturity at the time of issuance not to exceed nine
months, provided that following each issuance of commercial paper, (i) the
aggregate face amount of commercial paper outstanding shall not exceed $500
million less the aggregate amount of competitive bid rate borrowings (described

31

<PAGE>

VIACOM INC. AND
VIACOM INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

below), outstanding at such time and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Facility
B loans and competitive bid rate loans outstanding, together with the aggregate
face amount of commercial paper outstanding, shall not exceed $926 million.
The Company is also permitted to make short-term competitive bid rate
borrowings from the Banks until December 1, 1994, provided that following the
making of each proposed competitive bid rate borrowing, (i) the aggregate
amount of the competitive bid rate loans outstanding shall not exceed $500
million less the aggregate face amount of commercial paper outstanding and (ii)
the aggregate amount of all Facility B loans and competitive bid rate loans
outstanding, together with the aggregate face amount of commercial paper
outstanding, shall not exceed $926 million.

The Company and Subsidiary Obligors are required to repay the principal
outstanding under the Credit Agreement in quarterly payments equal to
percentages of the original aggregate principal amount with respect to the
Facility A loans and Facility B-1 loans, and of the outstanding principal
amount with respect to the Facility B loans, under the Credit Agreement, in the
amount of 5% for the period commencing January 2, 1995 through and including
January 2, 1999; and 7.5% on April 1, 1999 and on June 30, 1999.

The Company may prepay at any time a portion or all of the principal
outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Any such optional prepayments shall be
applied to the remaining installments of Facility A and Facility B loans in the
order that the Company designates. The Company is required to make mandatory
prepayments upon receipt of net cash sale proceeds in connection with permitted
sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business. All such prepayments
shall be applied until December 31, 1994 to reduce the Facility B loans
outstanding; provided, however, that any amounts so repaid may be reborrowed
prior to December 31, 1994. All such prepayments after December 31, 1994 shall
be applied pro rata against the remaining installments of first, the Facility A
loans and second, the Facility B loans. In the event of a sale of the stock or
substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Obligor, the Facility B-1
loan of such Subsidiary Obligor shall be repaid in full; provided, however,
that upon such prepayment prior to December 31, 1994, the Facility B commitment
of each Facility B Bank shall be increased by an amount equal to the principal
amount of such Facility B Bank's Facility B-1 loan prepaid as a result of such
prepayment and such amounts may be borrowed by the Company prior to December
31, 1994. The Company is required to prepay principal outstanding under the
Credit Agreement with the proceeds of certain issuances of unsecured senior
debt in an amount equal to the proceeds so received, together with accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid, with
such prepayments applied against remaining installments of first, the Facility
A loans and second, the Facility B loans.

The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among other things,
require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios and impose on the
Company and its subsidiaries certain limitations on (i) the incurrence of
indebtedness or the guarantee or assumption of indebtedness of another; (ii)
the creation or incurrence of mortgages, pledges or security interests on the
property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in order to secure
debt or the sale of assets of the Company or its subsidiaries; (iii) the merger
or consolidation of the Company with any person or other entity; (iv) the
incurrence of capitalized leases and purchase money indebtedness; (v) the
payment of cash dividends or the redemption or repurchase of any capital stock
of the Company; and (vi) investments and acquisitions.

The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default. The
Credit Agreement also provides that it is an event of default if National
Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") fails to own at least 51% of the outstanding voting
stock of Viacom Inc. or Viacom Inc. fails to own at least 67% of the
outstanding voting stock of the Company.

Under the restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement, the Company is
prohibited from (i) paying any dividends on its stock to Viacom Inc. for the
purpose of enabling Viacom Inc. to pay any dividend on its common stock, or
(ii) making any other dividend payments to Viacom Inc. (other than for certain
limited specified purposes, including the satisfaction of Viacom Inc.'s
obligations under the LTIP), unless its total leverage ratio is less than a
specified amount.

The Company is required to pay a commitment fee based on the aggregate average
daily unborrowed portion of the Facility B commitment, with any amounts
outstanding under competitive bid rate loans and commercial paper being deemed
unborrowed for the purpose of calculating the commitment fee. The Company also
is required to pay certain agency fees to the agent. The Credit Agreement does
not require compensating balances.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

On January 4, 1993, Viacom Inc. borrowed $42.2 million from BONY pursuant to
the Term Loan Agreement. The interest rate in the Term Loan Agreement is based
upon BONY's prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate. Viacom Inc.
repaid $13.9 million of debt under the Term Loan Agreement on January 15, 1994,
the first scheduled maturity date. The remaining $28.3 million under the Term
Loan Agreement matures on January 15, 1995.

Viacom Inc. may prepay at any time a portion or all of the principal amount
outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement. Any such optional prepayments shall
be applied to reduce the principal installment due January 1995 and shall
include all accrued interest on the amount of principal prepaid. Viacom Inc.
shall be obligated to prepay the loan in the amount of any dividends received
from the Company.

The Term Loan Agreement contains certain covenants which impose certain
limitations on (i) the incurrence of indebtedness and (ii) payment of cash
dividends or the redemption or repurchase of any capital stock of Viacom. The
Term Loan Agreement also contains certain customary events of default. The
Term Loan Agreement has been amended to allow Viacom Inc. to complete the
Paramount Offer and the Paramount Merger.

The Company enters into interest rate protection agreements with off-balance
sheet risk in order to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates on its
variable rate long-term debt. These interest rate protection agreements
include interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. At December 31, 1993, the
Company and Viacom Inc. had interest rate protection agreements outstanding
with commercial banks, with respect to $1.1 billion of indebtedness under the
Credit Agreement and $42.2 million under the Term Loan Agreement. These
agreements effectively change the Company's interest exposure under the Credit
Agreement to a ceiling of 5.64% on the interest rate caps, and under the Term
Loan Agreement to a fixed weighted average rate of 6.65% on interest rate
swaps. The interest rate protection agreements are in effect for a fixed
period of time. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company
does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company had commercial paper outstanding of $60.9 million as of December
31, 1993.

The Company also has aggregate money market facilities of $40 million, all of
which was available at December 31, 1993.

(b) -- On March 4, 1992, the Company issued $150 million aggregate
principal amount of 9.125% Senior Subordinated Notes ("9.125% Notes") due
August 15, 1999. Interest is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15,
commencing August 15, 1992. The 9.125% Notes may not be redeemed prior to
February 15, 1997. They are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole
or in part, during the 12 month period beginning February 15, 1997 at a
redemption price of 102.607% of the principal amount, during the 12 month
period beginning February 15, 1998 at 101.304% of the principal amount, and on
or after February 15, 1999 at 100% of the principal amount. Any such
redemption will include accrued interest to the redemption date. The 9.125%
Notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements.

(c) -- On May 28, 1992, the Company issued $100 million aggregate
principal amount of 8.75% Senior Subordinated Reset Notes ("8.75% Reset Notes")
due on May 15, 2001. Interest is payable semiannually on May 15 and November
15, commencing November 15, 1992. On May 15, 1995 and May 15, 1998, unless a
notice of redemption of the 8.75% Reset Notes on such date has been given by
the Company, the interest rate on the 8.75% Reset Notes will, if necessary, be
adjusted from the rate then in effect to a rate to be determined on the basis
of market rates in effect on May 5, 1995 and on May 5, 1998, respectively, as
the rate the 8.75% Reset Notes should bear in order to have a market value of
101% of principal amount immediately after the resetting of the rate. In no
event will the interest rate be lower than 8.75% or higher than the average
three year treasury rate (as defined in the indenture) multiplied by two. The
interest rate reset on May 15, 1995 will remain in effect on the 8.75% Reset
Notes through and including May 15, 1998 and the interest rate reset on May 15,
1998 will remain in effect on the 8.75% Reset Notes thereafter. The 8.75%
Reset Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole but not in
part, on May 15, 1995 or May 15, 1998, at a redemption price of 101% of

principal amount plus accrued interest to, but not including, the date of

requirements.

based interests ("Awards"), and for subsequent payments of cash with respect to
phantom shares or stock appreciation rights based, subject to certain limits,
on their appreciation in value over stated periods of time.

7) INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes shown below for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991 represents federal, state and foreign income taxes on
earnings before income taxes. The tax benefits relating to losses accounted
for under the equity method of accounting, which are shown net of tax on the
Company's statement of operations, are $.6 million (1993), $2.2 million (1992)
and $6.4 million (1991). See Note 4 for tax benefits relating to the
Extraordinary Losses.

During the first quarter of 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109") on a
prospective basis and recognized an increase to earnings of $10.3 million in
1993 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 109
mandates the liability method for computing deferred income taxes.

Effective tax rate 43.0% 54.5% 510.1%
===== ===== ======

The annual effective tax rate of 43% for 1993 and 54.5% for 1992 includes a
reduction of certain prior year tax reserves in the amount of $22 million and
$20 million, respectively. The reduction is based on management's view
concerning the outcome of several tax issues based upon the progress of
federal, state and local audits.

As of December 31, 1993, after having given effect to SFAS 109, the Company had
total non-current deferred net tax liabilities of $85.2 million and current
deferred net tax assets of $16.3 million. The deferred net tax assets are
deemed to be fully realizable and therefore no valuation allowance has been
established. At December 31, 1993, the Company had no net operating loss or
investment tax credit carryovers.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

There are no significant temporary differences relating to foreign
undistributed earnings or investments in foreign subsidiaries for 1993, 1992 or
1991. Thus, no related deferred taxes have been recorded by the Company for
these years.

Viacom Inc. and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return
and have done so since the period commencing June 11, 1991, the date on which
NAI's percentage of ownership of Viacom Inc. was reduced to less than 80%.
Prior to such date, Viacom Inc. and the Company filed a consolidated federal
income tax return with NAI, and also participated in a tax-sharing agreement
with NAI with respect to federal income taxes. The tax-sharing agreement
obligated Viacom Inc. and the Company to make payment to NAI to the extent they
would have paid federal income taxes on a separate company basis, and entitled
them to receive a payment from NAI to the extent losses and credits reduced
NAI's federal income taxes.

8) PENSION PLANS, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have non-contributory pension plans
covering substantially all employees. The benefits for these plans are based
primarily on an employee's years of service and pay near retirement. All
employees are vested in the plans after five years of service. The Company's
policy for all pension plans is to fund amounts in accordance with the Employee
Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974. Plan assets consist principally of
common stocks, marketable bonds and United States government securities.

Net periodic pension cost for the periods indicated included the following
components:

For purposes of valuing the 1993 and 1992 projected benefit obligation, the
discount rate was 7.5% (1993) and 8.25% (1992) and the rate of increase in
future compensation was 6% for each of the years. For determining the pension
expense for each of the years, the long-term rate of return on plan assets was
9%.

In 1992, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting For Postemployment Benefits" ("SFAS 112") which the
Company will be required to adopt in 1994. SFAS 112 requires that
postemployment benefits be accounted for under the accrual method versus the
currently used pay-as-you-go method. The Company is evaluating the impact of
SFAS 112 and it is not expected that SFAS 112 will have a significant effect on
the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

9) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company, through the normal course of business, is involved in transactions
with affiliated companies. The Company sold programming to affiliates
amounting to $5.5 million (1993), $3.3 million (1992) and $.9 million (1991)
and paid subscriber fees of $6.1 million (1993), $5.4 million (1992) and $2.0
million (1991). In addition, rent and other expenses of $5.8 million, $4.7
million and $4.0 million were charged to affiliated companies during 1993, 1992
and 1991, respectively. Related party accounts receivable and accounts payable
were immaterial for each period.

The Company received approximately $.9 million (1993) and $1.3 million (1992)
under its tax-sharing agreement with NAI and paid approximately $.9 million
(1991).

10) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has long-term noncancellable lease commitments for office space and
equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles.

At December 31, 1993, minimum rental payments under noncancellable leases are
as follows:

Operating Capital
Leases Leases
------ ------
(Thousands of dollars)
1994 $ 59,746 $ 9,632
1995 58,946 10,660
1996 56,795 11,689
1997 53,125 12,717
1998 55,373 13,746
1999 and thereafter 390,181 38,764

Total minimum lease payments $674,166 97,208
========
Less amounts representing 
interest 34,121
-------
Present value of net minimum 
payments $63,087
=======

Future minimum capital lease payments and operating lease payments have not
been reduced by future minimum sublease rentals of $26.0 million and $.5
million, respectively. Rent expense amounted to $74.2 million (1993), $67.9
million (1992) and $64.6 million (1991).

Capital leases represent the financing of transponders of $67.0 million (1993)
and $26.2 million (1992), net of accumulated amortization of $7.8 million
(1993) and $3.0 million (1992).

The commitments of the Company for program license fees which are not reflected
in the balance sheet as of December 31, 1993, which are estimated to aggregate
approximately $1.9 billion, principally reflect commitments under SNI's
exclusive arrangements with several motion picture companies. This estimate is
based upon a number of factors. A majority of such fees are payable within the
next seven years, as part of normal programming expenditures of SNI. These
commitments are contingent upon delivery of motion pictures which are not yet
available for premium television exhibition and, in many cases, have not yet
been produced.

During July 1991, the Company received reassessments from 10 California
counties of its Cable Division's real and personal property, related to the
June 1987 acquisition by NAI, which could result in substantially higher
California property tax liabilities. The Company is appealing the
reassessments and believes that the reassessments as issued are unreasonable
and unsupportable under California law. The Company believes that the final
resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on its consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the Company. Management
believes that any ultimate liability resulting from those actions or claims
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations (See Note 14).

14) OTHER ITEMS, NET

As part of the settlement of the Time Warner antitrust lawsuit, the Company
sold all the stock of Viacom Cablevision of Wisconsin, Inc. to Warner
Communications Inc. ("Warner"). This transaction was effective on January 1,
1993. As consideration for the stock, Warner paid the sum of $46 million plus
repayment of debt under the Credit Agreement in the amount of $49 million,
resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $55 million reflected in "Other
items, net." Also reflected in this line item is the net gain on the sale of a
portion of an investment held at cost and adjustments to previously established
non-operating litigation reserves, and other items.

"Other items, net" reflects a gain of $35 million recorded in the third quarter
of 1992; this gain represents payments received in the third quarter relating
to certain aspects of the settlement of the Time Warner antitrust lawsuit, net
of the Company's 1992 legal expenses related to this lawsuit.

"Other items, net" also reflects a reserve for litigation of $33 million during
the second quarter of 1992 related to a summary judgment against Viacom in a
dispute with CBS Inc. arising under the 1970 agreement associated with the
spin-off of Viacom International Inc. by CBS Inc. On July 30, 1993, the
Company settled all disputes arising under the above litigation.

In September 1991, the Company recorded a reserve for its investment in a
start-up joint venture. On August 16, 1991, the Company sold 129,837 shares of
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.9
million. These transactions resulted in a pre-tax loss of approximately $6.5
million, which is reflected in "Other items, net."
