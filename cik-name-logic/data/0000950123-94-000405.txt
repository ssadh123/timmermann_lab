ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE 1993 EARNINGS

Filed herewith are the preliminary and unaudited Consolidated
Statements of Operations of Lehman Brothers Inc. ("the Company"), for the
quarter and year ended December 31, 1993, which Consolidated Statements of
Operations will be superseded by information contained in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. All adjustments
which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented have been
included. Certain amounts for fourth quarter and year-to-date 1992 reflect
reclassifications to conform to the current periods' presentation. In
addition, filed herewith are unaudited pro forma Consolidated Statements of
Operations for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, which
reflect, among other things, the elimination of revenues and expenses of
certain of the Company's retail and asset management businesses, as well as
certain other assets related to such businesses (the "SLBD Results of
Operations"), the loss on the sale of such businesses and the sale of a
non-core business. The presentation herein of historical information for 1993
(the "Current Presentation") differs from the presentations set forth in the
Reports on Form 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of 1993, which
presentations reflect SLBD Results of Operations, the loss on the sale of such
businesses and reserves for certain non-core businesses in one line item called
"Retail/Asset Management." In the Current Presentation, SLBD Results of
Operations are included in all applicable line items through July 31, 1993 (the
date of the closing of the sale of the Company's retail and asset management
businesses).

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. TO BECOME INDEPENDENT CORPORATION

On January 24, 1994, American Express Company ("American Express")
announced plans to issue a special dividend to its common shareholders. Such
special dividend will consist of the common shares of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (the "Parent") which American Express owns immediately preceding such
dividend, including common stock which it receives in exchange for the Parent's
$250 million Money Market Cumulative Preferred(sm) Stock. Prior to the issuance
of such dividend, the Parent's equity capital will increase by $1.25 billion,
bringing its equity capital to approximately $3.3 billion. The additional
equity will be the result of the purchase of i) $160 million of newly-issued
Parent common stock by certain employees of the Parent and its subsidiaries
(including the Company), approximately $60 million of which would come from an
employee ownership plan that was established in 1993; and ii) $200 million of
newly-issued Parent preferred stock and $890 million of newly-issued Parent
common stock, each by American Express.

In addition, American Express' plan to spin-off the Parent provides
that American Express would receive 50% of any of the Parent's net income in
excess of $400 million per year, with a cap of $50 million per year, for each
of the next eight years. Such plan also

<PAGE> 3
provides for American Express to receive certain contingent revenue and
earnings related participations due to the Company from Travelers Corporation
for a period of three and five years, respectively, in connection with the sale
last year of the Company's retail and asset management businesses.

Final terms of the proposed transaction, which is subject to certain
conditions, have not yet been determined. The completion of the proposed
transaction, which is expected to occur during the second quarter of 1994,
would result in the Parent emerging as an independent publicly owned
corporation.

The Company does not expect the proposed transaction to affect its
capital structure, liquidity or results of operations; therefore, such
transaction is not reflected in the Company's Pro Forma Financial Statements
which are exhibits hereto.

99.3, 99.4 and 99.5 is presented in order to illustrate the effects of
the elimination of the SLBD Results of Operations, the loss on the

LEHMAN BROTHERS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTMENTS

For the Year Ended December 31, 1993
- ------------------------------------

Since The Boston Company, Inc. ("Boston") is reported as a
discontinued operation in the Company's financial statements, its results are
not reflected in the Company's 1993 results from continuing operations. The
pro forma adjustments to the statement of operations give effect to the items
described below:

a) Adjustment reflects the elimination of revenues and expenses of 
certain of the Company's retail and asset management businesses, 
as well as certain other assets related to such businesses 
("SLBD") and the loss on the sale of such assets (the "Primerica 
Transaction"). (Primerica Corporation was a predecessor in 
interest of Travelers Corporation). Also eliminated is the 
income tax expense of $149 million related to these items.

b) Adjustment reflects the elimination of revenues and expenses of 
SLHMC.

c) Adjustment to reserves for non-core businesses reflects the 
elimination of the reserves related to the sale of SLHMC. Also 
eliminated is the income tax benefit of $41 million related to 
these items. Adjustments have not been made for reserves taken 
in the first quarter of 1993 related to certain non-core 
partnership syndication activities in which the Company is no 
longer actively engaged.

d) Adjustment reflects reduced interest expense of approximately $61
million resulting from the utilization of cash proceeds (from the 
sales of Boston, SLBD and SLHMC) to reduce the Company's 
short-term debt and term notes, certain of which notes were 
obligations owed to Holdings, offset by interest expense of $72 
million allocated to SLBD and SLHMC for the carrying costs of 
buildings, improvements and equipment and certain acquisition 
related debt, which is not directly eliminated by the Primerica 
Transaction or the sale of SLHMC other than through the 
utilization of available sales proceeds.

e) Adjustment (d) is tax effected at a rate of 40%.
