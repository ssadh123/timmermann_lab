ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

A. Securities and Exchange Commission Investigation

The staff of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") has advised Service Corporation International
("the Company") that it is considering recommending to the Commission that it
institute an administrative proceeding pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), seeking cease and
desist orders against the Company, R. L. Waltrip, Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer, L. William Heiligbrodt, President and Chief Operating
Officer, and Samuel W. Rizzo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer/Treasurer, for violations of certain reporting and disclosure
requirements of the 1934 Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The
recommendation under consideration by the staff arises out of the informal
private investigation previously disclosed by the Company relating to, among
other things, the change in the Company's accountants and the Company's Form
8-K dated March 31, 1993, as amended in April 1993, reporting such change.
See Items 3 and 9 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1993. The staff has offered the Company and the named
individuals the opportunity to make a presentation with respect to the
recommendation under consideration.

B. Pro forma Financial Information

In June 1994, in connection with the ongoing acquisition program of the
Company, the Company announced an unsolicited offer to acquire 100% of the
outstanding common shares of Great Southern Group plc ("GSG"). As of September
30, 1994, the Company owned or had commitments to acquire in excess of 98% of
GSG's voting shares. The Company anticipates that the total acquisition cost
will approximate $192,777,000, including the assumption of approximately
$14,751,000 of existing indebtedness which the Company intends to repay. GSG
is a funeral provider in the United Kingdom ("UK") and owns 157 funeral homes,
13 crematoria and two cemeteries.

In September 1994, the Company announced its offer to acquire 100% of the
outstanding shares of Plantsbrook Group plc ("PG") for approximately
$312,690,000, including the assumption of approximately $13,873,000 of existing
debt. PG is a funeral provider in the UK and owns 380 funeral homes. As of
September 30, 1994, the Company owned or had commitments to acquire in excess
of 95% of PG's voting shares.

The acquisitions of GSG and PG are being financed on an interim basis with
short term UK pound sterling loan financings (the "UK Loans") in the amount of
$438,900,000 with interest based on UK pound sterling LIBOR plus 20 basis
points. The remaining financing will be provided from the Company's existing
lines of credit.

In addition to the acquisitions of GSG and PG, during 1993 and the six months
ended June 30, 1994, the Company continued to acquire funeral and cemetery
operations in the United States, Australia and Canada. Excluding GSG and PG
during such period, the Company acquired 195 funeral homes and 33 cemeteries
(the "Other Acquired Companies") in 78 separate transactions for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $395,000,000 in the form of combinations of
cash, Company common stock, issued and assumed debt, convertible debentures
and retired loans receivable held by the Company's finance subsidiary. None of
the Company's acquisitions, including GSG and PG, individually meet the
definition of a significant subsidiary as defined in the Commission's
Regulation S-X.

The following unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of June 30, 1994 
has been prepared assuming the acquisitions by the Company of GSG and PG took
place on June 30, 1994, and the unaudited pro forma combined statements of
income for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the six months ended June 30,
1994 have been prepared assuming the acquisitions by the Company of GSG, PG and
the Other Acquired Companies took place at the beginning of the respective
periods. Such acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. The historical revenues and expenses of the Other Acquired
Companies represent amounts recorded by these businesses for the period that
they were not owned by the Company during the twelve months ended December 31,
1993 and

2
<PAGE> 3
the six months ended June 30, 1994, respectively. The unaudited pro forma
combined financial information may not be indicative of results that would have
actually resulted if these transactions had occurred on the dates indicated or
which may be obtained in the future.

The historical financial statements of GSG and PG as of June 30, 1994, and for
the year and six months ended December 31, 1993 and June 30, 1994,
respectively, were prepared in pound sterling in accordance with the UK
Companies Act of 1985 ("UK GAAP"). This information has been adjusted to
present the historical financial statements in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("US GAAP") and translated into U.S.
dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date or the average
exchange rate for the respective statement of income periods presented. The
Company has not completed all appraisals and evaluations necessary to finalize
GSG's and PG's purchase price allocation, and accordingly, actual adjustments
that reflect appraisals and other evaluations of the purchased assets and
assumed liabilities may differ from the pro forma adjustments.

The Company is currently exploring alternatives to refinance the UK Loans
issued in connection with the acquisitions of GSG and PG and to reduce
borrowings under its existing credit lines. Such refinancing could include
issuance of combinations of Company common stock, preferred securities
convertible into Company common stock and fixed rate debt financings. The
Company anticipates that such refinancing, if effected under current market
conditions, would not have a significant impact on historically reported
earnings per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 1993 and six months
ended June 30, 1994, respectively.

One UK pound sterling equivalent to $1.54, which represents the exchange rate
on June 30, 1994.

(A) To record the amount of prearranged funeral contracts outstanding and
the related deferred prearranged funeral revenue in accordance with
the Company's accounting policies for GSG ($38,719) and PG

for GSG.

(E) To eliminate the previously recorded GSG and PG goodwill.

One UK pound sterling equivalent to $1.493, which represents the average
exchange rate for the period.

(A) To record the acquisition of 13 separate businesses acquired at
various dates by PG between January 1, 1993 and June 30, 1994 as if
such acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 1993. Internally
generated funds were used for the purchase of these businesses;
however, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined statement of
income imputed interest expense, calculated on the purchase price, has
been included at a rate of 6%, which approximates the Company's UK
borrowing rate.

(B) To record an adjustment to costs and expenses for the Other
Acquired Companies based on results actually achieved by the Company
for the periods subsequent to acquisition in the amount of $14,432 . 
Included are additional costs and expenses of $2,590 resulting from the
effect of applying purchase accounting adjustments, primarily
amortization and depreciation.

Interest expense was added for debt and convertible debentures
issued in the purchase of the Other Acquired Companies at stated
rates. In addition, interest expense has been added for the cash
portion of the purchase price assumed to be borrowed by the Company at
a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.51%, which represented the
weighted average borrowing rate under the Company's existing lines of
credit for the year ended December 31, 1993. At September 30, 1994,
the borrowing rate for such existing lines of credit was 5.03%.

(C) To eliminate corporate expenses, primarily consisting of duplicate 
personnel expenses, related to the acquisitions of GSG and PG.

(D) To record the depreciation expense (based on 50 year life) on
GSG's funeral buildings resulting from the estimated change in fair
value over historical cost (see note D to the Notes to the Unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet).

(E) To record the amortization of names and reputations created from
the acquisition of PG by the Company (see note F to the Notes to the
Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet). This assumes a 40 year
straight-line amortization.

(F) To eliminate the historical GSG and PG goodwill amortization expense.

(G) To record the cost of GSG's cemetery and cremation memorialization
interment rights sold.

(H) To eliminate the interest expense from GSG debt to be repaid by the
Company.

(I) To record the interest expense on amounts borrowed in connection
with the acquisition of GSG and PG as if all such borrowings had
occurred on January 1, 1993. The cash acquisition price for both
transactions was assumed to be borrowed from the Company's UK Loans at
a rate equal to the average pound sterling LIBOR rate (5.86%) plus 20
basis points for the year ended December 31, 1993 and existing lines
of credit at a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.51%, which
represents the Company's weighted average borrowing rate for such lines
of credit for the year ended December 31, 1993. At September 30, 1994
the pound sterling LIBOR rate was 5.88%.

(J) To record the tax effect of the pro forma adjustments, including a $947
tax benefit from the amortization of deferred taxes resulting from
indexed increases in the tax basis of UK assets.

(K) To give effect to the additional time period during which the
Company common stock (in the case of the primary and fully diluted

the fully diluted weighted average number of shares) issued during the
period between January 1, 1993 and June 30, 1994 in respect to the
acquisition of the Other Acquired Companies would have been outstanding
if all of such acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 1993.

One UK pound sterling equivalent to $1.5125, which represents the average
exchange rate for the period.

(A) To record the acquisition of five separate businesses acquired
at various dates by PG between January 1, 1994 and June 30, 1994 as if
such acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 1994. Internally
generated funds were used for the purchase of these businesses;
however, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined statement of
income imputed interest expense, calculated on the purchase price, has

(B) To record an adjustment to costs and expenses for the Other
Acquired Companies based on results actually achieved by the Company
for the periods subsequent to acquisition in the amount of $2,408. 
Included are additional costs and expenses of $501 resulting from the
effect of applying purchase accounting adjustments, primarily
amortization and depreciation.

Interest expense was added for debt and convertible debentures
issued in the purchase of the Other Acquired Companies at stated 
rates. In addition, interest expense has been included for the cash 
portion of the purchase price assumed to be borrowed by the Company 
at a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.93%, which represented 
the weighted average borrowing rate under the Company's existing lines 
of credit for the six months ended June 30, 1994. At September 30, 
1994, the borrowing rate for such existing lines of credit was 5.03%.

(C) To eliminate corporate expenses, primarily consisting of duplicate
personnel expenses, related to the acquisitions of GSG and PG.

(D) To record the depreciation expense (based on 50 year life) on
GSG's funeral buildings resulting from the estimated change in fair
value over historical cost (see note D to the Notes to the Unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet).

(E) To record the amortization of names and reputations created from
the acquisition of PG by the Company (see note F to the Notes to the
Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet). This assumes a 40 year
