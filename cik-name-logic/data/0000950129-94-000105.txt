Texas corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rowan Companies, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Rowan"), acquired substantially all of the assets, and
assumed certain related liabilities, of Marathon LeTourneau Company ("Marathon

Cable Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("General Cable"), and two of its
subsidiaries, in accordance with the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement among
the parties dated November 12, 1993 (the "Agreement"). The purchase price for

necessity of any of Sellers obtaining any consent, approval,
authorization or waiver or giving any notice or otherwise, except for

and such notices which have been given or are expressly contemplated

(c) Financial Statements, Etc. The following audited and
unaudited financial statements of Sellers have been delivered to Purchaser and
are attached as Schedule 2.01(c) hereto:

(1) the audited consolidated balance sheet of Sellers as of
December 31, 1992 (the "Audited Balance Sheet") and 1991 and the related
audited consolidated statements of operations, of stockholder's equity
and of cash flows for the three-year period ended December 31, 1992
(together with related notes and schedules), which financial statements
contain a report of Deloitte & Touche, independent auditors, reporting
thereon (such balance sheets, the related statements of operations, of
stockholder's equity and of cash flows, and the related notes and
schedules being hereinafter together referred to as the "Audited
Financial Statements"); and

(2) the unaudited preliminary consolidated balance sheet of
Sellers as of September 30, 1993 (the "Interim Balance Sheet") and 1992
and the related unaudited statements of operations, of stockholder's
equity and of cash flows for the nine-month periods then ended (together
with related notes and schedules) (such balance sheets, the related
statements of operations, of stockholder's equity and of cash flows, and
the related notes and schedules being hereinafter together referred to as
the "Interim Financial Statements").

The Audited Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements
(collectively, the "Financial Statements"), including the related notes and
schedules, have been prepared from the books and records of Sellers in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
consistent with preceding years ("GAAP") and present fairly the financial
position of Sellers as of the dates of such statements.

The trade accounts and other receivables of Sellers which are
classified as current assets on the Audited Balance Sheet and the Interim
Balance Sheet (collectively, the "Balance Sheets") are bona fide receivables,
were acquired in the ordinary course of business and are stated in accordance
with GAAP.

The inventories of Sellers reflected on the Balance Sheets have
been valued in accordance with GAAP, and the value of obsolete materials and
materials of below standard quality has been written down or reserved against
in accordance with GAAP.

Sellers have no liabilities other than:

(i) those set forth or reserved against in the
Interim Balance Sheet, and

(ii) those incurred since the date of the Interim
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business.

Sellers' books of account have been kept accurately in the ordinary
course of business, the transactions entered therein represent bona fide
transactions, and the

-16-
<PAGE> 21
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of Sellers have been properly
recorded in such books.

(d) Title and Condition of Assets. Sellers hold good title to
the tangible and intangible personal property owned by them that comprise the
Assets, free and clear of Liens, other than:

(1) Permitted Encumbrances, or

(2) Liens which will be released or discharged at or prior
to the Closing Date.

The tangible Assets used in the Business at any time since January
1, 1993 (i) are in good operating condition, order and repair, subject to
ordinary wear and tear, and have been maintained in accordance with standard
industry practice, and (ii) conform in all material respects with all
applicable legal requirements. All of the plants, facilities, machinery and
equipment constituting the Assets are adequate and sufficient for all
operations conducted by Sellers in substantially the same manner as conducted
prior to Closing.

Since the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, Sellers have not sold,
transferred, leased, distributed or otherwise disposed of any of its assets,
whether or not reflected on the Balance Sheet, or agreed to do so except for
sales of products and services in the ordinary course of business.

All real and tangible personal property held by Sellers under
leases are held under lease agreements that are valid and binding upon Sellers
and are in full force and effect. Sellers are not in default, and no notice of
alleged default has been received by Sellers, under any such lease and no
lessor is in default or alleged to be in default thereunder. None of the
rights of Sellers under any lease will be impaired by the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, assuming that the consent of the
lessor to the assignment of each lease described in Schedule 2.01(b) hereto is
obtained. The Assets constitute all material assets and properties, real,
personal, tangible and intangible, that are necessary for the continued conduct
of the Business as presently being conducted.

(e) Insurance. The Sellers' insurance policies covering the

have a Material Adverse Effect.

As of the date of this Agreement:

-17-
<PAGE> 22
(1) each of the Sellers is in compliance with, has conducted for
the past two years and does conduct its business and operations in compliance
with, and is not in default or violation in any respect under, any material
law, rule, regulation, writ, injunction, decree or order applicable to it or
its Assets, and

(2) there are no judgments outstanding and unsatisfied against
any of the Sellers or the Assets.

(g) Taxes. Sellers have duly filed when due, subject to any
extensions, all Tax reports and returns in connection with and in respect of
the Business, the Assets and Sellers' employees, and have timely paid and
discharged all Tax Obligations shown thereon. Sellers have made available to
Purchaser, to the extent requested by Purchaser, all Tax reports and returns of
Sellers for all periods ending prior to the date hereof.

Except as set forth on Schedule 2.01(g) hereto, Sellers have not
received notice of any Tax deficiency outstanding, proposed or assessed against
or allocable to any of the Sellers, nor have any of them executed any waiver of
any statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any Tax or

in effect extending the period for assessment or collection of any Taxes
against any of the Sellers.

Except for Liens included within clause (b) of the definition of
Permitted Encumbrances, there are no Tax Liens upon, pending against or, to the
knowledge of any Seller, threatened against any Asset.

Consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not
result in the imposition or creation of any Tax Obligations on the Assets,
except for (1) Tax Obligations which remain the liability of Sellers under
Section 7.01(c) below, or (2) Tax Obligations resulting from any Tax election
made by Purchaser after the Effective Time of Closing.

(h) Intangible Assets. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.01(h)
hereto, there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Sellers, threatened
infringement claims against any Seller by any Person with respect to any of the
Intangible Assets, nor has any such Intangible Asset been declared invalid or

Purchaser the right to use all technology, proprietary information, know-how or
patented ideas, designs, inventions, trademarks, copyrights, tradenames and
servicemarks owned by any of the Sellers or their Affiliates necessary for the
conduct of the Business as presently being conducted. The use of the
Intangible Assets will not, and does not, infringe on the rights of any other
Person.

(i) Instruments in Full Force and Effect; Possession under
Leases. The Assumed Contracts, the Scheduled Leases and other commitments,
agreements and obligations (including without limitation licenses, royalties,
assignments and similar agreements with respect to the Intangible Assets)
constituting a part of the Assets ("Instruments") are valid and binding upon
Sellers (and, to the knowledge of Sellers, are valid and binding upon the other
parties thereto) and in full force and effect, have not been amended or
supplemented in any manner or respect and upon assignment and assumption, with
applicable consents if necessary, will be enforceable by Purchaser in

-18-
<PAGE> 23
accordance with their respective terms. There are no defaults by any of the
Sellers thereunder and none of the Sellers know of any defaults thereunder by
any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time
or action or inaction by any party thereto would result in a violation thereof
or a default thereunder. None of the rights under the Instruments will be
impaired by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and all such rights will inure to and be enforceable by Purchaser
after the Closing Date without the authorization, consent, approval, permit or
licenses of, or filing with, any other Person. Sellers enjoy peaceful and
undisturbed possession under all leases included in the Scheduled Leases.

(j) Employee Plans and Agreements.

(1) Schedule 2.01(j) hereto lists all pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, medical and welfare
benefit plans or arrangements, covering the current employees of the
Sellers, true and complete copies of which, including all amendments,
trusts and insurance contracts have heretofore been furnished, or with
respect to those plans and arrangements that are not Transferred Plans,
made available to Purchaser; lists the employees of Sellers who have
entered into Transaction Bonus and Severance Agreements with Marathon
LeTourneau Company (the "Transaction Bonus Agreements") providing for
certain incentive and severance payments to such employees; describes all
material benefit, bonus or incentive practices not set forth in such
plans; and describes the severance, vacation, sick pay and sick leave
policies for employees of the Sellers (the "Benefit Arrangements").

(2) The only "pension plans," as defined in Section 3(2) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), that cover employees of the Sellers (the "Pension Plans") are
the Savings Plan, the Marathon Retirement Plan, the General Cable Plan
and the Supplemental Contracts, as defined in this Section 2.01(j). The
Sellers have at no time contributed to or been required to contribute to
any multi-employer pension plan subject to Section E of Title IV of
ERISA.

(3) Each "welfare plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, that covers employees of the Sellers (the "Welfare Plans") has
been maintained substantially in compliance with its terms and, both as
to form and operation, with the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes, orders, rules and regulations which are applicable to such
plan, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. Each Welfare Plan
that is a "group health plan", as defined in Section 607(1) of ERISA, (i)
has been operated substantially in compliance with the provisions of Part
6 of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") at all
times and (ii) except as described in item 4 of Schedule 2.01(j),
concerning continued life insurance benefits and health benefits for
employees retiring between the ages of 62 and 65 with 20 or more years of
service, does not provide for any continuation of coverage or benefits
beyond a termination of employment except to the extent mandated by
COBRA. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.01(j), no litigation,
investigation or claim (other than a routine claim for benefits) is
pending or, to the knowledge of any Seller, threatened or anticipated
(nor to the knowledge of Sellers is there any basis therefor) concerning
any Welfare Plan. Each Welfare Plan, including each such plan that is a
Transferred Plan, can be unilaterally terminated

-19-
<PAGE> 24
at any time by the Sellers without incurring any liability. Each Welfare
Plan is either funded through an insurance contract or unfunded.

(4) The Savings and Investment Plan for Marathon LeTourneau
Company Longview Division (the "Savings Plan") is a "defined contribution
plan," as defined in section 3(34) of ERISA, which is tax-qualified under
Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code, and its related trust is exempt
from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. The Sellers have received a
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating that the
Savings Plan is qualified as provided in the preceding sentence, and
nothing has occurred since the date of such letter that has adversely
affected such qualification other than changes in law not yet required to
be reflected in the plan document. All contributions to the Savings Plan
required by law have been made and all contributions (including matching
contributions) for the current year through the Closing Date shall have
been made by the Closing Date or are accrued on the Closing Balance
Sheet. None of the assets of the Savings Plan are invested in any
property constituting employer real property or an employer security
(within the meaning of Section 407(d) of ERISA) nor in any investment
that cannot be readily sold on an established securities exchange or the
over-the-counter market, other than any insurance or bank investment
contracts.

(5) The Retirement Income Plan of Marathon LeTourneau
Company (the "Marathon Retirement Plan") was merged into the General
Cable Master Pension Plan (the "General Cable Plan") on April 30, 1993
(the "Merger Date"). The Marathon Retirement Plan and the General Cable
Plan are each "defined benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA. The General Cable Plan is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, and its related trust is exempt from tax under Section 501(a)
of the Code. General Cable has received a determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service stating that the General Cable Plan is qualified
as provided in the preceding sentence, and nothing has occurred since the
date of such letter that has adversely affected such qualification other
than changes in law not yet required to be reflected in the plan
document. All contributions for periods up to the Closing Date to the
Marathon Retirement Plan and the General Cable Plan required to be made
under Section 412 of the Code or otherwise have been or will be made by
the Sellers.

(6) Marathon LeTourneau Company has entered into
supplemental pension benefit contracts (the "Supplemental Contracts")
that are unfunded and that provide deferred compensation to a select
group of highly compensated employees of the Sellers.

(7) The Sellers have not and, to the knowledge of Sellers,
no other person including any fiduciary has, engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of
ERISA) with respect to the Pension Plans or the Welfare Plans which could
subject, directly or indirectly, any such plans (or their trusts), any
trustee or administrator of any such plans, the Sellers or any other
person that the Sellers or plans may have an obligation to indemnify, to
any material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA.

any employees of Sellers.

(2) None of the Sellers is aware of any union organizing

before the National Labor Relations Board with regard to any of Sellers'

any employees of Sellers.

(3) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.01(k) hereto (any

representative of any such Person or Persons. No charge or claim
involving any of the facilities or employees of Sellers is pending before
any administrative agency, local, state or federal, and no lawsuit
involving any of such facilities or employees is pending with respect to
equal employment opportunity, age discrimination, occupational safety, or
any other form of alleged employment practice or unfair labor practice.

(4) Sellers comply with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations relating to the employment of labor, including, but without
limitation, those relating to wages, hours, concerted activity,
non-discrimination, occupational health and safety and the payment and
withholding of Taxes, and Sellers have no accrued liability for any

any solid or hazardous waste, hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, oil,
petroleum product, commercial product or other substance: (x) which is listed,
regulated or designated as toxic or hazardous (or words of similar meaning and
regulatory effect), or with respect to which remedial obligations may be

government employee or other Person who is or may be in a position to help or
hinder the business of Sellers (or to assist Sellers in connection with any
actual or proposed transaction) which (1) may reasonably be expected to subject
Sellers to any damage or penalty in any civil, criminal or governmental
litigation or proceeding, (2) if not given in the past, would reasonably be
expected to have had a Material Adverse Effect on the assets, business or
operations of Sellers, or (3) if not continued in the future, would reasonably
be expected to materially adversely affect the assets, business operations or
prospects of Sellers.

(r) Names. The use of the name "LeTourneau" does not infringe
the right of any third party in any jurisdiction where any Seller presently
conducts the Business nor is it confusingly similar with the corporate name of
any third party. Except as provided in Section 3.08 hereto, after the Closing
Date, no Person or business entity other than Purchaser will be authorized
directly or indirectly to use the names "Marathon LeTourneau," "R.G.
LeTourneau" and "LeTourneau" or any name or names deceptively or confusingly
similar thereto.

only to the representations and warranties in the specific Section of

or operated by it and to carry on its businesses as now conducted.

approval, authorization or waiver or giving any notice or otherwise, except for
such consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers and notices which have been
obtained and are unconditional and are in full force and effect and such
notices which have been given or are expressly contemplated hereby.

extent that the satisfaction of such conditions is in the control of Sellers or
Parent, and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
conditions to the obligations of Sellers contained in Section 4.02 to be
satisfied to the extent that the satisfaction of such conditions is in the
control of Purchaser.

3.06. Insurance. As of the Closing Date, Sellers shall cease to
be covered with respect to any occurrence after the Closing Date under the
insurance policies obtained and maintained by Sellers covering the business,
property and employees of Sellers. All such occurrences prior to the Closing
Date that are insured under such policies shall continue to be so insured, and
Purchaser shall be entitled to the benefits thereof. At Purchaser's request,
Sellers shall make copies of such policies available to Purchaser for
inspection and shall assist Purchaser in determining whether any claim or loss
is covered by such policies of insurance.

Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall give to Sellers prompt
notice of the assertion by any Person of any claim against Sellers which may
reasonably be subject to the insurance coverage described in this Section 3.06.
Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers and any applicable insurance carrier in
any investigation by Sellers or any applicable insurance carrier of any such
claim and shall give to Sellers and any applicable insurance carrier reasonable
access to the books, records and personnel formerly of Sellers to the extent
reasonably necessary to enable Sellers and any applicable insurance carrier to
investigate such claim.

3.07. Payment of Liabilities. Sellers shall pay or otherwise
satisfy in the ordinary course all of Sellers' trade payables and shall fully
pay or otherwise satisfy all other claims or liabilities relating to the assets
or the business of Sellers incurred through the Closing Date, including the
Assumed Obligations. Sellers shall pay when due any sales, transfer or similar
Taxes which may become applicable in respect of Sellers' sale of the Business
or any of the Assets to Purchaser.

3.08. Change of Sellers' Name. Immediately following the Closing,
Sellers shall cease to use the name "Marathon LeTourneau" or "LeTourneau" or
any similar name and shall cause R.G. LeTourneau to cease using such name and
as soon as practical thereafter will file with the office of the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or other appropriate jurisdiction all documents
necessary to change the name of Sellers to

-29-
<PAGE> 34
a name reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser which name does not include
"Marathon" or "LeTourneau." Pending the effectiveness of such name changes,
Sellers and R.G. LeTourneau shall file all necessary documentation with the
appropriate governmental authorities to evidence its doing business as an
entity using a name other than "Marathon LeTourneau" or "LeTourneau." Sellers
shall take the equivalent action with respect to such name in any other
jurisdiction where it has been, is or is licensed to be used. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
certain Subsidiaries and Affiliates of The Penn Central Corporation have the
perpetual right and license, until abandoned, to use the "Marathon" name and
associated rights consistent with the terms of that Intercompany Agreement
entered into between General Cable and The Penn Central Corporation dated as of
June 9, 1992, a copy of which has been provided to Purchaser.

3.09. Vacate Real Property. Sellers shall vacate all of the Real
Property at the Closing Date.

3.10 Title.

(a) Sellers shall, as soon as practicable and no later than the
fifteenth day prior to the Closing Date, furnish to Purchaser an Owners Title
Policy Commitment (the "Commitment") issued by a title company reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser which shall show good and indefeasible title to the
Real Property to be vested in Sellers and shall contain or be subject to no
exceptions, conditions or stipulations except ad valorem Taxes for the current
year, Permitted Encumbrances or other matters approved in writing by Purchaser.

(b) In the event there are any Liens of any nature affecting the
Real Property or its use, the Commitment shall list and specifically describe
all instruments (including all pertinent recording data thereof) embodying,
containing or evidencing each and all of said Liens.

(c) Sellers shall as soon as practicable and no later than the
fifth business day prior to the Closing Date, at their expense, obtain and
furnish to Purchaser current date as-built surveys (the "Surveys") of the Real
Property (1) showing all boundaries and the location of all existing
improvements thereon, (2) showing any and all easements, rights-of-way and
encroachments, and (3) containing a statement of the area of the Real Property
so that any exception relating to matters which a correct survey would show may
be deleted from the Commitment.

(d) Purchaser shall advise Sellers whether it accepts said
Surveys and Commitment as soon as practicable after receipt thereof.

3.11. Antitrust Law Compliance. As promptly as practicable, but 
no later than 10 business days after the date hereof, (a) Parent and Sellers 
and (b) Purchaser shall prepare and file with the United States Department of 
Justice (the "Department") and the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") the 
notification and report form with respect to the transactions contemplated by 
this Agreement as required pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"). Parent, Sellers and Purchaser shall 
each cooperate with the others in preparation of such filings and shall 
promptly comply with any reasonable request by the Department or the FTC for

-30-
<PAGE> 35
supplemental information and shall use their best efforts to obtain early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act.

3.12 Schedule Supplements. Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser a
supplement ("Supplement") to any of the Schedules attached hereto within 10
business days of the date of this Agreement disclosing any event which changes
any representation or warranty made by Sellers or Parent in this Agreement or
any statement made in any of the Schedules attached hereto or in any
Supplement. Purchaser shall have 30 days in which to notify Sellers that
Purchaser does not accept such Supplement. If Sellers do not receive such
notice, the Supplement will be deemed accepted by Purchaser.

3.13 Environmental Report.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser, with Sellers'
cooperation, will undertake a complete environmental review report
("Environmental Report") of the Assets and the Business prepared by an
environmental consultant chosen by Purchaser for purposes of determining any
evidence of non-compliance with, and the degree of any necessary reclamation,
remediation or other compliance obligations under, Environmental Laws. In
connection therewith, Purchaser, Sellers and their respective consultants will
prepare a detailed estimate of the probable cost of such reclamation,
remediation or compliance measures and a preliminary work plan for implementing
such measures ("Remediation Estimate"). Sellers may hire an environmental
consultant to participate in or monitor the preparation of the Environmental
Report and Remediation Estimate at Sellers' expense. In the event Purchaser
and Sellers are unable to agree on the compliance measures required, the costs
of such measures, or the work plan to implement such measures, the parties
shall appoint a third consultant to review such conflicting proposed
remediation estimates, which consultant must choose one or the other of such
proposed remediation estimates as the more nearly correct, which determination
shall be conclusive on all parties.

Purchaser and Sellers agree to share the Environmental Report and
the Remediation Estimate, and to make available their respective consultants to
discuss the contents of those documents. All work product prepared in
connection with this Section 3.13, including without limitation documents
prepared and information exchanged among the consultants, Sellers and/or
Purchaser, shall be for the joint defense of both Purchaser and Sellers against
potential third party claimants, and each will take appropriate measures to
protect the confidentiality of and legal privileges attached to such work
product; provided, however, that the duty of Purchaser and Sellers to protect
work product under this provision shall not limit or prevent the use of any
such information in a dispute between themselves.

(b) Subject only to Section 5.01(a)(5) or 5.01(a)(6), Sellers
shall diligently proceed to perform the reclamation, remediation or other
corrective obligations identified in the Environmental Report (including,
without limitation, the items identified on Schedule 2.01(o)) as necessary to
bring all conditions on the Assets and all properties that will be used, leased
or maintained by Purchaser into compliance with Environmental Laws (the
"Required Remediation") as quickly as practicable, with no more than minimal
and temporary interruption or disruption of Purchaser's conduct of the
Business. The conduct of the Required Remediation shall be under Sellers'
control, subject, however, to Purchaser's prior approval of the extent, methods
and timing of all

-31-
<PAGE> 36
work required, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Sellers
shall use their best efforts to complete the Required Remediation without undue
or unnecessary delay, but will not be obligated to incur extraordinary costs
for contractor overtime or surcharges for accelerated laboratory analyses
unless such charges are necessary to meet the work schedule previously approved
by Purchaser.

(c) Sellers shall pay all costs and penalties arising out of or
relating to the Required Remediation. If the Remediation Estimate exceeds
$1,000,000, Sellers shall deposit into escrow with a Person acceptable to
Purchaser on the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to 50% of the amount by
which such costs exceed $1,000,000. Such escrowed funds shall be released for
payment (or reimbursement to Sellers if already paid by Sellers) as cash
payments are required to be made, against vendor invoices. The parties hereto
recognize that the actual costs of the Required Remediation may vary, and could
vary substantially, from the Remediation Estimate, and Sellers' agreement to
perform the Required Remediation shall be unconditional once the Closing has
occurred.

(d) Sellers and their officers, directors, employees and Agents
may enter upon and use the remediated sites (including all roads and driveways
upon the remediated sites), at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, for
the purpose of performing Required Remediation.

(e) Sellers will perform and complete all actions in connection
with Required Remediation in compliance with Environmental Laws and other
applicable laws and in such a manner as to minimize, to the extent practicable,
damage to the remediated sites and the improvements thereon and disruption or
interference with the use of the remediated sites and the improvements thereon
by Purchasers or any tenants, employees or business invitees of Purchasers.

(f) Purchasers and Sellers will, to the extent reasonably
requested by the other: (i) cooperate in any Required Remediation, (ii) make
employees of Purchaser or Sellers available to meet on or off site with Sellers
and its environmental consultants or other representatives on matters relating
to any such remediation; (iii) make employees of Purchaser or Sellers available
to meet with federal, state and local environmental regulatory officials if,
when and as requested; and (iv) provide reasonable access to or copies of such
documents, records and other data as either may reasonably request in
connection with any such remediation.

employees of the Business set forth on Schedule 6.01 hereto, and Sellers will
use reasonable efforts to cause such employees to make available their
employment services to Purchaser and its subsidiaries. Sellers will not,
without Purchaser's prior written consent, offer, and will not permit any of
their Affiliates to offer, employment within two years of the Closing Date to
any such employee to whom Purchaser or one of its subsidiaries offers
employment. Except as provided in Exhibit 6.02, Purchaser will not be obligated
to assume or pay any employee benefit (statutory or otherwise) or compensation
plan or arrangement or portion thereof, severance obligations or any other
obligations that may become payable as a result of the consummation of the

such obligation is attributable to employment by Sellers prior to the Closing
Date. Further, if (1) an employee of Marathon LeTourneau Australia Pty. Ltd.
named on Schedule 6.01 becomes employed by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates
and (2) any law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order or determination
of any Governmental Body (including common law duties established by courts or
other Governmental Bodies) in any jurisdiction (federal, state, local or
foreign) would require Purchaser to pay severance or separation pay to such
employee upon his or her

-36-
<PAGE> 41
termination of employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, which
severance or separation pay is computed or determined, in whole or in part, by
reference to such employee's period of service with Sellers then with respect
to such employee, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the Severance Amount within 30
days after the date Purchaser notifies Sellers that such employee's employment
with Purchaser and its Affiliates has been terminated in a manner that requires
that such payment be made. The term "Severance Amount" shall mean the amount
of severance or separation pay required to be paid to such an employee by
Purchaser or its Affiliates under such law, statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation, order or determination which is attributable to such employee's
period of service with Sellers or its Affiliates (or with any other prior
employer).

6.02. Employee Benefit Matters.

The treatment of the Benefit Arrangements of the Sellers shall be
in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit 6.02 hereto, which Exhibit shall
be incorporated herein as part of this Article VI.

1.05.

7.02. Notice, Participation and Duration.

(a) If a claim by a third party is made against a party
indemnified pursuant to this Article VII ("Indemnitee"), and if such Indemnitee

any fact upon which Indemnitee intends to base a claim

-38-
<PAGE> 43
for indemnification under this Agreement ("Claim"), notify the party or parties
from whom indemnification is sought ("Indemnitor") of such Claim. In the event
of any Claim, Indemnitor, at its option, may assume (with legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee) the defense of any claim, demand,
lawsuit or other proceeding in connection with the Indemnitee's Claim, and may
assert any defense of Indemnitee or Indemnitor; provided that Indemnitee shall
have the right at its own expense to participate jointly with Indemnitor in the
defense of any claim, demand, lawsuit or other proceeding in connection with
the Indemnitee's Claim. In the event that Indemnitor elects to undertake the
defense of any Claim hereunder, Indemnitee shall cooperate with Indemnitor to
the fullest extent possible in regard to all matters relating to the Claim
(including, without limitation, corrective actions required by applicable law,
assertion of defenses and the determination, mitigation, negotiation and
settlement of all amounts, costs, actions, penalties, damages and the like
related thereto) so as to permit Indemnitor's management of same with regard to
the amount of Damages payable by the Indemnitor hereunder. Neither Purchaser
nor any Sellers shall be entitled to settle any Claim without the prior written
consent of the other, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.

(b) No claim for indemnification under this Section 7.02 may be
made after the third anniversary of the Closing Date, except claims for
indemnification in respect of breaches of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 2.01(o) hereof may be made until the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect any
claim made in good faith prior to the date of such expiration.

7.03. Indemnification if Negligence of Indemnitee. It is

(a) Each of the Purchaser and the Sellers and their respective
successors and assigns agree not to assert any Claim under this Agreement

which event the indemnified party shall only be entitled to indemnification for

the other shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in
full force and effect until the third anniversary of the Date hereof at which
time they shall terminate except for any bona fide Claim theretofore asserted,
which shall survive until its resolution; provided, however, that with respect
to any Claim pursuant to any matter arising under

-39-
<PAGE> 44
Section 2.01(o) hereof, such obligation shall survive and remain in full force
and effect until the fifth anniversary of the date hereof.

7.05. Reimbursement. In the event that the Indemnitor shall
undertake, conduct or control the defense or settlement of any Claim and it is
later determined that such Claim was not a Claim for which the Indemnitor is
required to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Article VII, the Indemnitee
shall reimburse the Indemnitor for all its costs and expenses with respect to
such settlement or defense, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements.

7.06. Offset. Any indemnified party may bring an action at
law or in equity to enforce its rights to indemnification under this Article
VII, and Purchaser shall also have the right to offset any amounts for which it
or any other Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this
Article VII against any amounts payable by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to
the Offset Note. Purchaser may offset any such amounts to the extent Purchaser
reasonably believes such offset is appropriate. Any offset by Purchaser may be
subject to immediate binding arbitration as provided in Section 8.17.

7.07. No Third Party Beneficiaries. The foregoing

provision exists, be in any way impaired.

and relate to the business, operations, income, expenses and assets of Sellers
existing on, accruing or arising prior to or occurring prior to Effective Time
of Closing, but any access pursuant to this Section 8.14 shall be conducted in
such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operations of the
Business following the Closing Date.

(b) Following the Closing Date, and for a period of five years
thereafter Sellers shall preserve and shall give to Purchaser free and
unrestricted access to (and the right to make copies at the expense of
Purchaser) the books, files, records and Tax returns and supporting schedules
and work papers of Sellers to the extent that such relate to the business,
operations, income, expenses and assets of Sellers existing on, accruing or
arising prior to or occurring prior to the Closing Date, but any access
pursuant to this Section 8.14 shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the operations of the business of Sellers following

<PAGE> 48
(d) After the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, all such
records referred to in this Section 8.14 may be destroyed by a party if such
party sends to the other parties written notice of its intent to destroy
records, specifying with particularity the contents of the records to be
destroyed. Such records may then be destroyed after the 90th day after such
notice is given unless another party objects to the destruction in which case
the party seeking to destroy the records shall deliver such records to the
objecting party at the expense of the objecting party.

(e) After Closing, Purchaser will make available such of its
personnel and records as Sellers reasonably require, in connection with the
defense of any claims and items of litigation retained by any Seller, but on
the condition that such Seller reimburse Purchaser for reasonable direct
expenses incurred by Purchaser in making such persons available, such as travel
expenses and other out-of-pocket expenses.

8.15. Payments Received. Sellers and Purchaser each agree that
following the Closing Date, they will hold and will promptly transfer and
deliver to the other, from time to time as and when received by them, any cash,
checks with appropriate endorsements, or other property that they may receive
on or after the the Closing Date which properly belongs to the other party,
including without limitation any insurance proceeds, and will account to the
other for all such receipts. From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
have the right to endorse without recourse the name of any Seller on any check
or any other evidences of indebtedness received by Purchaser on account of the
Business and the Assets transferred to Purchaser hereunder.

8.16. Cost of Litigation. If any legal action or other proceeding 
is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement or because of an alleged 
dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with this Agreement 
or the transactions contemplated hereby, the successful or prevailing party or 
parties shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs 
incurred in connection with such action or proceeding, in addition to any other 
relief to which it or they may be entitled, subject to Section 7.04.

8.17. Arbitration Procedures. If at any time, Purchaser exercises 
its right of offset as provided in Section 7.06 and Sellers reasonably believe 
such offset is invalid, Sellers shall provide written notice to Purchaser 
which notice shall indicate that Sellers desire to submit the issue of the 
validity of such offset to arbitration in accordance with the following 
procedures. In Sellers' arbitration notice, Sellers shall include a list of 
five or more arbitrators who would be acceptable to Sellers. The Purchaser 
shall within ten (10) days following receipt of such notice either specify one 
of the arbitrators on Sellers' list as a mutually acceptable arbitrator or name 
a separate arbitrator to serve as an arbitrator on behalf of Purchaser. If a 
mutual arbitrator is selected by Sellers and Purchaser, then such arbitrator 
shall serve as the sole arbitrator; however, if the Purchaser names a separate 
arbitrator, then the arbitration shall be determined by three arbitrators 
including the arbitrator selected by Purchaser, an arbitrator selected by 
Sellers and a third arbitrator selected by the two arbitrators so selected, or 
if they are unable to agree, selected by the Houston office of the American 
Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted in Houston, Texas 
in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration 
Association. In the event the arbitrator(s) determine that the offset is 
invalid, Purchaser shall promptly pay Sellers an amount

-44-
<PAGE> 49
equal to the offset amount plus interest at a rate of 7% to the date of the
arbitration decision.

no representation or warranty to Purchaser with respect to (a) the information
set forth in the Confidential Offering Memorandum distributed by The First
Boston Corporation in connection with the offering of the Assets or (b) any
financial projection or forecast delivered by or on behalf of the Sellers to
Purchaser. Purchaser acknowledges that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such projections and forecasts, (ii) it is familiar with
such uncertainties, (iii) it is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all such projections and forecasts
so furnished to it and (iv) it shall have no claims against Sellers with
respect thereto.

and acknowledges that it is a "Business Consumer" for the purposes of the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices - Consumer Protection Act (Subchapter E of Chapter 17
of the Texas Business and Commerce Code), that it has assets of $5,000,00 or

merits and risks of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the
Operative Agreements, that it has been represented by legal counsel of its
choice entering into this Agreement and the Operative Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and that it is not in a
significantly disparate bargaining position with respect to the parties to and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Operative Agreements.
