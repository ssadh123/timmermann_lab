REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS ..................................

To the Shareowners of American Telephone and Telegraph Company:
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of American
Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) and subsidiaries at December
31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of
income and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992
and 1991. These financial statements are the responsibility of
AT&T's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of AT&T and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993
and 1992, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and
1991, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 1993
AT&T changed its methods of accounting for postretirement benefits,
postemployment benefits and income taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND
TELEGRAPH COMPANY (AT&T)
AND SUBSIDIARIES 

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ............................

CONSOLIDATION

Ownership of affiliates Accounting method
_____________________________________________________________________
More than 50% Fully consolidated
20% to 50% Equity method 
Less than 20% Cost method
_____________________________________________________________________
We include the accounts of operations located outside the U.S. on the basis
of their fiscal years, ended either November 30 or December 31.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

For the business we transact in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we
translate income statement amounts at average exchange rates for the year,
and we translate assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates. We show
the adjustments from balance sheet translation as a separate component of
shareowners' equity. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue from Basis of recognition
_____________________________________________________________________
Telecommunications Minutes of traffic processed and 
Services contracted fees
Products and Systems Upon performance of contractual 
obligations
Rentals and Other Proportionately over contract 
Services period or as services are 
performed
Financial Services Over the life of the finance 
and Leasing receivables using the interest
method
_____________________________________________________________________

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We expense research and development expenditures as incurred (including
development costs of software that we plan to sell) until technological
feasibility is established. After that time, we capitalize the remaining
software production costs as other assets and amortize them to product costs
over the estimated period of sales.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest expense is the interest on short-term and long-term debt and accrued
liabilities, excluding the interest related to our financial services
operations, which is included in cost of financial services and leasing, and
net of interest capitalized in connection with construction. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 9

INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS

For financial reporting purposes, we amortize investment tax credits as a
reduction to the provision for income taxes over the useful lives of the
property that produced the credits.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

We use the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock
equivalents outstanding during each period to compute earnings per common
share. Common stock equivalents are stock options that we assume to be
exercised for the purposes of this computation.

TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS

We consider temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents for cash flow
reporting purposes. They are highly liquid and have original maturities
generally of three months or less.

INVENTORIES

We state inventories at the lower of cost or market. We determine cost
principally on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

We state property, plant and equipment at cost and determine depreciation
using either the group or unit method. The unit method is used primarily for
factory facilities, laboratory equipment, large computer systems, and certain
international earth stations and submarine cables. The group method is used
for most other depreciable assets. When we dispose of assets that were
depreciated using the unit method, we include the gains or losses in
operating results. When we sell or retire plant that was depreciated using
the group method, we deduct the original cost from the plant account and from
accumulated depreciation.
We use accelerated depreciation methods for factory facilities and digital
equipment used in the telecommunications network, except switching equipment
placed in service before 1989. All other plant and equipment is depreciated
on a straight-line basis.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of
net assets acquired in business combinations treated as purchases. We
amortize goodwill on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited,
principally in the range of 10 to 15 years. 

RECLASSIFICATIONS

We reclassified certain amounts for previous years to conform with the 1993
presentation.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 10

2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ......................................

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,"
effective January 1, 1993. This standard requires us to accrue estimated
future retiree benefits during the years employees are working and
accumulating these benefits. Previously, we expensed health care benefits as
claims were incurred and life insurance benefits as plans were funded.
When we adopted the new standard, we had an accumulated liability related
to past service from retirees and active employees. A portion of that
liability was provided for by group life insurance benefits and trusts for
health care benefits funded before 1993.
We also reimburse the divested regional Bell companies for a portion of
their costs to provide health care benefits, increases in pensions and other
benefits to predivestiture retirees under the terms of the Divestiture Plan
of Reorganization. Through 1992 we expensed these reimbursements as
incurred. In January 1993 we recognized this liability in connection with
the adoption of SFAS No. 106. 
We elected to record a one-time pretax charge of $11,317 million to record
the unfunded portions of these liabilities. That charge reflects $12,986
million of liabilities less $1,669 million of plan assets and amounts
previously recorded. After taxes, that charge was $7,023 million ($5.19 per
share), including $1,375 million for predivestiture retirees. Apart from
these cumulative effects on prior years of the accounting change, our change
in accounting had no material effect on net income in 1993 and is not
expected to affect net income materially in future periods. This change does
not affect cash flows.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

We also adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," effective January 1, 1993. Analogous to SFAS No. 106, this
standard requires us to accrue for estimated future postemployment benefits,
including separation payments, during the years employees are working and
accumulating these benefits, and for disability payments when the
disabilities occur. Before this change in accounting, we recognized costs
for separations when they were identified and disability benefits when they
were paid.
When we adopted the new standard, we had an accumulated liability for
payments to employees who were then disabled and for benefits related to the
past service of active employees. We recorded a one-time pretax charge of
$1,809 million to record the unprovided portion of these liabilities. That
charge reflects $2,221 million of liabilities less $412 million of reserves
for business restructuring activities that were established before 1993 and
reclassified to postemployment liabilities as part of this accounting change. 
After taxes, that charge was $1,128 million ($0.83 per share). The change in
accounting reduced operating income by $301 million, and net income by $171
million ($0.13 per share) in 1993. This change does not affect cash flows.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 11

INCOME TAXES

We also adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," effective
January 1, 1993. Among other provisions, this standard requires us to
compute deferred tax accounts using the enacted corporate income tax rates
for the years in which the taxes will be paid or refunds received. Before
1993 our deferred tax accounts reflected the rates in effect when we made the
deferrals.
Because corporate income tax rates in 1993 were lower than the rates that
existed before the 1986 Tax Act, our adoption of the new standard raised net
income by $383 million ($0.28 per share). Apart from this benefit, the new
accounting method had no material effect on net income in 1993. Unless
Congress changes tax rates, we do not expect this change to affect net income
materially in future periods. This change does not affect cash flows.

3. PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING CHANGES ........................................

DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

In 1994 we must adopt SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities." This standard addresses the accounting and
reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable
fair values and for all investments in debt securities. We do not expect
this new standard to affect net income materially at or after adoption, and
it will not affect cash flows. 

IMPAIRED LOANS

By 1995 we must adopt SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan." This standard requires us to compute present values for impaired
loans when determining our allowances for credit losses. We do not expect
this new standard to affect net income materially at or after adoption, and
it will not affect cash flows.

4. PROSPECTIVE MERGER WITH MCCAW CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS, INC. (MCCAW) ...

On August 16, 1993 AT&T and McCaw entered into a definitive agreement to
merge McCaw and a subsidiary of AT&T, making McCaw a wholly owned subsidiary
of AT&T.
In the merger, each share of McCaw's Class A and Class B common stock will
be converted into one share of AT&T common stock. However, if the 20-day-
average market price of the AT&T common stock as of five business days before
the merger is less than $53 per share, the conversion ratio will be adjusted
upward to provide shares of AT&T common stock having an aggregate market
price of $53 for each share of McCaw common stock, subject to a maximum of
1.111 shares of AT&T common stock. If the 20-day-average market price of
AT&T common stock as of five business days before the merger is 
greater than $71.73 per share, the conversion ratio will be adjusted downward
to provide shares of AT&T common stock having an aggregate market price of
$71.73 for each share of McCaw common stock, subject to a minimum of .909 of
a share of AT&T common stock.
Pursuant to a separate agreement, AT&T has granted McCaw the right, in the
event the merger does not close, to require AT&T to purchase from McCaw $600
million of McCaw's Class A common stock at a price of $51.25 per share.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 12

The merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of
regulatory approvals, expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (HSR Act), receipt of opinions that the
merger will be tax free and will be accounted for as a pooling of interests,
and McCaw stockholder approval. McCaw stockholders holding a majority of the
voting power of the McCaw common stock, including members of the McCaw family
and British Telecommunications plc, have agreed to vote in favor of the
merger.
The waiting period under the HSR Act will not expire until 20 days after
AT&T and McCaw have substantially complied with a September 1993 request from
the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for additional information and
documents.
In August 1993 AT&T and McCaw filed applications seeking consent of the FCC
to the proposed transfer of control of McCaw's radio licenses to AT&T. A
number of AT&T's competitors have sought to have conditions imposed on the
merger or to deny FCC consent. Final comments were filed in January 1994.
AT&T and McCaw filed applications with nine state regulatory commissions
seeking approval or a statement of non-opposition to the merger. All of the
states, except California have done so. In California, AT&T and McCaw
entered into a settlement agreement with the original opposing parties
regarding the provision of cellular and interexchange services in that state. 
In January 1994 AT&T and McCaw filed a reply to objections to the settlement.
BellSouth Corp. (BellSouth) filed a motion in federal court in December
1993 contending that AT&T requires a waiver of the antitrust consent decree
to proceed with the merger. In January 1994 the DOJ filed a response that
supported that motion in part. AT&T is seeking expedited determination of
the issues raised by BellSouth's motion or, alternatively, an expedited
waiver of any relevant decree provisions.

6. BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES...............................

Provisions for business restructuring include the estimated costs of specific
plans to close offices, consolidate facilities, relocate employees and
fulfill contractual obligations, and of other activities involved in
restructuring operations. These provisions also cover separation payments
made as a result of special offers related to defined benefit plans. Before
we changed our accounting for postemployment benefits in 1993, costs for
other types of separation payments were also included in these provisions. 

Our $498 million in provisions for business restructuring in 1993 covered
$227 million of costs at AT&T Global Information Solutions (including, in
millions, $137 for special termination benefits, $43 for closing facilities,
$18 for employee relocation, $19 for contractual obligations and $10 for
other related expenses). We also provided $215 million for reengineering
customer support functions for telecommunications services (including, in
millions, $55 for employee relocation, $25 for outplacement 
costs, $30 for legal contingencies and $105 for closing facilities, lease
terminations and asset abandonments associated with centralizing support
services). The remaining provisions consist of $23 million related to
closing plants for manufacturing telecommunications network systems, and $33
million for employee relocation, outplacement services and legal liabilities
related to restructuring operations that service the U.S. federal government. 

In 1991 we recorded approximately $4.5 billion of business restructuring
and other charges, reducing net income by $2,863 million ($2.21 per share). 
The charges covered estimated costs of changes in our computer operations,
PBX operations and product distribution processes; consolidating operations
in leased and owned buildings and recognizing costs of vacant space;
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 15

eliminating a future subsidy to an Alaskan long distance company; writing
down an investment; and other restructuring-related activities, merger-
related expenses and other charges. We recorded these charges as $3,572
million in provisions for business restructuring; $501 million as selling,
general and administrative expenses; $123 million as cost of products and
systems; and the remainder as other costs and expenses, including other
income - net. Charges included in other accounts in 1991 were primarily for
expenses related to the restructuring activities, writing down impaired
assets and merger-related expenses.
The remaining reserves for separation payments at January 1, 1993, were
included in the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for
postemployment benefits. We believe that the balance of reserves for all
other business restructuring activities, $1,440 million at December 31, 1993,
is adequate for the completion of those activities.

7. OTHER INCOME-NET.......................................................

In June 1993 we sold our remaining 77% interest in UNIX System Laboratories,
Inc. to Novell, Inc. (Novell) in exchange for approximately 3% of Novell
common stock. Our gain on the sale was $217 million.
We sold our remaining interest in Compagnie Industriali Riunite S.p.A. in
1993 for a slight gain. We reduced the carrying value of that investment by
$68 million in 1992 and by $218 million in 1991 because of a sustained
decline in its market value. 
In 1991 we had a $171 million gain from selling our 19% equity investment
in Sun Microsystems, Inc. 

8. SALE OF STOCK BY SUBSIDIARIES ........................................

In August 1993 AT&T Capital Corporation sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock
in an initial public offering and approximately 850,000 shares of common
stock in a management offering. That was about 14% of the shares
outstanding, so our ownership is now about 86%. The shares were sold at
$21.50 per share, yielding net proceeds of $115 million excluding $18 million
of recourse loans attributable to the management offering. Because of these
loans, we recorded a $9 million loss on the sale. When the loans are
collected in seven years, we expect to report a net $6 million gain from this
sale of stock.
In 1991 UNIX Systems Laboratories, Inc. sold about 20% of its stock to
other companies to encourage their support for open computing standards. We
had a $43 million gain on that sale. Proceeds from the sale were in cash and
we did not provide for deferred taxes on the gain.

refunded in future periods. Deferred taxes arise because of
differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and
liabilities.

In 1992 we recorded the retained earnings of Teradata Corporation (Teradata)
as of January 1, after making adjustments associated with the merger. In
September 1991 NCR Corporation (NCR) issued 6.3 million shares of NCR common
stock in connection with the merger with AT&T. The shares were converted
into approximately 17.9 million shares of our common stock upon consummation
of the merger. 
In March 1990 we issued 13.4 million new shares of common stock in
connection with the establishment of an ESOP feature for the non-management
savings plan. The shares are being allocated to plan participants over ten
years commencing in July 1990 as contributions are made to the plan.
We have 100 million authorized shares of preferred stock at $1 par value. 
No preferred stock is currently issued or outstanding.

to AT&T and $2 billion to AT&T Capital Corp. (AT&T Capital). These facilities
are intended for general corporate purposes, which include support for AT&T's
and AT&T Capital's commercial paper. They were unused at December 31, 1993. 

13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS ...............................................

PENSION PLANS

We sponsor non-contributory defined benefit plans covering the majority of
our employees. Benefits for management employees are principally based on
career-average pay. Benefits for occupational employees are not directly
pay-related.
Pension contributions are principally determined using the aggregate cost
method and are primarily made to trust funds held for the sole benefit of
plan participants. We compute pension cost using the projected unit credit
method and assumed a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 9.0% in 1993,
9.0% in 1992 and 8.6% in 1991. Pension cost includes the following
components:

====================================================================
*The actual return on plan assets was $5,068 in 1993, $2,153 in 1992
and $6,980 in 1991.

This table shows the funded status of the defined benefit plans:

____________________________________________________________________
Prepaid pension costs $ 3,308 $ 3,127 
====================================================================

We used these rates and assumptions to calculate the projected
benefit obligation:

At December 31 1993 1992
====================================================================
Weighted-average discount rate 7.5% 8.3%
Rate of increase in future
compensation levels 5.0% 5.0% 
____________________________________________________________________

The prepaid pension costs shown above are net of pension liabilities for
plans where accumulated plan benefits exceed assets. Such liabilities are
included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
We are amortizing over approximately 15.9 years the unrecognized transition
asset related to our 1986 adoption of SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for
Pensions." We amortize prior service costs primarily on a straight-line
basis over the average remaining service period of active employees. Our
plan assets consist primarily of listed stocks (including $378 million and
$451 million of AT&T common stock at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively), corporate and governmental debt, real estate investments, and
cash and cash equivalents.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 22

SAVINGS PLANS

We sponsor savings plans for the majority of our employees. The plans allow
employees to contribute a portion of their pretax and/or after-tax income in
accordance with specified guidelines. We match a percentage of the employee
contributions up to certain limits. Our contributions in millions amounted
to $347 in 1993, $331 in 1992 and $279 in 1991.

14. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ..............................................

Our benefit plans for retirees include health care benefits, life insurance
coverage and telephone concessions. This table shows the components of the
net postretirement benefit cost:

Dollars in millions 1993 
===========================================================
Service cost-benefits earned during the period $ 95
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation 868
Credit for expected return on plan assets* (180)
Amortization of unrecognized prior service costs 29
Charge for special options 29 
___________________________________________________________
Net postretirement benefit cost $841 
===========================================================
* The actual return on plan assets was $243.

We did not restate our 1991 and 1992 financial statements to reflect the
change in accounting for retiree benefits. This table shows our actual
postretirement benefit costs on a pay-as-you-go basis in those years: 

Dollars in millions at December 31, 1992 1991
=====================================================================
Cost of health care benefits for retirees $532 $532
Cost of life insurance benefits for retirees 3 26
Cost of telephone concessions and other benefits 39 35
Payments to regional Bell companies
for predivestiture retirees 145 125
_____________________________________________________________________
Postretirement benefit cost $719 $718
=====================================================================

We had approximately 142,200 retirees in 1993, 141,200 in 1992 and 138,500
in 1991.
Our plan assets consist primarily of listed stocks, corporate and 
governmental debt, cash and cash equivalents and life insurance
contracts. This table shows the funded status of our postretirement benefit
plans reconciled with the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance
sheet:

Dollars in millions at December 31 1993 
===========================================================
Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
Retirees $ 8,928
Fully eligible active plan participants 893
Other active plan participants 2,092
___________________________________________________________
Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 11,913
Plan assets at fair value 2,900
___________________________________________________________
Unfunded postretirement obligation 9,013
Unrecognized prior service costs 283
Unrecognized net loss 569
___________________________________________________________
Accrued postretirement benefit obligation $ 8,161 
===========================================================<PAGE>
<PAGE> 23

We made these assumptions in valuing our postretirement
benefit obligation at December 31, 1993:

===========================================================
Weighted-average discount rate 7.5%
Expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets 9.0%
Assumed rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits 9.4% 
=========================================================== 

We assumed that the growth in the per capita cost of covered health care
benefits (the health care cost trend rate) would gradually decline after 1994
to 5.6% by the year 2021 and then remain level. This assumption greatly
affects the amounts reported. To illustrate, increasing the assumed trend
rate by 1% in each year would raise our accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at December 31, 1993 by $758 million and our 1993 postretirement
benefit costs by $64 million.

15. STOCK OPTIONS ........................................................

In our Long Term Incentive Program, we grant stock options, stock
appreciation rights (SARs), either in tandem with stock options or
free-standing, and other awards. On January 1 of each year, 0.6% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock become available for grant. The
exercise price of any stock option is equal to or greater than the stock
price when the option is granted. When granted in tandem, exercise of an
option or SAR cancels the other to the extent of such exercise. Option

GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS

Transfers between geographic areas are on terms and conditions comparable
with sales to external customers. The methods followed in developing the
geographic area data require the use of estimation techniques and do not take
into account the extent to which product development, manufacturing and
marketing depend upon each other. Thus the information may not be indicative
of results if the geographic areas were independent organizations.

Data on other geographic areas pertain to operations that are located
outside of the U.S. Our revenues from all international activities, including
those in the table, international telecommunications services and exports,
provided 25.2% of consolidated revenues in 1993.
Business restructuring and other charges were taken primarily in the
information movement and management segment and the U.S. geographic area. 
Corporate assets are principally cash and temporary cash investments.

17. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ................................................

We use various financial instruments in the normal course of our business. 
By their nature all such instruments involve risk, and our maximum potential
loss may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet. As is customary
for these types of instruments, we usually do not require collateral or other
security from other parties to these instruments. However, because we
control our exposure to credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits
and monitoring procedures, we believe that our reserves for losses are
adequate. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 26

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

We participate in the general-purpose credit card business through AT&T
Universal Card Services Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary. We purchase
essentially all cardholder receivables under an agreement with the Universal
Bank, a subsidiary of Synovus Financial Corporation, which issues the cards. 

LETTERS OF CREDIT

Letters of credit are purchased guarantees that ensure our performance or
payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions. 
GUARANTEES OF DEBT

From time to time, we guarantee the financing for product purchases by
customers outside the U.S., and the debt of certain unconsolidated joint
ventures. 

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

We enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes
in interest rates. The agreements generally involve the exchange of fixed or
floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal
amounts.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts, including forward, option
and swap contracts, to manage our exposure to changes in currency exchange
rates.

18. CONTINGENCIES ........................................................

In the normal course of business we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits and
other claims, including proceedings under government laws and regulations
related to environmental and other matters. Such matters are subject to many
uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. 
Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of
monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters at
December 31, 1993. While these matters could affect the operating results of
any one quarter when resolved in future periods, we believe that after final
disposition, any monetary liability or financial impact to us beyond that
provided for at year-end would not be material to our annual consolidated
financial statements. 

19. AT&T CREDIT HOLDINGS, INC. ...........................................

In connection with the March 31, 1993 legal restructuring of AT&T Capital
Holdings, Inc. (formerly AT&T Capital Corporation), we issued a direct, full
and unconditional guarantee of all the outstanding public debt of AT&T Credit
Holdings, Inc. (formerly AT&T Credit Corporation). 
AT&T Credit Holdings, Inc. holds the majority of AT&T's investment in AT&T
Capital Corporation and the lease finance assets of the former AT&T Credit
Corporation. The table below shows summarized consolidated financial
information for AT&T Credit Holdings, Inc., which consolidates the accounts
of AT&T Capital Corporation. Financial information for prior periods was
restated for the legal restructuring. The summarized financial information
includes transactions with AT&T that are eliminated in consolidation.

The number of weighted average shares outstanding increases as we issue new
common shares for employee plans, shareowner plans and other purposes. For
this reason, the sum of quarterly earnings per common share may not be the
same as earnings per common share for the year, and the per share effects of
unusual items in a quarter may differ from the per share effects of those
same items for the year.
<PAGE>

In the second quarter of 1993, we recorded $278 million in provisions for
business restructuring activities. The effect of these provisions was offset
by the $217 million gain from selling UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. and
other miscellaneous credits. In the fourth quarter of 1993, we recorded a
$190 million provision for business restructuring at AT&T Global Information
Solutions, which reduced net income by $119 million ($0.09 per share).
As a result of adopting SFAS No. 112, data for the first three quarters of
1993 were restated. The following table shows the net effects of this
accounting change, which represent the differences between the amounts shown

AT&T AND SUBSIDIARIES AND McCAW AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Note 1 - Historical Presentation 

Certain amounts reported in McCaw's historical financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the AT&T presentations in the
accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet and Statement of
Income. Such reclassifications are not material to the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements. 

Note 2 - Exchange Ratio

As set forth in the Merger Agreement, the exchange ratio in the Merger
(the "Exchange Ratio") will be one share of AT&T common stock (an "AT&T
Common Share") for each share of McCaw's Class A Common Stock and Class B
Common Stock (together, the "McCaw Common Stock"); provided, however, that
(i) in the event the Closing Date Market Price (as defined below) of one
AT&T Common Share is less than $53.00, the Exchange Ratio will be equal to
$53.00 divided by the Closing Date Market Price of one AT&T Common Share,
but in no event greater than 1.111 AT&T Common Shares, and (ii) in the
event the Closing Date Market Price of one AT&T Common Share is greater
than $71.73, the Exchange Ratio will be equal to $71.73 divided by the
Closing Date Market Price of one AT&T Common Share, but in no event less
than .909 of an AT&T Common Share. For purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements, an Exchange Ratio of one AT&T Common Share
per share of McCaw Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) is
assumed. If the maximum exchange ratio of 1.111 were assumed, pro forma
combined (loss) per share for the year ended December 31, 1993 would be
$(3.77). The Closing Date Market Price is the average of the last reported
sale price on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. for the 20 most recent
trading days ending on the fifth day prior to the date of closing of the
Merger.

Note 3 - Other Pro Forma Adjustments

(A) The McCaw Common Stock account has been adjusted to reflect the
assumed exchange of one AT&T Common Share, par value $1.00 per share, for
each of approximately 194.1 million shares of McCaw Common Stock, par value
$.01 per share, outstanding at December 31, 1993 (excluding shares of McCaw
Common Stock held by AT&T - see Note 3(B)). The difference between the par
value of the AT&T Common Shares and the par value of the McCaw Common
Stock, after giving effect to the assumed Exchange Ratio, is reflected as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital of $192.

(B) The $400 investment by AT&T in 14.5 million shares of Class A
Common Stock purchased in February 1993 has been eliminated. The weighted
average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 1993 have
been adjusted to eliminate the impact of this purchase.

(C) McCaw's historical financial statements reflect the adoption of
SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," retroactive to January 1,
1991. AT&T adopted SFAS No. 109 effective January 1, 1993. For conformity
purposes, the pro forma combined information for AT&T and McCaw has been
adjusted as if McCaw had adopted SFAS No. 109 on January 1, 1993. Such
adoption would result in the use of different tax assumptions related to
intangible assets McCaw acquired in purchase business combinations in 1991
and 1992 that would increase the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109<PAGE>
<PAGE> 36

by $39. Accordingly, the pro forma combined net income and earnings per
common share have been decreased $1,840 and $1.19 for the year ended
December 31, 1993, respectively. Pro forma combined total assets and
shareowners' equity have been decreased $39 at December 31, 1993. Also,
effective January 1, 1993, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." When McCaw adopts SFAS No. 112,
the impact on McCaw financial statements is expected to be immaterial.

(D) No adjustments have been reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements for direct expenses related to the Merger. 
Direct expenses included in the historical periods presented have not been
adjusted for in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements. 
Such amounts are not material. 

(E) No adjustments to eliminate intercompany transactions and balances
have been made in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements as
such amounts are not material. 

(F) The cash dividends per common share in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements reflect AT&T's cash dividends declared in the
period presented. McCaw has never paid cash dividends on the McCaw Common
Stock.

Note 4 - Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements assume that the
Merger qualifies as a "tax-free" reorganization for federal income tax
purposes.
