News Release

For Release:

BANKERS TRUST NEW YORK CORPORATION INCREASES DIVIDEND BY 11.1%
COMMENTS ON EARNINGS OUTLOOK

New York, December 20, 1994 -- Bankers Trust New
York Corporation has increased the regular quarterly dividend
on its common stock to $1.00 per share, from $0.90, an
increase of 11.1%. Bankers Trust has now increased its common
stock dividend for 16 consecutive years.

The dividend increase reflects management's view
that long-term prospects for Bankers Trust's global and
diverse mix of businesses remain strong, although results for
1994 will be below those of 1993. Earnings for the first nine
months of 1994 were 35% lower than those for the prior year's
nine months. Earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to
be below the $169 million earned in this year's third quarter,
due to lower trading revenue attributable to persistently
difficult market conditions and a resulting decline in client
activity.

The common stock dividend for the fourth quarter is
payable January 25, 1995, to shareholders of record January 6,
1995.
