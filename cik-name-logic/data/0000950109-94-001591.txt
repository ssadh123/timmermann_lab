ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

On July 21, 1994, A.L. Laboratories, Inc. (the "Company") issued two press
releases announcing that it had acquired Wade Jones Company, Inc., a Texas
corporation ("Wade Jones"), a distributor of poultry animal health products that
is also actively involved in the development, manufacture and sale of its own
line of products including animal health pharmaceuticals and feed additives.
The Company consummated the acquisition of Wade Jones by acquiring all of the
outstanding capital stock of Mikjan Corporation, an Arkansas corporation
("Mikjan"), which is the parent of Wade Jones. The Mikjan capital stock was
acquired from Mick Wagner, Jan Powell and certain charitable trusts established
by Mr. Wagner and Mr. Powell. Prior to the acquisition, Wade Jones acted as a
distributor of the Company's poultry animal health products. The Company
intends to continue to operate Wade Jones as a stand-alone business maintaining
its historic operations while expanding the scope of such operations.

The Company paid aggregate consideration of $8,219,440 as the initial
purchase price for the Mikjan capital stock, subject to a potential purchase
price adjustment for which certain amounts were retained by the Company. The
Company will pay additional consideration specified in the Stock Purchase
Agreement (defined below) in the event that regulatory approval is obtained
permitting the marketing of certain development stage products and in the event
that such products are successfully marketed by Wade Jones. The Company
obtained funds for the acquisition from a lender through a line of credit. The
identity of such lender has been filed separately with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). 

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. 

As announced in its press release dated May 17, 1994, the Company entered
into an agreement (the "Restructuring Agreement") with Apothekernes Laboratorium
A.S, the beneficial owner of 100% of the Company's Class B Common Stock ("A. L.
Oslo"), on May 16, 1994 to combine the pharmaceutical, animal health, bulk
antibiotic and aquatic animal health businesses of A. L. Oslo (the "Related
Norwegian Businesses") with the Company. The Restructuring Agreement was
unanimously approved by the Board of Directors, following a recommendation by a
Special Committee of the Board consisting of the Directors elected by the
holders of the Company's Class A Common Stock (the "Class A Shares"). The
transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Agreement (the "Transactions")
will require approval of the shareholders of both corporations, including a
majority of the outstanding Class A Shares, voting as a separate class. A proxy
statement relating to approval of, among other things, the Restructuring
Agreement and the Transactions is being contemporaneously filed with this Form
8-K/A and is being mailed to stockholders on August 22, 1994 (the "Proxy
Statement"). The Proxy Statement includes detailed information regarding the
Transactions and the Related Norwegian Businesses. In addition to shareholder
approval, the Transactions are subject to a number of other conditions including
the approval of Norwegian governmental authorities and acceptance of the
Exchange Offer (as defined below) by holders of at least 90% of the shares of
capital stock of A. L. Oslo. 

The consideration to be paid by the Company for the Related Norwegian
Businesses consists of 170 million Norwegian kroner ("NOK") and warrants to
purchase 3.6 million Class A Shares (the "Warrants"). The Warrants will have an
exercise price equal to 140% of the average trading price over a specified
period prior to closing. The cash portion of the purchase price has been
adjusted from NOK 170 million to NOK 160 million as a result of a NOK 10 million
dividend which was paid to A. L. Oslo shareholders in June 1994. Using the
exchange rate at June 30, 1994, NOK 160 million equals approximately $23.1
million. 

Prior to the closing of the Transactions, A. L. Oslo will transfer the
assets and liabilities of the Related Norwegian Businesses into a new company
("New A. L. Oslo") in a transaction called a demerger. A demerger in Norway is
similar to a spin-off in the United States. Each holder of an A. L. Oslo share
will be entitled to receive one share of capital stock of New A. L. Oslo for
each A. L. Oslo share it holds. The Company will acquire the Related Norwegian
Businesses through an offer (the "Exchange Offer") to acquire all shares of New
A. L. Oslo which the A. L. Oslo shareholders are entitled to receive in the
demerger. 

The Company is required to account for the acquisition of all of the
outstanding shares of New A. L. Oslo (the "RNB Acquisition") as a transfer and
exchange between companies under common control. Accordingly, the assets and
liabilities of New A. L. Oslo will be combined with the Company at historical
cost in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests; and the Company's historical
financial statements will be restated to reflect the combined results of
operations, assets, liabilities and net worth of the Company and of the Related
Norwegian Businesses. The payment of the cash purchase price will be reflected
as a reduction of combined equity when the transactions are consummated.

<PAGE>

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Mikjan Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mikjan
Corporation and subsidiary (the "Company") as of October 2, 1993 and October 3,
1992, the related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings
(accumulated deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Mikjan Corporation and subsidiary as of October 2, 1993 and October 3, 1992 and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

MIKJAN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements include
the consolidated accounts of Mikjan Corporation and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Wade Jones Company, Inc. (the "Company"). All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

NATURE OF BUSINESS - The Company is a manufacturer and distributor of
various feed additives, poultry medication and antibiotics for animals. The
Company extends credit to customers throughout the United States who serve
the poultry industry.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK - Assets which potentially subject the Company
to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable
and cash in financial institutions in excess of the federal deposit
insurance limits of $340,000 at October 2, 1993 and $377,000 at October 3,
1992. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers.

FISCAL YEAR - The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to
September 30.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates market
value. At October 2, 1993 and October 3, 1992, cash equivalents included
repurchase agreements of $440,000 and $477,000, respectively.

INVENTORY - Inventory is stated at the lower of cost, using the weighted
average cost method, or market.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold
improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the
estimated useful lives of the improvements. Annual depreciation is
primarily computed using the straight-line method. As assets are disposed
of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, Continued

INCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes, reflecting timing differences in
recognizing income and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes,
relate principally to depreciation, deferred compensation and accrued
liabilities.

AMORTIZATION - A covenant not to compete was being amortized over five years
and became fully amortized in 1993. A licensing agreement and the excess of
purchase price over the net assets at the acquisition date of Wade Jones
Company of Texas, Inc., is being amortized over a period of forty years.
Amortization is computed using the straight-line method.

2. INVENTORIES

Inventories consist of the following:

1. Basis of Presentation
---------------------

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements (pro forma
financials) are presented for illustrative purposes only, giving effect to the
acquisition, as described and therefore are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results and financial position that might have been achieved had the
combination occurred as of an earlier date, nor are they necessarily indicative
of operating results and financial position which may occur in the future.

On July 21, 1994, the Company acquired the stock of the Mikjan Corporation
(hereinafter referred to as "Wade Jones Company" or "Wade Jones".) The Wade
Jones Company is a major distributor of Poultry Animal Health products with
headquarters in Lowell, Arkansas and five other facilities. In addition, Wade
Jones manufactures and blends certain Animal Health products. The purchase
agreement required a purchase price of approximately $8,200 and provides for
contingent payments based on certain product approvals.

The acquisition will be accounted for in accordance with the purchase method.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
reflect the acquisition as if it occurred as of the beginning of the periods
presented for the income statements and as of June 30, 1994 for the balance
sheet presented. The Wade Jones Company presently has a fiscal year which ends
on the Saturday closest to September 30. Accordingly, the pro forma financials
consolidate the results of operations for the fiscal year ended October 2, 1993
with the Company's year ended December 31, 1993 and the results of operations
for the period October 3, 1993 to March 31, 1994 with the Company's six month
results of operations as of June 30, 1994.

For the pro forma balance sheet the unaudited Wade Jones balance sheet dated
June 30, 1994 has been consolidated with the balance sheet of the Company dated
June 30, 1994.

The actual results of Wade Jones will be consolidated with the Company from
the date of acquisition.

The pro forma balance sheet includes a preliminary allocation of the purchase
price which will be adjusted during the allocation period based on a detail
review of the assets and liabilities acquired.

Transactions between the Company and Wade Jones Company
- - -------------------------------------------------------

The Company and Wade Jones Company have engaged in a number of transactions
during prior years including Wade Jones distributing the Company's primary
Animal Health products to the poultry industry and blending certain of the

market interest rates.

In preparing the pro forma financials these transactions are designated
intercompany and eliminated.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements ("pro forma
financials") are presented for illustrative purposes only, giving effect to the
planned RNB Acquisition and therefore are not necessarily indicative of the
financial position that might have been achieved had the combination occurred as
of an earlier date, nor are they necessarily indicative of the financial
position which may occur in the future. In accordance with the rules of the
Commission, the Company has been required to present pro forma combined income
statements of the Company combined with the Mikjan Corporation (the Company
combined with the Mikjan Corporation is referred to as the "Company Proforma")
and the Related Norwegian Businesses as if a pooling of interests was
consummated at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The pro forma
results of operations presented are therefore not indicative of the results of
--- 
the combined companies that might have been achieved had the combination
occurred as of an earlier date nor are they indicative of results which may
occur in the future since to effect the RNB Acquisition the cash consideration
paid would have resulted in interest expense in each of the periods presented.

The pro forma financials give effect to the RNB Acquisition as a transfer 
and exchange between companies under common control. Accordingly, the assets 
and liabilities of the Related Norwegian Businesses will be combined with the
Company Proforma at their historical costs in a manner similar to a pooling-of-
interests. Upon restatement of the combined consolidated balance sheet the
initial period presented will reflect the addition of the net equity of the
Related Norwegian Businesses as of that date as an increase in consolidated
equity and the subsequent payment of consideration by the Company for the
Related Norwegian Businesses as a reduction in consolidated equity.

The pro forma financials assume that the New A. L. Oslo shareholders will
tender 100% of the New A. L. Oslo shares in the Exchange Offer. If, however,
less than 100% but more than 90% of the New A. L. Oslo shares were tendered in
the Exchange Offer, the Company does not believe that the cost of acquiring the
remaining outstanding New A. L. Oslo shares would significantly affect the pro
forma financials.

Because the Transactions have not been completed and transition plans are 
not finalized, and the benefits and costs of integrating certain operations
cannot be estimated with reasonable assurance, the pro forma combined income
statements for the periods exclude the financial impact of benefits expected to
be achieved upon combining the resources of the companies and any special
charges or other costs to achieve these benefits. As a result of the RNB
Acquisition, there may be a restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of
1994. Such a charge and its magnitude have yet to be determined. The Company
expects to operate as a pharmaceutical and animal health company and will be
managed on a global basis through decentralized strategic business units (or
divisions) ("SBU's"). It is anticipated that by the end of August 1994 key
executives will be named by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company to head
the SBU's. Each SBU head will begin a study of their business to determine what
actions may be taken to realize potential synergies of the RNB Acquisition and
to maximize both the SBU and the Company's global competitive position. Such
actions may include rationalization of the combined businesses. At the
conclusion of these studies, the head of each SBU working with the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company will make appropriate recommendations to the
Company's Board of Directors. It is anticipated that the Company's Board of
Directors will decide on recommended actions by December 31, 1994. Given the
timing of this plan, the financial impact of the actions that may be taken as a
result of such studies and the related action of the Company's Board of
Directors are not estimable at this time. The pro forma income statements for
the periods also exclude investment banking, legal, accounting and other
transaction expenses, including the expensing of debt issuance costs related to
existing debt expected to be refinanced, and tax effects relating to the
combination to be incurred and recorded by the Company subsequent to the signing
of the Restructuring Agreement in May 1994, estimated to be

F-28
<PAGE>

up to $3,600 after tax. Tax effects of the combination will include the non-
deductibility for tax purposes of a majority of the expenses previously incurred
or to be incurred to complete the RNB Acquisition.

The pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 1994 includes,
in accordance with the reporting rules of the Commission, the impact of all
transactions, whether of a recurring or non-recurring nature, that can be
reasonably reflected and should be reflected as of that date. Therefore,
current liabilities and long-term debt have been increased by $600 and $2,000,
respectively, and other assets and deferred charges have been reduced by $1,000.
Such adjustments represent an estimate of the investment banking, legal,
accounting and other transaction expenses, including the expensing of debt
issuance costs related to existing debt expected to be refinanced, and tax
effects relating to the combination expected to be incurred and recorded by the
Company subsequent to the signing of the Restructuring Agreement in May 1994 and
as a result of the planned refinancing of the existing debt.

2. Transactions between the Company and the Related Norwegian Businesses

The Company and the Related Norwegian Businesses have engaged in and will
continue to engage in a number of transactions including inventory purchased
from the Related Norwegian Businesses, license fees for technology paid to the
Related Norwegian Businesses and sales from the Company to the Related Norwegian
Businesses.

As a result, current amounts are generally payable from the Company to the
Related Norwegian Businesses for inventory and license fees. When the companies
are combined, the profit related to inventory purchased from either party will
be deferred or recognized depending on the amount on hand and the change in the
amounts from the preceding period.

Upon consummation of the combination these transactions will be intercompany
in nature and will be eliminated in preparing the consolidated accounts.
Accordingly, in the preparation of the pro forma financials these transactions
are designated as "intercompany" and are eliminated.

3. Translation of Related Norwegian Businesses Financial Information

The Related Norwegian Businesses financial information is maintained and
translated where applicable into Norwegian kroner. For purposes of the pro
forma financials, (a) the balance sheet at June 30, 1994 in Norwegian kroner has
been translated into United States dollars at the quarter end rate of NOK 6.9219
to $1.00; and (b) the income statements for the year ended December 31, 1993 and
for the six-month period ended June 30, 1994 have been translated by first
converting the income statements for each quarter in the period presented using
the average exchange rate for such quarter and then aggregating the converted
income statements for all of the quarters in such period. The average exchange
rates for each of the quarters in the year ended December 31, 1993 and the six
months ended June 30, 1994 were as follows:

<TABLE>

4. Earnings Per Common Share -- Pro Forma

The pro forma earnings per common share computations are based on historical
average common shares outstanding and income from continuing operations as
presented on a pro forma basis.

To reflect the effect of the consideration to be paid, the Company has
presented a supplemental computation of earnings per common share with earnings
being decreased by imputed interest expense net of taxes based on the proposed
cash consideration of $23,115 at a 7% interest rate and has reflected the
3,600,000 Warrants to be issued as part of the Transactions as outstanding
(assuming an exercise price of $20) for all periods presented. It should be
noted that the impact of the Warrants was either antidilutive or not material
for all periods presented.

Supplemental fully diluted earnings per share for the periods presented is
as follows:

5. Pro Forma Adjustments -- Balance Sheet at June 30, 1994

The unaudited pro forma balance sheet gives effect to the RNB Acquisition as
if it had been consummated on June 30, 1994. The adjustments are as follows:

(a) To eliminate intercompany receivable and payable of $2,201.

(b) To eliminate profit in inventory on intercompany sales of $1,075, profit
on intercompany sale of equipment of $250, and the tax effect related
thereto of $377.

(c) To reflect additional long-term debt expected to be incurred by the
Company as part of a refinancing in order to pay the Cash Purchase Price
pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement, NOK 160,000 ($23,115 at June
30, 1994 exchange rates), and estimated transaction expenses, including
the expensing of debt issuance costs related to existing debt expected
to be refinanced, of $3,600 after tax. The Company expects to obtain
long-term financing to complete the Transactions by the Closing Date. 
For purposes of the pro forma financials, $2,000 of the $3,600
transaction expenses are assumed to be financed at Closing. The $3,600
of transaction expenses are reflected as a decrease in other assets and
deferred charges of $1,000, an increase in accounts payable, accrued
expenses and income taxes of $600, and an increase in long-term debt of
$2,000.

<PAGE>

(d) To reflect the reduction of stockholders' equity relating to the
consideration paid of $29,667 by the Company to the holders of New A. L.
Oslo shares to acquire the Related Norwegian Businesses. The reduction of
stockholders' equity is offset by the recording of the Warrants as an
increase to stockholders' equity. The net effect is a reduction of
stockholders' equity of $23,115 (as detailed below).

============= ========
</TABLE>

The actual amount by which the total consideration and cash to be paid
will exceed the net book value of the Related Norwegian Businesses at the date
the RNB Acquisition is consummated will be determined by the exchange rate in
effect on such date and the actual net book value of the Related Norwegian
Businesses on such date.

For purposes of the pro forma financials, the Warrants have been valued
at $1.82 each. The $1.82 value is the average of the range ($1.36 to $2.27)
determined by the Special Committee's financial advisor, Lehman Brothers, based
on the 26-week observed volatility of the Class A Shares assuming up to a 40%
discount. Based on different hypothetical assumptions, Lehman Brothers observed
additional Black-Scholes Model ranges for valuation of the Warrants of between
$.90 and $3.41. The Company chose the average of $1.82 because it was based on
actual Class A Share volatility and on generally recognized variations between
Black-Scholes theoretical values and actual trading values. A wide range of
different valuations is possible depending on the chosen assumptions.

A. L. Oslo's financial advisor, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., had estimated
the value of the Warrants to be in a range of $2.93 to $3.30 using the 
Black-Scholes Model, assuming a $14.00 market price of the Class A Shares and a
4.5 year exercise period for the Warrants. The difference in the Warrant
valuation is primarily due to varying assumptions relating to the expected
future volatility of the market price of Class A Shares and discounts
attributable to marketability.

Each $.25 change in the value of the Warrants will result in a $900
corresponding change in the consideration to be paid by the Company for the
Related Norwegian Businesses. However, the final value attributed to the
Warrants for accounting purposes will not result in any change in total
---
stockholders' equity since the difference in the value will be reflected as a
change in the amount of the stockholder's equity reduction related to the RNB
Acquisition offset by the change in the increase in equity relating to recording
the

F-31
<PAGE>

issuance of the Warrants. The actual value of the Warrants will be
determined by the actual performance of the Class A Shares as traded in
the public market over the period that the Warrants are outstanding.

6. Pro Forma Adjustments - Income Statements for the Year Ended December 31,
1993 and Six Months Ended June 30, 1994.

The unaudited pro forma income statements give effect to the RNB
Acquisition as if it were a pooling of interests. The adjustments are as
follows:
<TABLE>

administrative (2,673) (1,550)

(b) To record rollover of profit

profit realized on the sale of
certain equipment by the

equipment purchased from the
Related Norwegian Businesses $ (74) $ (76)

(e) Estimated tax effect related 
to the cost of goods sold
adjustment and the profit and
depreciation related to the
equipment sales. $ (191) $ 102
</TABLE>

As previously disclosed the unaudited pro forma income statements do not
include an adjustment for interest expense related to the cash consideration
to be paid by the Company to the shareholders of New A. L. Oslo. Assuming
cash consideration of $23,115 and an interest rate of 7%, interest expense
after tax would have decreased net income by approximately $1,000 in 1993 and
$500 for the six months ended June 30, 1994.
