PITTSTON SERVICES SEES IMPROVED SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

Stamford, Ct. - June 15, l994 - The Pittston Services Group
(NYSE-PZS) announced today that, based on preliminary results
through May, second quarter earnings will significantly exceed

analysts' reported expectations. Joseph C. Farrell, Chairman
and CEO of The Pittston Company, said he is very pleased with the
continued strong performance by each of the three business units
in the Services Group. Burlington Air Express experienced record
domestic shipment volumes early in the quarter as the result of
an improving air freight market and the Teamsters' strike which
affected the trucking industry. Brink's Home Security is con-
tinuing the rapid growth of its subscriber base and Brink's,
Incorporated is experiencing improved demand for many of its
security services, particularly in North American markets.
