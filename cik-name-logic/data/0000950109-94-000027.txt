ITEM 5. Other Items.

On January 1, 1994 (the "Effective Date"), Valley Bancorp., Inc., a 
Pennsylvania corporation and bank holding company ("Valley"), was merged with 
and into Dauphin Deposit Corporation ("Dauphin"), under the Articles of 
Incorporation of Dauphin and under the title of "Dauphin Deposit Corporation"
(the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, all properties and all assets of 
every kind held by Valley on the Effective Date became properties and assets of 
Dauphin, and Dauphin became liable for all the debts, liabilities and other 
obligations of Valley. The Merger was approved by the shareholders of Valley at
a special shareholders meeting held on October 21, 1993.

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 16, 1993 
(the "Plan of Merger"), by and between Valley and Dauphin, each issued and 
outstanding share of Valley Common Stock was converted into 2.1401 shares of 
Dauphin common stock, par value $5.00 per share ("Dauphin Common Stock"), and 
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Dauphin Common Stock.

The Plan of Merger provided that the conversion factor was to be 
adjusted based on the formula set forth in the Plan of Merger reflecting any 
changes in the Market Value Per Share of Dauphin (as defined in the Plan of 
Merger) as of the fifth trading day preceding the Effective Date of the Merger, 
provided, however, that in no event was the conversion factor under the formula 
to be less than 2.1401 shares of Dauphin Common Stock for each share of Valley 
common stock converted in the Merger. The Market Value Per Share of Dauphin was
defined as the average of the closing sale prices of Dauphin Common Stock as 
reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation 
System for the fifteen (15) consecutive trading days ending on and including the
date as of which the Market Value Per Share was to be calculated. As of 
December 27, 1993, the fifth trading day preceding the Effective Date, the 
Market Value Per Share of Dauphin was $26.03.

As of the Effective Date, there were 1,236,480 shares of Valley 
Common Stock issued and outstanding, including 21,000 shares owned by Dauphin. 
As a result of the Merger, outstanding Valley shares (other than those owned by 
Dauphin, which were canceled) were converted into approximately 2,600,643 shares
of Dauphin Common Stock, plus cash in the approximate aggregate amount of 
$15,767 in lieu of fractional share interests. On December 31, 1993, the last 
trading day before the Merger, the closing sale price of Dauphin Common Stock 
in the NASDAQ National Market System was $25.25. Thus, the total consideration 
paid by Dauphin to the holders of Valley Common Stock in dollar equivalent terms
was approximately $65.7 million as of the Effective Date. The equivalent per 
share price of Valley Common Stock calculated by multiplying 2.1401 (the 
conversion factor in the Merger) by the closing sale price for Dauphin Common 
Stock on December 31, 1993 was approximately $54.04.

Trust Company ("Valley Bank"), a subsidiary of Valley and a Pennsylvania
chartered bank, was merged (the "Bank Merger") with and into Dauphin Deposit

with Dauphin Bank being the surviving corporation. The Bank Merger was
consummated pursuant to an Agreement of Merger of Valley Bank and Dauphin Bank
dated June 16, 1993. Valley Bank's offices will be operated after the Effective
Date as the Valleybank Division of Dauphin Deposit Bank.
