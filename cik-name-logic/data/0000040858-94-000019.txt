ITEM OF INFORMATION

Item 5. Other Events

GTE today announced that its results for the fourth quarter of 
1993 will include a one-time pre-tax restructuring charge of 
$1.8 billion which will reduce fourth quarter and full year net 
income by $1.2 billion, or $1.22 per share.

This restructuring charge includes $1.4 billion at Telephone 
Operations primarily to implement its re-engineering plan. The 
re-engineering plan will redesign and streamline processes in 
order to improve customer-responsiveness and product quality, 
reduce the time necessary to introduce new products and 
services and further reduce costs. The re-engineering plan 
includes $680 million to upgrade or replace existing customer 
service and administrative systems and enhance network 
software, $410 million for employee separation benefits 
associated with workforce reductions and $210 million primarily 
for the consolidation of facilities and operations and other 
related costs.

The re-engineering plan will be implemented over the next three 
years, with expected reductions of approximately 17,000 
Telephone Operations employees during that time frame.

The restructuring charge also includes a $400 million reduction 
in the carrying value of satellite communication assets of GTE 
Spacenet and certain other assets to estimated net realizable 
value. This action primarily reflects the development of 
alternative transmission methods through technological advances 
and increased competition. GTE will also combine its Spacenet 
business into Government Systems to leverage the combined 
strength of these two businesses.
