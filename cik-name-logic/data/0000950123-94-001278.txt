SECOND QUARTER REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS
For the Quarter Ending June 30, 1994
For Release: July 28, 1994

HECLA REPORTS SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST-HALF RESULTS

COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -- Hecla Mining Company (HL & HL-B:NYSE)
reported net income today of $0.7 million for the second quarter of 1994 prior
to payment of preferred dividends. After a $2 million dividend to preferred
shareholders, the company recorded a net loss for the quarter of $1.3 million,
or 3 cents per common share. This compares with a loss of $2.8 million, or 7
cents per common share, for the same period in 1993.

For the first half of 1994, Hecla lost $9.0 million, or 22 cents a
share, on revenue of $67.7 million after a $4 million dividend to preferred
shareholders. This compares with a loss of $8.3 million, or 23 cents a share,
on revenue of $50.4 million for the first half of 1993. Preferred shares had
not yet been issued, so no preferred dividend was paid during the first half of
1993.

On June 14, 1994, Hecla redeemed all of its outstanding
zero-coupon subordinated Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs) due 2004 for $50.2
million. The LYONs redemption followed completion of Hecla's common stock
offering of 7.4 million shares which yielded net proceeds of approximately $64
million.

Also during the second quarter, a judgment was entered against
Hecla by an Idaho State District Court following a jury's verdict finding Hecla
liable for $10 million in compensatory damages and an additional $10 million in
punitive damages in a lawsuit filed by the Star Phoenix Mining Company. Star
Phoenix, a former lessee of the Star-Morning mine, sued Hecla over a dispute
relating to Hecla's 1990 termination of Star Phoenix's lease of the mine.
Hecla strongly believes that it had the legal right to terminate the lease and
that the evidence presented in the trial does not support the jury's verdict.
Hecla intends to vigorously appeal the trial court judgment.

In June, the La Choya gold mine in Mexico produced approximately
6,000 ounces of gold, achieving its rated production capacity. The cash cost
per ounce of gold in June was $189 and the full cost was $285, meeting
projected cost estimates. "The business climate in Mexico is very positive,
and a national television network there recently featured our mine as an
exemplary model of industry working in harmony with the environment," said
Arthur Brown, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We look
forward to a long and prosperous relationship with Mexico."

Construction of Hecla's new Grouse Creek gold mine in central
Idaho is approximately 70 percent complete, and the underground mine has been
in production since April. High-grade ore is being stockpiled for the mill,
which is scheduled to begin operation during the fourth quarter of 1994.

The company's Lucky Friday silver mine produced more than 484,000
ounces of silver during the second quarter, although costs were higher than the
comparable period in 1993. Anticipated maintenance on the underground ore
transfer stations contributed to the higher costs, but this work should be
completed during August.

Our industrial minerals operations achieved outstanding first-half
results, generating $4.6 million in gross profit on record sales of more than
$35 million.

Hecla is a 103-year-old mining company with operations principally
in the United States and Mexico. The company is a well-known silver producer
with a growing gold profile, and a major supplier of ball clay, kaolin and
feldspar. The common and preferred shares of Hecla are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbols HL and HL-B, respectively.

NEWS RELEASE

HECLA TO PROCEED WITH LUCKY FRIDAY EXPANSION
For Release: Tuesday, August 2, 1994

COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -- Hecla Mining Company (HL & HL-B: NYSE)
today announced that it will proceed with a phased development of the Gold
Hunter deposit at the company's Lucky Friday mine near Mullan, Idaho. The
silver-rich deposit is located to the north of the current Lucky Friday
workings, more than a mile underground. The new ore was discovered in 1991
when an underground exploration program intercepted the downward extension of
the old Gold Hunter mine.

In 1993, Hecla did a test mining project in the new ore zone and
completed a feasibility study to assess economic viability. The feasibility
study indicated that bringing the Gold Hunter into production could reduce
overall mining costs and more than double the silver output of the Lucky
Friday. Art Brown, chairman, president and CEO of Hecla said, "If expectations
are met, the Lucky Friday mine could add up to 3 million ounces of additional
silver production per year, returning the mine to historic production levels in
the range of 5 million ounces annually."

The Gold Hunter area, which is accessed from the company's
existing Lucky Friday facility, potentially contains 2-3 million tons of
mineralization grading 14 ounces per ton silver, 4.7 percent lead and 1.3
percent zinc. Brown said that additional drilling is required to better define
this mineralization and bring it into the minable resource category.

Phase I of the project, which will begin immediately, includes the
addition of 20 employees and a $4.7 million budget to drive 6,000 feet of
tunnel on the 4900 level of the Lucky Friday mine. The tunnel will access the
Gold Hunter deposit at depth and provide a platform for 22,000 feet of diamond
drilling to delineate the ore body. Phase I will be completed in the fourth
quarter of 1995. The Company will then make a decision whether to bring the
ore body into production. Brown said the new deposit could be efficiently
mined and processed using Hecla's existing facilities, providing a reduction in
overall costs of production at the Lucky Friday mine. If the Gold Hunter is
ultimately brought into production, Brown said the work force could expand to
approximately 200 employees by 1997. Total cost of the three-year project is
estimated to be in the $18 million range.

The Gold Hunter mine was first discovered in 1882 and was mined
between 1903 and 1947. The property is controlled by Hecla under a long-term
operating agreement with Independence Lead Mines Company, Wallace, Idaho, and
Abot Mining Company, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. With its combined interests, Hecla
is entitled to a 79.08 percent interest in the net profits from the property.
Hecla will be obligated to pay a royalty of 18.52 percent of defined net
profits to Independence Lead Mines Company and 2.4 percent to Abot Mining
Company after Hecla has recouped its costs to explore and develop the property.
