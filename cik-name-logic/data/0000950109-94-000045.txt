M.D.C. HOLDINGS, INC. COMPLETES PRIVATE OFFERING OF NOTES

DENVER, COLORADO - M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and PSE: MDC), one of the
nation's largest residential builders and mortgage lending companies, today
announced that it had completed a private placement of $190,000,000 principal
amount of 11.125% Senior Notes due 2003 and $28,000,000 principal amount of
8.750% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005. The Senior Notes were offered
at 98.525% of par. The Convertible Subordinated Notes were offered at par and
are convertible into common stock at an initial conversion price of $7.75 per
share, subject to adjustment upon certain events. The placement agent for the
offering was Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.

Net proceeds of the offering, after estimated expenses, are estimated to be
$203,888,000. Approximately $98,000,000 was used to retire 98% of the Company's
restructured notes payable originally issued to Executive Life Insurance Company
and certain of its affiliates with a carrying value on the Company books of
$129,614,000 at September 30, 1993.

In addition, $30,479,000 of the net proceeds was used to complete the
previously announced purchase agreement with the Base Assets Trust. Pursuant to
this agreement MDC purchased from the Trust (i) 1,990 shares (19.9%) of the
common stock of Richmond Homes, MDC's Colorado home builder affiliate increasing
MDC's interest in Richmond Homes common stock to 65%; (ii) 1,400 shares of
Richmond Homes Class A preferred stock; (iii) a general partnership interest in
the Rock Creek Investment Partnership, a partnership affiliated with Richmond
Homes; and (iv) 2,560,866 shares of MDC common stock. As previously announced,
MDC intends to complete the acquisition of Richmond Homes by acquiring from
Messrs. Larry A. Mizel and David D. Mandarich, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and Executive Vice President - Real Estate of MDC, respectively, the
balance (35%) of the outstanding Richmond Homes common stock owned by them for a
purchase price between $2,000,000 and $3,500,000. After the completion of this
purchase, MDC will own 100% of Richmond Homes.

$51,816,000 of the remaining net proceeds will be used to redeem all of the
Company's currently outstanding 11 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 1996, at
100% of their principal amount. The balance will be used to pay down
approximately $14,100,000 of existing debt and for general corporate purposes.
The above transactions will result in net extraordinary gains from early
extinguishment of debt totalling approximately $14,500,000, net of income taxes.

Spencer I. Browne, President and Chief Operating Officer of MDC, said,
"These transactions have enabled the Company to achieve greater operating and
financial flexibility by putting in place long-term debt with maturities ten
years or more into the future as well as simplifying the Company's corporate
structure."

in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.

SECTION 2.3 Registrar and Paying Agent.
-------------------------- 

The Company shall maintain an office or agency in New York, New York,
where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange
("Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities may be presented for
payment ("Paying Agent") and where notices and demands to or upon the Company or
any Guarantor in respect of the Notes and related Guaranties may be served. The
Company may act as its own Registrar or Paying Agent, except that, for the
purposes of Articles

32
<PAGE>

Three, Eight, and Sections 2.11, 4.14, 4.16 and 4.17, none of the Company, any
Guarantor nor any Affiliate of the Company or any Guarantor shall act as Paying
Agent. The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their
transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more co-Registrars and one
or more additional Paying Agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any
additional Paying Agent. The Company hereby initially appoints the Trustee as
Registrar and Paying Agent, and the Trustee hereby initially agrees so to act.

The Company shall enter into an appropriate written agency agreement
with any Agent not a party to this Indenture, which agreement shall implement
the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent. The Company shall
promptly notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any such
Agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the
Trustee shall act as such.

SECTION 2.4 Paying Agent to Hold Assets in Trust.
------------------------------------ 

The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to
agree in writing that each Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of
Holders or the Trustee all assets held by the Paying Agent for the payment of
principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Securities (whether such
assets have been distributed to it by the Company, a Guarantor or any other
obligor on the Securities), and shall notify the Trustee in writing of any
Default in making any such payment. If the Company, a Guarantor or a Subsidiary
of the Company or a Guarantor acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate such
assets and hold them as a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders or
the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to distribute
all assets held by it to the Trustee and account for any assets disbursed and
the Trustee may at any time during the continuance of any payment Default, upon
written request to a Paying Agent, require such Paying Agent to distribute all
assets held by it to the Trustee and to account for any assets distributed. 
Upon distribution to the Trustee of all assets that shall have been delivered by
the Company or any Guarantor to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent (if other
than the Company or a Guarantor) shall have no further liability for such
assets.

33
<PAGE>

SECTION 2.5 Securityholder Lists.
-------------------- 

The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably
practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of
Holders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the
Trustee on or before the tenth Business Day preceding each Interest Payment Date
and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing a list in such
form and as of such date as the Trustee reasonably may require of the names and
addresses of Holders.

SECTION 2.6 Transfer and Exchange.
--------------------- 

When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-Registrar with
a request to register the transfer of such Securities or to exchange such
Securities for an equal principal amount of Securities of other authorized
denominations, the Registrar or co-Registrar shall register the transfer or make
the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction
are met; provided, however, that the Securities surrendered for transfer or
-------- ------- 
exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar or
co-Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the
Company and the Guarantors shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate
Securities at the Registrar's or co-Registrar's request. No service charge
shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax, assessments, or
similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such
transfer taxes, assessments, or similar governmental charge payable upon
exchanges or transfers pursuant to Sections 2.2, 2.10, 3.7, 4.14, 4.16, 4.17, or
9.5). The Registrar or co-Registrar shall not be required to register the
transfer of or exchange of (a) any Security selected for redemption in whole or
in part pursuant to Article Three, except the unredeemed portion of any Security
being redeemed in part, or (b) any Security for a period beginning 15 Business
Days before the mailing of a notice of an offer to repurchase pursuant to
Sections 4.14, 4.16, or 4.17 hereof or redeem Securities pursuant to Article 3
hereof and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing.

34
<PAGE>

Any Original Notes which are presented to the Registrar or a
co-registrar for exchange pursuant to an Exchange Offer shall be exchanged for
Series B Notes of equal principal amount upon surrender to the Registrar or
co-registrar of the Original Notes to be exchanged; provided, however, that the
-------- -------
Original Notes surrendered for exchange in an Exchange Offer shall be duly
endorsed and accompanied by a letter of transmittal or written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Registrar or
co-Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney who shall be
duly authorized in writing to execute such document. Whenever any Original Notes
are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver to the Registrar or co-Registrar, the same
aggregate principal amount of Series B Notes as the aggregate principal amount
of Original Notes that have been surrendered.

Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, no Original Note may be
exchanged by the Holder thereof for a Series B Note other than pursuant to the
Exchange Offer and no Series B Note may be exchanged by the Holder thereof for
an Original Note.

SECTION 2.7 Replacement Securities.
---------------------- 

If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee or if the Holder
of a Security claims and submits an affidavit or other evidence, satisfactory to
the Trustee, to the Trustee to the effect that the Security has been lost,
destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company and the Guarantors shall issue and
the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the Trustee's
requirements are met. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder
must provide an indemnity bond or other indemnity, sufficient in the judgment of
both the Company and the Trustee, to protect the Company, the Guarantors, the
Trustee or any Agent from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is
replaced. The Company may charge such Holder for its reasonable, out-of-pocket
expenses in replacing a Security.

Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company
and, to the extent of the Guaranty, of each Guarantor.

35
<PAGE>

SECTION 2.8 Outstanding Securities.
---------------------- 

Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities that have
been authenticated by the Trustee except those cancelled by it, those delivered
to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.8 as not
outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company, a
Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or a Guarantor holds the Security,
except as provided in Section 2.9.

If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.7 (other than a
mutilated Security surrendered for replacement), it ceases to be outstanding
unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security
is held by a bona fide purchaser. A mutilated Security ceases to be outstanding
---- ---- 
upon surrender of such Security and replacement thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.

If on a Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity the Paying Agent (other
than the Company, a Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or a Guarantor)
holds U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay all of
the principal and interest due on the Securities payable on that date and
payment of the Securities called for redemption is not otherwise prohibited,
then on and after that date such Securities cease to be outstanding and interest
on them ceases to accrue.

SECTION 2.9 Treasury Securities.
------------------- 

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of
Securities have concurred in any direction, amendment, supplement, waiver or
consent, Securities owned by the Company, the Guarantors and Affiliates of the
Company or a Guarantor shall be disregarded, except that, for the purposes of
determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such
direction, amendment, supplement, waiver or consent, only Securities that the
Trustee knows or has reason to know are so owned shall be disregarded.

SECTION 2.10 Temporary Securities.
-------------------- 

Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may
prepare, the Guarantors shall endorse and the Trustee shall authenticate
temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially

36
<PAGE>

in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company
reasonably and in good faith considers appropriate for temporary Securities. 
Without unreasonable delay, at the time that the registration statement pursuant
to the Senior Notes Registration Rights Agreement becomes effective, the Company
shall prepare, the Guarantors shall endorse and the Trustee shall authenticate
definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities. Until so exchanged,
the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this Indenture as permanent Securities authenticated and delivered
hereunder.

SECTION 2.11 Cancellation.
------------ 

The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for
cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee
any Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange or payment. The
Trustee, or at the direction of the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent
(other than the Company, a Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or a
Guarantor), and no one else, shall cancel and, at the written direction of the
Company, shall dispose of all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange,
payment or cancellation. Subject to Section 2.7, the Company may not issue new
Securities to replace Securities it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange
for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section 2.11, except as
expressly permitted in the form of Securities and as permitted by this
Indenture.

SECTION 2.12 Defaulted Interest.
------------------ 

Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or
duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the person in
whose name that Security (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered
at the close of business on the Record Date for such interest.

Any interest on any Security which is payable, but is not punctually
paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date plus, to the extent
lawful, any interest payable on the defaulted interest (herein called "Defaulted
Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered holder on the
relevant Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted

37
<PAGE>

Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided
in clause (1) or (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted
Interest to the persons in whose names the Securities are registered
at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of
such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following
manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the
amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security
and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the
Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to
the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such
Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the
Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment,
such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the
Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as provided in this
clause (1). Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date
for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more
than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the
proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the
Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall
promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the
name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the
proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record
Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each
Holder at his address as it appears in the security register not
less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee
may, in its discretion, in the name and at the expense of the
Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least once in a
newspaper, customarily published in the English language on each
Business Day and of general circulation in New York, New York, but
such publication shall not be a condition precedent to the
establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed
payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date
therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest

38
<PAGE>

shall be paid to the persons in whose names the Securities (or their
respective predecessor Securities) are registered on such Special
Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following
clause (2).

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest
in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of
any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed, and
upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after
notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment
pursuant to this clause, such manner shall be deemed practicable by
the Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12, each
Security delivered pursuant to this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange
for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued
and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

SECTION 2.13 Legending of the Securities; Restrictions on Transfers.
------------------------------------------------------

Until such time as the same is no longer a Restricted Security, each
certificate evidencing the Securities (and all Securities issued in exchange
therefor or substitution thereof) shall bear a legend in substantially the form
set forth on the form of Note set forth as Exhibit A-1 hereto. Prior to any
transfer or exchange of a legended Security for another Security, the Company
shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee directing it to transfer
or exchange such Security for another legended or unlegended Security, subject
to compliance with any transfer restrictions.

1998, at the Redemption Prices specified in the form of Note attached as Exhibit
A-1 and Exhibit A-2 set forth therein under the caption "Redemption," in each
case, including accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.

SECTION 3.2 Notices to Trustee.
------------------ 

If the Company elects to redeem Securities pursuant to Paragraph 5 of
the Securities, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the Redemption Date
and the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed and whether it wants the
Trustee to give notice of redemption to the Holders.

If the Company elects to credit the principal amount of Securities to
be redeemed pursuant to Paragraph 5 of the Securities by crediting against any
such redemption Securities it has not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, it shall so notify the Trustee and deliver such Securities with
such notice.

The Company shall give each notice to the Trustee provided for in this
Section 3.2 at least 45 days before the Redemption Date (unless a shorter notice
shall be satisfactory to the Trustee).

SECTION 3.3 Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed.
-------------------------------------- 

If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed pursuant to
Paragraph 5 thereof, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed pro
---
rata or by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall determine to be fair
- ---- 
and appropriate and in such manner as complies with any applicable legal and
stock exchange requirements.

The Trustee shall make the selection from the Securities outstanding
and not previously called for redemption and shall promptly notify the Company
in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any
Security selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed. Securities in denominations of $1,000 may be redeemed only in whole.
The Trustee may select for redemption portions (equal to

40
<PAGE>

$1,000 or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal of Securities that
have denominations larger than $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply
to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called
for redemption.

SECTION 3.4 Notice of Redemption.
-------------------- 

At least 15 days and not more than 60 days before a Redemption Date,
the Company shall mail a notice of redemption by first class mail, postage
prepaid, to the Trustee and each Holder, at such Holder's last address as then
shown upon the books of the registrar, whose Securities are to be redeemed. At
the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the
Company's name and at the Company's expense. Each notice for redemption shall
identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date;

(2) the Redemption Price, including the amount of accrued and
unpaid interest to be paid upon such redemption;

(3) the name, address and telephone number of the Paying Agent;

(4) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to
the Paying Agent at the address specified in such notice to collect the
Redemption Price;

(5) that, unless the Company defaults in its obligation to deposit
U.S. Legal Tender with the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 3.6
hereof, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on
and after the Redemption Date and the only remaining right of the Holders
of such Securities is to receive payment of the Redemption Price, including
accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date, upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of the Securities called for redemption and to be redeemed;

(6) if any Security is being redeemed in part, the portion of the
principal amount, equal to $1,000 or any integral multi-

41
<PAGE>

ple thereof, of such Security equal to the unredeemed portion thereof and
that, on and after the Redemption Date, and upon surrender of such
Security, a new Security or Securities in aggregate principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued;

(7) if less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the
identification of the particular Securities (or portion thereof) to be
redeemed, as well as the aggregate principal amount of such Securities to
be redeemed and the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be
outstanding after such partial redemption;

(8) the CUSIP number of the Securities to be redeemed; and

(9) that the notice is being sent pursuant to this Section 3.4 and
pursuant to the redemption provisions of Paragraph 5 of the Securities.

SECTION 3.5 Effect of Notice of Redemption.
------------------------------ 

Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.4,
Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date
and at the Redemption Price, including accrued and unpaid interest to the
Redemption Date. Upon surrender to the Trustee or Paying Agent, such Securities
called for redemption shall be paid at the Redemption Price, including interest,
if any, accrued and unpaid on the Redemption Date; provided that if the
--------
Redemption Date is after a regular Record Date and on or prior to the Interest
Payment Date, the accrued interest shall be payable to the Holder of the
redeemed Securities registered on the relevant Record Date; and provided,
--------
further, that if a Redemption Date is a Legal Holiday, payment shall be made on
- -------
the next succeeding Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the period
from such Redemption Date to such succeeding Business Day.

42
<PAGE>

SECTION 3.6 Deposit of Redemption Price.
--------------------------- 

On or prior to the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the
Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company
or a Guarantor) U.S. Legal Tender sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of,
including accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date on, all Securities
to be redeemed on such Redemption Date (other than Securities or portions
thereof called for redemption on that date that have been delivered by the
Company to the Trustee for cancellation). The Paying Agent shall promptly
return to the Company any U.S. Legal Tender so deposited which is not required
for that purpose upon the written request of the Company.

If the Company complies with the preceding paragraph and the other
provisions of this Article Three, interest on the Securities to be redeemed will
cease to accrue on the applicable Redemption Date, whether or not such
Securities are presented for payment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any Security surrendered for redemption in the manner provided in
the Securities shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption because of the
failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall
continue to accrue and be paid from the Redemption Date until such payment is
made on the unpaid principal, and, to the extent lawful, on any interest not
paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate and in the manner
provided in Section 4.1 hereof and the Securities.

SECTION 3.7 Securities Redeemed in Part.
--------------------------- 

Upon surrender of a Security that is to be redeemed in part, the
Company and each Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver to the Holder, without service charge, a new Security or Securities
equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.

SECTION 4.1 Payment of Securities.
--------------------- 

The Company shall pay the principal of and interest on the Securities
on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities. An installment of
principal of or interest on the Securities shall be considered paid on the date

Subsidiary of the Company or a Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or a
Guarantor) holds for the benefit of the Holders on that date, U.S. Legal Tender
deposited and designated for and sufficient to pay the installment or as
otherwise in compliance with Section 4.3 of the Purchase Agreement.

The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and on overdue
installments of interest at the rate specified in the Securities compounded

SECTION 4.2 Maintenance of Office or Agency.
------------------------------- 

The Company shall maintain in New York, New York, an office or agency
where Securities may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities
may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices
and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this
Indenture may be served. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or
agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required
office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof,
such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
address of the Trustee set forth in Section 14.2.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other
offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for any
or all

44
<PAGE>

such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided,
-------- 
however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the
- ------- 
Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in New York, New York,
for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee
of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any
such other office or agency. The Company hereby initially designates the office
of the agent of the Trustee at the address set forth in Article Fourteen as such
office of the Company.

SECTION 4.3 Limitation on Restricted Payments.

Neither the Company nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will,
directly or indirectly, make any Restricted Payment, if, after giving effect
thereto on a pro forma basis, (a) the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
--- ----- 
of the Company on the last day of the Reference Period is less than 1.5 to 1,
(b) a Default or an Event of Default would occur or be continuing, or (c) the

Restricted Subsidiaries simultaneously receive a dividend or distribution with
respect to their Investment in such Restricted Subsidiary either in U.S. Legal

things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate
existence and the corporate or other existence of each of its Subsidiaries in
accordance with the respective organizational documents of each of them and the
rights (charter and statutory) and corporate franchises of such Obligor and each
of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that an Obligor shall not be required to
-------- ------- 
preserve, with respect to itself, any right or franchise, and with respect to
any of its Subsidiaries, any such existence, right or franchise, if the Board of
Directors of such Obligor shall in good faith determine that the preservation
thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of such Obligor.

contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which disputed
amounts adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP or (ii)
that solely encumbers property abandoned or in the process of being abandoned
and with

47
<PAGE>

respect to which there is no recourse to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary.

SECTION 4.6 Maintenance of Properties and Insurance.
--------------------------------------- 

Each Obligor shall cause all properties used or useful to the conduct
of its business and the business of each of its Subsidiaries that are Restricted
Subsidiaries to be maintained and kept in good condition consistent with

judgment may be necessary, so that the business carried on in connection
therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided,
--------
however, that nothing in this Section 4.6 shall prevent an Obligor from
- ------- 
discontinuing any operation or maintenance of any of such properties, or
disposing of any of them, if such discontinuance or disposal is (a), in the
judgment of such Obligor, desirable in the conduct of the business of such
Obligor and (b) not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest on and after the Change of
Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have a Note, or portion thereof,
purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to
surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect
Purchase" on the reverse of the Security completed, to the Paying Agent
(which may not for purposes of this Section 4.16, notwithstanding anything
in this Indenture to the contrary, be the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company) at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of
business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election, in

Purchase Price (together with accrued and unpaid interest), and the Trustee will
promptly authenticate and mail or deliver to such Holders a new Note equal in
principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered. Any Notes
not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the

"Change of Control" means (i) any sale, transfer or other conveyance
(other than to the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company), whether
direct or indirect, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, on
a consolidated basis, to any "person" or "group" in one transaction or a series
of related transactions, provided that a transaction where the holders of all
-------- 
classes of Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction
own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the aggregate voting power of all
classes of Voting Stock of such "person" or "group" immediately after such
transaction will not be a Change of Control, or (ii) any "person" or "group,"
other than the Management Group (as defined below) is or becomes the "beneficial
owner," directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of
the Voting Stock then outstanding. The "Management Group" shall consist of at
least a majority of the executive officers of the Company as of the date of this
Indenture as disclosed in the Placement Memorandum, members of their immediate
families, certain trusts for their benefit, and legal representatives of, or
heirs, beneficiaries or legatees receiving Common Stock (or securities
convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock) under any such Person's estate.

For the purposes of this definition, (i) the terms "person" and "group"
shall have the meanings used for purposes of Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the
Exchange Act, whether or not applicable; provided that no Excluded Person and no
-------- 
person or group controlled by Excluded Persons shall be deemed to be a "person"
or "group" and (ii) the term "beneficial owner" shall have the meaning used in
Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, whether or not applicable, except
that a person shall be deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of all shares that
any such person has the right to acquire, whether such

64

right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time or upon the
occurrence of certain events.

SECTION 4.17 Maintenance of Consolidated Net Worth.
------------------------------------- 

If the Company's Consolidated Net Worth at the end of each of any two
consecutive fiscal quarters (the last day of the second such fiscal quarter
being referred to as a "Deficiency Date") is less than $100,000,000 (the
"Minimum Consolidated Net Worth"), then the Company shall, no later than 60 days
after a Deficiency Date (or 120 days if a Deficiency Date is also the end of the
Company's fiscal year), offer to purchase (a "Net Worth Offer") Notes in a
principal amount equal to 10% of the principal amount of Original Notes
originally issued under this Indenture (or such lesser amount as may be
outstanding at the time the Net Worth Offer is made) (the "Net Worth Offer
Amount") at a purchase price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of
such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date (the "Net
Worth Purchase Price"). The Net Worth Offer shall remain open for a period of
20 Business Days following its commencement and no longer, unless a longer
period is required by law (the "Net Worth Offer Period"). Three business days
after the termination of the Net Worth Offer Period (the "Net Worth Payment
Date"), the Company shall purchase and the Paying Agent shall mail or deliver
payment for the Net Worth Offer Amount of Notes tendered, pro rated over such
tendered Notes to the nearest $1,000 principal amount, or, if less than the Net
Worth Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered in response to the Net
Worth Offer. In no event shall the Company's failure to meet the Minimum
Consolidated Net Worth at the end of any fiscal quarter be counted towards the
making of more than one Net Worth Offer. The principal amount of Notes to be
purchased pursuant to a Net Worth Offer may be reduced by the principal amount
of Notes acquired by the Company subsequent to the Deficiency Date and
surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation through purchase or redemption
(other than pursuant to a Change of Control Offer).

Notice of a Net Worth Offer shall be mailed by the Company to all
Holders at their last registered address upon the commencement of the Net Worth
Offer. The Net Worth Offer shall remain open from the time of mailing until
three Business Days before the Net Worth Payment Date. The notice shall contain
all instructions

65
<PAGE>

and material necessary to enable such Holders to tender Notes pursuant to a Net
Worth Offer. The notice, which (to the extent consistent with this Indenture)
shall govern the terms of a Net Worth Offer, shall state:

(1) that the Net Worth Offer is being made pursuant to this
Section 4.17;

(2) the Net Worth Offer Amount, the Net Worth Purchase Price
(including the amount of accrued and unpaid interest) and the Net Worth
Payment Date;

(3) that any Note not tendered or accepted for payment will
continue to accrue interest;

(4) that any Note accepted for payment and for which payment is
made pursuant to the Net Worth Purchase Offer shall cease to accrue
interest on and after the Net Worth Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to a
Net Worth Purchase Offer will be required to surrender the Security, with
the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of
the Security completed, to the Paying Agent (which may not for purposes of
this Section 4.17, notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the
contrary, be the Company or any Affiliate of the Company) at the address
specified in the notice on or before the Net Worth Purchase Date;

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if
the Paying Agent receives, not later than three Business Days prior to the
Net Worth Purchase Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or
letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the
Notes the Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is
withdrawing his election to have the Note purchased;

66
<PAGE>

(7) that if Notes in a principal amount in excess of the Net Worth
Offer Amount are tendered pursuant to the Net Worth Purchase Offer, the
Company shall purchase Notes on a pro rata basis (with such adjustments as
--- ---- 
may be deemed appropriate by the Company so that only Notes in
denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 shall be acquired);
and

(8) that Holders whose Notes were purchased only in part will be
issued new Notes of the same series equal in principal amount to the
unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered.

Any such Net Worth Purchase Offer shall comply with all applicable provisions of
Federal and state laws regulating such offers, and any provisions of this
Indenture which conflict with such laws shall be deemed to be superseded by the
provisions of such laws.

No later than the Net Worth Payment Date, the Company shall (i) accept
for payment Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Net Worth
Purchase Offer (on a pro rata basis if required pursuant to paragraph (7)
--- ---- 
above), (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent U.S. Legal Tender sufficient to pay
the purchase price of all Notes or portions thereof so accepted and (iii)
deliver to the Trustee Notes so accepted together with the Officers' Certificate
stating the Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment by the Company. The
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail or
deliver to such Holders a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased
portion of the Note surrendered. Any Notes not so accepted shall be mailed
promptly or delivered by the Paying Agent to the Holder thereof. The Company
will notify the Holders of the results of the Net Worth Purchase Offer promptly
after the Net Worth Payment Date.

SECTION 4.18 Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws.
--------------------------------------- 

Each of the Company and the Guarantors covenants (to the extent that it
may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any
manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or
extension law or any usury law or other law which

67
<PAGE>

would prohibit or forgive the Company or any of the Guarantors from paying all
or any portion of the principal of or interest on the Securities as contemplated
herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may
affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent
that it may lawfully do so) each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby
expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it
will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to
the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as
though no such law had been enacted.

SECTION 4.19 Ownership of Richmond Homes.
--------------------------- 

(a) The Company shall own, directly or indirectly, beneficially all of
the Capital Stock of Richmond Homes (or its successor) on or prior to the
earlier of the date that is (i) 90 days following the Issue Date or (ii) 10 days
following the date that there is rendered to the Company in connection with the
Option Agreement an appraisal by a financial advisor with respect to the
valuation of Richmond Homes, and the Company shall thereupon cause all of such
Capital Stock to be pledged to the Trustee and for the benefit of the Holders
such that the Trustee shall have a perfected, first priority security interest
in such shares of Capital Stock and such Capital Stock shall constitute Pledged
Shares for all purposes of Article Twelve; provided that, if the Company shall
-------- 
not own all of such shares of Capital Stock by such date solely as a result of
an injunction imposed against the Company prohibiting the Company from
purchasing shares of common stock of Richard Homes pursuant to the Option
Agreement, then the term "Capital Stock" in this Section 4.19 shall not include
such shares of common stock to which such injunction applies.

(b) In the event of the imposition of an injunction referred to in
Section 4.19(a), the Company shall use its best efforts to cause such injunction
to be removed and shall promptly thereafter own beneficially all of the shares
of Capital Stock of Richmond Homes or its successor.

transaction; and (iv) the Company or the surviving or transferee entity thereof
would immediately thereafter be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional

Subsidiaries of the Company or to a transaction between the Company and its
Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries, or (y) a merger between Richmond Homes and
a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as a result of which merger

-------- 
event any such acceleration is withdrawn or otherwise rescinded (including
satisfaction of such Indebtedness) within a period of ten business days

which, in the aggregate, are at least $5,000,000 at any one time rendered
against the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries by a court of
competent jurisdiction and not bonded, satisfied or discharged for a period
(during which execution shall not be effectively stayed) of (A) 45 days

If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the
Trustee, the Trustee must, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Default,
give to the Holders notice of such Default; provided that, except in the case of
--------
a Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes,
including a Default in the payment of the Asset Sale Offer Price, amounts owing
pursuant to Section 4.17, or the Change of Control Purchase Price as required by
this Indenture, the Trustee will be protected in withholding such notice if it
in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest
of the Holders.

SECTION 6.2 Acceleration of Maturity Date; Rescission and Annulment.
------------------------------------------------------- 

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing (other than an Event
of Default specified in Section 6.1(4) or (5) of this Article Six, relating to
the Company or its Material Subsidiaries), then in each such case, unless the
principal of all of the Notes shall have already become due and payable, either
the Trustee or the

73
<PAGE>

Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by
notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders)
(an "Acceleration Notice"), may declare all principal, determined as set forth
below, including in each case accrued interest thereon, or, as appropriate, the
Change of Control Purchase Price (solely with respect to a Default relating to
the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price) to be due and payable
immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(4) or (5) occurs,
all principal and accrued and unpaid interest thereon will be immediately due
and payable on all outstanding Notes without any declaration or other act on the
part of the Trustee or the Holders.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration is made and before
a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the
Trustee as hereinafter provided in this Article Six, the Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Securities, by written notice
to the Company and the Trustee, may waive, on behalf of all Holders, any such
declaration of acceleration if:

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue interest on all Securities,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, applicable to) any
Securities which would become due otherwise than by such declaration of
acceleration, and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Securities,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest
upon overdue interest at the rate borne by the Securities,

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its
agents and counsel, and

(2) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Securities which have become
due solely by such declara-

74
<PAGE>

tion of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section
6.12, including, if applicable, any Event of Default relating to the
covenants contained in Section 4.16.

Notwithstanding the previous sentence of this Section 6.2, no waiver shall be
effective for any Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would be an Event of Default with respect to any covenant or provision
which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each
outstanding Security, unless all such affected Holders agree, in writing, to
waive such Event of Default or event. No such waiver shall cure or waive any
subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 6.3 Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by
-------------------------------------------------------
Trustee.
- ------- 

The Company covenants that if an Event of Default in payment of
principal, premium, or interest specified in clause (1) or (2) of Section 6.1
occurs and is continuing, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to
it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due
and payable on such Securities for principal, premium (if any) and interest,
and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable,
interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue
interest, at the rate borne by the Securities, and, in addition thereto, such
further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including compensation to, and expenses, disbursements and advances
of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand,
the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust in favor of the
Holders, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so
due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and
may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the
Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the
manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor
upon the Securities, wherever situated.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in
its discretion proceed to protect

75
<PAGE>

and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders by such appropriate
judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effective to protect and
enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or
agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted
herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

SECTION 6.4 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
-------------------------------- 

In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other Obligor upon the
Securities or the property of the Company or of such other Obligor, the Trustee
(irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and
payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company or any Obligor for
the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered,
by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise to take any and all actions
under the TIA, including

(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal
(and premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the
Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary
or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any
claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances
of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such
judicial proceeding, and

(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable
or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the
Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to
pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its

76
<PAGE>

agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition affecting the Securities
or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in
respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

SECTION 6.5 Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of
------------------------------------------------
Securities.
- ---------- 

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities
may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of
the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and
any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name
as trustee of an express trust in favor of the Holders, and any recovery of
judgment shall, after provision for the payment of compensation to, and
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be
for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which
such judgment has been recovered.

SECTION 6.6 Priorities.
---------- 

Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Six shall
be applied, if permitted by Article Eleven, in the following order, at the date
or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on
account of principal, premium (if any) or interest, upon presentation of the
Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and
upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

FIRST: To the Trustee in payment of all amounts due pursuant to
Section 7.7;

SECOND: To the Holders in payment of the amounts then due and unpaid
for principal of, premium (if any) and interest on, the Securities in respect of
which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably,
without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and
payable on such Securities for principal, premium (if any) and interest,
respectively; and

77
<PAGE>

THIRD: To whomsoever may be lawfully entitled thereto, the remainder,
if any.

SECTION 6.7 Limitation on Suits.
------------------- 

No Holder of any Security shall have any right to order or direct the
Trustee to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this
Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other
remedy hereunder, unless

(A) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee
of a continuing Event of Default;

(B) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of then
outstanding Securities shall have made written request to the Trustee to
institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name
as Trustee hereunder;

(C) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable
security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred or reasonably probable to be incurred in compliance with such
request;

(D) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice,
request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding;
and

(E) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been
given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the outstanding Securities;

it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders shall have any
right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of
this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders,
or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders
or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein
provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders.

78

Premium and Interest.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the Holder of
any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to

SECTION 6.9 Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
------------------------------ 

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in Section 2.7, no
right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the
Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every
right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in
addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any
right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 6.10 Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
---------------------------- 

No delay or omission by the Trustee or by any Holder of any Security
to exercise any right or remedy arising upon any Event of Default shall impair
the exercise of any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such
Event of Default. Every right and remedy given by this Article Six or by law to
the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often
as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may
be.

<PAGE>

SECTION 6.11 Control by Holders.
------------------ 

The Holder or Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
then outstanding Securities shall have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or
exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, provided that:
-------- 

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law
or with this Indenture,

(2) the Trustee shall not determine that the action so directed
would be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders not taking part in such
direction, and

(3) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

SECTION 6.12 Waiver of Past Default.
---------------------- 

Subject to Section 6.8, the Holder or Holders of not less than a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities may, on
behalf of all Holders, waive any past default hereunder and its consequences,
except a default

(A) in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on, any Security not yet cured, or

(B) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which, under
Article Nine, cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
Holder of each outstanding Security affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event
of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or impair the exercise of any right arising therefrom.

SECTION 6.13 Undertaking for Costs.
--------------------- 

All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by
his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its
discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken by it as Trustee, the filing by any party
litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that
such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to
the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant;
but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the
Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any
Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Securities, or to any suit instituted by any
Holder for enforcement of the payment of principal of, or premium (if any) or
interest on, any Security on or after the respective Maturity Date expressed in
such Security (including, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption
Date).

SECTION 6.14 Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
---------------------------------- 

If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce
any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to
the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every case, subject to any
determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and
the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former
positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and
the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

----------------- 

(a) If a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is

conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of

the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However,
the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine
whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

82
<PAGE>

with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.11.

the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds
for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such
risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

with counsel and may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel,

indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred
therein or thereby.

SECTION 7.3 Individual Rights of Trustee.
---------------------------- 

The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner
or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, its

if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. However,
the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.

SECTION 7.4 Trustee's Disclaimer.

responsible for any statement in the Securities, other than the Trustee's
certificate of authentication, or the use or application of any funds received
by a Paying Agent other than the Trustee.

SECTION 7.5 Notice of Default.
----------------- 

If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee,
the Trustee must, within 90 days after the occurrence of such default, mail to
each Holder notice of such Default, except in the case of a default in payment
of principal of, premium, if any, or interest

84
<PAGE>

on, the Notes, including a default in the payment of the Asset Sale Offer Price,
any amounts owing pursuant to Section 4.17, or the Change of Control Purchase
Price as required by this Indenture. The Trustee will be protected in
withholding such notice if it in good faith determines that the withholding of
such notice is in the interest of the Holders.

SECTION 7.6 Reports by Trustee to Holders.
----------------------------- 

Within 60 days after each May 15, beginning with the May 15 following
the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall, if required, mail to each Holder
a brief report dated as of such May 15 that complies with TIA (S) 313(a). The
Trustee also shall comply with TIA (S)(S) 313(b) and 313(c).

The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing if the
Securities become listed on any stock exchange or automatic quotation system.

A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders
shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the SEC and each stock exchange,
if any, on which the Securities are listed.

SECTION 7.7 Compensation and Indemnity.

The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable
compensation for its services. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited
by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall
reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable disbursements, expenses
and advances incurred or made by it. Such expenses shall include the reasonable
compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents, accountants,
experts and counsel.

The Company shall indemnify the Trustee (in its capacity as Trustee) and
each of its officers, directors, attorneys-in-fact and agents for, and hold it
harmless against, any claim, demand, expense (including but not limited to
reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and
counsel), loss or liability incurred by it without negligence or bad faith on
its part, arising out of or in connection with the administration of this trust
and its rights or duties hereunder including the reasonable costs and expenses
of defending itself against any claim or liability in con-

85
<PAGE>

nection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties
hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim asserted
against the Trustee for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend
the claim and the Trustee shall provide reasonable cooperation at the Company's
expense in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel; provided, that the
--------
Company will not be required to pay such fees and expenses if it assumes the
Trustee's defense and there is no conflict of interest between the Company and
the Trustee in connection with such defense. The Company need not pay for any
settlement made without its written consent. The Company need not reimburse any
expense or indemnify against any loss or liability to the extent incurred by the
Trustee through its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section 7.7, the
Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all assets held or
collected by the Trustee, in its capacity as Trustee, except assets held in
trust to pay principal and premium, if any, of or interest on particular
Securities.

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of
Default specified in Section 6.1(4) or (5) occurs, the expenses and the
compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of
administration under any Bankruptcy Law.

The Company's obligations under this Section 7.7 and any lien arising
hereunder shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee, the discharge
of the Company's obligations pursuant to Article Eight of this Indenture and any
rejection or termination of this Indenture under any Bankruptcy Law.

SECTION 7.8 Replacement of Trustee.
---------------------- 

The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company in writing. The
Holder or Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Securities may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Company and the Trustee in

Company may remove the Trustee if:

86

(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;

(2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;

(3) a receiver, Custodian, or other public officer takes charge of
the Trustee or its property; or

Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holder or
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may appoint a
successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its
appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Immediately after that
and provided that all sums owing to the Trustee provided for in Section 7.7 have
been paid, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as
Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided in Section 7.7,
the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and
the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the
Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its
succession to each Holder.

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the
retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the
Holder or Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the outstanding
Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
of a successor Trustee.

If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and
the appointment of a successor Trustee.

Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8,
the Company's obligations

87
<PAGE>

under Section 7.7 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.

SECTION 7.9 Successor Trustee by Merger, Etc.

otherwise eligible hereunder, be the successor Trustee.

respect of the Notes, U.S. Legal Tender in an amount which, in the opinion
of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants
expressed in a written certification thereof (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) delivered to the Trustee, is

Notes then outstanding on the dates on which any such payments are due and

In the event all or any portion of the Securities are to be redeemed
through such irrevocable trust, the Company must make arrangements satisfactory
to the Trustee for the giving of the notice of such redemption or redemptions by

Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver of any provision
of this Indenture or the Securities;

95
<PAGE>

(2) reduce the rate or extend the time for payment of interest on
any Security;

(3) reduce the principal amount of any Security, or reduce the
Change of Control Purchase Price, the Asset Sale Offer Price or the
Redemption Price;

(4) change the Maturity Date of any Security;

(5) alter the redemption provisions of Article Three or the terms
or provisions of Section 4.16, in any case, in a manner adverse to any
Holder;

(6) make any changes in the provisions concerning waivers of
Defaults or Events of Default by Holders of the Securities (except to
increase any required percentage or to provide that certain other
provisions hereof cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the
Holders of each outstanding Security affected thereby) or the rights of
Holders to recover the principal or premium of, interest on, or redemption
payment with respect to, any Security;

(7) make any changes in Section 6.4, 6.7 or the third sentence of
this Section 9.2;

(8) make the principal of, or the interest on, any Security
payable with anything or in any manner other than as provided for in this
Indenture (including changing the place of payment where, or the coin or
currency in which, any Security or any premium or the interest thereon is
payable) and the Securities as in effect on the date hereof; or

(9) make the Securities expressly subordinated in right of payment
to any extent or under any circumstances to any other Indebtedness.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this
Section 9.2 to approve the partic-

96
<PAGE>

ular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be
sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.2 becomes
effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders affected thereby a notice
briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the
Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any
way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.2 or 9.4
becomes effective, it shall bind each Holder.

In connection with any amendment, supplement or waiver under this
Article Nine, the Company may, but shall not be obligated to, offer to any
Holder who consents to such amendment, supplement or waiver, or to all Holders,
consideration for such Holder's consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver.

SECTION 9.3 Compliance with TIA.
------------------- 

Every amendment, waiver or supplement of this Indenture or the
Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.

SECTION 9.4 Revocation and Effect of Consents.
--------------------------------- 

Until an amendment, waiver or supplement becomes effective, a consent to
it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder
of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting
Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. 
However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his
Note or portion of his Note by written notice to the Company or the Person
designated by the Company as the Person to whom consents should be sent if such
revocation is received by the Company or such Person before the date on which
the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate certifying that the Holders of the
requisite principal amount of Notes have consented (and not theretofore revoked
such consent) to the amendment, supplement or waiver.

97
<PAGE>

The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for
the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment,
supplement or waiver, which record date shall be the date so fixed by the
Company notwithstanding the provisions of the TIA. If a record date is fixed,
then notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph,
those Persons who were Holders at such record date, and only those Persons (or
their duly designated proxies), shall be entitled to revoke any consent
previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such
record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days
after such record date.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall
bind every Holder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1)
through (9) of Section 9.2, in which case, the amendment, supplement or waiver
shall bind only each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every
subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same
debt as the consenting Holder's Security; provided that any such waiver shall
-------- 
not impair or affect the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal and
premium of and interest on a Security, on or after the respective dates set for
such amounts to become due and payable expressed in such Security, or to bring
suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates.

SECTION 9.5 Notation on or Exchange of Securities.
------------------------------------- 

If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the
Trustee may require the Holder of the Note to deliver it to the Trustee or
require the Holder to put an appropriate notation on the Note. The Trustee may
place an appropriate notation on the Note about the changed terms and return it
to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the
Company in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate
a new Note that reflects the changed terms. Any failure to make the appropriate
notation or to issue a new Note shall not affect the validity of such amendment,
supplement or waiver.

98
<PAGE>

SECTION 9.6 Trustee to Sign Amendments, Etc.
--------------------------------

The Trustee shall execute any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized
pursuant to this Article Nine; provided that the Trustee may, but shall not be
-------- 
obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver which affects the
Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture. The Trustee
shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an
Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or
waiver authorized pursuant to this Article Nine is authorized or permitted by
this Indenture.

appointment of proxies, and in regard to the appointment and duties of
inspectors of votes, and submission and examination of proxies, certificates and

meeting their verified written reports in duplicate of all votes cast at the
meeting. A record in duplicate of the proceedings of each meeting of Holders

ARTICLE ELEVEN

SUBORDINATION OF THE GUARANTY

SECTION 11.1 Guaranty Subordinated to Senior Indebtedness.
-------------------------------------------- 

Each Guarantor for itself and its successors, and each Holder, by his
acceptance of Securities, agrees that (a) any payment on account of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes made or to be made by a
Guarantor under the Guaranty and (b) any payment on account of the acquisition
or redemption of the Securities by any Guarantor (including, without limitation,
pursuant to Sections 4.14, 4.16, or 4.17) is subordinated, to the extent and in
the manner provided in this Article Eleven, to the prior payment in full of all
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor and that these subordination
provisions are for the benefit of the holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness.

This Article Eleven shall constitute a continuing offer to all Persons
who become holders of, or continue to hold, Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, and
such provisions are made for the benefit of the holders of Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness, and such holders are made obligees hereunder and any one or more
of them may enforce such provisions.

SECTION 11.2 No Payment on Guaranty in Certain Circumstances.
----------------------------------------------- 

(a) No payment shall be made by a Guarantor on account of the
Guaranties or to defease or acquire any of the Securities (including repurchases
of Securi-

103
<PAGE>

ties pursuant to Section 4.14, 4.16, or 4.17) for cash or property, or on
account of the redemption provisions of the Securities, (i) upon the maturity of
any Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor by lapse of time,
acceleration (unless waived) or otherwise, unless and until all principal of and
interest on (including any post-petition interest) such Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness and all other obligations in respect thereof shall first be paid in
full or such payment is duly provided for, or (ii) in the event of default in
payment of any principal of, premium, if any, or interest on or any other
amounts payable in respect of any Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such
Guarantor when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or at a
date fixed for prepayment or by declaration or otherwise (a "Payment Default")
unless and until such Payment Default has been cured or waived or otherwise has
ceased to exist.

(b) Upon the happening of an event of default (other than a Payment
Default) with respect to any Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor, as
such event of default is defined in the instrument under which it is
outstanding, permitting the holders (or any requisite percentage thereof) to
accelerate the maturity thereof and demand payment in full to be made
immediately with respect to such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, upon written
notice of such event of default given to such Guarantor and the Trustee by the
holders of an aggregate of $5,000,000 principal amount outstanding of such
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness or their representative (a "Payment Notice"),
then, unless and until such event of default shall have been cured or waived or
shall have otherwise ceased to exist, no payment shall be made by such Guarantor
on account of the Guaranties or to defease or acquire or repurchase any of the
Securities for cash or property, or on account of the redemption provisions of
the Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless (a) the Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness in respect of which such event of default exists has been declared
due and payable in its entirety within 179 days after the Payment Notice is
delivered as set forth above (the "Payment Blockage Period"), and (b) such
declaration has not been rescinded or waived, subject to Section 11.2(a), such
Guarantor shall be required to pay all sums not paid to the Holders of the
Securities during the Payment Blockage Period due to the foregoing prohibitions
and to resume all other payments as and when due on the applicable Guaranty. 
Any number of Payment Notices may be given; provided, however, that (i) not more
-------- ------- 
than one Payment

104
<PAGE>

Notice shall be given within a period of any 360 consecutive days, (ii) in no
event shall the aggregate of all Payment Blockage Periods with respect to any
particular payment on any Guaranty extend beyond 179 days from the date such
payment on such Guaranty was due, and (iii) no event of default that existed
upon the date of such Payment Notice or the commencement of such Payment
Blockage Period (whether or not such event of default is on the same issue of
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness) shall be made the basis for the commencement of
any other Payment Blockage Period, unless waived or cured for a period of at
least 90 consecutive days.

(c) In furtherance of the provisions of Section 11.1, in the event
that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.2, any payment
or distribution of assets on account of principal of or interest on the
Securities or to defease or acquire any of the Securities (including repurchases
of Securities pursuant to Section 4.14, 4.16, or 4.17) for cash, property or
securities, or on account of the redemption provisions of the Securities shall
be made by a Guarantor and received by the Trustee, by any Holder or by any
Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, money for
any such payment shall be segregated and held in trust), at a time when such
payment or distribution was prohibited by the provisions of this Section 11.2,
then, unless such payment or distribution is no longer prohibited by this
Section 11.2, such payment or distribution (subject to the provisions of
Sections 11.6 and 11.7) shall be received and held in trust by the Trustee or
such Holder or Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness of such Guarantor, and shall be paid or delivered by the Trustee or
such Holders or such Paying Agent, as the case may be, to the holders of
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor remaining unpaid or unprovided
for or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees
under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any of such
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor may have been issued, ratably
according to the aggregate amounts on account of the Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness of such Guarantor held or represented by each, to the extent
necessary to enable payment in full (except as such payment otherwise shall have
been provided for), of all Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor
remaining unpaid, after giving effect to all concurrent payments and
distributions and all provisions therefor to or for the holders of such

105
<PAGE>

Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, but only to the extent that as to any holder of
such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, as promptly as practical following notice
from the Trustee to the holders of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness that such
prohibited payment has been received by the Trustee, Holder(s) or Paying Agent
(or has been segregated as provided above), such holder (or a representative
thereof) notifies the Trustee of the amounts then due and owing on such
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, if any, held by such holder and only the amounts
specified in such notices to the Trustee shall be paid to the holders of such
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness.

winding up, total or partial liquidation or reorganization of such Guarantor,
whether voluntary or involuntary, in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or
similar proceeding or upon assignment for the benefit of creditors:

(a) the holders of all Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such
Guarantor shall first be entitled to receive payments in full (or to have such
payment duly provided for) of the principal of and interest and other amounts
payable in respect thereof, before the Holders are entitled to receive any
payment on account of the applicable Guaranty, as the case may be;

(b) any payment or distribution of assets of such Guarantor of any
kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders
or the Trustee on behalf of the Holders would be entitled except for the
provisions of this Article Eleven, shall be paid by the liquidating trustee or
agent or other Person making such a payment or distribution, directly to the
holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor or their
representative, ratably according to the respective amounts of Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness of such Guarantor held or represented by each, to the extent
necessary to make payment in full (or have such payment duly provided for) of
all such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid after giving effect to
all concurrent payments and distributions and all provisions therefor to or for
the holders of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness; and

106
<PAGE>

(c) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or
distribution of assets of a Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property or securities, shall be received by the Trustee or the Holders or any
Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, money for
any such payment or distribution shall be segregated or held in trust) on
account of such Guaranty, as the case may be, before all Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness of such Guarantor is paid in full, or provision made for its
payment, such payment or distribution (subject to the provisions of Sections
11.6 and 11.7) shall be received and held in trust by the Trustee or such Holder
or Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of such Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness, or their respective representative, ratably according to the
respective amounts of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor held or
represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full (except as
such payment otherwise shall have been provided for) of all such Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid after giving effect to all concurrent
payments and distributions and all provisions therefor to or for the holders of
such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, but only to the extent that as to any holder
of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, as promptly as practical following notice
from the Trustee to the holders of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness that such
prohibited payment has been received by the Trustee, Holder(s) or Paying Agent
(or has been segregated as provided above), such holder (or a representative
therefor) notifies the Trustee of the amounts then due and owing on such
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, if any, held by such holder and only the amounts
specified in such notices to the Trustee shall be paid to the holders of such
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness.

The Company and any relevant Guarantor shall give prompt written notice
to the Trustee of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization of
any such Guarantor or assignment for the benefit of creditors by any such
Guarantor.

SECTION 11.4 Securityholders to Be Subrogated to Rights of Holders of
--------------------------------------------------------
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness.
- ----------------------------- 

Subject to the payment in full of all Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of a
Guarantor, the Holders of Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the
holders of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness to receive payments

107
<PAGE>

or distributions of assets of any such Guarantor, as the case may be, applicable
to the Guarantor Senior Indebtedness until all amounts owing on the Securities
shall be paid in full, and for the purpose of such subrogation no such payments
or distributions to the holders of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness by or on
behalf of any Guarantor, or by or on behalf of the Holders by virtue of this
Article Eleven, which otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall, as
between any Guarantor and the Holders, be deemed to be payment by any Guarantor
to or on account of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that
the provisions of this Article Eleven are and are intended solely for the
purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the
holders of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.

If any payment or distribution to which the Holders would otherwise have
been entitled but for the provisions of this Article Eleven shall have been
applied, pursuant to the provisions of this Article Eleven, to the payment of
amounts payable under Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor, then the
Holders shall be entitled to receive from the holders of such Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness any payments or distributions received by such holders of Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness in excess of the amount sufficient to pay all amounts
payable under or in respect of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness in full.

SECTION 11.5 Obligations of the Guarantors Unconditional.
------------------------------------------- 

Nothing contained in this Article Eleven or elsewhere in this Indenture
or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as between any Guarantor
and the Holders, the obligation of each Guarantor, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay to the Holders the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on, and all other amounts owing with respect thereto, if any, the
Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with
their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the
Holders and creditors of any Guarantor other than the holders of the Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or
any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law
upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this
Article Eleven, of the holders of

108
<PAGE>

Guarantor Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or Securities of any
Guarantor received upon the exercise of any such remedy. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Article Eleven or elsewhere in this Indenture
or in the Securities, upon any distribution of assets of any Guarantor referred
to in this Article Eleven, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections
7.1 and 7.2, and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree
made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution, winding
up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or a certificate of
the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the
Trustee or to the Holders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled
to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of such Guarantor, the amount thereof or
payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other
facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Eleven. Nothing in this Section 11.5

Section 7.7.

SECTION 11.6 Trustee Entitled to Assume Payments Not Prohibited in
-----------------------------------------------------
Absence of Notice.

The Trustee shall not at any time be charged with knowledge of the
existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by

shall have received, no later than three Business Days prior to such payment,
written notice thereof from the Company or any Guarantor or from one or more
holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness or from any representative therefor
and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to
the provisions of Sections 7.1 and 7.2, shall be entitled in all respects

or not in trust) for the payment of principal of or interest on any Securities
shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4;
provided, that, if prior to the third Business Day preceding the date on which

by the terms of this Indenture any such assets may become distributable for any
purpose (including without limitation, the payment on account of any Guaranty)
the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall not have received with respect to such
assets the written notice provided for in Section 11.6, then the Trustee or such
Paying Agent shall have full power and authority to receive such assets and to
apply the same to the purpose for which they were received, and shall not be
affected by any notice to the contrary which may be received by it on or after
such date.

SECTION 11.8 Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or Omissions of
---------------------------------------------------------
the Guarantors or Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
- ------------------------------------------------ 

No right of any present or future holders of any Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness to enforce subordination provisions contained in this Article
Eleven shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or
failure to act on the part of any Guarantor or by any act or failure to act, in
good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by any Guarantor with
the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such
holder may have or be otherwise charged with. The holders of Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness may extend, renew, modify or amend the terms of the Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness or any security therefor and release, sell or exchange such
security and otherwise deal freely with any Guarantor all without affecting the
liabilities and obligations of the parties to this Indenture or the Holders.

SECTION 11.9 Securityholders Authorize Trustee to Effectuate
-----------------------------------------------
Subordination of Guaranty.
- ------------------------- 

Each Holder of the Securities by his acceptance thereof authorizes and
expressly directs the Trustee on its behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provisions contained in
this Article Eleven and to protect the

110
<PAGE>

rights of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, and appoints the Trustee its
attorney-in-fact for such purpose, including, in the event of any dissolution,
winding up, liquidation or reorganization of any Guarantor (whether in
bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceedings or upon an assignment for the
benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of assets and liabilities of such
Guarantor) tending towards liquidation of the business and assets of any
Guarantor, the immediate filing of a claim for the unpaid balance of his
Securities in the form required in said proceedings and cause said claim to be
approved. If the Trustee does not file a proper claim or proof of debt in the
form required in such proceeding prior to 30 days before the expiration of the
time to file such claim or claims, then the holders of the Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness or their representative are or is hereby authorized to have the
right to file and are or is hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for
and on behalf of the Holders of said Securities. Nothing herein contained shall
be deemed to authorize the Trustee or the holders of Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness or their representative to authorize or consent to or accept or
adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder
thereof, or to authorize the Trustee or the holders of Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness or their representative to vote in respect of the claim of any
Securityholder in any such proceeding.

SECTION 11.10 Right of Trustee to Hold Guarantor Senior Indebtedness.
------------------------------------------------------ 

The Trustee shall be entitled to all of the rights set forth in this
Article Twelve in respect of any Guarantor Senior Indebtedness at any time held
by it to the same extent as any other holder of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness,
and nothing in this Indenture shall be construed to deprive the Trustee of any
of its rights as such holder.

SECTION 11.11 Article Eleven Not to Prevent Events of Default.
----------------------------------------------- 

The failure to make a payment on account of any Guarantor by reason of
any provision of this Article Eleven shall not be construed as preventing the
occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.1 or in any way
prevent the Holders from exer-

111
<PAGE>

cising any right hereunder other than the right to receive payment on account of
the Guaranty.

SECTION 11.12 No Fiduciary Duty of Trustee to Holders of Guarantor
----------------------------------------------------
Senior Indebtedness.
- ------------------- 

The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders
of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, and shall not be liable to any such holders
(other than for its willful misconduct or negligence) if it shall in good faith
mistakenly pay over or distribute to the Holders of Securities or the Company or
any other Person, cash, property or securities to which any holders of Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Eleven or
otherwise. Nothing in this Section 11.12 shall affect the obligation of any
other such Person to hold such payment for the benefit of, and to pay such
payment over to, the holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness or their
representative.

ARTICLE TWELVE

SECURITY

SECTION 12.1 Pledge Agreement.
---------------- 

In order to secure the due and punctual payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Securities when and as the same shall be
due and payable, whether on an interest payment date, at maturity, by
acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue
principal and interest, if any, of the Securities and performance of all other
obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee under this Indenture
and the Securities, according to the terms hereunder or thereunder, each Pledgor
hereby pledges to the Trustee, and grants to the Trustee a security interest in
all of such Pledgor's right, title and interest in and to the Collateral. On
the date of the first issuance of the Securities hereunder, each Pledgor will
have full right, power and lawful authority to grant, bargain, sell, release,
convey, hypothecate, assign, mortgage, pledge, transfer and confirm, absolutely,
the property constituting the Collateral, free and clear of all Liens, pledges,
charges and encumbrances, whatsoever, except the Liens created hereby and except
to the extent otherwise provided herein, and (a) subject to the provisions of
this Indenture, will forever warrant and defend the title

112
<PAGE>

to the same against the claims of all Persons whatsoever, (b) will execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Trustee such further assignments, transfers,
assurances or other instruments as the Trustee may require or request, and (c)
will do or cause to be done all such acts and things as may be necessary or
proper, or as may be required by the Trustee, to assure and confirm to the
Trustee the perfection and protection of the security interest in the Collateral
granted or purported to be granted hereby, as from time to time constituted, so
as to render the same available for the security and benefit of this Indenture
and of the Securities secured hereby, according to the intent and purposes
herein expressed. To the extent applicable, this Article Twelve will be
governed by the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Article Twelve to the contrary,
the Trustee, as collateral agent, shall not exercise any of its remedies under
this Article Twelve upon the occurrence of an Event of Default until 179 days
after the Trustee has given written notice to each of the Pledge Senior Lenders
that an Event of Default and acceleration of the Securities has occurred (such
179-day period to be tolled during any period in which the automatic stay under
Section 362 of Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code prevents such
lender from exercising its remedies) regardless of whether or not the Event of
Default has been waived or cured or any acceleration is otherwise rescinded. 
Upon the request of the Trustee, the Company or Pledge Senior Lenders shall
provide the Trustee with the names of the Pledge Senior Lenders. A period of
180 days must elapse after the termination of any such standstill period before
any subsequent standstill period may be effective. This Section 12.1 is intended
for the equal and ratable benefit of the Pledge Senior Lenders.

SECTION 12.2 Delivery of Collateral.
---------------------- 

All certificates or instruments representing or evidencing the
Collateral shall be delivered to and held by or on behalf of the Trustee
pursuant hereto and shall be in suitable form for transfer by delivery, or shall
be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank,
all in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee.

assurance or amendment have been properly recorded, registered and filed to
the extent necessary to make effective and perfect the Lien intended to be
created under this Article Twelve, and reciting the details of such action
and stating that as to this Article Twelve, such recording, registering
and filing are the only recordings, registerings and filings necessary to

such Counsel, no such action is necessary to make such Lien and assignment

SECTION 12.4 Voting Rights; Dividends; Etc.
------------------------------

(a) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and
other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Shares or any part thereof for
any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Article Twelve, provided,
-------- 
however, that such Pledgor shall not exercise or shall refrain from exercising
- ------- 
any such right if such action would be inconsistent with or violate any
provisions of this Indenture.

(b) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred or be
continuing, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, each Pledgor
shall be entitled to receive, and to utilize free and clear of the Lien of this
Indenture, all dividends and distributions paid from time to time in respect of
the Pledged Shares as permitted by the Indenture other than dividends and
distributions in the form of additional shares of Capital Stock of the
respective Pledged Subsidiaries or liquidating dividends and distributions.

(c) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred or be
continuing, the Trustee shall execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and
delivered) to each Pledgor all such proxies and other instruments as such
Pledgor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Pledgor to
exercise the voting and other rights that it is entitled to exercise pursuant to
Section 12.4(a) and (b) hereof.

(d) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default and after written notice to each Pledgor, all rights of such Pledgor to

115
<PAGE>

exercise the voting and other consensual rights that it would otherwise be
entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 12.4(a) shall remain in effect,
provided, however that each Pledgor shall provide reasonable prior notice to the
- -------- ------- 
Trustee of such Pledgor's intention to exercise such voting or other consensual
rights that it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section
12.4(a); provided, further, that upon receipt of such notice from a Pledgor, the
-------- ------- 
Trustee shall be entitled, upon notice to such Pledgor, to elect to exercise
such voting and other consensual rights that such Pledgor otherwise intended to
exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of Section 12.4(f).

(e) Subject to the terms of Section 12.4(d), upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Pledgor shall execute and
deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Trustee all such proxies

Trustee to exercise the voting and other rights that it is entitled to exercise
pursuant to Section 12.4(d) hereof.

(f) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default and after written notice to each Pledgor, the Trustee shall be entitled
to receive and deposit in a separate account for the benefit of the Trustee and
the Holders all dividends and distributions paid in respect of the Pledged
Shares. All dividends or other distributions that are received by each Pledgor
contrary to the provisions of this Section 12.4 shall be received in trust for
the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, be segregated from the other
property or funds of such Pledgor and be forthwith delivered to the Trustee as
Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsements).

(g) The exercise of the Trustee's rights under this Section 12.4 are
subject to the standstill agreement in favor of the Pledge Senior Lenders
pursuant to Section 12.1.

SECTION 12.5 Releases of Collateral.
---------------------- 

Each Holder by accepting a Security agrees that the release of any
Collateral from the terms hereof will not be deemed to impair the security under
this Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof if the Collat-

116
<PAGE>

eral is released in accordance with the terms hereof, including, but not limited
to, the release of any Collateral which is the subject of an Asset Sale and the
cash proceeds are applied so as to determine Net Cash Proceeds and Net Cash
Proceeds received from such Asset Sale are applied in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4.14 or pursuant to this sentence. Upon delivery to the
Trustee of an Officers' Certificate that an Asset Sale is contemplated the
subject of which is a Pledged Subsidiary's Pledged Shares or other Collateral,
the Trustee shall deliver to the Pledgor of such Collateral the Pledged Shares
proposed to be sold or transferred free and clear of any Lien under this
Indenture so long as such transaction is made in compliance with the terms of
Article Five and Section 4.14. In the event a Subsidiary who is the issuer of
Pledged Shares is (i) merged with and into another Subsidiary who is also the
issuer of Pledged Shares or whose shares will be owned by a Pledgor and will
constitute Pledged Shares following such merger or (ii) merged with and into the
Company, then in each case the Pledged Shares of the merged entity shall be
released by the Trustee and delivered to the Company to be retired and cancelled
upon delivery to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate stating that such
merger has occurred. Nothing herein shall prevent a merger pursuant to the
foregoing sentence. A Pledgor may assign its interest in any Pledged Shares to
another Pledgor and the Trustee shall cooperate with the assigning Pledgor in
transferring such Pledged Shares to the assignee Pledgor and substituting the
applicable certificate for Pledged Shares so transferred. The assignee Pledgor
shall take all actions (including executing appropriate stock powers in blank)
required hereunder to pledge the transferred Pledged Shares for the benefit of
the Holders pursuant to Section 12.1. To the extent applicable, each Pledgor
and each Obligor on the Securities, including the Guarantors, shall cause TIA
(S) 314(d) relating to the release of property from the Lien created under this
Article Twelve be complied with. Any certificate or opinion required by TIA (S)
314(d) may be made by an Officer of the Company, except in cases which TIA (S)
314(d) requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent
person.

SECTION 12.6 Suits to Protect the Collateral.
------------------------------- 

The Trustee shall have power to institute and to maintain such suits and
proceedings as it may deem expedient to prevent any impairment of the Collateral
by any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of this

117
<PAGE>

Article Twelve, and such suits and proceedings as the Trustee may deem expedient
to preserve or protect its interests and the interest of the Holders in the
Collateral (including power to institute and maintain suits or proceedings to
restrain the enforcement of or compliance with any legislative or other
governmental enactment, rule or order that may be unconstitutional or otherwise
invalid if the enforcement of, or compliance with, such enactment, rule or order
would impair the security hereunder or be prejudicial to the interests of the
Holders or the Trustee).

SECTION 12.7 Release Upon Termination of the Company's Obligations.
----------------------------------------------------- 

(a) In the event that the Company delivers an Officers' Certificate
certifying that all of the Securities have been indefeasibly satisfied and
discharged by complying with the provisions of Article Eight, the Trustee shall
deliver to each Pledgor a notice stating that the Trustee, on behalf of the
Holders, disclaims and gives up any and all rights it has in or to the
Collateral, and any rights it has under the Pledge Documents, and, upon and
after the receipt by the Company of such notice, the security interests in the
Collateral on behalf of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders shall be
terminated, and the Trustee shall deliver any and all Collateral in its
possession or under its control to the Company, except to the extent other
Indebtedness is secured by such Collateral pursuant to Section 12.8 hereof.

(b) Any release of Collateral made strictly in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 12.7 shall not be deemed to impair the security
interests in contravention of the provisions of this Indenture.

SECTION 12.8 Grant of Additional Security Interest in the Collateral.
------------------------------------------------------- 

Each Holder by accepting a Security agrees that other creditors of the
Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries may be granted a security interest in the
Collateral on a pari passu or subordinated basis if and to the extent such
---- ----- 
secured Indebtedness constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness with respect to the
Securities or other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral
pursuant to this Indenture. Any such additional security

118
<PAGE>

interest may be evidenced by a separate agreement in favor of such lenders and
the Trustee, at its election, may notify each Pledgor that it no longer is
willing to act as collateral agent with respect to the Holders and that another
collateral agent be engaged to act on behalf of the Holders and such other
lenders with respect to their security interests in the Collateral. The Trustee
agrees to cooperate with respect to the engagement of any such collateral agent
and to execute any and all documents in connection therewith for and on behalf
of itself and the Holders.

SECTION 12.9 Remedies Upon Default.
--------------------- 

(a) Subject to the standstill agreement in favor of the Pledge Senior
Lenders set forth in Section 12.1, if any Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, the Trustee and the Holders have, in addition to all other
rights given by law or by this Indenture, all of the rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code
of the State of New York. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default, the Trustee may at its option, following notice to each
Pledgor, transfer or register, and each Pledgor shall register or cause to be
registered upon request therefor by the Trustee, the Collateral or any part
thereof on the books of the respective Pledged Subsidiaries into the name of the
Trustee or the Trustee's nominee(s). In addition, with respect to any
Collateral that shall then be in or shall thereafter come into the possession or
custody of the Trustee, the Trustee may sell or cause to be sold at any broker's
board or at public or private sale, in one or more sales or lots, at such price
or prices as the Trustee may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future
delivery, without assumption of any creditors, and may adjourn any such sale. 
The purchaser of any or all Collateral so sold shall thereafter hold the same
absolutely, free from any claim, encumbrance or right of any kind whatsoever. 
Unless any of the Collateral threatens to decline speedily in value or is or
becomes of a type sold on a recognized market, the Trustee will give the Company
reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale thereof, or of the
time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made. 
Any sale of the Collateral conducted in conformity with reasonable commercial
practices of banks, insurance companies, commercial finance companies, or other
financial institutions disposing of property

119
<PAGE>

similar to the Collateral shall be deemed to be commercially reasonable. Any
requirements of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is mailed to the
Company as provided in Section 14.2 hereof, at least thirty (30) days before the
time of the sale or disposition. The Trustee or any Holder may, in its own name
or in the name of a designee or nominee, buy any of the Collateral at any public
sale and, if permitted by applicable law, at any private sale. All reasonable
expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and
disbursements) of, or incident to, the enforcement of any of the provisions
hereof shall be recoverable from the proceeds of the sale or other disposition
of the Collateral.

(b) If the Trustee shall determine to exercise its right to sell any
or all of the Pledged Shares pursuant to Section 12.9(a) hereof, and if in the
opinion of counsel for the Trustee it is necessary, or if in the opinion of the
Trustee it is advisable, to have the Pledged Shares or that portion thereof to
be sold and registered under the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), each Pledgor will cause the respective Pledged
Subsidiary to (i) execute and deliver, and cause its directors and officers to
execute and deliver, all at the Pledgor's own expense, all such instruments and
documents, and to do or cause to be done all such other acts and things, as may
be necessary or, in the opinion of the Trustee, advisable to register such
Pledged Shares under the provisions of the Securities Act, (ii) use its best
efforts to cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective
and to remain effective for a period of 180 days from the date of the first
public offering of such Pledged Shares or that portion thereof to be sold and
(iii) make all amendments thereto and/or to the related prospectus that are
necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission applicable therein. Each Pledgor agrees to use its best efforts to
cause the applicable Pledged Subsidiary to comply with the provisions of the
securities or "Blue Sky" laws of any jurisdiction that the Trustee shall
reasonably designate for the sale of the Pledged Shares and to make available to
the Pledged Subsidiary's security holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings
statement (which need not be audited) that will satisfy the provisions of
Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder. Each Pledgor will
cause the

120
<PAGE>

Pledged Subsidiary to furnish to the Trustee such number of copies as the
Trustee may reasonably request of each preliminary prospectus and prospectus, to
notify promptly the Trustee of the happening of any event as a result of which
any prospectus includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances when such prospectus is
delivered to any purchaser, misleading, to cause the Trustee to be furnished
with such number of copies as the Trustee may request of such supplement to or
amendment of such prospectus as is necessary to eliminate such untrue statement
or supply such omission and to otherwise keep the Trustee apprised of such
registration process. Each Pledgor will use its best efforts to cause the
Pledged Subsidiary, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Trustee and the Holders from and against all losses,
liabilities, expenses or claims (including reasonable legal expenses and the
reasonable costs of investigation) that the Trustee or the Holders may incur
under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities,
expenses or claims arise out of or are based upon any alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in such registration statement (or any amendment
thereto) or in any preliminary prospectus or prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto), or arise out of or are based upon any alleged omission to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading other than any such information furnished in
writing by the Trustee or any Holder expressly for use in the registration
statement. Each Pledgor will cause the Pledged Subsidiary to bear all costs and
expenses of carrying out its obligations hereunder.

(c) In view of the fact that federal and state securities laws may
impose certain restrictions on the method by which a sale of the Collateral may
be effected after an Event of Default, the Company agrees that upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and subject to the
standstill agreement in favor of the Pledge Senior Lenders, the Trustee may,
from time to time, attempt to sell all or any part of the Collateral by means of
a private placement, restricting the prospective purchasers to those who will
represent and agree that they are purchasing for investment only and not for
distribution. In so doing, the Trustee may solicit offers to buy the
Collateral, or any part of it,

121
<PAGE>

for cash, from a limited number of investors who might be interested in
purchasing the Collateral. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any such
private sale may result in prices and terms less favorable than if such sale
were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such
private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable
manner. Each Pledgor waives any claims against the Trustee by reason of the
fact that any such sale was at a price less than that which the Trustee could
have otherwise received even if the Trustee accepts its first offer and even if
the Trustee solicits an offer only to one person. The Trustee shall be under no
obligation to delay a sale of any of the Collateral for the period of time
necessary to permit the Pledgor to cause the Pledged Subsidiary to register such
securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state
securities laws, even if the Pledgor could cause the Pledged Subsidiary to do
so.

(d) Each Pledgor further agrees to use its best efforts to do or
cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or
sales of all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to this Section 12.9
valid and binding and in compliance with any and all other applicable
requirements of law. Each Pledgor further agrees that a breach of any of the
covenants contained in this Section 12.9 will cause irreparable injury to the
Trustee and the Holders, that the Trustee and the Holders have no adequate
remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and
every covenant contained in this Section 12.9 shall be specifically enforceable
against such Pledgor.

(e) The proceeds of any sale or other disposition of all or any part
of the Collateral by the Trustee shall be applied in the following order:

(1) to the payment in full of the costs and expenses of such sale
or sales, collections and the protection and enforcement of any security
interest granted hereunder, including the reasonable compensation of the
Trustee's attorneys and agents;

(2) to the payment in full of the Obligations; and

122
<PAGE>

(3) to the payment to the Company or its designee of any surplus
then remaining from such proceeds, subject to the rights of any holder of a
Lien on the Collateral of which the Trustee has actual notice.

In the event that the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of Collateral
are insufficient to pay in full the Obligations, plus costs and expenses of the
sale or other disposition, each Obligor shall remain liable for any deficiency.

(f) The exercise of the Trustee's rights under this Section 12.9 are
subject to the standstill agreement in favor of the Pledge Senior Lenders
pursuant to Section 12.1.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN

GUARANTY

SECTION 13.1 Guaranty.
-------- 

(a) For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the Guarantors, jointly and severally,
hereby unconditionally guarantees (such guarantees being the "Guaranty") to each
Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the
Trustee, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the
Securities or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the
Securities, that: (i) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
Securities, and any other amounts owing by the Company in connection therewith,
will be paid in full when due, whether at maturity or on an interest payment
date, by acceleration, call for redemption, upon a Change of Control Offer,
Asset Sale Offer to Purchase, Net Worth Offer, purchase or otherwise, and
interest on the overdue principal and interest, if any, of the Securities, if
lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee
under this Indenture and the Securities will be promptly paid in full or
performed, all in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the
Securities; and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of
any Securities or any of such other obligations, they will be paid in full when

or renewal, whether at maturity, by acceleration, call for redemption, upon a
Change of Control Offer, Asset Sale Offer to Purchase, Net Worth Offer, purchase
or otherwise.

Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever
reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same
before failure so to pay becomes an Event of Default.

(b) Each Guarantor agrees that (i) its obligations with regard to
this Guaranty shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity
or enforceability of the Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action
to enforce the same, any delays in obtaining or realizing upon (or failures to
obtain or realize upon) collateral, the recovery of any judgment against the
Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances that might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor
and (ii) this Guaranty will not be discharged as to any Security except by
payment in full of the principal thereof, premium, if any, and interest thereon
and as provided in Section 13.3 and 13.5. Each of the Guarantors hereby waives
diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the
event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a
proceeding first against the Company or right to require the prior disposition
of the assets of the Company to meet its obligations, protest, notice and all
demands whatsoever and covenants that this Guaranty will not be discharged
except as provided in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence.

(c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or
otherwise to return to either the Company or any Guarantor, or any Custodian,
Trustee, or similar official acting in relation to either the Company or any
Guarantor, any amount paid by either the Company or any of the Guarantors to the
Trustee or such Holder, this Guaranty, to the extent theretofore discharged,
shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each of the Guarantors agrees that
it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders
in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby.

(d) Each of the Guarantors agrees that (i) the maturity of the
obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 6.2 for
the pur-

124
<PAGE>

poses of this Guaranty, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such acceleration as to the Company of the obligations
guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of
those obligations as provided in Section 6.2, those obligations (whether or not
due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by each of the Guarantors
for the purpose of this Guaranty.

SECTION 13.2 Execution and Delivery of Guaranty.
---------------------------------- 

To evidence its Guaranty set forth in Section 13.1, each of the
Guarantors agrees that a notation of such Guaranty substantially in the form
annexed hereto as Exhibit B shall be endorsed on each Security authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of
such Guarantor by two Officers or an Officer and an Assistant Secretary.

Each of the Guarantors agrees that its Guaranty set forth in Section
13.1 shall remain in full force and effect and apply to all the Securities
notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Security a notation of such
Guaranty.

If an Officer whose facsimile signature is on a Security no longer
holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security on which a
Guaranty is endorsed, the Guaranty shall be valid nevertheless.

The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication
thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Guaranty set forth in
this Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.

SECTION 13.3 Guarantors May Consolidate, Etc., on Certain Terms.
-------------------------------------------------- 

(a) Except as set forth in Article Five, nothing contained in this
Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation or merger
of a Guarantor with or into the Company or shall prevent any sale or conveyance
of the property of a Guarantor, as an entirety or substantially as an entirety,
to the Company or another Guarantor. Upon any such consolidation, merger, sale
or conveyance, the Guaranty given by such Guarantor shall no longer have any
force or effect.

125
<PAGE>

(b) Except as set forth in Article Five and in Section 4.10, nothing
contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent any
consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into a corporation or corporation
other than the Company, or successive such consolidations or mergers in which a
Guarantor or its successor or successors shall be a party or parties, or shall
prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, to a corporation other than the Company authorized
to acquire and operate the same; provided, however, and each Guarantor hereby
-------- ------- 
covenants and agrees, that, except as provided in Section 13.13(a) or 13.15,
upon any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, the Guaranty endorsed
on the Securities, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of
the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by such
Guarantor, shall be expressly assumed (in the event that the Guarantor is not
the surviving corporation in the merger), by supplemental indenture satisfactory
in form to the Trustee, executed and delivered to the Trustee, by the
corporation formed by such consolidation, or into which the Guarantor shall have
been merged, or by the corporation which shall have acquired such property. In
addition, the Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation or
transfer and such supplemental indenture comply with this Section 13.3(b) and
that all conditions precedent herein provided relating to such transaction have
been complied with. In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or
conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the
Trustee, of the Guaranty endorsed upon the Securities and the due and punctual
performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be
performed by the Guarantor, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be
substituted for the Guarantor, with the same effect as if it had been named
herein as a Guarantor. Such successor corporation thereupon shall cause to be
signed any or all of the Guaranties to be endorsed upon all of the Securities
issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company
and delivered to the Trustee. All the Guaranties so issued shall in all
respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the
Guaranties theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of
this

126
<PAGE>

Indenture as though all of such Guaranties had been issued at the date of the
execution hereof.

SECTION 13.4 Contribution.
------------ 

In order to provide for just and equitable contribution among
Guarantors, the Guarantors, no later than the Issue Date, will enter into a
Contribution Agreement dated as of the Issue Date, providing that such
Guarantors agree, inter se, that in the event any payment or distribution is
----- -- 
made by such Guarantor (a "Funding Guarantor") under this Guaranty, that Funding
Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from all other Guarantors for all
payments, damages and expenses incurred by that Funding Guarantor in discharging
the Company's obligations with respect to the Securities as set forth in such
Contribution Agreement.

SECTION 13.5 Release of Guarantors.

by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company to an entity which is not an
Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and which sale or
disposition is otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture
(including Section 4.14), that Guarantor shall be deemed released from all
obligations under this Article Thirteen and the notation on the Securities
evidencing the Guaranty without any further action required on the part of the
Trustee or any Holder. At the request of the Company, however, the Trustee
shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release. 
Any Guarantor not so released remains liable for all amounts owing on the
Securities as provided in this Article Thirteen.

11-1/8% SENIOR NOTE
DUE 2003

1. Interest.
-------- 

M.D.C. Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), promises
to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at a rate of 11-1/8% per
annum. To the extent it is lawful, the Company promises to pay interest on any
interest payment due but unpaid on such principal amount at a rate of 11-1/8%
per annum compounded semi-annually.

The Company will pay interest semi-annually on December 15 and June 15
of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing June 15, 1994. 
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or from the
most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided
for, provided that, if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest
-------- 
and if this Note is authenticated between a record date referred to on the face
hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from
such Interest Payment Date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

2. Method of Payment.
----------------- 

The Company shall pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest)
to the persons in whose names such Notes are registered at the close of business
on December 1 or June 1 preceding such Interest Payment Date. Holders must
surrender Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. Except as
provided below, the Company shall pay principal and interest in such coin or
currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be
legal tender for payment of public and private debts ("U.S. Legal Tender"). At
the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to
the Holders of the Notes at the addresses set forth upon the registry books of
the Company. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or

A-4
<PAGE>

other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

3. Paying Agent and Registrar.
-------------------------- 

Initially, First Bank National Association (the "Trustee") will act as
Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change any Paying Agent or
Registrar without notice. Subject to limitations under certain circumstances,
the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Registrar
or co-Registrar.

4. Indenture.
--------- 

The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture, dated as of December
15, 1993 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantors and Pledgors named
on the signature pages therein and the Trustee. Capitalized terms herein are
used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise defined herein. The terms of
the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act, as in effect on the date of
the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders of Notes
are referred to the Indenture and said Act for a statement of them. The Notes
are general obligations of the Company limited in aggregate principal amount to
$190,000,000.

5. Redemption.
---------- 

The Notes may not be redeemed before December 15, 1998. The Notes may
be redeemed in whole or from time to time in part at any time on and after
December 15, 1998, at the option of the Company, at the Redemption Price
(expressed as a percentage of principal amount) set forth below with respect to
the indicated Redemption Date, in each case, together with any accrued but

</TABLE> 

A-5
<PAGE>

In the case of a partial redemption, the Trustee shall select the Notes
or portions thereof for redemption on a pro rata basis by lot or in such other
-------- 
manner as it deems appropriate and fair. The Notes may be redeemed in part only
in multiples of $1,000 of principal amount.

Any such redemption will comply with Article Three of the Indenture.

6. Notice of Redemption.
-------------------- 

Notice of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 15 days
and not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to
be redeemed at his address then shown upon the books of the registrar. Notes in
denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part. Any notice that
relates to a Note to be redeemed in part only must state the portion of the
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof and must state that on
and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Note, a new Note
or Notes in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be
issued.

Except as set forth in the Indenture, from and after any Redemption
Date, if monies for the redemption of the Notes called for redemption shall have
been deposited with the Paying Agent on or before such Redemption Date, the
Notes called for redemption will cease to accrue interest and the only right of
the Holders of such Notes will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price and
any accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.

7. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.

The Notes are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of
$1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may register the transfer of,
or exchange Notes in accordance with, the Indenture. The Registrar may require
a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the
Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any
Notes selected for redemption.

A-6
<PAGE>

8. Persons Deemed Owners.
--------------------- 

The registered Holder of a Note may be treated as the owner of it for
all purposes.

9. Unclaimed Money.
--------------- 

If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for
two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent(s) will pay the money back to the
Company at its written request. After that, all liability of the Trustee and
such Paying Agent(s) with respect to such money shall cease.

10. Discharge Prior to Redemption or Maturity.
----------------------------------------- 

If the Company at any time deposits into an irrevocable trust with the
Trustee U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay the
principal of and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity and complies
with the other provisions of the Indenture relating thereto, the Company will be
discharged from certain provisions of the Indenture and the Notes (including the
financial covenants, but excluding, among other things, its obligation to pay
the principal of and interest on the Notes).

11. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver.
----------------------------- 

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended
or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and any existing
Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision may be waived with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding. Without notice to or consent of any Holder, the parties
thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes to, among other
things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, or make any other change
that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of a Note.

12. Restrictive Covenants.

The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional Indebtedness, make
payments in respect of its Capital Stock, enter into trans-

A-7

respect to certain asset sales, change the nature of its business, limitation on
the ability of the Company to merge or consolidate with any other Person and
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its
properties or assets. The limitations are subject to many important
qualifications and exceptions. The Company must annually report to the Trustee
on compliance with such limitations.

13. Change of Control.
----------------- 

In the event that a Change of Control (as defined in Section 4.16 of the
Indenture) has occurred, each Holder will have the right, at such Holder's
option, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, to
require the Company to repurchase in the manner specified in the Indenture, all
or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of such Holder's Notes.

14. Successors.
---------- 

When a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under
the Notes, the Guaranties and the Indenture, the predecessor will be released
from those obligations.

15. Defaults and Remedies.
--------------------- 

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of
Default specified in Sections 6.1(4) and (5) of the Indenture), then in every
such case, unless the principal of all of the Notes shall have already become
due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding, by notice in writing to the Company (and
to the Trustee if given by Holders) (an "Acceleration Notice"), may declare all
principal, determined as set forth below, including in each case accrued
interest thereon, or, as appropriate, the Change of Control Purchase Price to be
due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(4)
or (5) of the Indenture, relating to the Company or any of its Material
Subsidiaries occurs, all principal and accrued interest thereon will be
immediately due and payable on all outstanding Notes without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or the Holders. Subject to certain
conditions being met, the Holders of no less than a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the

A-8
<PAGE>

Notes then outstanding generally are authorized to rescind such acceleration if
all existing Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes which have become due solely by such
acceleration, have been cured or waived. Holders may not enforce the Indenture,
the Notes or the Guaranties, except as provided in the Indenture.

16. No Recourse Against Others.
-------------------------- 

No stockholder, director, officer, employee or incorporator, as such,
past, present or future, of any Obligor or its Subsidiaries or any successor
corporation shall have any liability for any obligation of any Obligor under the
Notes, the Guaranties or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of
or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of a Note, by
accepting a Note, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.

17. Authentication.
-------------- 

This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee or authenticating agent
signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.

DUE 2003

1. Interest.
-------- 

M.D.C. Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), promises
to pay interest on the principal amount of this Series B Note at a rate of
11-1/8% per annum. To the extent it is lawful, the Company promises to pay
interest on any interest payment due but unpaid on such principal amount at a
rate of 11-1/8% per annum compounded semi-annually.

The Company will pay interest semi-annually on December 15 and June 15
of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on the Interest
Payment Date following the original issuance of the Series B Notes. Interest on
the Series B Notes will accrue from the later of the date of original issuance
or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or
provided for on the Original Notes cancelled in exchange for the Series B Notes
or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or
provided for, provided that if there is no existing Default in the payment of
-------- 
interest and if this Note is authenticated between a record date referred to on
the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall
accrue from such Interest Payment Date. Interest will be computed on the basis
of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

2. Method of Payment.
----------------- 

The Company shall pay interest on the Series B Notes (except defaulted
interest) to the persons in whose names such Series B Notes are registered at
the close of business on December 1 or June 1 preceding such Interest Payment
Date. Holders must surrender Series B Notes to a Paying Agent to collect
principal payments. Except as provided below, the Company shall pay principal
and interest in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the
time of payment shall be legal tender for payment of public and private debts
("U.S. Legal Tender"). At the option of the Company, payment of interest may be
made by check mailed to the Holders of the Series B Notes at the addresses set
forth upon the

A-16
<PAGE>

registry books of the Company. No service charge will be made for any
registration of transfer or exchange of Series B Notes, but the Company may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge payable in connection therewith.

3. Paying Agent and Registrar.
-------------------------- 

Initially, First Bank National Association (the "Trustee") will act as
Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change any Paying Agent or
Registrar without notice. Subject to limitations under certain circumstances,
the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Registrar
or co-Registrar.

4. Indenture.
--------- 

The Company issued the Series B Notes under an Indenture, dated as of
December 15, 1993 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantors and
Pledgors named on the signature pages therein and the Trustee. Capitalized terms
herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise defined herein. 
The terms of the Series B Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those
made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act, as in effect
on the date of the Indenture. The Series B Notes are subject to all such terms,
and Holders of Series B Notes are referred to the Indenture and said Act for a
statement of them. The Series B Notes are general obligations of the Company
limited in aggregate principal amount to $190,000,000.

5. Redemption.

Series B Notes may be redeemed in whole or from time to time in part at any time
on and after December 15, 1998, at the option of the Company, at the Redemption

</TABLE> 

In the case of a partial redemption, the Trustee shall select the Series
B Notes or portions thereof for redemption on a pro rata basis by lot or in such
--- ---- 
other manner as it deems appropriate and fair. The Series B Notes may be
redeemed in part only in multiples of $1,000 of principal amount.

Any such redemption will comply with Article Three of the Indenture.

6. Notice of Redemption.
-------------------- 

Notice of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 15 days
and not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Series B
Notes to be redeemed at his address then shown upon the books of the registrar. 
Series B Notes in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part. Any
notice that relates to a Series B Note to be redeemed in part only must state
the portion of the principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof and
must state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of
such Series B Note, a new Series B Note or Series B Notes in a principal amount
equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.

Except as set forth in the Indenture, from and after any Redemption
Date, if monies for the redemption of the Series B Notes called for redemption
shall have been deposited with the Paying Agent on or before such Redemption
Date, the Series B Notes called for redemption will cease to accrue interest and
the only right of the Holders of such Series B Notes will be to receive payment
of the Redemption Price and any accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption
Date.

A-18
<PAGE>

7. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.
--------------------------------- 

The Series B Notes are in registered form, without coupons, in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may register
the transfer of, or exchange Series B Notes in accordance with, the Indenture. 
The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by
law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer
of or exchange any Series B Notes selected for redemption.

8. Persons Deemed Owners.
--------------------- 

The registered Holder of a Series B Note may be treated as the owner
of it for all purposes.

9. Unclaimed Money.
--------------- 

If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for
two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent(s) will pay the money back to the
Company at its written request. After that, all liability of the Trustee and
such Paying Agent(s) with respect to such money shall cease.

10. Discharge Prior to Redemption or Maturity.
----------------------------------------- 

If the Company at any time deposits into an irrevocable trust with the
Trustee U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay the
principal of and interest on the Series B Notes to redemption or maturity and
complies with the other provisions of the Indenture relating thereto, the
Company will be discharged from certain provisions of the Indenture and the
Series B Notes (including the financial covenants, but excluding, among other
things, its obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Series B
Notes).

11. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver.
----------------------------- 

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Series B Notes may
be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Series B Notes then outstanding,
and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision
may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate
princi-

A-19
<PAGE>

pal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Without notice to or consent of any
Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Series
B Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, or
make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of
a Series B Note.

12. Restrictive Covenants.
--------------------- 

The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional Indebtedness, make
payments in respect of its Capital Stock, enter into transactions with
Affiliates, make Investments, incur Liens, use of proceeds with respect to
certain asset sales, change the nature of its business, limitation on the
ability of the Company to merge or consolidate with any other Person and sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its properties or
assets. The limitations are subject to many important qualifications and
exceptions. The Company must annually report to the Trustee on compliance with
such limitations.

13. Change of Control.
----------------- 

In the event that a Change of Control (as defined in Section 4.16 of the
Indenture) has occurred, each Holder will have the right, at such Holder's
option, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, to
require the Company to repurchase in the manner specified in the Indenture, all
or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of such Holder's Series B Notes.

14. Successors.
---------- 

When a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under
the Series B Notes, the Guaranties and the Indenture, the predecessor will be
released from those obligations.

15. Defaults and Remedies.
--------------------- 

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of
Default specified in Section 6.1(4) or (5) of the Indenture), then in every such
case, unless the principal of all of the Series B Notes shall have already
become due and payable, either the Trustee

A-20
<PAGE>

or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Series B Notes then
outstanding, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by
Holders) (an "Acceleration Notice"), may declare all principal, determined as
set forth below, including in each case accrued interest thereon, or, as
appropriate, the Change of Control Purchase Price to be due and payable
immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(4) or (5) of the
Indenture relating to the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries occurs,
all principal and accrued interest thereon will be immediately due and payable
on all outstanding Series B Notes without any declaration or other act on the
part of the Trustee or the Holders. Subject to certain conditions being met,
the Holders of no less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Series B Notes then outstanding generally are authorized to rescind such
acceleration if all existing Events of Default, other than the non-payment of
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Series B Notes which have
become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived. Holders may
not enforce the Indenture, the Series B Notes or the Guaranties, except as
provided in the Indenture.

16. No Recourse Against Others.
-------------------------- 

No stockholder, director, officer, employee or incorporator, as such,
past, present or future, of any Obligor or its Subsidiaries or any successor
corporation shall have any liability for any obligation of any Obligor under the
Series B Notes, the Guaranties or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in
respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of
a Series B Note, by accepting a Series B Note, waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the
issuance of the Series B Notes.

17. Authentication.
-------------- 

This Series B Note shall not be valid until the Trustee or
authenticating agent signs the certificate of authentication on the other side
of this Series B Note.

18. Abbreviations and Defined Terms.
------------------------------- 

Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a Series
B Note or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (=
tenants by the

A-21

entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as

THE SECURITIES

SECTION 2.1 Form and Dating.
--------------- 

The Notes and the Trustee's certificate of authentication, in
respect thereof, shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto. 
The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law,
stock exchange rule or usage. The Company shall approve the form of the
Securities and any notation, legend or endorsement on them. Any such
notations, legends or endorsements not contained in the form of Note
attached as Exhibit A hereto shall be delivered in writing to the Trustee. 
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

The terms and provisions contained in the form of Securities shall
constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture and, to
the extent applicable, the Company and the Trustee, by their execution and
delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and provisions
and to be bound thereby.

SECTION 2.2 Execution and Authentication.
---------------------------- 

Two Officers shall sign, or one Officer shall sign and one Officer
shall attest to, the Notes for the Company by manual or facsimile
signature. The Company's seal shall be impressed, affixed, imprinted or
reproduced on the Notes and may be in facsimile form.

If an Officer whose signature is on a Note was an Officer at the
time of such execution but no longer holds that office at the time the
Trustee authenticates the Note, the Note shall be valid nevertheless and
the Company shall nevertheless be bound by the terms of the Notes and this
Indenture.

A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the
Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security
but such signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been
authenticated pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.

The Trustee shall authenticate Securities for original issue in the
aggregate principal amount of up to

16
<PAGE>

$50,000,000 upon a written order of the Company in the form of an Officers'
Certificate. The Officers' Certificate shall specify the amount of
Securities to be authenticated and the date on which the Securities are to
be authenticated. The aggregate principal amount of Securities outstanding
at any time may not exceed $50,000,000, except as provided in Section 2.7. 
Upon the written order of the Company in the form of an Officers'
Certificate, the Trustee shall authenticate Securities in substitution of
Securities originally issued to reflect any name change of the Company.

The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the
Company to authenticate Securities. Unless otherwise provided in the
appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever
the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication
by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating
agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with any Obligor, any
Affiliate of any Obligor, or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

Securities shall be issuable only in registered form without
coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.

SECTION 2.3 Registrar, Paying Agent and Conversion Agent.
-------------------------------------------- 

The Company shall maintain an office or agency in New York, New
York, where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for
exchange ("Registrar"), an office or agency where Securities may be
presented for payment ("Paying Agent") and where notices and demands to or
upon the Company in respect of the Notes may be served and an office or
agency where Securities may be presented for conversion ("Conversion
Agent"). The Company may act as its own Registrar, Paying Agent or
Conversion Agent, except that, for the purposes of Articles Three and
Eight, and Sections 2.11 and 4.10, none of the Company nor any Affiliate of
the Company shall act as Paying Agent. The Registrar shall keep a register
of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have
one or more co-Registrars, one or more additional Paying Agents and one or
more additional Conversion Agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any
additional Paying Agent; the term "Conversion Agent" includes any
additional Conversion Agent. The Company hereby initially appoints the
Trustee

17
<PAGE>

as Registrar, Paying Agent and Conversion Agent, and the Trustee hereby
initially agrees so to act.

The Company shall enter into an appropriate written agency
agreement with any Agent not a party to this Indenture, which agreement
shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent.
The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of the name and
address of any such Agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar,
Paying Agent or Conversion Agent, the Trustee shall act as such.

SECTION 2.4 Paying Agent to Hold Assets in Trust.
------------------------------------ 

The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee
to agree in writing that each Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the
benefit of Holders or the Trustee all assets held by the Paying Agent for
the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the
Securities (whether such assets have been distributed to it by the
Company), and shall notify the Trustee in writing of any Default in making
any such payment. If the Company acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate
such assets and hold them as a separate trust fund for the benefit of the
Holders or the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent
to distribute all assets held by it to the Trustee and account for any
assets disbursed and the Trustee may at any time during the continuance of
any payment Default, upon written request to a Paying Agent, require such
Paying Agent to distribute all assets held by it to the Trustee and to
account for any assets distributed. Upon distribution to the Trustee of
all assets that shall have been delivered by the Company to the Paying
Agent, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company) shall have no further
liability for such assets.

SECTION 2.5 Securityholder Lists.
-------------------- 

The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably
practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses
of Holders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish
to the Trustee on or before the tenth Business Day preceding each Interest
Payment Date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing
a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee reasonably may
require of the names and addresses of Holders.

18
<PAGE>

SECTION 2.6 Transfer and Exchange.
--------------------- 

When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-Registrar
with a request to register the transfer of such Securities or to exchange
such Securities for an equal principal amount of Securities of other
authorized denominations, the Registrar or co-Registrar shall register the
transfer or make the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements
for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Securities
-------- ------- 
surrendered for transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied
by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and the Registrar or co-Registrar, duly executed by the Holder
thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. To permit
registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the
Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's or co-Registrar's
request. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any transfer tax, assessments, or similar governmental charge payable
in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes, assessments,
or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges or transfers pursuant
to Section 2.2, 2.10, 3.7, 9.5, or 4.10). The Registrar or co-Registrar
shall not be required to register the transfer of or exchange of (a) any
Security selected for redemption in whole or in part pursuant to Article
Three, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in
part, or (b) any Security for a period beginning 15 Business Days before
the mailing of a notice of an offer to repurchase pursuant to Section 4.10
hereof or redeem Securities pursuant to Article 3 hereof and ending at the
close of business on the day of such mailing.

SECTION 2.7 Replacement Securities.
---------------------- 

If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee or if the
Holder of a Security claims and submits an affidavit or other evidence,
satisfactory to the Trustee, to the Trustee to the effect that the Security
has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and
the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the Trustee's
requirements are met. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such
Holder must provide an indemnity bond or other indemnity, sufficient in the
judgment of both the Company and the Trustee, to protect the Company, the
Trustee or any Agent from any

19
<PAGE>

loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company
may charge such Holder for its reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses in
replacing a Security.

Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the
Company.

SECTION 2.8 Outstanding Securities.
---------------------- 

Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities that have
been authenticated by the Trustee except those cancelled by it, those
delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.8 as
not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the
Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security, except as
provided in Section 2.9.

If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.7 (other than a
mutilated Security surrendered for replacement), it ceases to be
outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the
replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser. A mutilated Security
---- ---- 
ceases to be outstanding upon surrender of such Security and replacement
thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.

If on a Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity the Paying Agent
(other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds U.S. Legal
Tender or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay all of the
principal and interest due on the Securities payable on that date and
payment of the Securities called for redemption is not otherwise prohibited
pursuant to Article Twelve hereof or otherwise, then on and after that date
such Securities cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to
accrue.

SECTION 2.9 Treasury Securities.
------------------- 

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount
of Securities have concurred in any direction, amendment, supplement,
waiver or consent, Securities owned by the Company and Affiliates of the
Company shall be disregarded, except that, for the purposes of determining
whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction,
amendment, supplement, waiver or consent, only Securities that the

20
<PAGE>

Trustee knows or has reason to know are so owned shall be disregarded.

SECTION 2.10 Temporary Securities.
-------------------- 

Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may
prepare, and the Trustee shall authenticate, temporary Securities. 
Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive
Securities but may have variations that the Company reasonably and in good
faith considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable
delay, at the time that the registration statement pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement becomes effective, the Company shall prepare
and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities in exchange for
temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities shall
in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as
permanent Securities authenticated and delivered hereunder.

SECTION 2.11 Cancellation.
------------ 

The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for
cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the
Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange or
payment. The Trustee, or at the direction of the Trustee, the Registrar or
the Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company),
and no one else, shall cancel and, at the written direction of the Company,
shall dispose of all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment
or cancellation. Subject to Section 2.7, the Company may not issue new
Securities to replace Securities it has paid or delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in
exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section 2.11,
except as expressly permitted in the form of Securities and as permitted by
this Indenture.

SECTION 2.12 Defaulted Interest.
------------------ 

Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid
or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the
person in whose name that Security (or one or more predecessor Securities)
is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such
interest.

21
<PAGE>

Any interest on any Security which is payable, but is not
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date plus, to
the extent lawful, any interest payable on the defaulted interest (herein
called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
registered holder on the relevant Record Date by virtue of having been such
Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its
election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any 
Defaulted Interest to the persons in whose names the Securities are
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the
payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the
following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of
the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security
and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company
shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the
aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted
Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when
deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
to such Defaulted Interest as provided in this clause (1). Thereupon
the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such
Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less
than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less
than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the
proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of
such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the
Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted
Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class
postage prepaid, to each Holder at his address as it appears in the
security register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record
Date. The Trustee may, in its discretion, in the name and at the
expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least
once in a newspaper, customarily published in the English language on
each

22
<PAGE>

Business Day and of general circulation in New York, New York, but such
publication shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of
such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such 
Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been
mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the
persons in whose names the Securities (or their respective predecessor
Securities) are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no
longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted 
Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the 
requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be
listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if,
after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed
payment pursuant to this clause, such manner shall be deemed
practicable by the Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12, each 
Security delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or
in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and
unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

SECTION 2.13 Legending of the Securities; Restrictions on Transfers.
------------------------------------------------------ 

Until such time as the same is no longer a Restricted Security, each
certificate evidencing the Securities (and all Securities issued in exchange
therefor or substitution thereof) shall bear a legend in substantially the form
set forth on the form of Note set forth as Exhibit A hereto. Prior to any
transfer or exchange of a legended Security for another Security, the Company
shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee directing it to transfer
or exchange such Security for another legended or unlegended Security, subject
to compliance with any transfer restrictions.

SECTION 3.1 Right of Redemption.
------------------- 

Redemption of Securities, as permitted or required by any provision of
this Indenture, shall be made in accordance with such provision and this Article

If the Company elects to redeem Securities pursuant to Paragraph 5 of
the Securities, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the Redemption Date
and the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed and whether it wants the
Trustee to give notice of redemption to the Holders.

If the Company elects to credit the principal amount of Securities to be
redeemed pursuant to Paragraph 5 of the Securities by crediting against any such
redemption Securities it has not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, it shall so notify the Trustee and deliver such Securities with
such notice.

The Company shall give each notice to the Trustee provided for in this
Section 3.2 at least 45 days before the Redemption Date (unless a shorter notice
shall be satisfactory to the Trustee).

SECTION 3.3 Selection of Securities To Be Redeemed 
--------------------------------------

If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed pursuant to
Paragraph 5 thereof, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed pro
---
rata or by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall determine to be fair
- ---- 
and appropriate and in such manner as complies with any applicable legal and
stock exchange requirements.

24
<PAGE>

The Trustee shall make the selection from the Securities outstanding and
not previously called for redemption and shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any
Security selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed. Securities in denominations of $1,000 may be redeemed only in whole.
The Trustee may select for redemption portions (equal to $1,000 or any integral
multiple thereof) of the principal of Securities that have denominations larger
than $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for
redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption.

SECTION 3.4 Notice of Redemption.
-------------------- 

At least 15 days and not more than 60 days before a Redemption Date, the
Company shall mail a notice of redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid,
to the Trustee and each Holder, at such Holder's last address as then shown upon
the books of the registrar, whose Securities are to be redeemed. At the
Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the
Company's name and at the Company's expense. Each notice for redemption shall
identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date;

(2) the Redemption Price, including the amount of accrued
and unpaid interest to be paid upon such redemption;

(3) the conversion price;

(4) the name, address and telephone number of the Paying
Agent and Conversion Agent;

(5) that Securities called for redemption must be
surrendered to the Paying Agent at the address specified
in such notice to collect the Redemption Price;

(6) that, unless (a) the Company defaults in its obligation
to deposit U.S. Legal Tender with the Paying Agent in
accordance with Section 3.6 hereof or (b) such
redemption payment is prohibited pursuant to

25
<PAGE>

Article Twelve hereof or otherwise, interest on
Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and
after the Redemption Date and the only remaining right
of the Holders of such Securities is to receive payment
of the Redemption Price, including accrued and unpaid
interest to the Redemption Date, upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of the Securities called for redemption and
to be redeemed;

(7) if any Security is being redeemed in part, the portion
of the principal amount, equal to $1,000 or any integral
multiple thereof, of such Security equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof and that, on and after the
Redemption Date, and upon surrender of such Security, a
new Security or Securities in aggregate principal amount
equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued;

(8) if less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the

Securities;

(11) the CUSIP number of the Securities to be redeemed; and

(12) that the notice is being sent pursuant to this Section
3.4 and pursuant to the optional redemption provisions
of Paragraph 5 of the Securities.

26
<PAGE>

SECTION 3.5 Effect of Notice of Redemption.
------------------------------ 

Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.4,
Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date
and at the Redemption Price, including accrued and unpaid interest to the
Redemption Date. Upon surrender to the Trustee or Paying Agent, such Securities
called for redemption shall be paid at the Redemption Price, including interest,
if any, accrued and unpaid on the Redemption Date; provided that if the
-------- 
Redemption Date is after a regular Record Date and on or prior to the Interest
Payment Date, the accrued interest shall be payable to the Holder of the
redeemed Securities registered on the relevant Record Date; and provided,
-------- 
further, that if a Redemption Date is a Legal Holiday, payment shall be made on
- ------- 
the next succeeding Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the period
from such Redemption Date to such succeeding Business Day.

SECTION 3.6 Deposit of Redemption Price.
--------------------------- 

On or prior to the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the
Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) U.S. Legal
Tender sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, including accrued and unpaid
interest to the Redemption Date on, all Securities to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date (other than Securities or portions thereof called for redemption
on that date that have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for
cancellation). The Paying Agent shall promptly return to the Company any U.S.
Legal Tender so deposited which is not required for that purpose upon the
written request of the Company.

If the Company complies with the preceding paragraph and the other
provisions of this Article Three and payment of the Securities called for
redemption is not prohibited under Article Twelve or otherwise, interest on the
Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the applicable Redemption
Date, whether or not such Securities are presented for payment. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if any Security surrendered for redemption in
the manner provided in the Securities shall not be so paid upon surrender for
redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding
paragraph, interest shall continue to accrue and be paid from the Redemption
Date until such payment is made on the unpaid principal, and, to the extent

27
<PAGE>

lawful, on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the
rate and in the manner provided in Section 4.1 hereof and the Securities.

SECTION 3.7 Securities Redeemed in Part.
--------------------------- 

Upon surrender of a Security that is to be redeemed in part, the Company
shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder,
without service charge, a new Security or Securities equal in principal amount
to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.

SECTION 3.8 Conversion Arrangements on Call for Redemption.
---------------------------------------------- 

In connection with any redemption of Securities, the Company may (but
shall not be obligated to) arrange for the purchase and conversion of any
Securities by an agreement with one or more investment bankers or other
purchasers to purchase any or all of such Securities by paying to Holders, or to
the Trustee or a Paying Agent in trust for the Holders, on or before the close
of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date an
amount not less than the Redemption Price. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Article Three, the obligation of the Company to pay
the Redemption Price shall be satisfied and discharged to the extent such amount
is so paid by such purchasers. Pursuant to such an agreement, any Securities
tendered by the Holder thereof for redemption or not duly surrendered for
conversion or redemption by the Holder thereof shall be deemed acquired by such
purchasers from such Holders and surrendered by such purchasers for conversion,
all as of immediately prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior
to the Redemption Date, subject to payment of the above amount as aforesaid.

office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof,
such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
address of the Trustee set forth in Section 13.2.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other
offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for any
or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations;
provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner
- -------- ------- 
relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in New
York, New York, for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice
to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the
location of any such other office or agency. The Company hereby initially

rights (charter and statutory) and corporate franchises of the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required
-------- ------- 
to preserve, with respect to itself, any right or franchise, and with respect to
any of its Subsidiaries, any such existence, right or franchise, if the Board of

judgment may be necessary, so that the business carried on in connection
therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided,
-------- 
however, that nothing in this Section 4.5 shall prevent the Company from
- ------- 
discontinuing any operation or maintenance of any of such properties, or
disposing of any of them, if such discontinuance or disposal is (a), in the
judgment of the Company desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company
and (b) not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

The Company shall provide, or cause to be provided, for itself and each
of its Subsidiaries that is not an Unrestricted Subsidiary, insurance (including
appropriate self-insurance) against loss or damage of the kinds that, in the
reasonable, good faith opinion of the Company are adequate and appropriate for

Subsidiaries during the preceding fiscal year has been made under the
supervision of the signing Officers with a view to determining whether the

describe such failure with particularity. The Officers' Certificate shall also

----------- 

The Company shall deliver to the Trustee and each Holder, within 15 days
after it files the same with the SEC, copies of all reports and information (or

required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act or pursuant to the immediately following sentence. So long as any

Holder, within 15 days after it would have been required to file such

other law which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any
portion of the principal of or interest on the Securities as contemplated
herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may
affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent
that it may lawfully do so) the Company hereby expressly waives all benefit or
advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or
impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer

SECTION 4.10 Repurchase of Notes at the Option of the Holder Upon a
------------------------------------------------------
Change of Control.
- ----------------- 

(a) In the event that a Change of Control (as defined below) has
occurred, each Holder will have the right, at such Holder's option, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Section 4.10, to require the Company to
repurchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes (provided that the principal
-------- 
amount of such Notes must be $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) on the date
that is no later than 60 Business Days (unless later required by applicable law)
after the occurrence of such Change of Control (the "Change of Control Payment
Date"), at a cash price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any (the "Change of Control Purchase Price"), to
the Change of Control Payment Date.

(b) The Company shall notify the Trustee within 10 Business Days after
the Company knows or reasonably should know as a result of a public filing of
the occurrence of each Change of Control. Within 20 Business Days after the
Company knows or reasonably should know as a result of a public filing of the
occurrence of each Change of Control, the Company will make an unconditional
offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to all Holders of Notes to purchase all of
the Notes at the Change of Control Purchase Price by sending written notice of a
Change of Control Offer, by first class mail, to each Holder at its registered
address, with a copy to the Trustee. The notice to Holders, which shall govern
the terms of the Offer, shall state:

(1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to
this Section 4.10 and that all Securities, or portions thereof, tendered
will be accepted for payment;

(2) the Change of Control Purchase Price (including the amount of
accrued and unpaid interest), the Change of Control Payment Date and the
Final Change of Control Put Date (as defined below);

(3) that any Security, or portion thereof, not tendered or
accepted for payment will continue to accrue interest;

35
<PAGE>

(4) that, unless the Company defaults in depositing U.S. Legal
Tender with the Paying Agent in accordance with the first paragraph of
clause (c) of this Section 4.10, or payment is otherwise prevented, any
Security, or portion thereof, accepted for payment pursuant to the Change
of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control
Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have a Security, or portion thereof,
purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to
surrender the Security, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect
Purchase" on the reverse of the Security completed, to the Paying Agent
(which may not for purposes of this Section 4.10, notwithstanding anything
in this Indenture to the contrary, be the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company) at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of
business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment
Date (the "Final Change of Control Put Date");

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election, in
whole or in part, if the Paying Agent receives, prior to the close of
business on the Final Change of Control Put Date, a telegram, telex,
facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the
principal amount of the Securities the Holder is withdrawing and a
statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such
principal amount of Notes purchased; and

(7) a brief description of the events resulting in such Change of
Control.

(c) On or before the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will
(i) accept for payment Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer, (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent U.S. Legal
Tender sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price (together with
accrued and unpaid interest) of all Notes so tendered and (iii) deliver to the
Trustee Notes so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate identifying the
Notes or portions thereof

36
<PAGE>

being purchased by the Company. The Paying Agent will promptly mail to the
Holders of Notes so accepted payment in an amount equal to the Change of Control
Purchase Price (together with accrued and unpaid interest), and the Trustee will
promptly authenticate and mail or deliver to such Holders a new Note equal in
principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered. Any Notes
not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the
Holder thereof. The Company will announce publicly the results of the Change of
Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment
Date.

"Change of Control" means (i) any sale, transfer or other conveyance
(other than to the Company or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary), whether direct or
indirect, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, on a
consolidated basis, to any "person" or "group" in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, provided that a transaction where the holders of all
classes of Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction
own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the aggregate voting power of all
classes of Voting Stock of such "person" or "group" immediately after such
transaction will not be a Change of Control, or (ii) any "person" or "group,"
other than the Management Group (as defined below) is or becomes the "beneficial
owner," directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of
the Voting Stock then outstanding. The "Management Group" shall consist of at
least a majority of the executive officers of the Company as of the date of the
Indenture as disclosed in the Placement Memorandum, members of their immediate
families, certain trusts for their benefit, and legal representatives of, or
heirs, beneficiaries or legatees receiving Common Stock (or securities
convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock) under any such person's estate.

For the purposes of this definition, (i) the terms "person" and "group"
shall have the meanings used for purposes of Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the
Exchange Act, whether or not applicable; provided that no Excluded Person and no
-------- 
person or group controlled by Excluded Persons shall be deemed to be a "person"
or "group" and (ii) the term "beneficial owner" shall have the meaning used in
Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, whether or not applicable, except
that a person shall be deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of all shares that
any such person has the right to acquire, whether such

37
<PAGE>

right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time or upon the
occurrence of certain events.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.10, the
Company shall not be obligated to make any payment of the Change of Control
Purchase Price unless and until the Company shall have satisfied its
obligations, if any, to make similar payments pursuant to Section 4.l6 of the
Senior Notes Indenture.

all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.

for a period of 45 days after there has been given, by registered or
certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee, or to the Company and the

outstanding Securities, a written notice specifying such default or breach,
requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of
Default" hereunder;

(4) a decree, judgment, or order by a court of competent

Non-Recourse Indebtedness) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
are not Unrestricted Subsidiaries that has an outstanding principal amount
of $5,000,000 or more in the aggregate to be immediately due and payable;
provided that, in the event any such acceleration is withdrawn or otherwise
-------- 
rescinded (including satisfaction of such Indebtedness) within a period of
ten business days after such acceleration by the holders of such
Indebtedness, any Event of Default under this clause (v) will be deemed to
be cured and any acceleration under this Indenture will be deemed withdrawn
or rescinded; and (B) the failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that are not Unrestricted Subsidiaries to make any principal, premium,

(7) one or more final judgments (in the amount not covered by
insurance or not reserved for) or the issuance of any warrant of attachment

Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are not Unrestricted Subsidiaries
by a court of competent jurisdiction and not bonded, satisfied or
discharged for a period (during which execution shall not be effectively
stayed) of (A) 45 days after the judgment (which, if there is more than one
judgment, causes such judgments to exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate)
becomes final and such court shall not have ordered or

<PAGE>

approved, and the parties shall not have agreed upon, the payment of such
judgment at a later date or dates or (B) 45 days after all or any part of
such judgment is payable pursuant to any court order or agreement between
the parties.

If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee,
the Trustee must, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Default, give to
the Holders notice of such Default; provided that, except in the case of a
-------- 
Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes,
including a Default in the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price as
required by this Indenture, the Trustee will be protected in withholding such
notice if it in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in
the interest of the Holders.

SECTION 6.2 Acceleration of Maturity Date; Rescission and Annulment.
------------------------------------------------------- 

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of
Default specified in Section 6.1(4) or (5) of this Article Six, relating to the
Company or its Material Subsidiaries), then in each such case, unless the
principal of all of the Notes shall have already become due and payable, either
the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if
given by the Holders) (an "Acceleration Notice"), may declare all principal,
determined as set forth below, including in each case accrued interest thereon,
or, as appropriate, the Change of Control Purchase Price (solely with respect to
a Default relating to the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price) to be
due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(4)
or (5) occurs, all principal and accrued and unpaid interest thereon will be
immediately due and payable on all outstanding Notes without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or the Holders.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration is made and before
a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the
Trustee as hereinafter provided in this Article Six, the Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Securities, by written notice
to the Company

42
<PAGE>

and the Trustee, may waive, on behalf of all Holders, any such declaration of
acceleration if:

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue interest on all Securities,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, applicable to) any
Securities which would become due otherwise than by such declaration of
acceleration, and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Securities,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest
upon overdue interest at the rate borne by the Securities,

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its
agents and counsel, and

(2) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Securities which have become
due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived
as provided in Section 6.12, including, if applicable, any Event of Default
relating to the covenants contained in Section 4.10.

Notwithstanding the previous sentence of this Section 6.2, no waiver shall be
effective for any Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would be an Event of Default with respect to any covenant or provision
which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each
outstanding Security, unless all such affected Holders agree, in writing, to
waive such Event of Default or event. No such waiver shall cure or waive any
subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 6.3 Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by
-------------------------------------------------------
Trustee.
- ------- 

The Company covenants that if an Event of Default in payment of
principal, premium, or interest

43
<PAGE>

specified in clause (1) or (2) of Section 6.1 occurs and is continuing, the
Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such
Securities for principal, premium (if any) and interest, and, to the extent that
payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue
principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest, at the rate borne
by the Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including compensation
to, and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel.

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the
Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust in favor of the
Holders, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so
due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and
may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the
Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the
manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor
upon the Securities, wherever situated.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its
discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Holders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most
effective to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific
enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

SECTION 6.4 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
-------------------------------- 

In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to the Company upon the Securities or the property
of the Company, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the
Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration
or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand
on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be
entitled and

44
<PAGE>

empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise to take any and all
actions under the TIA, including

(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal
(and premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the
Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary
or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any
claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances
of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such
judicial proceeding, and

(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable
or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the
Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to
pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other
amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition affecting the Securities
or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in
respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

SECTION 6.5 Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of
------------------------------------------------
Securities.
- ---------- 

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities
may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of
the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and
any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name
as trustee of an express trust in favor of the Holders, and any recovery of
judgment shall, after provision for the

45
<PAGE>

payment of compensation to, and expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of
the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.

SECTION 6.6 Priorities.
---------- 

Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Six shall be
applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and,
in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal, premium (if
any) or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon
of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

FIRST: To the Trustee in payment of all amounts due pursuant to
Section 7.7;

SECOND: Subject to Article Twelve, to the Holders in payment of the
amounts then due and unpaid for principal of, premium (if any) and interest on,
the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has
been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according
to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal, premium (if
any) and interest, respectively; and

THIRD: Subject to Article Twelve, to whomever may be lawfully
entitled thereto, the remainder, if any.

SECTION 6.7 Limitation on Suits.
------------------- 

No Holder of any Security shall have any right to order or direct the
Trustee to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this
Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other
remedy hereunder, unless

(A) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee
of a continuing Event of Default;

(B) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of then
outstanding Securities shall have made written request to the Trustee to
institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name
as Trustee hereunder;

46
<PAGE>

(C) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable
security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred or reasonably probable to be incurred in compliance with such
request;

(D) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice,
request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding;
and

(E) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been
given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the outstanding Securities;

it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders shall have any
right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of
this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders,
or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders
or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein
provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders.

SECTION 6.8 Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal,
----------------------------------------------------
Premium and Interest.
- -------------------- 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the Holder of any
Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive
payment of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, such Security
on the Maturity Date of such payment as expressed in such Security (in the case
of redemption, the Redemption Price on the applicable Redemption Date, and in
the case of the Change of Control Purchase Price, on the applicable Change of
Control Payment Date), and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such
payment after such respective dates, and such rights shall not be impaired
without the consent of such Holder.

SECTION 6.9 Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
------------------------------ 

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment
of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in Section 2.7, no right or
remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is
intended to be exclusive of any other

47
<PAGE>

right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The
assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall
not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate
right or remedy.

SECTION 6.10 Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
---------------------------- 

No delay or omission by the Trustee or by any Holder of any Security to
exercise any right or remedy arising upon any Event of Default shall impair the
exercise of any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of
Default. Every right and remedy given by this Article Six or by law to the
Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as
may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

SECTION 6.11 Control by Holders.
------------------ 

The Holder or Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
then outstanding Securities shall have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or
exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, provided that:
-------- 

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law
or with this Indenture,

(2) the Trustee shall not determine that the action so directed
would be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders not taking part in such
direction, and

(3) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

SECTION 6.12 Waiver of Past Default.
---------------------- 

Subject to Section 6.8, the Holder or Holders of not less than a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities may, on
behalf of all Holders, waive any past default hereunder and its consequences,
except a default

48
<PAGE>

(A) in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on, any Security not yet cured, or

(B) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which, under
Article Nine, cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
Holder of each outstanding Security affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event
of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or impair the exercise of any right arising therefrom.

SECTION 6.13 Undertaking for Costs.
--------------------- 

All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by
his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its
discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken by it as Trustee, the filing by any party
litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that
such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to
the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant;
but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the
Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any
Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Securities, or to any suit instituted by any
Holder for enforcement of the payment of principal of, or premium (if any) or
interest on, any Security on or after the respective Maturity Date expressed in
such Security (including, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption
Date).

SECTION 6.14 Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
---------------------------------- 

If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce
any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined

49
<PAGE>

adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every case, subject to
any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders
shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders
shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

Subject to Section 7.1:

inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit.

(f) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or

unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred
therein or thereby.

SECTION 7.3 Individual Rights of Trustee.
---------------------------- 

The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner
or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates with the same rights it would have

the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.

52
<PAGE>

SECTION 7.4 Trustee's Disclaimer.

each Holder notice of such Default, except in the case of a default in payment
of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes, including a default

Indenture. The Trustee will be protected in withholding such notice if it in
good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of
the Holders.

SECTION 7.6 Reports by Trustee to Holders.
----------------------------- 

Within 60 days after each May 15, beginning with the May 15 following

each of its officers, directors, attorneys-in-fact and agents for, and hold it
harmless against, any claim, demand, expense (including but not limited to
reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and
counsel), loss or liability incurred by it without negligence or bad faith on
its part, arising out of or in connection with the administration of this trust

shall notify the Company promptly of any claim asserted against the Trustee for
which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee
shall provide reasonable cooperation at the Company's expense in the defense. 
The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel; provided that the Company will not be

connection with such defense. The Company need not pay for any settlement made
without its written consent. The Company need not reimburse any expense or
indemnify against any loss or liability to the extent incurred by the Trustee
through its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all assets held or
collected by the Trustee, in its capacity as Trustee, except assets held in
trust to pay principal and premium, if any, of or interest on particular
Securities.

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of
Default specified in Section 6.1(4) or (5) occurs, the expenses and the
compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of
administration under any Bankruptcy Law.

The Company's obligations under this Section 7.7 and any lien arising
hereunder shall survive the

54
<PAGE>

resignation or removal of the Trustee, the discharge of the Company's
obligations pursuant to Article Eight of this Indenture and any rejection or
termination of this Indenture under any Bankruptcy Law.

SECTION 7.8 Replacement of Trustee.

The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company in writing. The

(2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;

(3) a receiver, Custodian, or other public officer takes charge of

Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holder or
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may appoint a
successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its
appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Immediately after that
and provided that all sums owing to the Trustee provided for in Section 7.7 have
been paid, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as
Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided in Section 7.7,
the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and
the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the
Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its
succession to each Holder.

55
<PAGE>

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the
retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the
Holder or Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the outstanding
Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
of a successor Trustee.

If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and
the appointment of a successor Trustee.

Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8,
the Company's obligations under Section 7.7 shall continue for the benefit of
the retiring Trustee.

otherwise eligible hereunder, be the successor Trustee.

rights of the Holders under this Indenture or the Securities. Subject to
Section 6.8, the Holder or Holders of not less than a majority in principal
amount of then outstanding Securities may waive compliance by the Company
with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities. Notwithstanding
any of the above, however, no such amendment, supplemental indenture or
waiver shall, without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Note
affected thereby:

(1) reduce the percentage of principal amount of Securities whose
Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver of any provision
of this Indenture or the Securities;

(2) reduce the rate or extend the time for payment of interest on
any Security;

(3) reduce the principal amount of any Security, reduce the Change
of Control Purchase Price, or the Redemption Price;

(4) change the Maturity Date of any Security;

(5) alter the redemption provisions of Article Three or the terms
or provisions of Section 4.10, in any case, in a manner adverse to any
Holder;

(6) make any changes in the provisions concerning waivers of
Defaults or Events of Default by Holders of the Securities (except to
increase any required percentage or to provide that certain other
provisions hereof cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the
Holders of each outstanding Security affected thereby) or the rights of
Holders to recover the principal or premium of, interest on, or redemption
payment with respect to, any Security;

(7) make any changes in Section 6.4, 6.7 or the third sentence of
this Section 9.2;

64
<PAGE>

(8) make the principal of, or the interest on, any Security
payable with anything or in any manner other than as provided for in this
Indenture (including changing the place of payment where, or the coin or
currency in which, any Security or any premium or the interest thereon is
payable) and the Securities as in effect on the date hereof; or

(9) make the Securities expressly subordinated in right of payment
to any extent not contemplated by Article Twelve or under any circumstances
not contemplated by Article Twelve to any other Indebtedness.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this
Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement
or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance
thereof.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.2 becomes
effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders affected thereby a notice
briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the
Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any
way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.2 or 9.4
becomes effective, it shall bind each Holder.

In connection with any amendment, supplement or waiver under this
Article Nine, the Company may, but shall not be obligated to, offer to any
Holder who consents to such amendment, supplement or waiver, or to all Holders,
consideration for such Holder's consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver.

SECTION 9.3 Compliance with TIA.
------------------- 

Every amendment, waiver or supplement of this Indenture or the
Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.

65
<PAGE>

SECTION 9.4 Revocation and Effect of Consents.
--------------------------------- 

Until an amendment, waiver or supplement becomes effective, a consent to
it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder
of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting
Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. 
However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his
Note or portion of his Note by written notice to the Company or the Person
designated by the Company as the Person to whom consents should be sent if such
revocation is received by the Company or such Person before the date on which
the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate certifying that the Holders of the
requisite principal amount of Notes have consented (and not theretofore revoked
such consent) to the amendment, supplement or waiver.

The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for
the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment,
supplement or waiver, which record date shall be the date so fixed by the
Company notwithstanding the provisions of the TIA. If a record date is fixed,
then notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph,
those Persons who were Holders at such record date, and only those Persons (or
their duly designated proxies), shall be entitled to revoke any consent
previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such
record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days
after such record date.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall
bind every Holder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1)
through (9) of Section 9.2, in which case, the amendment, supplement or waiver
shall bind only each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every
subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same
debt as the consenting Holder's Security; provided that any such waiver shall
-------- 
not impair or affect the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal and
premium of and interest on a Security, on or after the respective dates set for
such amounts to become due and payable expressed in such Security, or to bring
suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates.

66
<PAGE>

SECTION 9.5 Notation on or Exchange of Securities.
------------------------------------- 

If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the
Trustee may require the Holder of the Note to deliver it to the Trustee or
require the Holder to put an appropriate notation on the Note. The Trustee may
place an appropriate notation on the Note about the changed terms and return it
to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the
Company in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate
a new Note that reflects the changed terms. Any failure to make the appropriate
notation or to issue a new Note shall not affect the validity of such amendment,
supplement or waiver.

SECTION 9.6 Trustee to Sign Amendments, Etc.
--------------------------------

The Trustee shall execute any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized
pursuant to this Article Nine; provided that the Trustee may, but shall not be
-------- 
obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver which affects the
Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture. The Trustee
shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an
Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or
waiver authorized pursuant to this Article Nine is authorized or permitted by
this Indenture.

any meeting of Holders, in regard to proof of the holding of Notes and of the
appointment of proxies, and in regard to the appointment and duties of
inspectors of votes, and submission and examination of proxies, certificates and
other evidence of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the
conduct of the meeting as it shall think appropriate. Such regulations may fix
a record date and time for determining the Holders of record of Notes entitled

69
<PAGE>

The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary
chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the
Company or by Holders as provided in Section 10.3, in which case the Company or
the Holders calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner
appoint a temporary chairman. A permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of
the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Securities represented at the meeting and entitled to vote.

At any meeting each Holder or proxy shall be entitled to one vote for
each $1,000 principal amount of Securities held or represented by him; provided,
-------- 
however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any
- ------- 
Securities challenged as not outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the

other Holders. Any meeting of Holders duly called pursuant to the provisions of
Section 10.2 or Section 10.3 may be adjourned from time to time by vote of the

ARTICLE ELEVEN

CONVERSION

SECTION 11.1 Conversion Privilege.
-------------------- 

A Holder of a Security may convert it, or a portion thereof, subject to
prior redemption or repurchase, into Common Stock at any time during the period
stated in Paragraph 8 of the Securities.

The initial conversion rate is stated in Paragraph 8 of the Securities. 
The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in accordance with Sections 11.6
through 11.14.

The right to convert Notes called for redemption or subject to an offer
to repurchase will terminate at the close of business on the second Business Day
prior to the redemption or repurchase date, and will be lost if not exercised
prior to that time unless the Company defaults in making the payments due upon
redemption or repurchase.

71
<PAGE>

A Holder may convert a portion of a Security if the portion is $1,000 or
integral multiples thereof. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to
conversion of all of a Security also apply to conversion of a portion of it.

SECTION 11.2 Conversion Procedure.
-------------------- 

To convert a Security a Holder must satisfy the requirements in
Paragraph 8 of the Securities. The date on which the Holder satisfies all those
requirements is the conversion date (the "Conversion Date"). As soon as
practicable, the Company shall deliver to the Holder through the Conversion
Agent a certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion and a check in lieu of any fractional share. The person in whose
name the certificate is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record
on and after the Conversion Date.

If any Note is converted between the record date for the payment of
interest and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, such Note must be
accompanied by funds equal to the interest payable on such succeeding Interest
Payment Date on the principal amount so converted (unless such Note shall have
been called for redemption, in which case no such payment shall be required). A
Note converted on an Interest Payment Date need not be accompanied by any
payment, and the interest on the principal amount of the Note being converted
will be paid on such Interest Payment Date to the registered holder of such Note
on the immediately preceding record date. Subject to the aforesaid right of the
registered holder to receive interest, no payment or adjustment will be made on
conversion for interest accrued on the converted Note or for dividends on the
Common Stock issued on conversion.

If a Holder converts more than one Security at the same time, the number
of full shares issuable upon the conversion shall be based on the total
principal amount of the Securities converted.

Upon surrender of a Security that is converted in part the Trustee shall
authenticate for the Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to the
unconverted portion of the Security surrendered.

72
<PAGE>

If the last day on which a Security may be converted is a Legal Holiday
in a place where a Conversion Agent is located, the Security may be surrendered
to that Conversion Agent on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday.

SECTION 11.3 Fractional Shares.
----------------- 

The Company will not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon
conversion of a Security. Instead the Company will deliver its check for the
market value of a fractional share. The market value of a fraction of a share
shall be determined by multiplying the market price of a full share of Common
Stock by such fraction and rounding the result to the nearest cent.

The market price of a share of Common Stock for the purposes of this
Section 11.3 shall be the last reported sale price of a share of Common Stock on
the principal national securities exchange on which the shares of Common Stock
are listed or admitted to trading or on the National Association of Securities
Dealers National Market System ("NMS") on the first Business Day prior to the
day of conversion, or, if the Common Stock is not then listed on an exchange,
the closing sale price (or the quoted closing bid price if there were no sales)
as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation System ("NASDAQ") on the first business day prior to the day of
conversion. In the absence of one or more such quotations, the Board of
Directors shall determine in good faith the current market price.

SECTION 11.4 Taxes on Conversion.
------------------- 

The Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or
transfer tax due on the issue of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. 
However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the shares are
issued in a name other than that of the Holder.

SECTION 11.5 Company to Provide Stock.
------------------------ 

The Company shall reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common
Stock or its Common Stock held in treasury shares of Common Stock sufficient to
permit the conversion of all of the Securities at any time.

73
<PAGE>

All shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of the
Securities shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

The Company will endeavor to comply with all securities laws regulating
the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Securities
and will cause such shares to be listed on each national securities exchange on
which the Common Stock is then listed.

SECTION 11.6 Conversion Price Adjustment.
--------------------------- 

If the Company:

(1) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common Stock in
shares of its Common Stock;

(2) subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
greater number of shares;

(3) combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares; or

(4) issues by reclassification of its Common Stock any shares of
its capital stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a
consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing
corporation),

then the conversion privilege and the conversion rate in effect immediately
prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the Holder of a Security
thereafter converted may receive the number of shares of capital stock of the
Company which he would have owned immediately following such action if he had
converted the Security immediately prior to such action.

The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date
in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective
date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification.

74
<PAGE>

After such allocation, the conversion privilege and the conversion rate
of each class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on
terms comparable to those applicable to Common Stock in this Article Eleven.

SECTION 11.7 Adjustment for Shares Issued Below Market Price.
----------------------------------------------- 

If the Company shall pay a dividend, make a distribution or otherwise
issue rights, options, or warrants to holders of Common Stock, as such,
entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or
securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock) at a price per share
of Common Stock (or having an initial conversion or exchange price per share of
Common Stock, if a security convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock) less
than the Current Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the record date
relating to such dividend, distribution or issuance, then, immediately after
such record date, the conversion rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the
following formula:

N x P
-----
O + M
---------
C' = C x O + N

where:
<TABLE> 
<S> <C> <C>
C' = the adjusted conversion rate.

C = the then current conversion rate.

O = the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding on the record
date.

N = the number of additional shares of
Common Stock offered or issuable
on the exercise of the rights,
options or warrants.

P = the offering price per share of
the additional shares subject to
the rights or warrants.

M = the Current Market Price per share
of Common Stock on the record
date.
</TABLE>
The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights,
options or warrants are issued

75
<PAGE>

and shall become effective immediately after such record date. If such rights
or warrants are not issued, the conversion rate shall be immediately readjusted,
effective as of the date when the Board of Directors determines not to issue
such rights or warrants, to the conversion rate which would then be in effect if
such record date had not been fixed. If such rights or warrants are issued but,
at the end of the period during which such warrants or rights are exercisable,
not all warrants or rights shall have been exercised, the conversion rate shall
be immediately readjusted to what it would have been if "N" in the above formula
had been the number of shares actually issued.

SECTION 11.8 Adjustment for Other Distributions.
---------------------------------- 

If the Company shall set a record date to pay a dividend or make a
distribution to holders of shares of Common Stock (including any such
distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the
Company is the continuing corporation) of (i) securities other than Common
Stock, (ii) evidences of its indebtedness, (iii) assets, or (iv) rights,
options, or warrants to acquire securities of the Company, then in each such
case the conversion rate in effect immediately after the applicable record date
shall be adjusted in accordance with the following formula:

C' = C x M - F
-----
M

where:
<TABLE> 
<S> <C>
C' = the adjusted conversion rate.

C = the then current conversion rate.

M = the Current Market Price per share
of Common Stock on the applicable
record date.

F = the aggregate fair market value (as
reasonably determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors of the
Company) on the applicable record
date of the assets (including cash),
indebtedness, securities, rights or
warrants divided by the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock.
</TABLE>

76
<PAGE>

The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution
is made and shall become effective immediately after such record date. In the
event that such distribution is not made, the conversion rate then in effect
shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the Board of Directors
determines not to make such distribution, to the conversion rate which would
then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. Such adjustment shall
be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed.

If at the end of the period during which any warrants or rights
described by subsection 11.8(iv) are exercisable, not all of such warrants,
options, or rights shall have been exercised, the conversion rate shall be
immediately readjusted to what it would have been if "F" in the above formula
had not included the fair market value on the record date of such expired
warrants or rights, but were still divided by the same number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock.

This Section 11.8 shall not apply to cash dividends paid out of the
Company's consolidated cumulative earnings after the Issue Date. In addition,
this Section 11.8 does not apply to distributions referred to in Section 11.6 or
rights, options or warrants referred to in Section 11.7.

This Section does not apply to cash dividends or cash distributions paid
out of consolidated current or retained earnings as shown on the books of the
Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company shall
distribute rights or warrants (other than those referred to in Section 11.7
above) ("Rights") pro rata to holders of Common Stock, the Company may, in lieu
--- ---- 
of making any adjustment pursuant to this Section 11.8, make proper provision so
that each Holder of a Security who converts such Security (or any portion
thereof) after the record date for such distribution and prior to the expiration
or redemption of the Rights shall be entitled to receive upon such conversion,
in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, a
number of Rights to be determined as follows: (i) if such conversion occurs on
or prior to the date for the distribution to the holders of Rights of separate
certificates evidencing such Rights (the "Distribution Date"), the same number
of Rights to which a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the

77
<PAGE>

number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion is entitled at
the time of such conversion in accordance with the terms and provisions of and
applicable to the Rights; and (ii) if such conversion occurs after the
Distribution Date, the same number of Rights to which a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock into which the principal amount of the Security so
converted was convertible immediately prior to the Distribution Date would have
been entitled on the Distribution Date in accordance with the terms and
provisions of and applicable to the Rights.

SECTION 11.9 Adjustment for Common Stock Issuances.
------------------------------------- 

If the Company issues shares of Common Stock for a consideration per
share less than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date
the Company fixes the offering price of such additional shares, the conversion
rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the following formula:

P
--- 
O + M
------- 
C' = C x A

where:
<TABLE> 
<S> <C> <C> 

C' = the adjusted conversion rate.

C = the then current conversion rate.

O = the number of shares outstanding
immediately prior to the issuance of
such additional shares.

P = the aggregate consideration received
for the issuance of such additional
shares.

M = the Current Market Price per share on
the date of issuance of such additional
shares.

A = the number of shares outstanding
immediately after the issuance of such
additional shares.
</TABLE> 

78
<PAGE>

The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is
made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance.

This Section 11.9 does not apply to (i) any of the transactions
described in Sections 11.7, 11.8 or 11.10, (ii) Common Stock issued to the
Company's employees under bona fide employee benefit plans, or issued by the
---- ---- 
Company pursuant to an employment agreement or consulting agreement, which plan
or agreement has been adopted or approved by the Board of Directors of the
Company and, when required by law, approved by the holders of Common Stock, if
such Common Stock would otherwise be covered by this Section 11.9 (but only to
the extent that the aggregate number of shares excluded hereby and issued after
the Issue Date pursuant to such plans and agreements shall not exceed 15% of the
Common Stock outstanding at the time of the adoption of any such plan or
agreement, exclusive of antidilution adjustments thereunder), (iii) Common Stock
issued to shareholders of any Person which, in an arm's-length transaction,
merges into or with the Company, or any Subsidiary of the Company, in proportion
to their stock holdings of such Person immediately prior to such merger, upon
such merger, (iv) Common Stock issued in a bona fide public offering pursuant to
---- ---- 
a firm commitment underwriting by an investment banking firm (except for any
such public offering in which the aggregate underwriting discounts and
commissions exceed 10%), (v) Common Stock issued in a bona fide private
---- ---- 
placement through a placement agent that is a member firm of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") (except to the extent that
any discount from the Current Market Price attributable to restrictions on
transferability of the Common Stock, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Company and described in a Board Resolution which the Company
shall cause to be given to the Conversion Agent, shall exceed 15%), (vi) the
Company's Common Stock issued upon the exercise of warrants, rights or options
which had been issued for fair value with an exercise price at least equal to
the Current Market Price of the Company's Common Stock at the time of issuance
of such warrant, right or option, (vii) the exercise of options or warrants, or
the conversion or exchange of other securities convertible or exchangeable for
Common Stock pursuant to their terms as outstanding on the Issue Date or (viii)
Common Stock issued in connection with a merger exclusively between Richmond
Homes and a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company that is not an Unrestricted
Subsidiary.

SECTION 11.10 Adjustment for Issuances of Convertible Securities.
-------------------------------------------------- 

If the Company issues any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Common Stock (other than securities issued in transactions
described in Sections 11.7, 11.8, or 11.9) for a consideration per share of
Common Stock initially deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such
securities less than the Current Market Price per share on the date of issuance
of such securities, or if such securities are not immediately convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable, on the date such securities become convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable the conversion rate shall be adjusted in accordance
with the following formula:

P
--- 
O + M
------- 
C' = C x O + D

where:
<TABLE> 
<S> <C> <C> 
C' = the adjusted conversion rate.

C = the then current conversion rate.

O = the number of shares outstanding
immediately prior to the issuance
of such securities.

P = the aggregate consideration
received for the issuance of such
securities.

M = the Current Market Price per share
on the date of issuance of such
securities or on the date such
securities become convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable.

D = the maximum number of shares
deliverable upon conversion,
exchange or exercise of such
securities at the initial
conversion, exchange or exercise
rate.
</TABLE> 

The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is
made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance.

If all of the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or
exercise of such securities has

80
<PAGE>

not been issued when such securities are no longer outstanding, then the
conversion rate shall promptly be readjusted to the conversion rate which would
then be in effect had the adjustment upon the issuance of such securities been
made on the basis of the actual number of shares of Common Stock issued upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities.

SECTION 11.11 Adjustment to Number of Conversion Shares.
----------------------------------------- 

Upon each adjustment of the conversion rate pursuant to this Article
Eleven, each Note shall thereupon evidence the right to purchase that number of
shares of Common Stock (calculated to the nearest hundredth of a share) obtained
by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon conversion
of the Note immediately prior to such adjustment by the conversion rate in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product so obtained
by the conversion rate in effect immediately after such adjustment. The
adjustment pursuant to this Section 11.11 to the number of shares of Common
Stock purchasable upon conversion of a Note shall be made each time an
adjustment of the conversion rate is made pursuant to this Article Eleven.

SECTION 11.12 Voluntary Adjustment.
-------------------- 

The Company at any time may lower the conversion rate, temporarily or
otherwise, so long as such action does not cause Common Stock to be issued at
less than its par value.

SECTION 11.13 Current Market Price.
-------------------- 

In this Article Eleven the "Current Market Price" per share of Common
Stock on any date is the average of the last reported sale prices of a share of
Common Stock on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares
of Common Stock are listed or admitted to trading or, if not traded thereon, on
the NMS, or, if the Common Stock is not then listed on such an exchange or on
the NMS, the closing sale prices (or the quoted closing bid prices if there were
no sales) as reported by NASDAQ for any 20 consecutive trading days commencing

quotations, the Board of Directors reasonably and in good faith shall determine
the Current Market Price.

For purposes of any computation respecting consideration received
pursuant to Sections 11.9 and 11.10, the following shall apply:

82
<PAGE>

(1) in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be the amount of such cash, provided that in
-------- 
no case shall any deduction be made for any commissions, discounts or other
expenses incurred by the Company for any underwriting of the issue or
otherwise in connection therewith;

(2) in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other
than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors (irrespective of the accounting
treatment thereof) and described in a Board Resolution which shall be filed
with the Trustee; and

(3) in the case of the issuance of securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares, the aggregate consideration received therefor
shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the Company for the
issuance of such securities plus the additional minimum consideration, if
any, to be received by the Company upon the conversion or exchange thereof
(the consideration in each case to be determined in the same manner as
provided in clauses (1) and (2) of this Section).

SECTION 11.15 When Adjustment May Be Deferred.
------------------------------- 

No adjustment in the conversion rate need be made unless the adjustment
would require a change of at least l% in the conversion rate then in effect;
provided, however, that any adjustments that would otherwise be required to be
- -------- -------
made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent
adjustment.

All calculations under this Article Eleven shall be made to the nearest
cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.

In any case in which this Article Eleven shall require that an
adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event,
the Company may defer until the occurrence of such event (1) issuing to

83
<PAGE>

the Holder of any Security converted after such record date and before the
occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and
above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving
effect to such adjustment and (2) paying to such Holder any amount in cash in
lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock pursuant to Section 11.3; provided,
--------
however, that the Company shall deliver to such Holder a due bill or other
- -------
appropriate instrument evidencing such Holder's rights to receive such
additional shares of Common Stock, and such cash, upon the occurrence of the
event requiring such adjustment.

SECTION 11.16 When No Adjustment Required.
--------------------------- 

No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value
of the Common Stock.

SECTION 11.17 Notice of Adjustment.
-------------------- 

Whenever the conversion rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly
mail to Holders a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall file with the
Trustee an Officers' Certificate or a certificate from the Company's independent
public accountants briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the
manner of computing it. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the
adjustment is correct, absent manifest error.

SECTION 11.18 Notice of Certain Transactions.
------------------------------ 
If:

(1) the Company proposes to take any action that would require an
adjustment in the conversion rate,

(2) the Company proposes to take any action that would require a
supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 11.19, or

(3) there is a proposed liquidation or dissolution of the Company,

the Company shall mail to Holders a notice stating the proposed record date for
a dividend or distribution or the proposed effective date of a subdivision,
combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,

84
<PAGE>

lease, liquidation or dissolution. The Company shall mail the notice at least
15 days before such date. Failure to mail the notice or any defect therein shall
not affect the validity of the transaction.

SECTION 11.19 Reorganization of the Company.
----------------------------- 

If the Company is a party to a transaction subject to Section 5.1 or a
merger which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Common Stock, the successor
corporation shall enter into a supplemental indenture which shall provide that
the Holder of a Security may convert it into the kind and amount of securities,
cash or other assets which such Holder would have owned immediately after the
consolidation, merger, transfer or lease if such Holder had converted the
Security immediately before the effective date of the transaction. The
supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly
equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this Article
Eleven. The successor Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing
the supplemental indenture.

If this Section applies to any such transaction, reclassification or
change, Sections 11.6 through 11.10 shall not apply thereto.

SECTION 11.20 Trustee's Disclaimer.
-------------------- 

The Trustee shall have no duty to determine whether an adjustment under
this Article Eleven or under the terms of the Securities shall be made, or if
made, whether such adjustment was properly made. The Trustee shall have no duty
to determine whether any supplemental indenture required by Section 11.19 meets
the requirements of such Section 11.19.

ARTICLE TWELVE

SUBORDINATION

SECTION 12.1 Securities Subordinated to Senior Indebtedness.
---------------------------------------------- 

Each Holder, by accepting Securities, agrees that (a) the payment of the
principal of and interest on the Securities and (b) any payment on account of
the acquisition or redemption of the Securities by the

85
<PAGE>

Company (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 4.10) is
subordinated to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article Twelve, to
the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company and that
these subordination provisions are for the benefit of the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness.

This Article Twelve shall constitute a continuing offer to all Persons
who become holders of, or continue to hold, Senior Indebtedness, and such
provisions are made for the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and
such holders are made obligees hereunder and any one or more of them may enforce
such provisions.

SECTION 12.2 No Payment on Securities in Certain Circumstances.
------------------------------------------------- 

(a) No payment shall be made by the Company on account of the
principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities or to defease or
acquire any of the Securities (including repurchases of Securities pursuant to
Section 4.10) for cash or property, or on account of the redemption provisions
of the Securities, (i) upon the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness by lapse of
time, acceleration (unless waived) or otherwise, unless and until all principal
of and interest on (including any post-petition interest) such Senior
Indebtedness and all other obligations in respect thereof shall first be paid in
full or such payment is duly provided for, or (ii) upon an event of default in
payment of any principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Senior
Indebtedness when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or at a
date fixed for prepayment or by declaration or otherwise (a "Payment Default"),
unless and until such Payment Default has been cured or waived or otherwise has
ceased to exist.

(b) Upon the occurrence of an event of default (other than a Payment
Default) with respect to any Senior Indebtedness, as such event of default is
defined in the instrument under which it is outstanding, permitting the holders
(or any requisite percentage thereof) to accelerate the maturity thereof or
demand payment upon written notice of such event of default given to the Company
and the Trustee by the Company holders of an aggregate of $10,000,000 principal
amount outstanding of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative (a
"Payment Notice"), then, unless and until such event of default shall have been
cured or waived or

86
<PAGE>

shall have otherwise ceased to exist, no payment shall be made by the Company on
account of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities,
or to defease or acquire or repurchase any of the Securities for cash or
property, or on account of the redemption provisions of the Securities, in any
such case. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless (a) the Senior Indebtedness in
respect of which such event of default exists has been declared due and payable
in its entirety within 179 days after the Payment Notice is delivered as set
forth, above (the "Payment Blockage Period"), and (b) such declaration has not
been rescinded or waived, subject to Section 12.2(a), the Company shall be
required to pay all sums not paid to the Holders of the Securities during the
Payment Blockage Period due to the foregoing prohibitions and to resume all
other payments as and when due on the Securities. Any number of Payment Notices
may be given; provided, however, that (i) not more than one Payment Notice shall
-------- ------- 
be given within a period of any 360 consecutive days and (ii) no event of
default that existed upon the date of such Payment Notice or the commencement of
such Payment Blockage Period (whether or not such event of default is on the
same issue of Senior Indebtedness) shall be made the basis for the commencement
of any other Payment Blockage Period.

(c) In furtherance of the provisions of Section 12.1, in the event
that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.2, any payment
or distribution of assets of the Company on account of principal of or interest
on the Securities or to defease or acquire any of the Securities (including
repurchases of Securities pursuant to Section 4.10) for cash, property or
securities, or on account of the redemption provisions of the Securities shall
be made by the Company and received by the Trustee, by any Holder or by any
Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, money for
any such payment shall be segregated and held in trust), at a time when such
payment or distribution was prohibited by the provisions of this Section 12.2,
then, unless such payment or distribution is no longer prohibited by this
Section 12.2, such payment or distribution (subject to the provisions of
Sections 12.6 and 12.7) shall be received and held in trust by the Trustee or
such Holder or Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company, and shall be paid or delivered by the Trustee or
such Holders or such Paying Agent, as the case may be, to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company remaining unpaid or

87
<PAGE>

unprovided for or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any
indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior
Indebtedness of the Company may have been issued, ratably according to the

represented by each, to the extent necessary to enable payment in full (except
as such payment otherwise shall have been provided for, of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Company remaining unpaid, after giving effect to all
concurrent payments and distributions and all provisions therefor to or for the
holders of such Senior Indebtedness, but only to the extent that as to any
holder of such Senior Indebtedness, as promptly as practical following notice

M.D.C. HOLDINGS, INC.

8-3/4% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTE
DUE 2005

1. Interest.
-------- 

M.D.C. Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), promises
to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at a rate of 8-3/4% per
annum. To the extent it is lawful, the Company promises to pay interest on any
interest payment due but unpaid on such principal amount at a rate of 8-3/4% per
annum compounded semi-annually.

The Company will pay interest semi-annually on December 15 and June 15
of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing June 15, 1994. 
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of issuance or from the most
recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for;
provided that, if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest and if
- -------- 
this Note is authenticated between a record date referred to on the face hereof
and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such
Interest Payment Date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

2. Method of Payment.
----------------- 

The Company shall pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest)
to the persons in whose names such Notes are registered at the close of business
on December 1 or June 1 preceding such Interest Payment Date. Holders must
surrender Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. Except as
provided below, the Company shall pay principal and interest in such coin or
currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be
legal tender for payment of public and private debts ("U.S. Legal Tender"). At
the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to
the Holders of the Notes at the addresses set forth upon the registry books of
the Company. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or

A-4
<PAGE>

other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

3. Paying Agent, Registrar and Conversion Agent.
-------------------------------------------- 

Initially, First Bank National Association (the "Trustee"), will act as
Paying Agent, Registrar and Conversion Agent. The Company may change any Paying
Agent, Registrar or Conversion Agent without notice. Subject to limitations
under certain circumstances, the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates may act
as Paying Agent, Registrar, co-Registrar or Conversion Agent.

4. Indenture.
--------- 

The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture, dated as of December
15, 1993 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. Capitalized
terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise defined
herein. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those
made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act, as in effect
on the date of the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and
Holders of Notes are referred to the Indenture and said Act for a statement of
them. The Notes are general unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Company
limited in aggregate principal amount to $50,000,000.

5. Redemption.
---------- 

The Notes may not be so redeemed before December 15, 1998. The Notes
may be redeemed in whole or from time to time in part at any time on and after
December 15, 1998, at the option of the Company, at the Redemption Price
(expressed as a percentage of principal amount) set forth below with respect to
the indicated Redemption Date, in each case, together with any accrued but
unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.

2000.................. 103%
2001.................. 102%
2002.................. 101%
2003 and thereafter... 100%

</TABLE> 
In the case of a partial redemption, the Trustee shall select the Notes
or portions thereof for redemption on a pro rata basis by lot or in such other
-------- 
manner as it deems appropriate and fair. The Notes may be redeemed in part only
in multiples of $1,000 of principal amount.

Any such redemption will comply with Article Three of the Indenture.

6. Notice of Redemption.
-------------------- 

Notice of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 15 days
and not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to
be redeemed at his address then shown upon the books of the registrar. Notes in
denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part. Any notice that
relates to a Note to be redeemed in part only must state the portion of the
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof and must state that on
and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Note, a new Note
or Notes in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be
issued.

Except as set forth in the Indenture, from and after any Redemption
Date, if monies for the redemption of the Notes called for redemption shall have
been deposited with the Paying Agent on or before such Redemption Date, the
Notes called for redemption will cease to accrue interest and the only right of
the Holders of such Notes will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price and
any accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.

A-6
<PAGE>

7. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.
--------------------------------- 

The Notes are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of
$1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may register the transfer of,
or exchange Notes in accordance with, the Indenture. The Registrar may require
a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the
Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any
Notes selected for redemption.

8. Conversion.
---------- 

A Holder of a Note may convert it into Common Stock of the Company at
any time prior to the close of business on December 15, 2005, subject to prior
redemption or repurchase, to convert such Notes or portion thereof (which are
$1,000 or integral multiples thereof) into Common Stock of the Company, at the
conversion rate computed in compliance with the Indenture. The initial
conversion rate is $7.75 principal amount of Notes for each share of Common
Stock (initially equal to 129.03 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal
amount of the Notes), subject to adjustment in certain events. The Company will
deliver a check in lieu of any fractional share. On conversion, no payment or
adjustment for interest accrued on the Notes will be made nor for dividends on
the Common Stock issued on conversion. If any Note is converted between the
record date for the payment of interest and the next succeeding interest payment
date, such Note must be accompanied by funds equal to the interest payable on
such succeeding Interest Payment Date on the principal amount so converted
(unless such Note shall have been called for redemption, in which case no such
payment shall be required), and the interest on the principal amount of the Note
being converted will be paid on such next succeeding Interest Payment Date to
the registered holder of such Note on the immediately preceding record date
except as provided in the Indenture. A Note converted on an Interest Payment
Date need not be accompanied by any payment, and the interest on the principal
amount of the Note being converted will be paid on such interest payment date to
the registered holder of such Note on the immediately preceding record date,
except as provided by the Indenture.

A-7
<PAGE>

To convert a Note a Holder must (1) complete and sign the conversion
notice on the back of the Note, (2) surrender the Note to the Conversion Agent,
(3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the
Registrar or Conversion Agent and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax if
required. A Holder may convert a portion of a Note if the portion is $1,000 or
a whole multiple of $1,000.

9. Subordination.
------------- 

The Notes are subordinated in right of payment, in the manner and to the
extent set forth in the Indenture, to the prior payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture). Each Holder by accepting a Note
agrees to such subordination and authorizes the Trustee to give it effect.

10. Persons Deemed Owners.
--------------------- 

The registered Holder of a Note may be treated as the owner of it for
all purposes.

11. Unclaimed Money.
--------------- 

If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for
two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent(s) will pay the money back to the
Company at its written request. After that, all liability of the Trustee and
such Paying Agent(s) with respect to such money shall cease.

12. Discharge Prior to Redemption or Maturity.
----------------------------------------- 

If the Company at any time deposits into an irrevocable trust with the
Trustee U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay the
principal of and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity and complies
with the other provisions of the Indenture relating thereto, the Company will be
discharged from certain provisions of the Indenture and the Notes (including the
financial covenants, but excluding, among other things, its obligation to pay
the principal of and interest on the Notes).

13. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver.
----------------------------- 

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended
or supplemented with the written

A-8
<PAGE>

consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding, and any existing Default or Event of Default or
compliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Without
notice to or consent of any Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement
the Indenture or the Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or
inconsistency, or make any other change that does not adversely affect the
rights of any Holder of a Note.

14. Restrictive Covenants.
--------------------- 

The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, among other things, enter into transactions with
Affiliates, and a limitation on the ability of the Company to merge or
consolidate with any other Person. The limitations are subject to many
important qualifications and exceptions. The Company must annually report to
the Trustee on compliance with such limitations.

15. Change of Control.
----------------- 

In the event that a Change of Control (as defined in Section 4.10 of the
Indenture) has occurred, each Holder will have the right, at such Holder's
option, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, to
require the Company to repurchase in the manner specified in the Indenture, all
or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of such Holder's Notes.

16. Successors.
---------- 

When a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under
the Notes and the Indenture, the predecessor will be released from those
obligations.

17. Defaults and Remedies.
--------------------- 

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of
Default specified in Sections 6.1 (4) and (5) of the Indenture), then in every
such case, unless the principal of all of the Notes shall have already become
due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding, by notice in writing to the Company (and
to the Trustee if given by Holders) (an "Accelera-

A-9
<PAGE>

tion Notice"), may declare all principal, determined as set forth below,
including in each case accrued interest thereon, or, as appropriate, the Change
of Control Purchase Price to be due and payable immediately. If an Event of
Default specified in Sections 6.1 (4) or (5) of the Indenture, relating to the
Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries occurs, all principal and accrued
interest thereon will be immediately due and payable on all outstanding Notes
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the Holders. 
Subject to certain conditions being met, the Holders of no less than a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding generally are
authorized to rescind such acceleration if all existing Events of Default, other
than the non-payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
Notes which have become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or
waived. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes, except as provided
in the Indenture.

18. No Recourse Against Others.
-------------------------- 

No stockholder, director, officer, employee or incorporator, as such,
past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation shall have
any liability for any obligation of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture
or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each Holder of a Note, by accepting a Note, waives and releases
all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
the issuance of the Notes.

19. Authentication.
-------------- 

This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee or authenticating agent
signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.

20. Abbreviations and Defined Terms.
------------------------------- 

Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a Note or
an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the
entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as

2. Exchange Offer
--------------

(a) The Company and the Guarantors shall use their best efforts to
cause the Exchange Opinion to be issued to the holders of the Registrable
Securities and shall file a Registration Statement relating to the Exchange
Offer with the SEC no later than the Filing Date. The offer and sale of the
Exchange Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer shall be registered pursuant
to the Securities Act on the appropriate form and duly registered or qualified
under applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws and will comply with all
applicable tender offer rules and regulations of and pursuant to the Exchange
Act and state securities or Blue Sky laws. On or prior to the Effectiveness
Date, the Company and the Guarantors shall Consummate the Exchange Offer and
cause to be delivered to all holders who are to receive Exchange Securities an
updated Exchange Opinion, dated the date of the Consummation of the Exchange
Offer. The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any condition, other than that
the Exchange Offer does not violate any applicable law and that the Exchange
Offer Opinion be delivered in accordance herewith. No securities shall be
included in the Registration Statement covering the Exchange Offer other than
the Notes and the Exchange Securities.

(b) The Company and the Guarantors may require each holder of
Registrable Securities participating in the Exchange Offer to represent to the
Company and the Guarantors and their counsel that at the time of the
Consummation of the Exchange Offer (i) any Exchange Securities received by such
holder will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business and (ii) such
holder will have no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate
in the distribution of the Notes or the Exchange Securities within the meaning
of the Securities Act.

(c) If (i) the Company and the Guarantors are unable, using their
best efforts, to obtain an Exchange Opinion in accordance with Section 2(a), or
(ii) prior to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer, either the Company and the
Guarantors or holders of 20% or more of the aggregate principal amount of
Registrable Securities determines in its or their reasonable judgment that,
based upon advice of legal counsel, the Exchange Securi-

7
<PAGE>

ties would not, upon receipt, be tradeable by each such holder without
restriction under the Securities Act (other than a restriction related solely to
a holder's status as an Affiliate of either the Company or the Guarantors or as
a Participating Broker-Dealer), then, upon such a determination by the Company
and the Guarantors or receipt by the Company and the Guarantors of notice of
such determination by such holders, the Company and the Guarantors shall
promptly deliver to the holders of the Registrable Securities and the Trustee
notice thereof (the "Shelf Notice") and shall thereafter file a Shelf
Registration pursuant to Section 3. Following the delivery of a valid Shelf
Notice in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Company and the Guarantors
shall not have any further obligation under this Section 2.

(d) The Company and the Guarantors shall commence the Exchange Offer
(within the time periods set forth herein) by mailing the related exchange offer
prospectus and appropriate accompanying documents to each holder of Registrable
Securities providing, in addition to such other disclosures as are required by
applicable law:

i) that the Exchange Offer is being made pursuant to this Agreement
and that all Notes validly tendered will be accepted for exchange;

ii) the dates of acceptance for exchange (the "Exchange Date"), which
date shall in no event be later than the Effectiveness Date;

iii) that holders of Registrable Securities electing to have a Note
exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be required to surrender such
Note, together with the enclosed letters of transmittal, to the institution
and at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business
on the Exchange Date; and

iv) that holders of Registrable Securities will be entitled to
withdraw their election to exchange Notes, not later than the close of
business on the Exchange Date;

8
<PAGE>

As soon as practicable after the Exchange Date (but in no event later
than the Effectiveness Date), the Company shall:

(i) accept for exchange all Notes or portions thereof tendered and 
not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer; and

(ii) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for 
cancellation all Notes or portions thereof so accepted for exchange by the
Company, and issue, or cause the Trustee under the Indenture to authenticate
and mail to each holder, an Exchange Security equal in principal amount to the
principal amount of the Notes surrendered by such holder.

(e) The Company has been informed that the Staff of the SEC has
taken the position that any broker-dealer that owns Exchange Notes that were
received by such broker-dealer for its own account in the Exchange Offer (a
"Participating Broker-Dealer") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the
meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the
requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such
Exchange Securities (other than a resale of an unsold allotment resulting from
the original placement of the Notes).

The Company has also been informed that it is the Staff's 
position that if the Prospectus contained in the Registration Statement includes
a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means
by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities,
without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of
Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by
Participating Broker-Dealers to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligations
under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for
their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements
of the Securities Act.

In light of the above, notwithstanding the other provisions of 
this Agreement, the Company agrees that the provisions of Section 6 of this
Agreement as they relate to a Shelf Registration shall also apply to an
Exchange Offer Registration to the extent, and with

9
<PAGE>

such reasonable modifications thereto as may be reasonably requested by any
Participating Broker-Dealer or the Company, in each case as provided in clause
(ii) below, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange
Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the
Staff recited in this Section 2(e); provided that:
-------- 

(i) the Company shall not be required to amend or supplement the
Prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, as would otherwise be
contemplated by this Agreement, for a period exceeding 90 days after the
Effectiveness Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement relating to a Shelf Registration) and Participating
Broker-Dealers shall not be authorized by the Company to deliver and shall
not deliver such Prospectus after such period in connection with the
resales contemplated by this Section 2(e);

(ii) the application of the Shelf Registration procedures set forth
in this Section 2(e) of this Agreement to an Exchange Offer, to the extent
not otherwise required by the positions of the Staff of the SEC or the
Securities Act, will be in conformity with the reasonable request to the
Company by anyone who certifies to the Company in writing a reasonable
period prior to the Filing Date that they anticipate that they may be a
Participating Broker-Dealer.

3. Shelf Registration
------------------

If a Shelf Notice is delivered as contemplated by Section 2(c), then the
Company and the Guarantors shall prepare and file, as promptly as reasonably
practicable thereafter, with the SEC a Registration Statement for an offering to
be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act
covering all of the Registrable Securities (the "Shelf Registration"). The
Company and the Guarantors shall (i) file a Registration Statement relating to
the Shelf Registration with the SEC on or prior to the Filing Date, (ii) cause
the Shelf Registration to become effective under the Securities Act on or prior
to the Effectiveness Date, and (iii) keep the Shelf Registration continuously
effective under the Securities Act until (the "Effectiveness Period") (A) 24
months following the date on which the Shelf Registration

10
<PAGE>

becomes effective (subject to extension pursuant to Section 5(a) and the last
paragraph of Section 6 hereof) or (B) if sooner, the date following the date
that all Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration have been sold
pursuant thereto; provided that the Effectiveness Period shall be extended to
-------- 
the extent required to permit dealers to comply with the applicable prospectus
delivery requirements under Rule 174 under the Securities Act.

4. Liquidated Damages
------------------

(a) The parties hereto agree that the holders of Registrable
Securities will suffer damages if the Company and the Guarantors fail to fulfill
their obligations under Section 2 or Section 3 and that it would not be feasible
to ascertain the extent of such damages. Accordingly, if, other than primarily
as a result of any action by the holders of Registrable Securities or any of
their agents or representatives, including, without limitation, their Special
Counsel or an inability on the part of any holder or any of their
representatives or agents to obtain any necessary approval from the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (i) either a Registration Statement
relating to either the Exchange Offer or the Shelf Registration is not filed
with the SEC on or prior to the Filing Date, or (ii) (x) on or prior to the
Effectiveness Date, either the Shelf Registration or the Registration Statement
relating to the Exchange Offer has not become effective under the Securities Act
or (y) the Exchange Offer (if required) has not been Consummated within 45
business days after the Effectiveness Date (the "Exchange Date"), or (iii) at
any time prior to the end of the Effectiveness Period the Shelf Registration
shall have ceased to be continuously effective (the Filing Date, in the case of
clause (i), the Effectiveness Date (or the Exchange Date), in the case of clause
(ii), and the date on which the Registration Statement ceases to be continuously
effective, in the case of clause (iii), being referred to herein as the "Event
Date"), then the Company and the Guarantors agree jointly and severally to pay,
as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, to each holder of a Registrable
Security, an additional amount (the "Liquidated Damages") equal to $.20 per week
per $1,000 principal amount of Registrable Securities held by such holder for
each day beginning on, and including, the Event Date and ending on but not

11
<PAGE>

including the date that the act required as of such Event Date actually takes
place; provided that the Company shall not be required to pay in excess of $.20
-------- 
per week per $1,000 principal amount of Registrable Securities held by any
holder on account of failures to act as of all such Event Dates.

(b) The Company shall notify the Trustee and Paying Agent under the
Indenture immediately upon the happening of each and every Event Date. The
Company shall pay the Liquidated Damages due on the Registrable Securities by
depositing with the Paying Agent (which may not be the Company for these
purposes), in trust, for the benefit of the holders thereof, at least one
business day prior to the next interest payment date specified by the Indenture,
sums sufficient to pay the Liquidated Damages then due. The Liquidated Damages
due shall be payable on each interest payment date specified by the Indenture to
the record holder entitled to receive the interest payment to be made on such
date. Each obligation to pay Liquidated Damages shall be deemed to accrue from
and including the applicable Event Date.

(c) The parties hereto agree that the liquidated damages provided for
in this Section 4 constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be
suffered by holders of Registrable Securities by reason of the failure of the
Shelf Registration, or the Exchange Offer, to be filed, to be declared
effective, to be Consummated or to remain effective, as the case may be, in
accordance with this Agreement.

5. Hold-Back Agreements
--------------------

(a) Restrictions on Sale by Holders of Registrable Securities. Each
--------------------------------------------------------- 
holder of Registrable Securities agrees, if requested (pursuant to a timely
written notice) by the managing underwriters in an underwritten offering or
placement agent in a private offering of the Company's or the Guarantors' debt
securities, not to effect any private sale or distribution (including a sale
pursuant to Rule 144(k) and Rule 144A, but excluding non-public sales to any of
its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and controlling persons) of any
of the Notes (except pursuant to an Exchange Offer), during the period beginning
10 days prior to, and ending 90 days after, the closing date of the underwritten
offering or

12
<PAGE>

private offering. If a proper request is made pursuant to this Section 5(a) at
any time when a Shelf Registration is effective, then the time period during
which such a Shelf Registration is required to remain continuously effective for
such holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
shall be extended by 100 days.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any holder of Registrable
Securities if such holder is prevented by applicable statute or regulation from
entering into any such agreement.

(b) Restrictions on Public Sale by the Company, the Guarantors and
--------------------------------------------------------------
Others. The Company and the Guarantors agree that without the written consent
- ------ 
of the managing underwriters in an underwritten offering of Registrable
Securities covered by a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 3
hereof, not to effect any public or private sale or distribution of its debt
securities, including a sale pursuant to Regulation D or Rule 144A under the
Securities Act, during the period beginning 10 days prior to, and ending 90 days
after, the closing date of each underwritten offering made pursuant to such
Registration Statement (provided, however, that such period shall be extended by
-------- ------- 
the number of days from and including the date of the giving of any notice
pursuant to Section 6(c) hereof to and including the date when each seller of
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement shall have
received the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by
Section 6(k) hereof).

6. Registration Procedures
-----------------------

In connection with the Company's and the Guarantors' registration
obligations hereunder, the Company and the Guarantors shall effect such
registrations on the appropriate form available for the sale of the Registrable
Securities or Exchange Securities, as applicable, to (i) permit the sale of
Exchange Securities and (ii) in the case of a Shelf Registration, permit the
sale of Registrable Securities in accordance with the method or methods of
disposition thereof specified by the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of Registrable Securities, and pursuant thereto the Company and
the Guarantors shall as expeditiously as possible:

13
<PAGE>

(a) In the case of a Shelf Registration, no fewer than 10 Business Days
prior to the initial filing of a Registration Statement or Prospectus and no
fewer than two Business Days prior to the filing of any amendment or supplement
thereto (including any document that would be incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated therein by reference), furnish to the Special Counsel and the
managing underwriters, if any, copies of all such documents proposed to be
filed, which documents (other than those incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference) will be subject to the review of such Special Counsel
and such underwriters, if any, and cause the officers and directors of the
Company and the Guarantors, counsel to the Company and the Guarantors and
independent certified public accountants to the Company and the Guarantors to
respond to such inquiries as shall be necessary, in the opinion of such Special
Counsel to such holders and such underwriters, to conduct a reasonable
investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act; provided, further, that
-------- ------- 
the Company shall not be deemed to have kept a Registration Statement effective
during the applicable period if it voluntarily takes any action that results in
selling holders of the Registrable Securities covered thereby not being able to
sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Federal securities laws during that
period unless such action is required under applicable law (and the time period
during which such Registration Statement is required to remain effective
hereunder shall be extended by the number of days during which such selling
holders of Registrable Securities are not able to sell Registrable Securities). 
Neither the Company nor the Guarantors shall file any such Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto to which the
holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities, their Special Counsel, or
the managing underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object on a timely basis;
provided, that subject to the clause preceding subsection (a) of this Section 6,
- -------- 
the Company may reasonably and in good faith file such document in a form
required by law or upon advice of its counsel and make such of the Company's
representatives as shall reasonably be requested by holders' Special Counsel or
a managing underwriter, if any, available for negotiation and discussion in good
faith on such document; provided, further, however, that in the event that the
-------- ------- ------- 
holders, their Special Counsel or the managing underwriter make

14
<PAGE>

such an objection, the Filing Date and the Effectiveness Date shall be extended
for a period of 60 days;

(b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments, including
post-effective amendments, to each Registration Statement as may be necessary to
keep such Registration Statement continuously effective for the applicable time
period; cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any required
Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424
(or any similar provisions then in force) under the Securities Act; and comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to
the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement during
such period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the
sellers thereof set forth in such Registration Statement as so amended or in
such Prospectus as so supplemented;

(c) Notify the Special Counsel and the managing underwriters, if any,
promptly, (and in the case of (i) (A) in no event fewer than two Business Days
prior to such filing) and (if requested by any such Person), confirm such notice
in writing, (i) (A) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment is proposed to be filed, and, (B) with respect to a
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective, (ii) in the case of a Shelf Registration, of any request by the SEC
or any other Federal or state governmental authority for amendments or
supplements to a Registration Statement or related Prospectus or for additional
information, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC, any state securities commission,
any other governmental agency or any court of any stop order, order or
injunction suspending or enjoining the use or the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose,
(iv) if at any time any of the representations and warranties of the Company or
the Guarantors contained in any agreement (including any underwriting agreement)
contemplated hereby cease to be true and correct in all material respects, (v)
of the receipt by the Company or the Guarantors of any notification with respect
to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of
the Registrable Securities or Exchange Securities for sale in any jurisdiction,
or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose,

15
<PAGE>

and (vi) in the case of a Shelf Registration, of the happening of any event that
makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or related Prospectus or
any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference
untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in
such Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the
Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, and that in the case
of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading;

(d) Use their reasonable best efforts to avoid the issuance of, or,
if issued, obtain the withdrawal of any order enjoining or suspending the use or
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or the lifting of any suspension of
the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable
Securities or Exchange Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest
practicable moment;

(e) If a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 and if
requested by the managing underwriters, if any, or the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold in
connection with such offering, make all required filings of such Prospectus
supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the
Company and the Guarantors have received notification of the matters to be
incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment;
provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantors shall not be required to
- -------- ------- 
take any action pursuant to this Section 6(e) that would, in the opinion of
outside counsel for the Company and the Guarantors, violate applicable law;

(f) Furnish to each holder of Registrable Securities and Exchange
Securities, their Special Counsel and each managing underwriter, if any, without
charge, at least one conformed copy of each Registration Statement and each
amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents

to be incorporated therein by reference, and all exhibits to the extent
requested by each holder (including those previously furnished or incorporated
by reference) as soon as practicable after the filing of such documents with the
SEC;

(g) Deliver to each holder of Registrable Securities and Exchange
Securities, their Special Counsel, and the underwriters, if any, without charge,
as many copies of the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of
prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons reasonably
request; and the Company, and the Guarantors hereby consent to the use of such
Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling
holders of Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if any, in connection
with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such
Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, unless an event occurs under
Paragraph 6(c)(vi) in which case such consent shall not be deemed to be given
until the Company and the Guarantors have complied with Paragraph 6(k) or the
holders of the Registrable Securities have received an Advice;

(h) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities and prior
to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer, use their reasonable best efforts to
register or qualify or cooperate with the holders of Registrable Securities to
be sold or tendered for, the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel
in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such
registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities or Exchange
Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such
jurisdictions within the United States as any holder or underwriter reasonably
requests in writing; keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption
therefrom) effective during the period such Registration Statement is required
to be kept effective and do any and all other acts or things necessary or
advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable
Securities or Exchange Securities covered by the applicable Registration
Statement; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantors shall not be
-------- ------- 
required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not
then so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to general service
of process in

17
<PAGE>

any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or subject the Company and
the Guarantors to any tax in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so
subject;

(i) Cooperate with the holders and the managing underwriters, if any,
to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing
Registrable Securities or Exchange Securities to be sold, which certificates
shall not bear any restrictive legends and shall be in a form eligible for
deposit with The Depository Trust Company and to enable such Registrable
Securities or Exchange Securities to be in such denominations and registered in
such names as the managing underwriters, if any, or holders may request at least
two Business Days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities or Exchange
Securities;

(j) Use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities and Exchange Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities
within the United States, except as may be required solely as a consequence of
the nature of such selling holder's business, in which case the Company and the
Guarantors will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the filing of such
Registration Statement and the granting of such approvals as may be necessary to
enable the seller or sellers thereof or the underwriters, if any, to Consummate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities and Exchange Securities;
provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantors shall not be required to
- -------- ------- 
register the Registrable Securities and Exchange Securities in any jurisdiction
that would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction
where it is not then so subject or subject the Company and the Guarantors to any
tax in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or to require the
Company or the Guarantors to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it
is not then so qualified;

(k) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Paragraph
6(c)(vi), as promptly as practicable, prepare a supplement or amendment,
including a post-effective amendment, to each Registration Statement or a
supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to
be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required document so
that,

18
<PAGE>

into such agreements (including an underwriting agreement in form, scope and
substance as is customary in underwritten offerings) and take all such other
reasonable actions in connection therewith (including those reasonably requested
by the managing underwriters, if any, or the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold) in order to expedite
or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities, and in such
connection, whether or not an underwriting agreement is entered into, (i) make
such representations and warranties to the holders of such Registrable
Securities and the underwriters, if any, with respect to the business of the
Company, the Guarantors and their subsidiaries, and the Registration Statement,
Prospectus and documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference therein, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily

selling holder of Registrable Securities and each of the underwriters, if any,
such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type
customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with underwritten
offerings; (iv) if an underwriting agreement is entered into, the same shall
contain indemnification provisions and procedures no less favorable to the

Securities, as applicable; and in connection therewith, cooperate with the
trustee under the Indenture and the holders of the Registrable Securities and
the Exchange Securities, to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be
required for such Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of
the TIA; and execute, and use its reasonable efforts to cause such trustee to
execute, all customary documents as may be required to effect such changes, and
all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable the
Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner;

(r) Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and
make generally available to their securityholders earning statements satisfying
the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder
(or any similar rule promulgated

21
<PAGE>

under the Securities Act), no later than 45 days after the end of any 12-month
period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month period if such period is a
fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of any fiscal quarter in which
Registrable Securities are sold to underwriters in a firm commitment or
reasonable efforts underwritten offering and (ii) if not sold to underwriters in
such an offering, commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of
each of the Company and the Guarantors after the effective date of a
Registration Statement, which statement shall cover said 12-month periods, or
end shorter periods as is consistent with the requirements of Rule 158; and

(s) If an Exchange Offer is to be Consummated, upon delivery of the
Registrable Securities by such holders to the Company and the Guarantors in
exchange for the Exchange Securities, the Company and the Guarantors shall mark,
or caused to be marked, on such Registrable Securities that such Registrable
Securities are being cancelled in exchange for the Exchange Securities; in no
event shall such Registrable Securities be marked as paid or otherwise
satisfied.

The Company and the Guarantors may require each seller of Registrable
Securities as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the
Company and the Guarantors such information regarding the distribution of such
Registrable Securities as is required by law to be disclosed in the applicable
Registration Statement and the Company and the Guarantors may exclude from such
registration the Registrable Securities of any seller who unreasonably fails to
furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request.

If any such Registration Statement refers to any holder by name or
otherwise as the holder of any securities of the Company, then such holder shall
have the right to require (i) the insertion therein of language, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such holder, to the effect that the holding
by such holder of such securities is not to be construed as a recommendation by
such holder of the investment quality of the Company's securities covered
thereby and that such holding does not imply that such holder will assist in
meeting any future financial requirements of the Company, or (ii) in the event
that such reference to such holder

22
<PAGE>

by name or otherwise is not required by the Securities Act or any similar
Federal statute then in force, the deletion of the reference to such holder in
any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement filed or prepared
subsequent to the time that such reference ceases to be required.

In the case of a Shelf Registration pursuant to Section 3 hereof, each
holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of such Registrable
Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company and the Guarantors
of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 6(c)(ii),
6(c)(iii), 6(c)(v) or 6(c)(vi) hereof, such holder will forthwith discontinue
disposition of such Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement or Prospectus until such holder's receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(k) hereof, or until
it is advised in writing (the "Advice") by the Company and the Guarantors that
the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has
received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated
or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus. If the Company
and the Guarantors shall give any such notice, the time periods mentioned in
Section 3 hereof shall be extended by the number of days during such periods
from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the
date when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement shall have received (x) the copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(k) hereof or (y) the Advice, and, in either
case, has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus.

7. Registration Expenses
---------------------

(a) All fees and expenses incident to the performance of or
compliance with this Agreement by the Company and the Guarantors shall be borne
jointly and severally by the Company and the Guarantors whether or not any
Registration Statement is filed or becomes effective and whether or not any
securities are issued or sold pursuant to any Registration Statement (unless
such Registration Statement is not filed or does not become

23
<PAGE>

effective or securities are not issued or sold pursuant to such Registration
Statement primarily as a result of any action by the holders of Registrable
Securities requesting such registration). The fees and expenses referred to in

aggregate principal amount of Registrable Securities may designate)), (ii)

24
<PAGE>

expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties),
the expense of any annual audit, the fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the listing of the securities to be registered on any securities exchange

any local counsel, deemed appropriate by the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Registrable Securities).

(b) In connection with any Registration hereunder, the Company and
the Guarantors shall reimburse the holders of the Registrable Securities being
registered or tendered for in such registration for the reasonable fees and
disbursements of not more than one firm of attorneys ("Special Counsel") chosen
by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable
Securities.

8. Indemnification
---------------

(a) Indemnification by the Company and the Guarantors. The Company
------------------------------------------------- 
and the Guarantors shall, notwithstanding termination of this Agreement and
without limitation as to time, jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
each holder of Registrable Securities, each initial holder of Exchange
Securities, the officers, directors, agents, investment advisors and employees
of each of them, each Person who controls any such holder (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) and the
officers, directors, agents and employees of each such controlling person, to
the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs (including, without limitation, costs of preparation and
reasonable attorneys' fees) and expenses (collectively, "Losses"), as incurred,
arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or form of
prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary
prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or form of prospectus or
supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made)

25
<PAGE>

not misleading, except to the extent, that such are finally determined to have
been based upon information regarding such holder furnished in writing to the
Company and the Guarantors by or on behalf of such holder expressly for use
therein, and that information was reasonably relied on by the Company and the
Guarantors in the preparation thereof; provided, however, that the Company and
-------- ------- 
the Guarantors shall not be liable to the extent that (A) any such Losses arise
out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in any preliminary prospectus if (i) having
previously been furnished by or on behalf of the Company and the Guarantors with
copies of the Prospectus on a timely basis, such holder failed to send or
deliver a copy of the Prospectus with or prior to the delivery of written
confirmation of the sale by such holder of a Registrable Security to the person
asserting such Losses who purchased such Registrable Security that is the
subject thereof and (ii) the Prospectus would have adequately corrected such
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or such omission or alleged
omission or (B) any such Losses arise primarily out of or are based primarily
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission in the Prospectus, if such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement, omission or alleged omission is adequately corrected in an amendment
or supplement to the Prospectus (such that there is no longer any untrue
statement of a material fact in the Prospectus or omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading) and if, having previously been furnished by or on behalf of the
Company and the Guarantors with copies of the Prospectus as so amended or
supplemented, the holder of Registrable Securities thereafter failed to deliver
such Prospectus as so amended or supplemented on a timely basis, prior to or
concurrently with the sale of a Registrable Security to the person asserting
such Losses who purchased such Registrable Security that is the subject thereof
from such holder.

(b) Indemnification by Holder of Registrable Securities. In
--------------------------------------------------- 
connection with any Registration Statement in which a holder of Registrable
Securities is participating, such holder of Registrable Securities shall furnish
to the Company and the Guarantors in writ-

26
<PAGE>

ing such information as the Company and the Guarantors reasonably request for
use in connection with any Registration Statement or Prospectus and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantors, their directors,
officers, agents and employees, each Person who controls the Company or the
Guarantors (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section
20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, agents or employees of
such controlling persons, to the fullest extent lawful, from and against all
Losses (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment
not subject to appeal or review) arising out of or based upon any untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
Prospectus, or form of prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission
of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading to the extent, but only to the extent, that
such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished
in writing by such holder to the Company and the Guarantors expressly for use in
such Registration Statement or Prospectus and that such information was
reasonably relied upon by the Company and the Guarantors in preparation of such
Registration Statement, Prospectus or form of prospectus. In no event shall the
liability of any selling holder of Registrable Securities hereunder be greater
in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder upon
the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification
obligation.

(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. If any Proceeding shall
-------------------------------------- 
be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an
"Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party promptly shall so notify the person
from whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing, and the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the defense thereof; provided,
-------- 
that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, except to
the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction (which determination is not

27
<PAGE>

subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have materially
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

Any such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties, unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party
has agreed to pay such fees and expenses; or (2) the Indemnifying Party shall
have failed promptly to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding
and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any
such action, claim or proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such action,
claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall
have been advised in writing by counsel that an actual conflict of interest may
exist if such counsel represents such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying
Parties in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of
the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying Parties shall not have the right to
assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party), it being understood, however, that, the Indemnifying Party
------- 
shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but
substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction
arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the
fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to
any local counsel) at any time for all such Indemnified Parties, which firm
shall be designated in writing by the Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected
without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any proceeding unless such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability on claims that are or may be the subject matter of such proceeding.

All fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable
fees and expenses to the extent

28
<PAGE>

incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or
proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this Section 8) shall be paid to
the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within 20 business days of written notice
thereof to the Indemnifying Party (regardless of whether it is ultimately
determined that an Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder; provided, that the Indemnifying Party may require such Indemnified
-------- 
Party to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is
finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder).

(d) Contribution. If a claim by an Indemnified Party for
------------ 
indemnification under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof is found unenforceable in a
final judgment (not subject to further appeal) by a court of competent
jurisdiction (even though the express provisions hereof provide for
indemnification in such case), then each applicable Indemnifying Party, in lieu
of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that
resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. 
The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to
information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or
payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation
or Proceeding.

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata
--- ----
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account
the equitable considerations referred to in the

29
<PAGE>

immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
8(d), an Indemnifying Party that is a holder of Registrable Securities or
Exchange Securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of
the amount by which the total price at which the securities sold by such
Indemnifying Party and distributed to the public were offered to the public
exceeds the amount of any damages that such Indemnifying Party has otherwise
been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

9. Rules 144 and 144A
------------------

The Company and the Guarantors shall use their best efforts to file the
reports required to be filed by them under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Company or the Guarantors are not
required to file such reports, they will, upon the reasonable request of any
holder of Registrable Securities, make publicly available other information so
long as necessary to permit sales of their securities pursuant to Rules 144 and
144A. The Company and the Guarantors each further covenant that it will take
such further action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to
sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 144A. Upon the
request of any holder of Registrable Securities, the Company and the Guarantors
shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied
with such requirements.

10. Underwritten Registrations
--------------------------

If any of the Registrable Securities covered by any Shelf Registration
are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment
bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected
by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Registrable
Securities included in such offering.

30
<PAGE>

No person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder,
unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Person's Registrable Securities on
the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the
persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements.

11. Miscellaneous
-------------

(a) Remedies. In the event of a breach by the Company and the
-------- 
Guarantors, or by a holder of Registrable Securities, of any of their
obligations under this Agreement, each holder of Registrable Securities or the
Company and the Guarantors, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to
exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be
entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company
and the Guarantors, and each holder of Registrable Securities, agree that
monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by
reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby
further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in
respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate.

(b) No Inconsistent Agreements. None of the Company nor the
-------------------------- 
Guarantors has entered into, as of the date hereof, nor shall the Company or the
Guarantors, without the written consent of the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Registrable Securities, on or
after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its
securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of
Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the
provisions hereof. Except for the Convertible Notes Registration Rights
Agreement (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and registration rights granted
to Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich pursuant to the Option Agreement (as defined in
the Placement Memorandum), none of the Company nor the Guarantors has previously
entered into any agreement granting any registration rights with respect to any
of its securities to any person.

31
<PAGE>

(c) No Piggyback on Registrations. None of the Company, the Guarantors
----------------------------- 
nor any of their respective securityholders (other than the holders of
Registrable Securities in such capacity pursuant to the applicable Section
hereof) may include securities of the Company or the Guarantors in any Shelf
Registration or Exchange Offer (except to the extent that the inclusion of such
securities by the Company or the Guarantors or such securityholder would not, in
the good faith opinion of the managing underwriter selected by the holders of
Registrable Securities, materially and adversely affect the success of the
offering proposed to be made by holders of Registrable Securities).

(d) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement,
---------------------- 
including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof
may not be given, unless the Company and the Guarantors have obtained the
written consent of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding aggregate
principal amount of Registrable Securities; provided, however, that, for the
-------- ------- 
purposes of this Agreement, Registrable Securities that are owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, the Guarantors or an Affiliate of either of them are
not deemed outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to
depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates
exclusively to the rights of holders of Registrable Securities whose securities
are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly
or indirectly affect the rights of other holders of Registrable Securities may
be given by holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Registrable Securities being sold by such holders pursuant to such Registration
Statement; provided, however, that the provisions of this sentence may not be
-------- ------- 
amended, modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of
the immediately preceding sentence.

(e) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for
------- 
herein shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, next-day air courier,
certified first-class mail, return receipt requested, telex or facsimile to:

32
<PAGE>

(i) the intended recipient at the "Address for Notices"
specified below its name on the signature pages hereof, or

(ii) if to any other person who is then the registered holder of
any Registrable Securities, to the address of such holder as it appears in the
note register of the Company and the Guarantors.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all such communications
shall be deemed to have been duly given: when delivered by hand, if personally
delivered; one business day after being timely delivered to a next-day air
courier; five business days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid,
if mailed; when answered back, if telexed; and when receipt is acknowledged by
the recipient's telecopier machine, if telecopied.

(f) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the
---------------------- 
benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of each of
the parties and shall inure to the benefit of each holder of at least $ 100,000
principal amount of Registrable Securities. The Company and the Guarantors may
not assign (except to a successor entity as a result of merger, consolidation or
transfer of all or substantially all assets) their rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each holder of any Registrable
Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no transferee shall have any of the
rights granted under this Agreement until such transferee shall acknowledge its
rights and obligations hereunder by a signed written statement of such
transferee's acceptance of such rights and obligations.

(g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
------------ 
counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and, all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

(h) Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AS APPLIED TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED WITHIN

OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST THE COMPANY AND
THE GUARANTORS IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

(i) Severability. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and
------------ 
not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. If any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and
the parties hereto shall use their reasonable efforts to find and employ an
alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that
contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby
stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have
executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without
including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable.

----------- 
force and effect from and after the earliest of (w) the date on which 10% or

under the Securities Act on or prior to the Effectiveness Date, and (iii) keep
the Shelf Registration continuously effective under the Securities Act until
(the "Effectiveness Period") (A) 24 months following the date on which the Shelf
Registration becomes effective (subject to extension pursuant to Section 4(a)
and the last paragraph of Section 5 hereof) or (B) if sooner, the date following
the date that all Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration have
been sold pursuant thereto; provided that the Effectiveness Period shall be
-------- 
extended to the extent required to permit dealers to comply with the applicable
prospectus delivery requirements under Rule 174 under the Securities Act.

3. Liquidated Damages
------------------

(a) The parties hereto agree that the holders of Registrable
Securities will suffer damages if the Company fails to fulfill its obligations
under Section 2 and that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of
such damages. Accordingly, if, other than primarily as a result of any action
by the holders of Registrable Securities or any of their agents or
representatives, including, without limitation, their Special Counsel, or an
inability on the part of any holder or any of their representatives or agents to
obtain any necessary approval from the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., (i) a Registration Statement relating to the Shelf Registration
is not filed with the SEC on or prior to the Filing Date, (ii) on or prior to
the Effectiveness Date, the Shelf Registration has not become effective under
the Securities Act, or (iii) at any time prior to the end of the Effectiveness
Period the Shelf Registration shall have ceased to be continuously effective
(the Filing Date, in the case of clause (i), the Effectiveness Date, in the case
of clause (ii), and the date on which the Registration Statement ceases to be
continuously effective, in the case of clause (iii), being referred to herein as
the "Event Date"), then the Company agrees to pay, as liquidated damages, and
not as a penalty, to each holder of a Registrable Security, an additional amount

6
<PAGE>

(the "Liquidated Damages") equal to (a) for each day beginning on, and
including, the Event Date and ending on but not including the date the act
required as of such Event Date actually takes place, $.20 per week per $1,000
principal amount of Registrable Securities held by such holder; provided that
-------- 
the Company shall not be required to pay in excess of $.20 per week per $1,000
principal amount of Registrable Securities held by any holder on account of
failures to act as of all such Event Dates.

(b) The Company shall notify the Trustee and Paying Agent under the
Indenture immediately upon the happening of each and every Event Date. The
Company shall pay the Liquidated Damages due on the Registrable Securities by
depositing with the Paying Agent (which may not be the Company for these
purposes), in trust, for the benefit of the holders thereof, at least one
business day prior to the next interest payment date specified by the Indenture,
sums sufficient to pay the Liquidated Damages then due. The Liquidated Damages
due shall be payable on each interest payment date specified by the Indenture to
the record holder entitled to receive the interest payment to be made on such
date. Each obligation to pay Liquidated Damages shall be deemed to accrue from
and including the applicable Event Date.

(c) The parties hereto agree that the liquidated damages provided for
in this Section 3 constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be
suffered by holders of Registrable Securities by reason of the failure of the
Shelf Registration to be filed, to be declared effective or to remain effective,
as the case may be, in accordance with this Agreement.

4. Hold-Back Agreements
--------------------

(a) Restrictions on Sale by Holders of Registrable Securities. Each
--------------------------------------------------------- 
holder of Registrable Securities agrees, if requested (pursuant to a timely
written notice) by the managing underwriters in an underwritten offering or
placement agent in a private offering of the Company's debt securities, not to
effect any private sale or distribution (including a sale pursuant to Rule
144(k) and Rule 144A, but excluding non-public sales to any of its affiliates,
officers, directors, employees and controlling persons) of any of the Notes,
during the period beginning 10 days prior to, and ending 90 days after, the

7
<PAGE>

closing date of the underwritten offering. If a proper request is made pursuant
to this Section 4(a) at any time when a Shelf Registration is effective, then
the time period during which such a Shelf Registration is required to remain
continuously effective for such holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement shall be extended by 100 days.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any holder of Registrable
Securities if such holder is prevented by applicable statute or regulation from
entering into any such agreement.

(b) Restrictions on Public Sale by the Company and Others. The
----------------------------------------------------- 
Company agrees (i) without the written consent of the managing underwriters in
an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof, not to effect any public or
private sale or distribution of its debt securities, including a sale pursuant
to Regulation D or Rule 144A under the Securities Act, during the period
beginning 10 days prior to, and ending 90 days after, the closing date of each
underwritten offering made pursuant to such Registration Statement (provided,
-------- 
however, that such period shall be extended by the number of days from and
- ------- 
including the date of the giving of any notice pursuant to Section 5(c) hereof
to and including the date when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented
or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 5(k) hereof).

5. Registration Procedures
-----------------------

In connection with the Company's registration obligations hereunder, the
Company shall effect such registrations on the appropriate form available for
the sale of the Registrable Securities to permit the sale of Registrable
Securities in accordance with the method or methods of disposition thereof
specified by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
Registrable Securities, and pursuant thereto the Company shall as expeditiously
as possible:

(a) No fewer than 10 Business Days prior to the initial filing of a
Registration Statement or Prospectus and no fewer than two Business Days prior
to the

8
<PAGE>

filing of any amendment or supplement thereto (including any document that would
be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), furnish to
the Special Counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, copies of all such
documents proposed to be filed, which documents (other than those incorporated
or deemed to be incorporated by reference) will be subject to the review of such
Special Counsel and such underwriters, if any, and cause the officers and
directors of the Company, counsel to the Company and independent certified
public accountants to the Company to respond to such inquiries as shall be
necessary, in the opinion of such Special Counsel to such holders and such
underwriters, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the
Securities Act; provided, further, that the Company shall not be deemed to have
-------- ------- 
kept a Registration Statement effective during the applicable period if it
voluntarily takes any action that results in selling holders of the Registrable
Securities covered thereby not being able to sell such Registrable Securities
pursuant to Federal securities laws during that period unless such action is
required under applicable law (and the time period during which such
Registration Statement is required to remain effective hereunder shall be
extended by the number of days during which such selling holders of Registrable
Securities are not able to sell Registrable Securities). The Company shall not
file any such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or
supplements thereto to which the holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities, their Special Counsel, or the managing underwriters, if any, shall
reasonably object on a timely basis; provided, that subject to the clause
preceding subsection (a) of this Section 5, the Company may reasonably and in
good faith file such document in a form required by law or upon advice of its
counsel and make such of the Company's representatives as shall reasonably be
requested by holders' Special Counsel or a managing underwriter, if any,
available for negotiation and discussion in good faith on such document;
provided, however, that in the event that the holders, their Special Counsel or
- -------- ------- 
the managing underwriter make such an objection, the Filing Date and the
Effectiveness Date shall be extended for a period of 60 days;

(b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments, including
post-effective amendments, to each Registration Statement as may be necessary to
keep such

9
<PAGE>

Registration Statement continuously effective for the applicable time period;
cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus
supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any
similar provisions then in force) under the Securities Act; and comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the
disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement during such
period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers
thereof set forth in such Registration Statement as so amended or in such
Prospectus as so supplemented;

(c) Notify the Special Counsel and the managing underwriters, if any,
promptly, (and in the case of (i) (A) in no event less than two Business Days
prior to such filing) and (if requested by any such Person), confirm such notice
in writing, (i) (A) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment is proposed to be filed, and, (B) with respect to a
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC or any other Federal or state
governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement
or related Prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by
the SEC, any state securities commission, any other governmental agency or any
court of any stop order, order or injunction suspending or enjoining the use or
the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose, (iv) if at any time any of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in any agreement (including any underwriting
agreement) contemplated hereby cease to be true and correct in all material
respects, (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to
the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of
the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, and (vi) of the happening of any
event that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or related
Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by
reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any
changes in such Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the
case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of
a

10
<PAGE>

material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, and that in the
case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading;

(d) Use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the issuance of, or, if
issued, obtain the withdrawal of any order enjoining or suspending the use or
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or the lifting of any suspension of
the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment;

(e) If requested by the managing underwriters, if any, or the holders
of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities being
sold in connection with such offering, make all required filings of such
Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable
after the Company has received notification of the matters to be incorporated in
such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
the Company shall not be required to take any action pursuant to this Section
5(e) that would, in the opinion of outside counsel for the Company, violate
applicable law;

(f) Furnish to each holder of Registrable Securities, their Special
Counsel and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, at least one
conformed copy of each Registration Statement and each amendment thereto,
including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and all exhibits to the extent
requested by each holder (including those previously furnished or incorporated
by reference) as soon as practicable after the filing of such documents with the
SEC;

(g) Deliver to each holder of Registrable Securities, their Special
Counsel, and the underwriters, if any, without charge, as many copies of the
Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of prospectus) and each
amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons

11
<PAGE>

reasonably request; and the Company hereby consents to the use of such
Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling
holders of Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if any, in connection
with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such
Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto unless an event occurs under
Paragraph 5(c)(vi) in which case such consent shall not be deemed to be given
until the Company has complied with Paragraph 5(k) or the holders of the
Registrable Securities have received an Advice.

(h) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its
reasonable best efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the holders of
Registrable Securities to be sold or tendered for, the underwriters, if any, and
their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification
(or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable
Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such
jurisdictions within the United States as any holder or underwriter reasonably
requests in writing; keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption
therefrom) effective during the period such Registration Statement is required
to be kept effective and do any and all other acts or things necessary or
advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable
Securities covered by the applicable Registration Statement; provided, however,
-------- ------- 
that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in
any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or to take any action that
would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it
is not then so subject or subject the Company to any tax in any such
jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;

(i) Cooperate with the holders and the managing underwriters, if any,
to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing
Registrable Securities to be sold, which certificates shall not bear any
restrictive legends and shall be in a form eligible for deposit with The

denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriters, if any,
or holders may request at least

12
<PAGE>

two Business Days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities;

(j) Use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered with or
approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities within the United
States, except as may be required solely as a consequence of the nature of such
selling holder's business, in which case the Company will cooperate in all
reasonable respects with the filing of such Registration Statement and the
granting of such approvals as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers
thereof or the underwriters, if any, to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
-------- ------- 
required to register the Registrable Securities in any jurisdiction that would
subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is
not then so subject or subject the Company to any tax in any such jurisdiction
where it is not then so subject or to require the Company to qualify to do
business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified;

(k) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Paragraph
5(c)(vi), as promptly as practicable, prepare a supplement or amendment,
including a post-effective amendment, to each Registration Statement or a
supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to
be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required document so
that, as thereafter delivered, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

(l) Use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable

into such agreements (including an underwriting agreement in form, scope and
substance as is customary in underwritten offerings) and take all such other
reasonable actions in connection therewith (including those reasonably requested
by the managing underwriters, if any, or the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold) in order to expedite
or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities, and in such
connection, whether or not an underwriting agreement is entered into, (i) make
such representations and warranties to the holders of such Registrable
Securities and the underwriters, if any, with respect to the business of the
Company and its subsidiaries, and the Registration Statement, Prospectus and
documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference
therein, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by
issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings, and confirm the same if and
when requested; provided, that any such representations and warranties with

compliance with matters addressed by Rule 10b-5 under the Securities Act and
that the Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC pursuant

of the underwriters, if any, such letters to be in customary form and covering
matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection
with underwritten offerings; (iv) if an underwriting agreement is entered into,
the same shall contain indemnification provisions and procedures no less
favorable to the selling holders and the underwriters, if any, than those set
forth in Section 7 hereof (or such other provisions and procedures acceptable to
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the holders of
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement and the managing
underwriters); and (v) deliver such documents and certificates, other than those
specifically referenced in this clause (o), as may be reasonably requested by

any, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties
made pursuant to clause 5(o)(i) above and to evidence compliance with any
customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or other agreement
entered into by the Company;

(p) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, make available for
inspection by a representative of the holders of Registrable Securities being
sold, any underwriter participating in any such disposition of Registrable

(r) Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and
make generally available to their securityholders earning statements satisfying
the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder

days after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of any
12-month period if such period is a fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of

The Company may require each seller of Registrable Securities as to
which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Company such
information regarding the distribution of such Registrable Securities as is
required by law to be disclosed in the applicable Registration Statement and the
Company may exclude from such registration the Registrable Securities of any
seller who unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a reasonable
time after receiving such request.

16
<PAGE>

If any such Registration Statement refers to any holder by name or
otherwise as the holder of any securities of the Company, then such holder shall
have the right to require (i) the insertion therein of language, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such holder, to the effect that the holding
by such holder of such securities is not to be construed as a recommendation by
such holder of the investment quality of the Company's securities covered
thereby and that such holding does not imply that such holder will assist in
meeting any future financial requirements of the Company, or (ii) in the event
that such reference to such holder by name or otherwise is not required by the
Securities Act or any similar Federal statute then in force, the deletion of the
reference to such holder in any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement filed or prepared subsequent to the time that such reference ceases to
be required.

Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of such
Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the
happening of any event of the kind described in Section 5(c)(ii), 5(c)(iii),
5(c)(v) or 5(c)(vi) hereof, such holder will forthwith discontinue disposition
of such Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement or
Prospectus until such holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or
amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 5(k) hereof, or until it is advised
in writing (the "Advice") by the Company that the use of the applicable
Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received copies of any
additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference in such Prospectus. If the Company shall give any
such notice, the time periods mentioned in Section 2 hereof shall be extended by
the number of days during such periods from and including the date of the giving
of such notice to and including the date when each seller of Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement shall have received (x) the
copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 5(k)
hereof or (y) the Advice, and, in either case, has received copies of any
additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference in such Prospectus.

lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs
(including, without limitation, costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys'
fees) and expenses (collectively, "Losses"), as incurred, arising out of or
based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or form of prospectus or in any

19
<PAGE>

or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or
form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, except to the extent, that such are
finally determined to have been based upon information regarding such Holder
furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such holder expressly for
use therein, and that information was reasonably relied on by the Company in the
preparation thereof; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to
-------- ------- 
the extent that (A) any such Losses arise out of or are based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
any preliminary prospectus if (i) having previously been furnished by or on
behalf of the Company with copies of the Prospectus on a timely basis, such
holder failed to send or deliver a copy of the Prospectus with or prior to the
delivery of written confirmation of the sale by such holder of a Registrable
Security to the person asserting such Losses who purchased such Registrable
Security that is the subject thereof and (ii) the Prospectus would have
adequately corrected such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or such
omission or alleged omission or (B) any such Losses arise primarily out of or
are based primarily upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission in the Prospectus, if such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission is adequately corrected
in an amendment or supplement to the Prospectus (such that there is no longer
any untrue statement of a material fact in the Prospectus or omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading) and if, having previously been furnished by or on behalf
of the Company with copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, the
holder of Registrable Securities thereafter failed to deliver such Prospectus as
so amended or supplemented on a timely basis, prior to or concurrently with the
sale of a Registrable Security to the person asserting such Losses who purchased
such Registrable Security that is the subject thereof from such holder.

(b) Indemnification by Holder of Registrable Securities. In
--------------------------------------------------- 
connection with any Registration Statement in which a holder of Registrable
Securities is participating, such holder of Registrable Securities

20
<PAGE>

shall furnish to the Company in writing such information as the Company
reasonably requests for use in connection with any Registration Statement or
Prospectus and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors,
officers, agents and employees, each Person who controls the Company (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act),
and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling persons, to
the fullest extent lawful, from and against all Losses (as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment not subject to appeal or review)
arising out of or based upon any untrue statement of a material fact contained
in any Registration Statement, Prospectus, or form of prospectus, or arising out
of or based upon any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to the extent, but
only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any
information so furnished in writing by such holder to the Company expressly for
use in such Registration Statement or Prospectus and that such information was
reasonably relied upon by the Company in preparation of such Registration
Statement, Prospectus or form of prospectus. In no event shall the liability of
any selling holder of Registrable Securities hereunder be greater in amount than
the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder upon the sale of the
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. If any Proceeding shall
-------------------------------------- 
be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an
"Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party promptly shall so notify the person
from whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing, and the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the defense thereof; provided,
-------- 
that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, except to
the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review)
that such failure shall have materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

21
<PAGE>

Any such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties, unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party
has agreed to pay such fees and expenses; or (2) the Indemnifying Party shall
have failed promptly to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding
and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any
such action, claim or proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such action,
claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall
have been advised in writing by counsel that an actual conflict of interest may
exist if such counsel represents such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying
Parties in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of
the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying Parties shall not have the right to
assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party), it being understood, however, that, the Indemnifying Party
shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but
substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction
arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the
fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to
any local counsel) at any time for all such Indemnified Parties, which firm
shall be designated in writing by the Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected
without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any proceeding, unless such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability on claims that are or may be the subject matter of such proceeding.

All fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable
fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or
preparing to defend such action or proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with
this Section 7) shall be paid to the Indem-

22
<PAGE>

nified Party, as incurred, within 20 business days of written notice thereof to
the Indemnifying Party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that
an Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided that
-------- 
the Indemnifying Party may require such Indemnified Party to undertake to
reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally judicially
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder).

(d) Contribution. If a claim by an Indemnified Party for
------------ 
indemnification under Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof is found unenforceable in a
final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction (not subject to further
appeal) (even though the express provisions hereof provide for indemnification
in such case), then each applicable Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying
such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that
resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. 
The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to
information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or
payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 7(c), any legal or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation
or Proceeding.

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata
--- ----
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), an Indemnifying Party that
is a holder of Registrable Securities shall not be

23
<PAGE>

required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price at which the securities sold by such Indemnifying Party and distributed to
the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that
such Indemnifying Party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

8. Rules 144 and 144A
------------------

The Company shall use its best efforts to file the reports required to
be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in a timely manner
and, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, it will,
upon the reasonable request of any holder of Registrable Securities, make
publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of
their securities pursuant to Rules 144 and 144A. The Company further covenants
that it will take such further action as any holder of Registrable Securities
may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and
144A. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities, the Company
shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied
with such requirements.

9. Underwritten Registrations
--------------------------

If any of the Registrable Securities covered by any Shelf Registration
are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment
bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected
by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Registrable
Securities included in such offering.

No person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder
unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Person's Registrable Securities on
the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements ap-

24
<PAGE>

proved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b)
completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements.

10. Miscellaneous
-------------

(a) Remedies. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a holder
-------- 
of Registrable Securities of any of their obligations under this Agreement, each
holder of Registrable Securities or the Company, in addition to being entitled
to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be
entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company
and each holder of Registrable Securities agree that monetary damages would not
be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of
any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the
event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall
waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

(b) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not, as of the date
-------------------------- 
hereof, nor shall the Company, without the written consent of the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Registrable
Securities, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement
with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to
the holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts
with the provisions hereof. Except for the Senior Notes Registration Rights
Agreement (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and registration rights granted
to Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich pursuant to the Option Agreement (as defined in
the Placement Memorandum), the Company has not previously entered into any
agreement granting any registration rights with respect to any of its securities
to any person.

(c) No Piggyback on Registrations. Neither the Company, nor any of
----------------------------- 
its securityholders (other than the holders of Registrable Securities in such
capacity pursuant to the applicable Section hereof) may include securities of
the Company or the Guarantors in any Shelf Registration (except to the extent
that the inclusion of such securities by the Company or such securityholder

25
<PAGE>

would not, in the good faith opinion of the managing underwriter selected by the
holders of Registrable Securities, materially and adversely affect the success
of the offering proposed to be made by holders of Registrable Securities).

(d) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement,
---------------------- 
including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof
may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the
holders of a majority of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of
Registrable Securities; provided, however, that, for the purposes of this
-------- ------- 
Agreement, Registrable Securities that are owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company or an Affiliate of the Company are not deemed outstanding. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions
hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of
holders of Registrable Securities whose securities are being sold pursuant to a
Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the
rights of other holders of Registrable Securities may be given by holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold
by such holders pursuant to such Registration Statement; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented,
except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence.

(e) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for
------- 
herein shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, next-day air courier,
certified first-class mail, return receipt requested, telex or facsimile to:

(i) the intended recipient at the "Address for Notices"
specified below its name on the signature pages hereof, or

(ii) if to any other person who is then the registered holder of
any Registrable Securities, to the address of such holder as it appears in the
Note register of the Company.

26
<PAGE>

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all such communications
shall be deemed to have been duly given: when delivered by hand, if personally
delivered; one business day after being timely delivered to a next-day air
courier; five business days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid,
if mailed; when answered back, if telexed; and when receipt is acknowledged by
the recipient's telecopier machine, if telecopied.

(f) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the
---------------------- 
benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of each of
the parties and shall inure to the benefit of each holder of at least $ 100,000
principal amount of Registrable Securities. The Company may not assign (except
to a successor entity as a result of merger, consolidation or transfer of all or
substantially all assets) its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of each holder of any Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no transferee shall have any of the rights granted under this
Agreement until such transferee shall acknowledge its rights and obligations
hereunder by a signed written statement of such transferee's acceptance of such
rights and obligations.

(g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
------------ 
counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and, all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

(h) Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AS APPLIED TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED WITHIN
THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY NEW YORK STATE
COURT SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN OR ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN THE
BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND IRREVOCABLY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT
OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID
COURTS. THE COMPANY IRRE-

27
<PAGE>

VOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY EFFECTIVELY DO SO UNDER APPLICABLE
LAW, TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH
COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH
COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT
THE RIGHT OF ANY HOLDER OF A REGISTRABLE SECURITY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY MANNER
PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST
THE COMPANY IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

(i) Severability. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and
------------ 
not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. If any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and
the parties hereto shall use their reasonable efforts to find and employ an
alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that
contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby
stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have
executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without
including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable.

(j) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
-------- 
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. All
references made in this Agreement to "Section" and "paragraph" refer to such
Section or paragraph of this Agreement unless expressly stated otherwise.

(k) Attorneys' Fees. In any action or proceeding brought to enforce
--------------- 
any provision of this Agreement, or where any provision hereof or thereof is
validly asserted as a defense, the prevailing party, as determined by the court,
shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to any other
available remedy.

28
<PAGE>

(l) Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further
----------- 
force and effect from and after the earliest of (w) the date on which 10% or
less of the Registrable Securities remain outstanding, (x) with respect to any
holder of Registrable Securities, the date on which all of the Notes held by
such holder may be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k), (y) with respect to any holder
of Registrable Securities, the date on which all of the Notes held by such
holder may be sold in a three-month period pursuant to Rule 144 and (z) 7 years
from the date hereof.
