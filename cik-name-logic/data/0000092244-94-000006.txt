SNET ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS 
FROM OPERATIONS UP 17 PERCENT 
ON HIGHER REVENUES AND COST CONTROLS 

Southern New England Telecommunications

Corporation (SNET) -- (NYSE: SNG) -- announced

today first quarter net income for 1994 of $0.68

per share compared with a net loss of $2.89 per

share for the same period last year, when the

company adopted new accounting standards. This

resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge in first-

quarter 1993 of $220 million after taxes or $3.47

per share. Income from operations was up 17.2

percent to $0.68 per share versus $0.58 share for

the first quarter last year.

"Seismic change continues apace in our dynamic

industry. We are moving forward aggressively and

becoming more competitive," said Daniel J.

Miglio, chairman and chief executive officer

referring to SNET's reengineering and marketing

efforts. _ We're reengineering to strengthen our

competitive position. Our marketing efforts have

resulted in our entry into the long-distance

business through SNET America, the introduction

of our video-on-demand trial, and our commitment

to invest $4.5 billion in I-SNET, an information

superhighway that will reach all SNET customers.

This investment will, over the next 15 years,

transform our statewide telecommunications

network and enable us to offer a wealth of

exciting new services," he added.

Consolidated revenues and sales for the first

quarter were up 5.2 percent to $423 million.

Revenue from Southern New England Telephone, the

company's largest subsidiary, increased 4.4

percent in the first quarter to $369 million.

This reflected higher local-service revenue from

rate increases authorized by the Department of

Public Utility Control in July 1993, a 1.8

percent increase in access lines in service, and

continued increases in sales of premium services

like Totalphone[SM]. In-state toll revenue

decreased due to competitive price reductions and

expanded local-calling service that shifted a

portion of toll revenue to local-service

revenues.

Sales from other businesses increased 10

percent led by cellular operations, which were up

44 percent on a growing customer base. Business

systems sales were lower, reflecting our

withdrawal from the PBX market during 1993 in

favor of concentration on SNET's own network-based

centrex services.

Costs and expenses, excluding depreciation,

for the quarter were down 0.6 percent to $250

million. Depreciation and amortization expense

increased 26.9 percent due primarily to higher

depreciation rates authorized by state and federal

regulators. Interest expense declined 16.8

percent because of savings from previous

refinancings and less borrowing.
