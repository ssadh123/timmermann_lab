FOR RELEASE: Wednesday, October 19, 1994

Buoyed by a stronger U.S. economy, as well as rebounding

economic growth abroad, AMR Corporation, parent company of

American Airlines, Inc., today reported third quarter net

earnings of $205 million ($188 million after preferred stock

dividends), or $2.47 per common share ($2.27 fully diluted).

The third quarter 1994 results compare with net earnings of

$118 million, or $1.33 per common share after preferred stock

dividends, for the same period in 1993. The 1993 results include

an extraordinary after-tax loss of $7 million related to the

early retirement of debt.

In addition to improving global economies, AMR attributed

the substantial year-over-year earnings gain to strong showings

on both the revenue and cost sides of the ledger. Operating

revenues increased 0.8 percent to $4.23 billion despite a 5.0

percent year-over-year capacity decline at AMR's largest unit,

American Airlines' Passenger Division. The company cited the

strength of its marketing programs, its

<PAGE> 5

extensive route network, and the superior performance of its

employees as key factors in mitigating the effects of sub-optimal

industry pricing.

AMR's revenue performance was also enhanced by a 15.2

percent revenue increase at AMR Eagle, Inc., the company's

regional airline affiliate, as well as by a 4.5 percent revenue

increase at the Cargo Division. Additionally, the company's

information technology unit, The SABRE Group, boosted its

revenues by 10.4 percent, and its Management Services Group

increased revenues by 13.3 percent.

AMR's operating expenses declined 2.2 percent in the quarter

to $3.74 billion, due largely to aggressive cost control efforts

and a 3.2 percent drop in the price of jet fuel. However, pay

and benefit costs per employee continued to rise.

The combination of improved revenues and lower costs led to

operating earnings of $489 million in the quarter, an improvement

of 31.5 percent year over year.

"We are heartened by these improved results," said AMR's

Chairman, Robert L. Crandall. "They are a reflection of great

progress in many parts of our operation. Most explicitly, they

are a commentary on the hard work and commitment of our people,

who are offering our customers first-rate service.

"In light of our earnings, some may ask if the company still

needs to change," he said. "The answer is that it clearly does."

Crandall noted that low-cost carriers now compete with

American Airlines for almost 40 percent of its domestic traffic

on nonstop routes, a figure which he said is still growing

rapidly. Thus, he said, "Our biggest challenge still lies ahead.

To be successful in the long term, we must structure our company

to be much more cost competitive than it is today. Our objective

must be to report satisfactory financial results, not just in a

single quarter, but on a regular basis."

For the first nine months of 1994, AMR recorded net earnings

of $351 million, or $3.95 per common share after preferred stock

dividends. This compares with net earnings of $143 million, or a

$1.30 per common share after preferred stock dividends, for the

same nine-month period in 1993.

For the nine months, the 1994 results include a favorable

adjustment to revenues of $35 million ($22 million after tax, or

$0.28 per common share) produced by a change in the company's

estimate of the usage patterns of miles awarded by participating

companies in American's AAdvantage frequent flyer program. The

nine-month results for 1993 include a $125 million charge ($79

million after-tax) for the retirement of DC-10 aircraft, and a

positive $115 million adjustment to revenues ($67 million net of

related commission expense and taxes) for a change in estimate

related to passenger revenues.

Segment Information

Pre-tax earnings for third quarter 1994 in the Air

Transportation Group, which includes American Airlines, Inc.'s

Passenger and Cargo Divisions and AMR Eagle, Inc. were $226

million, which produced a pre-tax margin of 5.8 percent; The

SABRE Group, which includes AMR's information technology

businesses, had pre-tax earnings of $98 million, a pre-tax margin

of 24.9 percent; and the Management Services Group, which

includes AMR's airline management, aviation services, training,

consulting and investment service activities, posted pre-tax

income of $12 million, resulting in a pre-tax margin of 8.8

percent for that unit.

These results compare with third quarter 1993 pre-tax

earnings of $134 million in the Air Transportation Group, a

margin of 3.4 percent; pre-tax earnings of $84 million in The

SABRE Group, a margin of 23.6 percent; and pre-tax earnings of $5

million in the

percent; The SABRE Group had pre-tax earnings of $292 million, a

American Airlines' Passenger and Cargo Division Results

American's Passenger Division available seat miles (ASMs, a

measure of capacity) decreased 5.0 percent, from 41.81 billion in

third quarter 1993 to 39.74 billion this year. For the nine

months, ASMs decreased 6.3 percent, from 122.15 billion in 1993

to 114.40 billion in 1994.

American's Passenger Division flew 27.01 billion revenue

passenger miles (RPMs, the number of seats per mile filled by

passengers), in 1994's third quarter, up 1.5 percent from the

26.62 billion flown in third quarter 1993. For the nine months,

RPMs decreased 1.1 percent, from 74.66 billion in 1993 to 73.83

billion in 1994.

American's Passenger Division third quarter load factor (the

percentage of seats filled with passengers) of 68.0 percent was

4
<PAGE> 8

the same period in 1993. For the nine-month period, load factor

increased from 61.1 percent in 1993 to 64.5 percent this year.

American's Passenger Division yield (the average amount one

passenger pays to fly one mile), decreased 3.6 percent, from

12.95 cents in third quarter 1993 to 12.48 cents for the same

period this year. For the nine months, yield fell to 13.09 cents

in 1994 compared with 13.47 cents for the same period in 1993.

American's Passenger Division passenger revenue per

available seat mile (the average amount of revenue earned per

seat, per mile) increased 2.9 percent in the third quarter, from

8.24 cents in 1993 to 8.48 cents this year. For the nine months,

passenger revenue per available seat mile was 8.45 cents in 1994,

a 2.7 percent increase from 8.23 cents in 1993.

American's Passenger Division operating expense per

available seat mile (the average cost to fly one seat for one

mile) in third quarter 1994 was 8.08 cents, a 0.2 percent

increase from the same period a year ago. For the nine-month

period, operating expenses per available seat mile rose 1.5

percent, from 8.24 cents in 1993 to 8.36 cents this year.

Cargo ton miles increased from 454 million in third quarter

1993 to 504 million this year. For the nine months, cargo ton

miles were 1.44 billion in 1994, up 8.5 percent from 1.33 billion

last year.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS

1.Included in Passenger Revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994, is a favorable adjustment of $35 million
produced by a change in the Company's estimate of the usage
patterns of miles awarded by participating companies in
American's AAdvantage frequent flyer program. Included in
Passenger Revenues for the nine months ended September 30,
1993, is a favorable adjustment of $115 million resulting from
a change in estimate relating to certain earned passenger
revenues.

2.Included in Miscellaneous - net for the nine months ended
September 30, 1993, is a $125 million charge related to the
retirement of 31 DC-10 aircraft. The charge represents the
Company's best estimate of the expected loss based upon the
anticipated method of disposition. However, should the
ultimate method of disposition differ, the actual loss could
be different than the amount estimated.

3.In the third quarter of 1993 AMR retired prior to maturity $59
million in face value of long-term debt. The retirement
resulted in an extraordinary loss of $7 million, net of tax
benefit of $5 million.
