UNION PLANTERS CORPORATION
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements
present a balance sheet as of March 31, 1994, and statements of earnings for
the three-month period ended March 31, 1994, and for each of the three years
ended December 31, 1993. The pro forma balance sheet presents certain
acquisitions which were completed subsequent to March 31, 1994, as well as
pending acquisitions, the consummation of which is considered by management to
be probable (the probable acquisitions). The statement of earnings for the
three-month period ended March 31, 1994 and for the twelve-month period ended
December 31, 1993, present the pro forma impact of certain acquisitions
completed in 1993 and 1994 and the probable acquisitions assuming that all of
the acquisitions had been completed at January 1, 1993. Acquisitions accounted
for as poolings of interests and completed in 1993 are included in the
Corporation's 1993 results. Pro forma statements of earnings are also presented
for the two years ended December 31, 1992, to reflect the pending acquisition
of BNF BANCORP, INC. (formerly BANCFIRST Corporation) (BNF), which would be
accounted for as a pooling of interests. Consummation of the BNF acquisition is
considered probable and meets the test for a significant subsidiary. With the
exception of the BNF acquisition, the pro forma impact of the other probable
acquisitions expected to be accounted for as poolings of interests is not
presented because the results of the entities acquired are not considered
significant to consolidated results. The pro forma financial statements should
be read in connection with the Corporation's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1994.
Additionally, the Corporation's Current Reports on Form 8-K dated February 8,
1994, April 14, 1994, and May 18, 1994 contain audited financial statements and
unaudited interim financial statements for BNF BANCORP, INC. Note 1 to these
pro forma financial statements identifies (including the abbreviations for the
company names heading the columns of the statements) the completed and probable
acquisitions included herein.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. CONSUMMATED ACQUISITIONS

The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and statements of
earnings reflect the consummated and the probable acquisitions listed below.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet gives effect to these
transactions at March 31, 1994 as if they had occurred on that date, and the
unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of earnings reflect the impact of
the transactions as if they had occurred January 1, 1993, except for the
acquisition of BNF BANCORP, INC. (formerly BANCFIRST Corporation) (BNF) which
is presented assuming the transaction occurred January 1, 1991. The unaudited
pro forma consolidated results shown are not necessarily indicative of future
operating results, nor can there be any assurance that the pending transactions
will be consummated. For the probable acquisitions expected to be accounted for
as poolings of interests, except BNF, statements of earnings for periods prior
to 1993 are not presented because the transactions are not significant.

(a) The Corporation had previously acquired 17.93% of the common stock of BOET
($3.4 million). On January 1, 1993, the Corporation purchased an
additional 43.93% of the common stock of BOET in exchange for Series E
Preferred Stock ($11.1 million). Effective May 3, 1993, the Corporation
acquired the remaining outstanding common stock of BOET in exchange for
the Corporation's Series E Preferred Stock ($10.8 million).

(b) The Corporation acquired Maryville, a federal mutual savings bank which,
incidental to a conversion/acquisition, converted to a federal stock
charter. All of the stock of Maryville was acquired by the Corporation in
exchange for a capital contribution equalling approximately $14.1 million
derived in part from the proceeds of a public offering of the
Corporation's Common Stock made in connection with the
conversion/acquisition.

-17-
<PAGE> 21
(c) The recording of the acquisition of Maryville using the purchase method of
accounting resulted in negative goodwill of approximately $9.4 million,
$8.1 million of which was deducted from noncurrent, nonmonetary assets
(premises and equipment, fair value adjustment of loans, prepaid software
and mortgage servicing rights). The remaining negative goodwill of $1.3
million was recorded in other liabilities and is being amortized over 7
years.
