Item 5. Other Events.

On April 21, 1994, the Registrant reported second quarter net income
of $73 million, or 65 cents per share, compared to $75 million, or 66 cents per
share, in the year-ago quarter. Last year's second quarter included a 1 cent
per-share gain from a non-operating item. Sales in the quarter rose 3 percent
to $859 million compared to $834 million last year.
In summarizing the quarter, Air Products Chairman H. A. Wagner said
"Major factors included strong volume gains in gases and chemicals, higher
profits in environmental and energy systems, lower polyvinyl alcohol margins,
and reduced equipment business activity."
Industrial gas sales for the quarter increased 7 percent and operating
income rose 2 percent compared to last year. Worldwide volumes in merchant and
on-site gases increased significantly. However, most of the revenue gain was
offset by higher operating and maintenance costs, including those related to
severe winter weather. Average merchant pricing pressures continued in the
United States and Europe.
In chemicals, second quarter sales were up 4 percent while operating
income decreased 13 percent versus last year. While most major product lines
experienced higher volumes, the most significant factor in the quarter's
results was substantially lower polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) margins due to excess
world capacity and intense competition. The company is adjusting PVOH
production levels downward, reducing costs, and focusing on a more profitable
sales mix.

Profits in the environmental and energy systems business increased
significantly over the year-ago quarter. Continued strong results at
cogeneration and waste-to-energy facilities, including the addition of American
Ref-Fuel's Niagara Falls facility, contributed favorably to the quarter.
The Equipment and Technology segment reported lower sales and
operating income versus last year due to decreased levels of manufacturing
activity in the cryogenic air separation and liquefied natural gas equipment
business.
For the first half of fiscal 1994, Air Products reported net income of
$148 million, or $1.31 per share, before the cumulative effect of required
accounting changes, compared with $144 million, or $1.27 per share last year.
This year's first half included non-operating gains of 2 cents while last
year's included 5 cents. Excluding these gains, earnings per share were up 6
percent versus last year. Sales of $1.7 billion were up 2 percent from last
year.

</TABLE>

Fiscal 1993 operating income of the industrial gases segment and corporate and
other have been restated to reflect the current year presentation of Brazilian
conversion gains related to U.S. dollar denominated investments. For the three
months ended 31 March 1993, operating income of the industrial gases segment
was reduced by $2.5 million with a corresponding increase in corporate and
other. For the six months ended 31 March 1993, this reclassification totaled
$4.6 million.

For the six months ended 31 March 1994, corporate and other includes an expense
of $2.3 million for the charitable contribution of the remaining shares of a
stock investment in an insurance company. The tax benefit associated with this
contribution, based on fair value of the investment, was 

<PAGE> 6
$4.6 million. This transaction reduced the effective tax rate from 33.6% to 
31.8% for the six month period ended 31 March 1994.

Effective 1 October 1993, the company adopted and recognized the cumulative
effect of the following accounting standards: SFAS 106- Postretirement
Benefits ($31.3 million charge); SFAS 109-Income Taxes ($55.9 million gain);
and SFAS 112-Postemployment Benefits ($10.3 million charge). The impact of
these accounting changes on income for the six months ended 31 March 1994,
exclusive of the cumulative effect as of 1 October 1993, is not material.

For the second quarter of fiscal 1993, corporate and other includes a gain of
$2.7 million ($1.7 million after tax) from the partial sale of stock options in
an insurance company.

For the six months ended 31 March 1993, equipment and technology's operating
income includes a gain of $3.9 million ($2.4 million after tax) from the sale
of a business venture. In addition, corporate and other includes a gain of
$5.5 million ($3.5 million after tax) from the sale of stock options in an
insurance company.
