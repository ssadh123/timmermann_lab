Item 5. Other Events
- - --------------------

Univar Corporation ("Univar") and Pakhoed Investeringen B.V., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Pakhoed N.V. ("Pakhoed") are the owners
of Univar Europe N.V. Univar owns 51% of Univar Europe and Pakhoed owns
49%.

At the time of the organization of Univar Europe in 1991, Univar
and Pakhoed entered into a Shareholder Agreement which gave Pakhoed a
unilateral right to require Univar to acquire Pakhoed's 49% interest in
Univar Europe.

On May 18, 1994, Pakhoed gave notice to Univar that Pakhoed had
elected to require Univar to purchase Pakhoed's interest in Univar
Europe. Under the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, Univar may
designate the date on which it will purchase said interest, so long as
the actual date of purchase is not later that February 18, 1995. The
date has not been set by Univar.

Because most of the purchase price for Pakhoed's interest will be
paid in various European currencies whose exchange rates fluctuate, the
actual purchase price for Pakhoed's interest in Univar Europe cannot be
determined until the date of purchase occurs. However, the anticipated
purchase price is approximately $25 million.

SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the registrant had duly caused this report to be signed on its
behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
