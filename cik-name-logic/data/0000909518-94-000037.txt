For Immediate Release

JPS Textile Group, Inc. Announces Public Offering For Its Automotive
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Products and Synthetic Industrial Fabrics Businesses
----------------------------------------------------
GREENVILE, SOUTH CAROLINA, February 22, 1994 - JPS Textile Group,
Inc. announced today that registration statements have been filled
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of securities
of a newly formed corporation organized to acquire all the automotive
products and synthetic industrial fabrics operations from JPS Textile
Group.

The transactions contemplated by the registration statements
would result in the operations of JPS's automotive products subsidiary
(JPS Automotive Products Corp.) and the synthetic industrial fabrics
business of another subsidiary (JPS Converter and Industrial Corp.)
becoming a separate publicly owned company.

A newly formed corporation, which would operate as JPS Automotive
Products Corp., intends to acquire the aforementioned businesses,
based on the filing range in the registration statement, for
approximately $258 million and 20% of its outstanding stock. The
acquisition is expected to be financed with the net proceeds from an
initial public offering of 6,500,000 shares of common stock and the
sale of $150 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes.

The acquisition of the automotive and synthetic industrial
fabrics operations is conditioned, among other things, upon the
successful consummation of the public offerings, which is expected to
occur in April 1994. JPS Textile Group intends to utilize the net
proceeds to retire its indebtedness in accordance with the terms of
its indentures and credit agreement.

Registration statements relating to the offerings of common stock
and senior notes have been filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on February 18, 1994 but have not yet become effective. 
These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted
prior to the time the registration statements become effective. This
release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of
an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in
any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful
prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of
any such state.

JPS Textile Group, Inc. is one of the largest diversified
domestic manufacturers of textile and textile related products,
principally for the apparel fabric, industrial and home fashion
markets.
