NEW ORLEANS -- Hibernia Corporation announced it has signed a
definitive agreement to merge with the $93-million-asset American
Bank, headquartered in Norco. 
The transaction will significantly expand Hibernia's coverage
of the river Parishes area outside New Orleans, a rapidly growing
industrial region, by giving it five banking offices in St. Charles
Parish: one each in Norco, Boutte, Destrehan, Hahnville and
Luling.
Based on Hibernia's Friday closing price of $8.125 per share,
shareholders of American Bank would receive approximately 4.6
shares of Hibernia stock for each share of American stock in a tax-
free pooling of interests valued at approximately $18.3 million. 
The transaction is subject to approvals by regulators and American
shareholders and should be completed in early 1995.
"Customers have valued their relationship with American Bank
because we've made service our top priority," said Darryl Chauvin,

president of the almost 30-year-old bank. "Hibernia will enhance
that commitment to service and offer our customers financial
products that haven't been available before."
Chauvin referred to Hibernia's upgraded and expanded statewide
ATM network, brokerage, trust services and private banking, among
others. 
"St. Charles Parish is home to some of Louisiana's most
important and promising industries, as well as small businesses and
growing residential communities," said Hibernia president and CEO
Stephen A. Hansel. "A partnership with American Bank and its
excellent employees will improve our ability to serve businesses
and consumers upriver from New Orleans."
American customers will not see any changes for a number of
months. Only after the bank is converted to Hibernia's operating
systems would checks, signs and forms change. Until then, American
customers should continue using their checks, making loan payments
and conducting other transactions just as before.
Hibernia National Bank is Louisiana's largest statewide bank. 
When the American Bank and other pending mergers are complete, it
will have $6.3 million in assets and 152 banking offices serving
New Orleans and the River Parishes, Baton Rouge, Lafayette and the
Acadiana region, Alexandria, Shreveport and northwest Louisiana,
and the northeast, including Monroe, West Monroe, Bastrop and
Tallulah.
