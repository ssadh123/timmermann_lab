Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Form 8-K") filed
by Michaels Stores, Inc. on May 23, 1994. Item 5 of the Form 8-K is hereby
amended to read it its entirety as follows:

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

LEEWARDS CREATIVE CRAFTS, INC. ACQUISITION

On May 10, 1994, Michaels Stores, Inc. ("Michaels" or the "Company")
announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement (the "Agreement and
Plan of Merger") for the acquisition (the "Leewards Acquisition") of Leewards
Creative Crafts, Inc. ("Leewards"), an Illinois-based arts and crafts retailer
with approximately 100 stores located primarily in the midwestern and
northeastern United States (the "Merger"). Following the Leewards Acquisition,
the Company expects to close approximately 20 Leewards stores and
approximately 5 to 10 Michaels stores due to overlapping locations.

The Agreement and Plan of Merger provides for an aggregate merger
consideration not to exceed 1,550,000 shares of the Michaels common stock, par
value $.10 per share ("Michaels Common Stock"). The aggregate consideration is
(i) subject to certain downward adjustments and (ii) payable, in part, in cash
in lieu of shares with respect to certain shares of preferred stock and the
net value of outstanding options to purchase Leewards common stock. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the Company will also repay the indebtedness under
Leewards' bank credit facility and subordinated notes. Substantially all of
the conditions to the consummation of the Leewards Acquisition have been
satisfied, including approval of Leewards' stockholders and termination of the
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.
Consummation of the acquisition is nevertheless subject to certain customary
conditions to closing, including there having occurred no material adverse
changes in the condition (financial or otherwise), operations, assets or
liabilities of the Company or Leewards. The Leewards Acquisition is expected
to close on or before July 8, 1994. The Company has filed a Registration
Statement on Form S-3 (No. 33-53639), as amended, relating to a public offering
of Michaels Common Stock, which is expected to close following the closing of
the Leewards Acquisition. The offering includes the sale by certain Leewards
stockholders of shares of Michaels Common Stock to be received by them in
connection with the Merger. Under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, if the
Company consummates an underwritten offering of Michaels Common Stock on or
before the closing of the Leewards Acquisition resulting in net proceeds per
share of at least $39.00, the total number of shares of Michaels Common Stock
to be issued in connection with the Merger shall be reduced by a number of
shares (the "Reduced Share Number") equal to 25% of the total number of shares
sold in such offering excluding the underwriters overallotment option (not to
exceed 500,000 shares), and, in lieu thereof, cash equal to the net proceeds
per share multiplied by the Reduced Share Number shall be distributed in
connection with the Merger.

Michaels expects to incur a pretax charge in the quarter in which the
Leewards Acquisition is consummated. The charge will relate to the cost of
closing approximately 5 to 10 existing Michaels store locations in connection
with the integretion of Leewards. In accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, the cost of closing the Company's existing store
locations will be expensed while the cost of closing the acquired Leewards
store locations will be included as an adjustment to the purchase price of
the acquisition.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS

In February 1994, the Company acquired Treasure House Stores, Inc., a
chain of nine arts and crafts stores operating primarily in the Seattle market,
for 280,000 shares of Michaels Common Stock. In April 1994, the Company
acquired the affiliated arts and crafts store chains of Oregon Craft & Floral,
with eight stores located primarily in the Portland, Oregon area, and H&H
Craft & Floral, with eight stores located in southern California, for a total
of 455,000 shares of Michaels Common Stock. The Treasure House stores have
been converted to the Michaels format and the Oregon Craft & Floral and the
H&H Craft and Floral stores are being converted to the Michaels format with
grand openings scheduled for July through August of this year.

NEW CREDIT FACILITY

In June 1994, Michaels entered into a new three-year, unsecured $150
million revolving credit facility to replace its existing $100 million
revolving credit facility.

Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements of Michaels and Leewards

<PAGE>
PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of income of the
Company for the year ended January 30, 1994 and the quarter ended May 1, 1994
have been prepared as if the Leewards Acquisition, which will be accounted for
by the purchase method of accounting, occurred on February 1, 1993, the
beginning of fiscal year 1993. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined
balance sheet of the Company as of May 1, 1994 has been prepared as if the
Leewards Acquisition occurred on that date.

The historical financial information of the Company and Leewards has been
derived from the respective historical financial statements incorporated by
reference or included herein. Certain amounts in the statements of operations of
Leewards for fiscal year 1993 and the quarter ended May 1, 1994 included in the
pro forma combined statements of income have been reclassified to conform to the
method of presentation used by Michaels. The pro forma adjustments are
preliminary and are based upon available information and assumptions that
management of the Company believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma
combined financial statements do not purport to represent the financial position
or results of operations which would have occurred had such transactions been
consummated on the dates indicated or the Company's financial position or
results of operations for any future date or period. These unaudited pro forma
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical financial
statements of the Company and Leewards.

The pro forma combined financial statements do not include the financial
statements of 1) Treasure House, which was acquired by the Company in February
1994 and will be accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method of
accounting, or 2) Oregon Craft & Floral and H&H Craft & Floral, which were
acquired as of May 1, 1994 and will be accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting, since the acquisitions are not considered material, individually
or in the aggregate, to the operating results or financial position of the
Company. Sales of Treasure House were approximately $15.6 million and $3.8
million for the year ended January 30, 1994 and the quarter ended May 1, 1994,
respectively. Combined sales of Oregon Craft & Floral and H&H Craft & Floral for
the same periods were approximately $41.8 million and $7.4 million,
respectively.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

Adjustments to the pro forma combined statement of income to reflect the
consummation of the Leewards Acquisition as of February 1, 1993 are as follows:

(A) Revenues and related operating expenses of 20 overlapping Leewards
stores to be closed subsequent to the consummation of the Leewards
Acquisition have not been eliminated from the pro forma combined statements
of income since revenues are expected to increase in nearby Michaels stores.
The revenues of the 20 Leewards stores to be closed totaled $30.5 million
for the year ended January 30, 1994 and $7.0 million for the quarter ended
May 1, 1994.

(B) To eliminate nonrecurring costs, primarily rental and related
occupancy costs, associated with the Leewards distribution center, net of
incremental costs to be incurred at the Company's distribution center. Upon
consummation of the Leewards Acquisition and completion of the conversion of
the Leewards stores, the Leewards distribution center is to be closed.

(C) To adjust selling, general and administrative expense to (i) account
for pre-opening costs incurred by Leewards consistent with the Company's
accounting policy whereby pre-opening costs are expensed in the fiscal year
in which the store opens by increasing (decreasing) expense by $2.0 million
and $(840,000) for the year ended January 30, 1994 and the quarter ended May
1, 1994, respectively, and (ii) eliminate nonrecurring costs, primarily
salaries and related benefits, associated with reductions of Leewards
corporate personnel and other costs of approximately $1.6 million and
$494,000 for the year ended January 30, 1994 and the quarter ended May 1,
1994, respectively.

(D) To amortize costs in excess of net assets acquired over a 40-year
period on a straight-line basis. The Company will assess the recoverability
of costs in excess of net assets acquired annually based on existing facts
and circumstances. The Company will generally consider projected earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, on an undiscounted
basis, as the on-going measure of recoverability.

(E) To reduce the interest expense on the Leewards indebtedness
consisting of approximately $17 million of subordinated debentures and
short-term borrowings (average outstanding borrowings approximated $11.5
million for the year ended January 30, 1994 and $16.8 million for the
quarter ended May 1, 1994) from their stated rates of 13.5% and 7.75%,
respectively, to 4.9%, which rate approximates the Company's incremental
borrowing rate for both of the periods presented. In connection with the
Leewards Acquisition, the Leewards subordinated debentures and short-term
borrowings are required to be repaid.

(F) To reflect the tax effects applicable to the above entries,
exclusive of the amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired, at
a 40% effective tax rate.

Adjustments to the pro forma balance sheet to reflect the consummation
of the Leewards Acquisition as of May 1, 1994 are as follows:

(G) To record the costs of the Leewards Acquisition. Cash payments and
shares issued are based on an assumed five day average closing stock price
of $40.50.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors
Leewards Creative Crafts, Inc.
Elgin, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Leewards Creative Crafts,
Inc. as of January 31, 1993 and January 30, 1994 and the related statements of
operations, of redeemable preferred stock and common stockholders' equity, and
of cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Leewards Creative Crafts, Inc. as of January
31, 1993 and January 30, 1994 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 11, the Company has entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the "Agreement") whereby it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASIS OF PRESENTATION -- The accompanying
financial statements and related footnote disclosures of Leewards Creative
Crafts, Inc. (the "Company") as of May 1, 1994 and for the three months then
ended and for the three months ended May 2, 1993 are unaudited. In the opinion
of management, these statements have been prepared on the same basis as the
audited financial statements and include all adjustments, which are of a normal
and recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. The results of operations for the three
months ended May 1, 1994 and May 2, 1993 are not necessarily indicative of the
results which may be expected for the entire year.

OPERATIONS AND RESTRUCTURING

The Company engages in the retail sale of craft and home decor products. The
Company maintained the following number of Company-operated and franchised
stores at:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
COMPANY-
OPERATED FRANCHISES TOTAL
--------------- --------------- -----
<S> <C> <C> <C>
January 31, 1993......................................................... 85 2 87
January 30, 1994......................................................... 99 3 102
</TABLE>

During the year ended January 31, 1993, the Company effected a restructuring
of its debt (Note 4), capital structure (Note 6) and ongoing operations. Costs
associated with these efforts, other than those directly associated with the
debt and capital restructurings, are included in restructuring expenses. Such
expenses include store closing, severance and other costs incurred in connection
with these efforts.

FISCAL YEAR-END -- The Company's fiscal year-end is the Sunday closest to
January 31.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents include cash; amounts
due from major credit card companies, which are collected within 1 to 2 days
after date of sale; and highly liquid investments which, at time of purchase,
have maturities of three months or less.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES -- Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower
of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market. During the year ended January 31,
1993, LIFO inventories were reduced from levels at the beginning of the year,
which reduction of LIFO inventory quantities had no material effect on 1993
operating earnings. Inventories at January 31, 1993, January 30, 1994, May 2,
1993 and May 1, 1994 were valued at market which was lower than LIFO cost.

PRE-OPENING COSTS -- Pre-opening costs incurred for the opening of retail
locations are deferred and amortized over 12 months, commencing in the month
after the location opens. Unamortized deferred pre-opening costs included in
prepaid expenses were $97,000 and $2,208,000 at January 31, 1993 and January 30,
1994, respectively.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT -- Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Buildings and improvements.................. 25-30 years
Leasehold improvements...................... Shorter of lease term or 10 years
Machinery and equipment..................... 3-10 years
</TABLE>

INTANGIBLE ASSETS -- Intangible assets, primarily the trade name, and
favorable lease agreements, are reported net of accumulated amortization. The
assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives
which range from 3 to 40 years.

INCOME TAXES -- The Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," in the year ended January 31, 1993 and, accordingly, computes deferred
taxes using the liability method.

LEEWARDS CREATIVE CRAFTS, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES: (CONTINUED)

tax rate in effect when these differences are expected to reverse.

(a) In August 1988, the Company entered into a secured revolving credit and
term loan agreement (the "agreement") which enabled the Company to borrow up to
a maximum of $25,000,000. On June 13, 1990, the Company restructured the
agreement to provide for additional borrowings up to $32,000,000 through August
19, 1993. On April 2, 1993 the borrowing limit was reduced to $29,920,000.

4. LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)
Borrowings outstanding under the agreement are (in 000's):

<TABLE>

1993 1994

<S> <C> <C>
Revolving loans............................................................ $ 4,235 $ 14,067
Term loan.................................................................. 3,113 1,458
----------- -----------
Total.................................................................... $ 7,348 $ 15,525
----------- -----------
----------- -----------
</TABLE>

The borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by the assets of the
Company. Interest is payable monthly based on the rate of interest publicly
announced by Citibank in New York, New York as Citibank's "base rate" ("Base
Rate"). In the year ended January 30, 1994, the interest rate was Base Rate plus
2% for the period from February 1, 1993 to April 2, 1993 and Base Rate plus
1.75% for the period from April 3, 1993 to January 30, 1994. During the prior
year ended January 31, 1993, the interest rate was Base Rate plus 5% for the
period from February 3, 1992 to June 22, 1992 and Base Rate plus 2% for the
period from June 23, 1992 to January 31, 1993. In the year ended January 30,
1994, the interest rate fluctuated between 7.75% and 8.0% and was 7.75% at
year-end; in the prior year, the rate fluctuated between 8.0% and 11.5% and was
8.0% at year-end.

Under the revolving credit loan, as restructured, the full availability of
this credit line is contingent on the cost of collateralized inventory, less
certain adjustments. Commitment fees on the revolving loan are one-half of one
percent of the average daily unused portion of the total facility, payable
monthly.

The term loan, as restructured, requires quarterly principal payments of
$413,750 and the balance on August 19, 1994.

The Company is in the preliminary stages of negotiating a new and expanded
credit facility.

In consideration for expanding the credit facility, the Company paid a
one-time fee of $200,000 and issued warrants to Citicorp to purchase 3,250
shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, subject to adjustment
under certain antidilution provisions. The warrants are exercisable from the
date of issuance at $141.65 per share and expire the later of June 13, 1995 or
upon full payment of the credit facility.

The agreement has covenants providing for mandatory prepayment provisions
and requiring the Company to meet specified financial ratios and income tests.
Such tests include, but are not limited to, net worth and earnings before
interest, depreciation and taxes. The covenants impose limitations on, among
other things, the amount of capital expenditures for each year, creating or
incurring liens, and selling assets or granting guarantees, and prohibit
declaring or paying dividends on common stock unless specifically permitted
under the terms of the agreement. The Company has received waivers for all
events of noncompliance with such covenants during the fiscal year ended January
31, 1993. The Company was not in compliance with all covenants at January 30,
1994 and at May 1, 1994. Accordingly, at those dates, all amounts outstanding
under the agreement were due on demand (See Note 11).

(b) In August 1988, the Company sold $14,884,000 of subordinated debentures
to a related party. Interest is payable semi-annually at 13.5%. Annual principal
payments of $3,742,000 begin May 15, 1997 and the remaining balance is due May
15, 2000. Included in interest expense are $2,285,000 and $2,137,000 for the
years ended January 30, 1994 and January 31, 1993, respectively, for the
indebtedness.

The debentures contain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness,
liens, and the incurrence of other subordinated indebtedness, and restrict
payments such as dividends on common stock. The Company has received waivers for
all events of noncompliance with such covenants during the

F-12

4. LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)

fiscal year ended January 31, 1993. At January 30, 1994, and at May 1, 1994,
because of cross default provisions with respect to the agreement referred to in
(a) above, all amounts outstanding at those dates under the subordinated
debentures also were due on demand and have been classified as currently payable
(See Note 11).

(c) RESTRUCTURING -- On June 22, 1992, the subordinated debentures were
restructured and amended to provide, among other things, for the interest
payments due on May 15 and November 15, 1992 to be made in the form of
additional promissory notes ("accrual notes") in the principal amount of the
interest payable at each date. The accrual notes bear interest at 13.5% per
annum, payable semi-annually, and $1,038,000 was due on March 15, 1994 with the
balance due on November 15, 1994. All amounts due under these debentures remain
unpaid at May 1, 1994.

In addition, an acquirer of the Class C Senior Convertible Stock (Note 6)
acquired $5,000,000 of the subordinated debentures.

Scheduled principal maturities of long-term debt classified as current for
fiscal years subsequent to January 30, 1994 are as follows (in 000's):

Unamortized deferred financing costs of $892,000 and $656,000 at January 31,
1993 and January 30, 1994, respectively, consist of professional and commitment
fees incurred in connection with the Company's revolving and term loan facility
and subordinated debentures. Such costs are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the related debt.

5. PENSION PLAN
The Company has a defined benefit pension plan for its hourly workers with
benefits based on a fixed dollar rate per year of service. The plan assets are
invested primarily in short-term bonds and in equity securities. The Company's
funding policy is to contribute annually the minimum amount required by the
applicable Internal Revenue Code regulation. In April 1992, as part of a series
of cost reductions, the Company froze the hourly pension plan. As a result,
there will be no new entrants to the plan and no additional benefits accruing to
current participants beyond those earned as of the date the plan was frozen.

balance from day to day outstanding under the Notes, shall be due and payable as
it accrues on the last day of each Interest Period and on the Maturity Date with
respect to any Borrowing under the Loan; provided that, with respect to any

the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuance thereof, after
notice to Company by Administrative Lender, all Advances outstanding under the

Lawful Rate and the Base Rate plus 5%.

Section 2.13 PAYMENTS ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS. Whenever any payment to be
made hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not
a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest shall be
payable at the applicable rate during such extension; except that as to a
Eurodollar Rate Borrowing, if the next succeeding Business Day is in the next
calendar month, then the due date shall be the immediately preceding Business

Section 2.20(c) hereof, Company shall not make any prepayments on any portion of
any Eurodollar Rate Borrowing on a day which is not the last day of the

Notes, and thereafter to all other Obligations.

20
<PAGE>

Section 2.15 MANDATORY PREPAYMENT.

(a) MONTHLY. Company shall make mandatory prepayments under the Loan if,
as of the last day of any Fiscal Month, the sum of the (i) total principal
amount of all outstanding Advances, plus (ii) the aggregate face amount of all

such excess within the earlier of (I) 5 Business Days after Company's actual

less than the product of $200,000 times the number of store locations operating

Section 2.16 MANNER AND PLACE OF PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS. All payments
and prepayments of principal and interest on the Notes shall be made to
Administrative Lender for the account of Lenders in their Pro Rata Parts, at its
office at 901 Main Street, Dallas, Texas 75202, in immediately available funds.

Section 2.17 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Subject to Section 10.15 hereof,
interest on (a) Base Rate Borrowings shall be calculated on the basis of a year
of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, for the actual number of the days
elapsed, and (b) interest on Eurodollar Rate Borrowings, fees and other amounts
owed hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days, for the
actual number of days elapsed. Any changes in the rate of interest on the Notes
resulting from changes in the Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening
of business on the day on which such change in the Base Rate shall occur.

Section 2.18 INTEREST RECAPTURE. If at any time the interest rate
applicable to any Advance under the Loan or any other extension of credit
pursuant to this Agreement shall exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, thereby causing
the interest on such Advance or other extension of credit to be limited to the
Highest Lawful Rate, then any subsequent reduction in such interest rate as
provided hereunder shall not reduce the rate of interest on the Loan below the
Highest Lawful Rate until the aggregate amount of interest accrued on the Loan
equals the aggregate amount of interest which would have accrued on the Loan if
the interest rate had not been limited to the Highest Lawful Rate.

Section 2.19 INDEMNITY PROVISIONS. Company agrees to indemnify Lenders
against, and pay to Administrative Lender on behalf of any such Lender on
demand, amounts equal to: (i) the cost of any present and future reserve or
special deposit requirements or any taxes (other than federal, state, or local
taxes on or measured by the overall income of Lender or the portion thereof
allocable to the applicable jurisdiction), domestic or foreign, which any

21
<PAGE>

Lender is required to keep or pay by reason of its funding any Eurodollar Rate
Borrowing (other than reserves which are already reflected in determining the
rate of interest in accordance with the terms hereof); (ii) any costs or
expenses incurred by any Lender as a result of Company's failure to borrow a
portion of an Advance to bear interest at a Eurodollar Rate once requested
and/or Company's payment or conversion for any reason (including without
limitation a payment under Section 2.15 hereof or a conversion under Section
2.20(c) hereof) of all or a portion of any Eurodollar Rate Borrowings prior to
the end of the Interest Period and/or Company's failure to make any payment
hereunder when due, including, without limitation, any loss arising from the
reemployment of funds at rates lower than the cost to such Lender of such funds.
A certificate of such Lender, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
the determination of such costs and expenses, shall constitute PRIMA FACIE
evidence of such costs and expenses, absent manifest error.

Section 2.20 LIMITATION ON EURODOLLAR RATE BORROWINGS. If, at any time
during the term of this Agreement Administrative Lender or any Lender reasonably
determines that:

(a) eurodollar deposits in the appropriate amount and for the
appropriate period are not being offered in the interbank eurodollar
market, Administrative Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to Company
(and such determination shall be conclusive on Company), and thereafter no
new Eurodollar Rate Borrowings shall be permitted until such time as
eurodollar deposits for the appropriate amount and for the appropriate
period are again offered in the interbank eurodollar market; or

(b) as a result of changes in the Law, or the adoption or making of
any interpretations, directives, or regulations (whether or not having the
force of law) by any court, governmental authority, or reserve bank charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, the Eurodollar Rate will
not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lenders of making,
maintaining, or funding a proposed Eurodollar Rate Borrowing that Company
has requested be made or continued, then Administrative Lender shall
promptly give notice to Company of such determination, and any such
requested Advance shall bear interest at the Base Rate; or

(c) as a result of changes in the Law, or the adoption or making of
any interpretations, directives, or regulations (whether or not having the
force of law) by any court, governmental authority, or reserve bank charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, it shall be or become
unlawful or impossible to make, maintain, or fund any Eurodollar Rate
Borrowing, Lenders' obligations to make or continue the affected Eurodollar
Rate Borrowing shall be automatically canceled, and the affected Eurodollar
Rate Borrowing or Borrowings shall be automatically converted to an Advance
bearing interest at the Base Rate, and Company shall pay Administrative
Lender any additional cost or expense which any Lender incurs as a result
of any such conversion prior to the last day of the then current Interest
Period for such Eurodollar Rate Borrowings, in accordance with Section 2.19
hereof.

22
<PAGE>

Section 2.21 DETERMINATION OF INTEREST RATES. Administrative Lender
shall determine each interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Rate Borrowings
hereunder, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. Administrative Lender shall, at the request of Company, furnish
such information concerning the calculation of the interest rate on any
Eurodollar Rate Borrowing as Company may reasonably request.

Section 2.22 CONTINUATION/CONVERSION. Subject to the limitations and
provisions of this Agreement, Company shall have the option, at any time or from
time to time, of continuing or converting the applicable interest rate to all or
any portion of the outstanding Advances, by giving Administrative Lender a
Notice of Borrowing/Conversion of any proposed continuation or conversion of
such rate which, in the case of telephonic notice, shall be promptly confirmed
in writing and, in each case, shall be irrevocable. All telephonic notices of
continuation or conversion shall be made to NationsBank of Texas, N.A., attn.:
Molly Oxford, telephone (214) 508-3255, or (800) 547-2005, facsimile (214) 508-
2515, or such other person as Administrative Lender may from time to time
specify. Each Notice of Borrowing/Conversion shall be given by an Authorized
Financial Officer not later than 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time on the date of
any proposed continuation of or conversion to a Base Rate Borrowing, and not
later than 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time at least three Business Days prior to
any proposed continuation of or conversion to a Eurodollar Rate Borrowing. Each
Notice of Borrowing/Conversion shall specify: (i) the rate (Base Rate or
Eurodollar Rate) which Company desires; (ii) the principal amount proposed to be
covered; (iii) the effective date of such continuation or conversion (which
shall be a Business Day); and (iv) a proposed Interest Period for any Borrowing
bearing interest at an Eurodollar Rate. Any continuation or conversion of any
Advances to a Eurodollar Rate shall be in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000.
Any continuation or conversion of any Advances to a Eurodollar Rate Borrowing
shall be in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of
$100,000 in excess thereof.

Section 2.23 EFFECT OF FAILURE TO GIVE NOTICE. If Company fails to give
Administrative Lender a Notice of Borrowing/Conversion prior to the expiration
of any then-relevant Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Rate
Borrowing or the information provided in any Notice of Borrowing/Conversion is
incomplete, Company shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar
Rate Borrowing, in whole, to a Base Rate Borrowing at the end of the
then-relevant Interest Period.

Section 2.24 CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If any Lender shall have determined that
the adoption of any Applicable Law or guideline regarding the amount of capital
required to be maintained by any Lender, or any change in such Law or guideline,
or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Tribunal,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance therewith by any such Lender (or any
lending office of such any Lender) with any directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of Law) of any such Tribunal, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Lender's capital as a direct consequence of its obligations hereunder to
a level below that which such Lender

23
<PAGE>

could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then,
such Lender shall immediately notify Company and Administrative Lender (such
notice referred to herein as the "Reimbursement Notice"), and, subject to
Section 2.30 hereof, Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction to the extent not
compensated for in the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, or in amounts paid by
Company pursuant to Sections 2.19 or 2.20 hereof. Amounts payable to any such
Lender under this Section and comparable provisions in agreements with other
borrowers of such Lender shall be allocated among such Lender's borrowers in
good faith and on an equitable basis (which may include a consideration of
relative credit risk). A certificate of such Lender in reasonable detail
setting forth the amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such
Lender (or participating banks or other entities pursuant to Section 10.02
hereof) as specified in this Section 2.24 shall be delivered to Company and
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Subject to Section 2.29 hereof,
Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate
upon demand by such Lender.

Section 2.25 SHARING OF PAYMENTS. Any Lender obtaining a payment
(whether voluntary or involuntary, due to the exercise of any right of set-off,
or otherwise) on account of Loan or Reimbursement Obligations in excess of its
Pro Rata Part shall purchase from each other Lender such participation in the
Loan and Reimbursement Obligations as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment Pro Rata with each other Lender;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be
rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest. Company agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation
from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.25, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, may exercise all its Rights of payment (including the Right of
set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the
direct creditor of Company in the amount of such participation. A Lender shall
not be required to share any such non-routine payment to the extent that it
exceeds the aggregate amount of all Loan and Reimbursement Obligations then
outstanding.

Section 2.26 NON-RECEIPT OF FUNDS BY ADMINISTRATIVE LENDER. Unless
Administrative Lender shall have been notified by a Lender prior to the date of
any proposed Advance to be made by such Lender or payment of its Specified
Percentage to Administrative Lender under any provision of this Agreement (which
notice shall be effective upon receipt), that such Lender does not intend to
make the proceeds of any such Advance or reimbursement required under any
provision of this Agreement available to Administrative Lender, Administrative
Lender may assume that such Lender has made such proceeds available to
Administrative Lender on such date and Administrative Lender may in reliance
upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to Company a
corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made
available to Administrative Lender by such Lender, Administrative Lender shall
be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender (or, if such
Lender fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand, from Company)
together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the

24
<PAGE>

period commencing on the date such amount was available to Company and ending on
(but excluding) the date Administrative Lender recovers such amount at a per
annum rate equal to the effective rate for overnight federal funds as reported
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for each applicable Business Day (or, if
such day is not a Business Day, for the next preceding Business Day).

Section 2.27 CALCULATION OF RATES. The provisions of this Agreement
relating to calculation of the Eurodollar Rate are included only for the purpose
of determining the rate of interest or other amounts to be paid hereunder that
are based upon such rate, it being understood that each Lender shall be entitled
to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of a Eurodollar Rate
Borrowing as it sees fit. All such determinations hereunder, however, shall be
made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained funding of each
Eurodollar Rate Borrowing through the purchase in the London Interbank Market of
one or more Eurodollar deposits in an amount equal to the principal amount of
such Advance and having a maturity corresponding to such Interest Period.

Section 2.28 BOOKING ADVANCES. Any Lender may make, carry or transfer
Advances at, to or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of
any affiliate.

Section 2.29 QUOTATION OF RATES. It is hereby acknowledged that the
Authorized Financial Officer on behalf of Company may call Administrative Lender
on or before the date on which notice of an elective interest rate is to be
delivered by the Authorized Financial Officer on behalf of Company in order to
receive an indication of the Eurodollar Rate then in effect, but that such
projection shall not be binding upon Administrative Lender or Lenders nor affect
the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is
made.

Section 2.30 REPLACEMENT BY COMPANY OF A LENDER.

(a) CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If any Lender has requested compensation in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.24 hereof and (i) such request is not the
result of any uniform changes in the statutes or regulations for capital
adequacy, (ii) there exists no Default or Event of Default hereunder, and
(iii) Company and such Lender are unable to reach a written agreement regarding
such request within 30 days following written notice by such Lender to Company
and Administrative Lender of such request, then after the expiration of 30 days
following the delivery of the Reimbursement Notice, Company may (A) replace such
Lender in whole with another Eligible Assignee reasonably acceptable to
Administrative Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, or (B)
reduce the Commitment in the full amount of such Lender's Specified Percentage
of the Commitment and repay such Lender in full. So long as Company
accomplishes the replacement or repayment of such Lender within 60 days
following the delivery of the Reimbursement Notice, Company shall not owe any
such Lender any amounts under Section 2.24 hereof. If Company does not
accomplish either replacement or repayment of such Lender within such 60 days,
Company shall owe such Lender in accordance with the terms of any written
agreement reached

25
<PAGE>

between such Lender and Company, and, if no such agreement has been reached,
Company shall owe such Lender in accordance with the terms and provisions of
Section 2.24 hereof. If the Commitment is reduced by Company pursuant to this
Section 2.30(a), Company and Lenders agree that the Specified Percentages of
each Lender will be automatically ratably adjusted to reflect such reduction of
the Commitment. Each Lender agrees to the automatic readjustment of each
remaining Lender's contingent liabilities under Section 3.04 hereof according to
the new (adjusted) Specified Percentages.

(b) ACQUIRED LENDER. If any Lender is acquired by or merges with any
other Person (including any other Lender) and (i) such Lender is not the
surviving Person, and (ii) there exists no Default or Event of Default
hereunder, Company may replace such Lender in whole with another Eligible
Assignee acceptable to Administrative Lender pursuant to an Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement within thirty days following the date of consummation of
any such Acquisition.

(c) CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. If (a) there exists no Default or Event of
Default on any such date and no Default or Event of Default shall be caused by
the action permitted below and (b) any Lender refuses to consent to any
amendment, waiver or consent to any provision hereof or in any Loan Paper in
accordance with the terms of Section 10.10 hereof (other than an amendment to
increase the Commitment of such Lender), but to which each other Lender has
previously agreed, then, Company may, with the prior written consent of
Administrative Lender, within 90 days after the date of such consent, amendment
or waiver, replace such Lender in whole with another Eligible Assignee, pursuant
to an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and otherwise in accordance with the
terms of Section 10.02 hereof.

conditions of this Agreement and each Application, each Lender agrees that
Administrative Lender shall, and Administrative Lender agrees on behalf of
Lenders in their Pro Rata Part to, issue Commercial Letters of Credit and
Stand-By Letters of Credit as requested by Company, provided that at no time
shall the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit exceed the Letter of
Credit Commitment. No Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date later than
the Maturity Date.

Section 3.02 APPLICATION FOR AND ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL LETTERS OF CREDIT
AND STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT.

(a) COMMERCIAL LETTERS OF CREDIT. Commercial Letters of Credit

by Company, but in no event later than the earlier of (a) 365 days after
their respective issuance dates or (b) the Maturity Date. Company's
request for the issuance of each Commercial Letter of Credit hereunder
shall be via a duly executed and completed Application. Notwithstanding
anything herein or in any other Loan Papers to the contrary, in no event
shall Company be entitled to request the issuance of a Commercial Letter of
Credit if the issuance of such Letter of Credit would cause the sum of (i)
the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit, plus (ii) the aggregate
amount of all Advances outstanding, to exceed the lesser of (A) the
Commitment and (B) the Borrowing Base.

(b) STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Stand-By Letter of Credit
issued under this Article III (i) shall be in a form acceptable to
Administrative Lender, (ii) shall be issued upon at least one Business
Day's notice on such date as Company may designate, (iii) shall not be
issued in an aggregate face amount of all Stand-By Letters of Credit
outstanding at any one time exceeding the difference between Letter of
Credit Commitment minus the aggregate face amount of all outstanding

(v) shall expire on such date as may be requested by Company, but in no
event later than the Maturity Date. Company's request for each issuance of
a Stand-By Letter of Credit hereunder shall be via a duly executed and
completed Application. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other
Loan Papers to the contrary, in no event shall Company be entitled to
request the issuance of a Stand-By Letter of Credit if the issuance of such
Letter of Credit would cause the sum of (i) the aggregate face amount of
all Letters of Credit, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all Advances
outstanding, to exceed the lesser of (A) the Commitment and (B) the
Borrowing Base.

Section 3.03 COMMISSION; PAYMENT OF DRAFTS DRAWN UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT;
INCORPORATION OF TERMS OF THE APPLICATIONS.

(a) Subject to Section 10.15 hereof, for the issuance of each Commercial
Letter of Credit, Company shall pay:

(i) to Administrative Lender for the account of Lenders in their Pro
Rata Part, the Applicable Margin on the face amount of each Commercial
Letter of Credit, payable by Company as it accrues upon receipt of an
invoice from Administrative Lender; and

(ii) to Administrative Lender for its own account an issuance fee
equal to $100 for each Commercial Letter of Credit, such issuance fee to be
payable by Company upon receipt of an invoice from Administrative Lender.

27
<PAGE>

(b) Subject to Section 10.15 hereof, for the issuance of each Stand-By
Letter of Credit, Company shall pay:

(i) to Administrative Lender for the account of Lenders in their Pro
Rata Part, the product of the Applicable Margin for any Stand-By Letter of
Credit on such date of issuance, multiplied by the face amount of such
Stand-By Letter of Credit, such credit fee to be payable by Company upon
receipt by Company of an invoice from Administrative Lender; and

(ii) to Administrative Lender for its own account an issuance fee
equal to one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) per annum of the face amount
of each Stand-By Letter of Credit, such issuance fee to be payable by
Company upon receipt by Company of an invoice from Administrative Lender.

All the terms and provisions of any and all Applications under this Article III
are incorporated herein by reference; provided, however, that in the event of a
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any Application, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control. Company shall pay to Administrative
Lender for the account of Lenders in their Pro Rata Part on demand an amount
equal to the face amount of each draft drawn or purporting to be drawn under a
Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms of the Application unless all
conditions precedent under Article IV have been satisfied and there exists no
Default or Event of Default, at which such time Company may request an Advance
under the Loan. If for any reason Company may not or does not request an
Advance under the Loan, Administrative Lender may debit Company's account(s)
with Administrative Lender (up to the credit balance thereof) in order to pay
each such draft, but Administrative Lender shall not be required to effect any
such debit. If Company's account(s) have insufficient funds with which to pay
such draft and if payment thereof is not otherwise made or provided for on the
maturity date of the draft, the face amount of the maturing draft shall
automatically be deemed to be an Advance under the Loan so long as there exists
no Default or Event of Default, the conditions precedent under Article IV have
been met and satisfied, and the total principal amount of all outstanding
Advances (after treating the face amount of the draft as an Advance) would not
exceed the lesser of (a) the Commitment minus the sum of the aggregate
outstanding face amount of all Letters of Credit plus the aggregate outstanding
amount of Advances under the Loan or (b) the Borrowing Base minus the sum of the
aggregate outstanding face amount of all Letters of Credit plus the aggregate
outstanding amount of Advances under the Loan. Such Advance shall be evidenced
by a Notice of Borrowing/Conversion to be received by Administrative Lender not
more than two Business Days following the date the draft matured. The failure
of Company to transmit such Notice of Borrowing/Conversion shall not affect
Company's obligation to repay such amount, and such amount shall be deemed to be
a Base Rate Borrowing.

Section 3.04 REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION OF Lenders. Each Lender (including
NationsBank of Texas, N.A. in its capacity as a Lender) agrees that it shall be

28

or issue Letters of Credit hereunder shall automatically terminate, and the
Obligations, without any action by Administrative Lender or any Lender, shall
become immediately due and payable without diligence, notice, demand,
presentment, notice of dishonor, protest or notice of intent to accelerate, or
notice of any other kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived, and all
outstanding Borrowings shall, at the option of Administrative Lender or at the
direction of Lenders, be automatically converted to Base Rate Borrowings. Upon
the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lenders may exercise all Rights
available to them at law or in equity, under the Loan Papers and otherwise and
all such Rights shall be cumulative.

Section 8.03 WAIVERS. The acceptance by any Lender at any time and from
time to time of part payment on the Obligations shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of any Event of Default then existing. No waiver by any Lender of any
Event of Default shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other then-existing or
subsequent Event of Default. No delay or omission by any Lender in exercising
any Rights under the Loan Papers shall impair such Rights or be construed as a
waiver thereof of any acquiescence with respect thereto, nor shall any single or
partial exercise or any such Rights preclude other or further exercise thereof,
or the exercise of any other Rights or remedies under the Loan Papers or
otherwise.

Section 8.04 PERFORMANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE LENDER. Should any covenant,
duty or agreement of Company fail to be performed in all material respects in
accordance with the

53

<PAGE>

terms of the Loan Papers, Administrative Lender may, at its option, perform, or
attempt to perform, such covenant, duty or agreement on behalf of Company. In
such event, Company agrees, at the request of Administrative Lender, to pay
promptly any amount expended by Administrative Lender in such performance or
attempted performance to Administrative Lender at Administrative Lender's
principal office, together with interest thereon at the Highest Lawful Rate from
the date of such expenditure by Administrative Lender until paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood that neither
Administrative Lender nor any Lender assumes, or shall ever have, except by
express written consent of Administrative Lender or such Lender, any liability
or responsibility for the performance of any duties of Company hereunder.

Section 8.05 LENDERS NOT IN CONTROL. None of the covenants or other
provisions contained in this Agreement shall, or shall be deemed to, give
Lenders the Rights or power to exercise control over the affairs and/or
management of Company, the power of Lenders being limited to the Right to
exercise the remedies provided in the other subparagraphs and subsections of
this Article VIII; provided, however, that if any Lender becomes the owner of
any stock, or other equity interest in, any Person whether through foreclosure
or otherwise, such Lender shall be entitled (subject to requirements of Law) to
exercise such legal Rights as it may have by being an owner of such stock, or
other equity interest in, such Person.

Section 8.06 CUMULATIVE RIGHTS. All Rights available to Administrative
Lender and Lenders under the Loan Papers shall be cumulative of and in addition
to all other Rights granted to Administrative Lender and Lenders at Law or in
equity, whether or not the Obligations shall be due and payable and whether or
not Administrative Lender or any Lender shall have instituted any suit for
collection or other action in connection with the Loan Papers.

Section 8.07 EXPENDITURES BY LENDERS. Any sums spent by Administrative
Lender or any Lender pursuant to the exercise of any Right provided hereof shall
become part of the Obligations and shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful
Rate from the date spent until the date repaid by Company.

ARTICLE IX

AGREEMENT AMONG LENDERS

Section 9.01 AGREEMENT AMONG LENDERS. Lenders agree among themselves
that:

(a) ADMINISTRATIVE LENDER. Each Lender hereby appoints NationsBank
of Texas, N.A. as its nominee in its name and on its behalf, to receive all
documents, monies and other items to be furnished hereunder; to act as
nominee for and on behalf of all Lenders under the Loan Papers; to take
such action as may be requested by any

54

<PAGE>

Lender, provided that, unless and until Administrative Lender shall have
received such requests, Administrative Lender may take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, as it may deem advisable and in the best
interests of Lenders; to arrange the means whereby the proceeds of Advances
of Lenders are to be made available to Company; to distribute promptly to
each Lender, at such Lender's principal office, information, requests,
documents and items received from Company and others, and its Pro Rata Part
of each payment with respect to any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation, fee or
other amount; and to deliver to Company and others requests, demands,
approvals and consents received from Lenders.

(b) REPLACEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LENDER. Should NationsBank of
Texas, N.A. or any successor Administrative Lender ever cease to be a
Lender hereunder, or should NationsBank of Texas, N.A. or any successor
Administrative Lender ever resign as Administrative Lender, or should
NationsBank of Texas, N.A. or any successor Administrative Lender ever be
removed by unanimous action of all Lenders (other than Lender then acting
as Administrative Lender), then Lender appointed by the other Lenders shall
forthwith become Administrative Lender, and Company and Lenders shall
execute such documents as any Lender may reasonably request to reflect such
change. Any resignation or removal of NationsBank of Texas, N.A. or any
successor Administrative Lender shall become effective upon the appointment
by Lenders of a successor Administrative Lender; provided, however, that if
Lenders fail for any reason to appoint a successor within 60 days after
such removal or resignation, NationsBank of Texas, N.A. or any successor
Administrative Lender (as the case may be) shall thereafter have no
obligation to act as Administrative Lender hereunder.

(c) EXPENSES. Each Lender shall pay its Pro Rata Part of any
expenses incurred by Administrative Lender in connection with any of the
Loan Papers if Administrative Lender does not receive reimbursement
therefor from other sources within 60 days after the date incurred. Any
amount so paid by Lenders to Administrative Lender shall be returned by
Administrative Lender Pro Rata to each paying Lender to the extent later
paid by Company to Administrative Lender.

(d) DELEGATION OF DUTIES. Administrative Lender may execute any of
its duties hereunder by or through officers, directors, employees,
attorneys or agents, and shall be entitled to (and shall be protected in
relying upon) advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to its
duties hereunder.

(e) RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE LENDER. Administrative Lender and its
officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents shall be entitled to
rely and shall be fully protected in relying on any writing, resolution,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telex
or teletype message, statement, order, or other document or conversation
believed by it or them to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or
made by the proper person and, with respect to legal matters,

55

<PAGE>

upon opinions of counsel selected by Administrative Lender. Administrative
Lender may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for
all purposes hereof.

(f) LIMITATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LENDER'S LIABILITY. Neither
Administrative Lender nor any of its officers, directors, employees,
attorneys or agents shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it or them hereunder in good faith and believed by it or them to
be within the discretion or power conferred by the Loan Papers or be
responsible for the consequences of any error of judgment. Except as
aforesaid, Administrative Lender shall be under no duty to enforce any
Rights with respect to the Loan, Advances, Reimbursement Obligations, other
Obligations or any collateral therefor. Administrative Lender shall not be
compelled to do any act hereunder or to take any action towards the
execution or enforcement of the powers hereby created or to prosecute or
defend any suit in respect hereof, unless indemnified to its satisfaction
against loss, cost, liability and expense. Administrative Lender makes no
warranty or representation to Lenders and shall not be responsible in any
manner to any Lender for the effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness,
validity or due execution of any of the Loan Papers or Letters of Credit or
for any representation, warranty, document, certificate, report or
statement made herein or furnished in connection with any Loan Papers, or
be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance or observation of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
any Loan Papers on the part of Company. Each Lender jointly and severally
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Administrative Lender, to the extent
of such Lender's Pro Rata Part, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses and/or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, asserted against, or incurred by Administrative Lender in any
way with respect to or arising out of (i) any Loan Papers or any action
taken or omitted by Administrative Lender under the Loan Papers, except and
only to the extent the same result from gross negligence or wilful
misconduct by Administrative Lender, and (ii) in its capacity as issuing
bank of a Letter of Credit, any failure by any Lender to comply with
Article III or IV hereof.

(g) LIABILITY AMONG LENDERS. No Lender shall incur any liability to
any other Lender except for acts or omissions in bad faith, and except as
provided in the last sentence of subparagraph (f) of this Section 9.01.

(h) RIGHTS AS LENDER. With respect to its Commitment, Advances made
by it, Notes issued to it and Letters of Credit issued by it,
Administrative Lender shall have and enjoy the same Rights as a Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Lender, and the
term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates,
include Administrative Lender in its individual capacity. Administrative
Lender may accept deposits from, act as trustee under indentures of, and
generally engage in any kind of business with, Company and any Person who

56

<PAGE>

may do business with or own securities of Company all as if Administrative
Lender were not Administrative Lender hereunder and without any duty to
account therefor to Lenders.

Section 9.02 LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that it
has, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Lender or any other
Lender and based upon the financial statements referred to in Section 5.02
hereof and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
Administrative Lender or any other Lender and based upon such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.

Section 9.03 BENEFITS OF ARTICLE. None of the provisions of this Article
IX shall inure to the benefit of Company or any Person other than Lenders;
consequently, neither Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to rely
upon, or to raise as a defense, in any manner whatsoever, the failure of any
Lender to comply with such provisions.

ARTICLE X

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 10.01 NO ORAL MODIFICATIONS. Neither this Agreement nor any
provisions hereof may be changed, waived, discharged, or terminated orally, but
only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of
the change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought.

Section 10.02 BENEFIT; ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

(a) Company may not transfer or assign its rights and obligations
hereunder, and, subject to such restriction, the provisions hereof shall
extend to and be binding upon Company's respective successors and assigns.
All covenants and agreements made by or on behalf of any of the parties
hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto, whether so
expressed or not, and, in particular, shall inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the holder or holders of all or any portion of the Notes.

(b) Administrative Lender may assign any portion of its rights to any
Person with the prior written consent of Company, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld; provided that, after the occurrence of a Default or
Event of Default which is continuing, Administrative Lender shall not be
required to obtain the

57

<PAGE>

consent of Company. Each Lender may assign its Rights and obligations as a
Lender under the Loan Papers to any Affiliate of such Lender, and, with the
prior written consent of Administrative Lender and pursuant to an
Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, to one or more Eligible Assignees, so
long as (i) each assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying
percentage of all Rights and obligations thereunder, (ii) no such
assignment shall be in an amount less than $15,000,000 unless it is the
remaining amount of such Lender's total committed amount, (iii) no Lender
shall assign any amount which would result in such Lender holding an amount
less than $10,000,000 immediately after any such assignment, (iv) Company
has given its prior written consent, provided that, after the occurrence of
an Event of Default and during the continuance thereof, no Lender shall be
required to obtain the prior written consent of Company.

(c) The assigning Lender (the "Assignor") shall give at least ten
Business Days notice to Administrative Lender and Company of such proposed
assignment, together with the date such assignment shall become effective,
the new Specified Percentage of the Assignor and the new assignee, and the
name, address and funding office of the assignee. On the effective date of
any assignment, the Assignor shall deliver to Administrative Lender and
Company a copy of the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and all related
documents, together with, for Administrative Lender, the processing fee
described in subsection (e) below. Within five Business Days after notice
of any such assignment, Company shall execute and deliver to the Assignor,
in exchange for the Notes issued to the Assignor new Notes to the order of
the Assignor and its assignee in amounts equal to their respective
Specified Percentages, dated as of the effective date of the assignment.
It is specifically acknowledged and agreed that on and after the effective
date of each assignment, the assignee shall be a party hereto, included in
the definition of "Lender" and shall have the Rights and obligations of a
Lender under the Loan Papers.

(d) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other
entities in all or any of its Rights and obligations under the Loan Papers;
provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under the Loan Papers
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to
the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of its Note for all purposes of
the Loan Papers, (iv) under the terms of any such participation, such
Lender's right to consent or agree to any amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Paper, or to consent to any
departure by any party therefrom, shall not be subject to or require any
consent or agreement of the participant, except in connection with matters
described in subsections (a) through (d) of Section 10.10 hereof to the
extent it is affected thereby, and (v) Company, Administrative Lender, and
other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with its Rights and obligations under the Loan Papers.

58

herein a copy of each assignment agreement received by it from each
Assignor and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names
and addresses of Lenders and the commitments of, and principal amount of
Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error, and Company,
Administrative Lender and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all
purposes of this Agreement. Upon Administrative Lender's receipt of an
executed Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, together with a payment to
Administrative Lender of a registration and processing fee of $2500,
Administrative Lender shall (i) promptly accept such assignment and (ii) on
the effective date thereof, record the information contained therein in the
Register.

(f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation, or proposed assignment or participation, disclose to the
assignee or participant, or proposed assignee or participant, any
information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries furnished to
such Lender by or on behalf of Company or its Subsidiaries.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion
of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any
Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

representations and warranties contained herein or in any other instrument
contemplated hereby shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement,

SECTION 10.09 INDEMNITY. COMPANY AGREES TO AND DOES INDEMNIFY AND HOLD
HARMLESS EACH LENDER AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS

(WHETHER MADE OR THREATENED), COSTS, EXPENSES AND DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR
NATURE WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE REASONABLE OUT-OF-POCKET
FEES AND EXPENSES OF COUNSEL WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED ON OR INCURRED BY ANY LENDER
OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS OR

61

<PAGE>

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM ANY CLAIMS (WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE MADE OR
THREATENED AND INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, CLAIMS RESULTING FROM THE
NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY) OR ACTIONS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS (WHETHER

BEHALF OF ANY PERSON OTHER THAN A CLAIM BY ANY LENDER (INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE
LENDER) OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES,
ATTORNEYS OR SHAREHOLDERS, AGAINST ANY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY. WITHOUT LIMITING
THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL EXTEND TO ANY AND ALL
COSTS AND EXPENSES WHATSOEVER INCURRED BY ANY LENDER AND ITS OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS OR SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION THE REASONABLE OUT-OF-POCKET FEES AND EXPENSES OF COUNSEL IN

ACTION, CLAIM (WHETHER MADE OR THREATENED), SUIT, LIABILITY, DAMAGE OR LOSS,
WHETHER OR NOT RESULTING IN ANY LIABILITY ON THE MERITS. EACH LENDER MAY SELECT
ITS OWN LEGAL COUNSEL IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTERS INDEMNIFIED AGAINST
HEREUNDER. THE OBLIGATION OF COMPANY UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE

62
<PAGE>

Section 10.10 AMENDMENT. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Papers, nor consent to any departure by Company or
any of its Subsidiaries therefrom (including, without limitation, any provision
of this Agreement specifically requiring the consent of Lenders), shall be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Lenders
(unless, in any such case, the text thereof specifically requires "each Lender"
or "all Lenders"), and then any such waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided,
however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by each of Lenders affected thereby, (a) increase the Commitment or the
Letter of Credit Commitment, (b) reduce any principal, interest, fees or other
amounts payable to such Lenders hereunder, or waive or result in the waiver of
any Event of Default under Section 8.01(a) hereof, (c) postpone any date fixed
for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable to such
Lenders hereunder, (d) release any collateral (if any) or Guaranties securing
the Obligations hereunder except as specifically provided for in the Loan Papers
on the Closing Date, (e) change the meaning of Specified Percentage or the
number of Lenders required to take any action hereunder, or (f) amend this
Section. No amendment, waiver or consent shall affect the Rights or duties of
Administrative Lender under any Loan Papers, unless it is in writing and signed
by Administrative Lender in addition to the requisite number of Lenders. This
Agreement embodies the entire agreement among the parties hereto, supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, if any, relating to the subject matter
hereof, and may be amended only as provided above. Company acknowledges and
agrees that all Loan Papers evidence the Obligation.

SECTION 10.11 WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. ADMINISTRATIVE LENDER, LENDERS,
COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE
ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED
HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER LOAN PAPERS, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS
(WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LENDER, LENDERS,
COMPANY OR ANY SUBSIDIARY. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR
ADMINISTRATIVE LENDER AND LENDERS ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 10.12 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and the other Loan Papers may
be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same instrument, but in making proof of this Agreement,
it shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one such
counterpart.

SECTION 10.13 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER
WRITTEN DOCUMENTS DESCRIBED HEREIN OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY REPRESENT THE FINAL
AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,

63

<PAGE>

CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES HERETO. THERE ARE
NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES.

Section 10.14 SURVIVAL AND APPLICATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
All representations and warranties made under this Agreement and the other Loan
Papers shall be deemed to be made as of the Closing Date and as provided in
Section 4.02 and Section 4.03 hereof, and each shall be true and correct when
made, except to the extent (a) previously fulfilled in accordance with the terms
hereof, (b) subsequently inapplicable, or (c) waived in writing by
Administrative Lender and Majority Lenders with respect to any particular
factual circumstance. In addition, all such representations and warranties
relating to Company's Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be made with respect to
any newly formed or acquired Subsidiary as of its formation or acquisition, and
shall be true and correct on such date. All representations and warranties made
under this Agreement shall survive, and not be waived by, the execution of the
Loan Papers by Administrative Lender and Lenders, any investigation or inquiry
by Administrative Lender or any Lender, or any disbursement of an Advance
hereunder.

Section 10.15 RATE PROVISION. It is not the intention of any party to any
Loan Papers to make an agreement violative of the Laws of any applicable
jurisdiction relating to usury. Regardless of any provision in any of the Loan
Papers, no Lender shall ever be entitled to receive, collect or apply, on the
Obligation, any amount deemed to constitute interest in excess of the Maximum
Amount. If any Lender ever receives, collects or applies any such excess, such
amount which would be excessive interest shall be deemed a partial repayment of
principal and treated hereunder as such; and if principal is paid in full, any
remaining excess shall be paid to Company. In determining whether or not the
interest paid or payable, under any specific contingency, exceeds the Maximum
Amount, Company and Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under
Applicable Laws, (a) characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee or
premium rather than as interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the
effect thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread in equal parts,
the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the
Obligation so that the interest rate is uniform throughout the entire term of
the Obligation; provided, however, that if the Obligation is paid and performed
in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term thereof, and if the
interest received for the actual period of existence thereof exceeds the Maximum
Amount, Lenders shall refund to Company the amount of such excess or credit the
amount of such excess against the total principal amount owing, and, in such
event, no Lender shall be subject to any penalties provided by any Laws for
contracting for, charging or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Amount.
This Section shall control every other provision of all agreements among the
parties to this Agreement pertaining to the transactions contemplated by or
contained in the Loan Papers.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement

hereunder at a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. Subject to the
provisions hereof limiting interest to the Maximum Amount, interest on (a)
Eurodollar Rate Borrowings shall be calculated at a daily rate equal to 1/360th
of the rate selected by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Agreement, and (b) Base Rate Borrowings shall be calculated at a daily rate
equal to 1/365th or 1/366th, as the case may be, of the rate selected by the
Borrower in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. Each Advance made
by Lender to Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement may be recorded by Lender
and, with respect to any transfer hereof, endorsed on the grid attached hereto
which is part of this Note. Any failure by Lender to endorse the grid attached
hereto shall not impair the obligation of Borrower to pay any amount due and
owing hereunder.

All capitalized terms used herein, but not specifically defined, shall have
the same meanings as set forth in the Credit Agreement.

Principal and all accrued interest hereunder shall be due and payable upon
the terms and on the dates provided for in the Credit Agreement. Subject to the
terms of the Credit Agreement, Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow
hereunder.

Any amounts remaining unpaid after the maturity of this Note (whether
maturity shall occur by default, lapse of time or otherwise) shall bear interest
as provided in the Credit Agreement.

<PAGE>

If at any time the rate selected by the Borrower shall exceed the Highest
Lawful Rate, thereby causing the interest hereon to be limited to the Maximum
Amount, then notwithstanding any subsequent reduction in such rate below the
Highest Lawful Rate, interest shall accrue hereunder at the Highest Lawful Rate
until such time as the total amount of interest accrued hereon equals the amount
of interest which would have accrued hereon (including the amount of such
interest which would have so accrued hereon prior to the time of repayment of
any of the principal hereof) if the rate selected by the Borrower had been in
effect at all times.

This Note is issued pursuant to and evidences the Loan under that certain
Credit Agreement among Borrower, NationsBank of Texas, N.A. for itself and as
Administrative Lender thereunder, and certain other Lenders ("Lenders") party
thereto, dated as of June 17, 1994, as the same may be amended from time to time
("Credit Agreement"), to which reference is made for a statement of the rights
and obligations of Administrative Lender and Lenders, and the duties and
obligations of Borrower in relation thereto.

If an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement shall occur, the unpaid
principal of and accrued interest on this Note may be declared due and payable
in the manner and with the effect provided in the Credit Agreement.

The Borrower, signers, guarantors, sureties and indorsers of this Note
severally waive demand, presentment, notice of dishonor, notice of intent to
demand payment hereof, notice of intent to accelerate payment hereof, notice of
acceleration, diligence in collecting, grace, notice and protest, the bringing
of any suit against any party and any notice of or defense on account of any
extensions, renewals, partial payments of or changes in any manner in this Note
or in any of its Terms, provisions, and covenants, or any releases or
substitutions of any security, or any delay, indulgence or other act of the
holder hereof, whether before or after maturity; provided, however, that
Borrower does not waive any notice or grace periods to which it may be entitled
under the express provisions of the Credit Agreement. If this Note is placed in
the hands of an attorney for collection after an Event of Default, or if all or
any part of the indebtedness represented by this Note is proved, established or
collected in any court or in any bankruptcy, receivership, debtor relief,
probate or other court proceedings, Borrower and all indorsers, guarantors and
sureties of this Note jointly and severally agree to pay reasonable attorneys'
fees (including the reasonable allocated cost of staff counsel) and all
collection costs to the holder hereof in addition to the principal, interest and
any other sums payable hereunder.

This Note may not be terminated orally, but only by a discharge in writing
signed by the holder of this Note at the time such discharge is sought.

It is not the intention of the parties hereto to make an agreement
violative of the laws of any applicable jurisdiction relating to the maximum
lawful rate of interest a lender may charge. Regardless of any provision in this
Note, the Credit Agreement or any other document or instrument securing or
evidencing the indebtedness represented hereby, no holder hereof shall ever be
entitled to receive, collect or apply, as interest hereon, any amount in excess
of the Maximum Amount. If any holder hereof ever receives, collects or applies,
as interest, any such excess, such amount which would be excessive interest
shall be deemed a partial repayment of principal and treated hereunder as such;
and if principal is paid in full, any remaining excess shall be paid to
Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any
specific contingency exceeds the Maximum Amount, Borrower and the holder hereof
shall, to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, (i) characterize any
nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, (ii)
exclude voluntary prepayments and the effect thereof and (iii) to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, amortize, prorate, allocate and spread the total
amount of interest throughout the entire term hereof until payment in full of
the principal hereof so that the interest hereon for such period shall not
exceed the Maximum Amount; provided that if this Note is paid in full prior to
the contemplated maturity, and if the interest received for the actual period of
existence thereof exceeds the Maximum Amount, the holder hereof shall refund to
Borrower the amount of such excess or credit the amount of such excess against
the total principal amount owing, and, in any event, the holder hereof shall not
be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for contracting for, charging
or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Amount. This paragraph shall
control every other provision of this Note, the Credit Agreement or any other
agreements, instruments or documents between the holder hereof and Borrower
pertaining to the indebtedness evidenced hereby.

This Note shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
the State of Texas and the laws of the United States applicable to transactions
in Texas.

GUARANTY AGREEMENT

WHEREAS, the execution of this Guaranty Agreement is a condition to
MICHAELS STORES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Borrower"), borrowing pursuant
to that certain Credit Agreement dated June 17, 1994, among Borrower,
NationsBank of Texas, N.A. for itself and as Administrative Lender, and certain
other Lenders party thereto as the same may hereafter be amended from time to
time (the "Credit Agreement");

NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of
which are hereby acknowledged, the undersigned __________________, a __________
corporation and [wholly owned] subsidiary of Borrower, the address of which is
________________________ (the "Guarantor"), hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to Lenders the prompt payment of the Guaranteed
Indebtedness (hereinafter defined), and the due performance of all terms and
conditions of the Credit Agreement and other Loan Papers (as defined in the
Credit Agreement, and all other capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings specified in the Credit Agreement), this Guaranty
Agreement being upon the following terms:

1. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Papers to the
contrary, the maximum liability of Guarantor shall in no event exceed the
Maximum Guaranteed Amount. The term "Guaranteed Indebtedness" as used herein
means all of the "Obligations", as defined in the Credit Agreement and the Loan
Papers. "Maximum Guaranteed Amount" as used herein shall mean the greater of
(a) the amount of any Guaranteed Indebtedness used to make a Valuable Transfer
to Guarantor, and (b) the greater of 95% of Guarantor's Adjusted Net Worth (i)
at the date hereof (if appropriate under applicable Law), (ii) at the time the
Guaranteed Indebtedness was incurred, and (iii) on the date of enforcement
hereof. "Adjusted Net Worth" as used herein shall mean as of the date of
determination, (a) the value of the assets of Guarantor as of such date, minus
(b) all liabilities of Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, as of such date
(excluding Guarantor's liability hereunder), as such concepts are determined in
accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of
debtors. "Valuable Transfer" as used herein shall mean (a) all loans, advances
or capital contributions made to Guarantor with proceeds of any Guaranteed
Indebtedness, (b) all debt securities or other obligations of Guarantor acquired
from Guarantor or retired by Guarantor with proceeds of any Guaranteed
Indebtedness, (c) the fair market value of all property acquired with proceeds
of any Guaranteed Indebtedness, and transferred, absolutely and not as
collateral, to Guarantor, and (d) all equity securities of Guarantor acquired
from Guarantor with proceeds of any Guaranteed Indebtedness.

2. This instrument shall be an absolute, continuing, irrevocable, and
unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and not a guaranty of
collection, and Guarantor shall

<PAGE>

remain liable on its obligations hereunder until the payment in full of the
Guaranteed Indebtedness.

3. If Guarantor becomes liable for any indebtedness owing by Borrower to
any of Lenders by endorsement or otherwise, other than under this Guaranty
Agreement, such liability shall not be in any manner impaired or affected
hereby, and the Rights of Lenders hereunder shall be cumulative of any and all
other Rights that Lenders may ever have against Guarantor. The exercise by
Administrative Lender or Lenders of any Right or remedy hereunder or under any
other instrument, at Law or in equity, shall not preclude the concurrent or
subsequent exercise of any other Right or remedy.

4. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Guarantor shall, on demand
and without further notice of dishonor, and without any notice having been given
to Guarantor previous to such demand of the acceptance by Lenders of this
Guaranty Agreement, pay the Guaranteed Indebtedness to Administrative Lender or
Lenders as provided in the Credit Agreement and it shall not be necessary for
Administrative Lender or Lenders, in order to enforce such payment by Guarantor,
first to institute suit or exhaust their remedies against Borrower or others
liable on such Guaranteed Indebtedness, or to enforce any rights against any
security which shall ever have been given to secure such Guaranteed
Indebtedness. In the event such payment is made by Guarantor, then Guarantor
shall be subrogated to the rights then held by Administrative Lender and Lenders
with respect to the Guaranteed Indebtedness to the extent to which the
Guaranteed Indebtedness was discharged by Guarantor and, in addition, upon
payment by Guarantor of any sums to Lenders hereunder, all rights of Guarantor
against Borrower arising as a result therefrom by way of right of subrogation or
otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to
the prior indefeasible payment in full of the Guaranteed Indebtedness.

5. Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations under the terms of this
Guaranty Agreement shall not be released, diminished, impaired, reduced, or
affected by the occurrence of any reason or event, including without limitation,
one or more of the following events: (a) the taking or accepting of any other
security of any or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness or the release, surrender,
exchange or subordination of any security now or hereinafter securing all or any
portion of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (b) any partial release of the liability
of Guarantor hereunder, or the release of any other guarantor of all or any
portion of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (c) the change in corporate existence,
ownership, or structure of, lack of corporate power of, or the insolvency or
bankruptcy of, Borrower, Guarantor, or any party at any time liable for the
payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness, whether now existing or
hereafter occurring; (d) any renewal, extension, modification, settlement,
waiver, amendment, and/or rearrangement of the payment of any or all of the
Guaranteed Indebtedness with or without notice to or consent of Guarantor, or
any adjustment, indulgence, forbearance, or compromise that may be granted or
given by Administrative Lender or Lenders to Borrower or Guarantor; (e) any
renewal, extension, modification, waiver, or amendment of the Credit Agreement
or any of the Loan Papers; (f) any neglect, delay, omission, failure, or refusal
of Administrative Lender or Lenders to take or prosecute any action for the
collection of any of

-2-
<PAGE>

the Guaranteed Indebtedness or to foreclose or take or prosecute any action in
connection with any instrument or agreement evidencing or securing all or any
part of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (g) the invalidity or unenforceability of
all or any part of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (h) any payment by Borrower to
Administrative Lender or Lenders is held to constitute a preference under the
bankruptcy laws or if for any other reason Administrative Lender or Lenders are
required to refund such payment or pay the amount thereof to someone else; (i)
the settlement or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (j) the
existence of any claim, defense, set-off or other rights which Borrower or any
Guarantor may have at any time against Borrower, any of the Lenders, any other
Guarantor or any other person, whether in connection with this Guaranty
Agreement, the Loan Papers, the transactions contemplated thereby or any other
transaction; (k) the failure of Administrative Lender or Lenders to perfect, or
the release, exchange, substitution, or invalidity of, any security interest or
Lien securing all or any portion of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (l) the failure
of Administrative Lender or Lenders to sell any Collateral securing all or any
portion of the Guaranteed Indebtedness in a commercially reasonable manner or as
otherwise required by Law; or (m) any other circumstance or happening
whatsoever, whether or not similar to the foregoing.

6. Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that all representations and
warranties set forth in Article V of the Credit Agreement with respect to it are
true and correct as of the date hereof, and are incorporated herein by
reference. In addition, Guarantor represents and warrants to Administrative
Lender and Lenders as follows:

(a) Except as previously disclosed to Administrative Lender or Lenders in
writing, Guarantor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of its incorporation, and is qualified to
do business in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted
by it makes such qualification necessary and where failure to so qualify would
have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or
operations.

(b) Guarantor has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver
and perform its obligations under this Guaranty Agreement, and this Guaranty
Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor,
enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its respective terms, except as
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, or other laws of general application relating
to the enforcement of creditors rights and subject to the qualification that
general equitable principles may limit the availability of equitable remedies,
including without limitation, the remedy of specific performance.

(c) The execution, delivery, and performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty
Agreement have been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of
Guarantor and will not violate the articles of incorporation or bylaws of
Guarantor or any Law or any order of any Tribunal and will not conflict with,
result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the
imposition of any Lien upon any assets of Guarantor pursuant to the provisions
of any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, security agreement, franchise,
permit, license, or other instrument or agreement to which Guarantor or its
properties is bound.

-3-
<PAGE>

(d) No authorization, approval, or consent of, and no filing or
registration with, any court, governmental authority or third party is necessary
for the execution, delivery or performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty
Agreement or the validity or enforceability hereof.

(e) The value of the consideration received and to be received by
Guarantor as a result of Advances or other extensions of credit under the Credit
Agreement and Guarantor's execution and delivery of this Guaranty Agreement is
reasonably worth at least as much as the liability and obligation of Guarantor
hereunder, and such liability and obligation and the Credit Agreement may
reasonably be expected to benefit Guarantor directly or indirectly.

7. Guarantor covenants and agrees that, as long as the Guaranteed
Indebtedness or any part thereof is outstanding or Administrative Lender or
Lenders have any commitment under the Credit Agreement:

(a) Guarantor will comply with the covenants applicable to any Subsidiary
contained in Articles VI and VII of the Credit Agreement.

(b) Guarantor will furnish to Administrative Lender as soon as available
one copy of each financial statement, report, notice or proxy statement sent by
Guarantor to its stockholders generally and one copy of each regular, periodic
or special report, registration statement, or prospectus filed by Guarantor with
any securities exchange or the Securities and Exchange Commission or any
successor agency, and any order issued by any court, governmental authority or
arbitrator in any material proceeding to which Guarantor is a party.

(c) Guarantor will furnish promptly to Administrative Lender written
notice of the occurrence of any default under this Guaranty Agreement or an
Event of Default of which Guarantor has knowledge.

(d) Guarantor will furnish promptly to Administrative Lender such
additional information concerning Guarantor as Administrative Lender or any
Lender may reasonably request.

(e) Guarantor will obtain at any time and from time to time all
authorizations, licenses, consents or approvals as shall now or hereafter be
necessary or desirable under all applicable Law or regulations or otherwise in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty
Agreement and will promptly furnish copies thereof to Administrative Lender.

8. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement,
Administrative Lender and Lenders shall have the right to set off and apply
against the Guaranty Agreement or the Guaranteed Indebtedness or both, without
notice to Guarantor, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) or other sums at any time credited by or owing from any of
Lenders to Guarantor irrespective of whether or not Administrative Lender or
Lenders shall have made any demand under this Guaranty Agreement.

-4-
<PAGE>

The rights and remedies of Administrative Lender and Lenders hereunder are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other
rights of setoff) which Administrative Lender and Lenders may have. After each
setoff and application, Administrative Lender or the appropriate Lender shall
promptly give notice to guarantor of such event; provided that the failure of
Administrative Lender or the appropriate Lender to furnish such notification
shall in no way impair, invalidate or prejudice Administrative Lender's or
Lenders' setoff and application so made.

9. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty Agreement or
consent to any departure by Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Administrative Lender. No
failure on the part of Administrative Lender or Lenders to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any Right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; no
shall any single or partial exercise of any Right hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies
herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by
Law.

10. Any acknowledgment or new promise, whether by payment or principal or
interest or otherwise and whether by Borrower or others (including Guarantor),
with respect to any of the Guaranteed Indebtedness shall, if the statute of
limitations in favor of the Guarantor against Lenders shall have commenced to
run, toll the running of such statute of limitations and, if the period of such
statute of limitations shall have expired, prevent the operation of such statute
of limitations.

11. Any indebtedness of Borrower now or hereafter held by Guarantor is
hereby subordinated to the Obligations, and if Administrative Lender so requests
shall be collected, enforced and received by Guarantor as trustee for Lenders
and be paid over to Administrative lender on account of the Obligations, but
without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of Guarantor under the
other provisions of the is Guaranty Agreement; provided, however, that unless
and until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Guarantor may
continue to receive and collect amounts pursuant to such subordinated
indebtedness. Upon request by Administrative Lender on behalf of Lenders, any
instruments now or hereafter evidencing such indebtedness of Borrower to
Guarantor shall be marked with a legend that the same are subject to this
Guaranty Agreement and, if Administrative Lender so requests, shall be delivered
to Administrative Lender. Guarantor will from time to time execute financing
statements and continuation statements and such other documents and take other
action as Administrative Lender deems necessary or appropriate to perfect,
preserve and enforce Lenders' Rights hereunder.

12. Guarantor waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all
presentments, demands for performance, protests, notices of protest, notices of
dishonor and notices of acceptance of this Guaranty Agreement and of the
existence, creation or incurring of new or additional indebtedness, diligence in
bringing suits against any person liable on any Guaranteed Indebtedness, and all
other notices of any kind whatsoever (including without limitation notice of
acceleration and notice of intent to accelerate). Guarantor agrees that the
Guaranteed

-5-
<PAGE>

Indebtedness and Loan Papers may be extended or renewed, and Loans repaid and
reborrowed in whole or in part, without notice to or assent by Guarantor, and
that it will remain bound upon this Guaranty Agreement notwithstanding any
extension, renewal or other alteration of any Guaranteed Indebtedness and Loan
Papers, or any repayment and reborrowing of Loans;

13. If Guarantor shall make any payment hereunder (whether voluntary,
involuntary, due to set-off or otherwise), it shall have a right of contribution
against any other Guarantor to the extent that such payment caused the
Guaranteed Indebtedness to exceed the Maximum Guaranteed Amount.

14. No obligations of Guarantor shall be altered, limited or affected by
any proceeding against Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other person
pursuant to any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws relating
to the relief of debtors. This Guaranty Agreement shall continue to be
effective, or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment,
or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Indebtedness is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Lender or Lenders in
connection with any proceeding involving Borrower, any Guarantor or any other
Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws relating
to the relief of debtors.

15. As a separate undertaking from similar provisions contained in the
Loan Papers, Guarantor agrees to pay reasonable attorneys' fees and all other
costs and expenses which may be incurred by Administrative Lender or Lenders in
the enforcement or collection of this Guaranty Agreement.

16. Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices, requests, consents and
demands shall be given to Guarantor c/o _______________________, Attention:
President, in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.

17. This Guaranty Agreement is for the benefit of Lenders and their
successors and assigns, and in the event of an assignment of the Guaranteed
Indebtedness, or any part thereof, the Rights and benefits hereunder, to the
extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, may be transferred with such
indebtedness. This Guaranty Agreement is binding not only on Guarantor, but on
Guarantor's successors and assigns.

18. Guarantor acknowledges that it expects to receive significant
financial benefits, either directly or indirectly, from the proceeds of the
Loans made by Lenders to Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and further
acknowledges that Lenders are relying upon this Guaranty Agreement and the
undertakings of Guarantor hereunder in making Advances and other extensions of
credit to Borrower under the Credit Agreement and that the execution and
delivery of this Guaranty Agreement is a material inducement to Lenders to
continue the Commitment pursuant to the Credit Agreement.

-6-
<PAGE>

19. Each payment on the Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be deemed to have
been made by Borrower unless express written notice is given to the
Administrative Lender at the time of such payment that such payment is made by
Guarantor.

20. This Guaranty Agreement is executed and delivered as an incident to a
lending transaction negotiated, consummated, and performable in Dallas County,
Texas, and shall be construed according to the laws of the State of Texas.

21. The Credit Agreement, and all of the terms thereof, are incorporated
herein by reference, the same as if stated verbatim herein, and Guarantor agrees
that Administrative Lender and Lenders may exercise any and all rights granted
to them under the Credit Agreement and other Loan Papers without affecting the
validity or enforceability of this Guaranty Agreement.

22. This Guaranty Agreement is for the ratable benefit of Lenders, each of
which shall share any proceeds hereof pursuant to the terms of the Credit
Agreement.

23. WITHOUT EXCLUDING ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, THE GUARANTOR AGREES THAT
THE FEDERAL COURTS OF TEXAS LOCATED IN DALLAS, TEXAS SHALL HAVE JURISDICTION
OVER PROCEEDINGS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.
