Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
------------------------------------

On January 28, 1994, the registrant, through a wholly owned foreign 
subsidiary, purchased all of the outstanding common stock of Societe d'Etude et
Fabrication d'Appareillage Medical, a French "Societe Anonyme (S.A.)" ("SEFAM"),
a leading European supplier of diagnostic and therapeutic systems used to treat
sleep disorders. In a Form 8-K filed on February 3, 1994, the registrant
undertook to file financial statements required by Item 7(a) and (b) of Form 8-K
as soon as they became available. Upon completion of the required financial
statements, the registrant has determined that a Form 8-K was not required to be
filed in the first instance and, accordingly, the otherwise required financial
statements will not be filed by amendment to the Form 8-K filed on February 3,
1994.
