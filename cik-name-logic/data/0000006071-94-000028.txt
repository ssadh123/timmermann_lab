ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

On June 10, 1994, Ames Department Stores, Inc. ("Ames" or the 
"Company") announced that Joseph R. Ettore has been appointed 
President and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. The 
press release announcing the appointment, dated June 10, 1994, is 
attached hereto as Exhibit 20-A. Mr. Ettore replaces Peter Thorner, 
former President and Chief Operating Officer, who has resigned.

Also, beginning on June 10, 1994, Ames will distribute, to its banks 
and other lenders, principal trade vendors and factors, summaries of 
its unaudited financial results for the four and seventeen weeks ended 
May 28, 1994. These monthly and year-to-date results (collectively, 
the "monthly results") are attached hereto as Exhibit 20-B and are 
incorporated by reference herein. 

Compared with the projections contained in the Form 8-K dated May 27, 
1994 (referred to herein as the "Plan"), sales for the four weeks 
ended May 28, 1994 were $12.8 million below Plan and EBITDA (as 
defined in Exhibit 20-B) was $1.3 million below Plan. In May, the 
major portion of the sales shortfall against Plan was in apparel due, 
in part, to unseasonable weather in the first half of the month. The 
unfavorable impact from the sales shortfall on May's EBITDA was 
partially offset by lower-than-planned expenses.

Sales for the seventeen weeks ended May 28, 1994 were $13.3 million 
below Plan; however, EBITDA was $.1 million better than Plan. The 
unfavorable impact on the year-to-date EBITDA from the lower-than- 
planned sales and gross margin rate was more than offset by 
lower-than-planned expenses. The year-to-date sales shortfall was 
primarily due to the $12.8 million shortfall in May. The lower gross 
margin rate was primarily due to higher-than-planned clearance 
markdowns on apparel merchandise in March. Store, field and home 
office expenses were all below the year-to-date Plan. 

As of May 28, 1994, inventories were $5.5 million above Plan, 
principally in hardline categories as a result of the additional 
merchandise purchased after the temporary closing of the Company's 
Leesport, PA distribution center in February and March. Trade 
payables were $24.3 million above Plan due primarily to improved 
payment terms. Outstanding borrowings under the Company's revolving 
line of credit as of May 28, 1994 were $26.8 million below Plan due 
primarily to the better-than-planned trade payable terms. 

The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants through 
May 28, 1994.

Ames is distributing the monthly results to its banks and other 
lenders, principal trade vendors and factors to facilitate their 
credit analyses. The summary results SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR 
ANY OTHER PURPOSE and should be read in conjunction with the Company's 
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994, the Company's 
Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter ended April 30, 1994, and the 
Company's Form 8-K dated May 27, 1994. The monthly results are being 
reported publicly solely because they are being distributed to a large 
number of the Company's vendors for purposes of their credit analyses.

During the pendency of its reorganization case, Ames disclosed 
publicly its monthly results through filings with the Office of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee and continued to report publicly its monthly 
results during the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994. Although Ames 
expects to continue to make its monthly results public for the fiscal 
year ending January 28, 1995, Ames does not believe it is obligated 
to provide such information indefinitely, other than as required by 
applicable regulations, and Ames may cease making such disclosures 
and updates at any time. The monthly results were not examined, 
reviewed or compiled by Ames' independent certified accountants. 
Moreover, Ames does not believe that it is obligated to update the 
monthly results to reflect subsequent events or developments. The 
reported monthly results are subject to future adjustments, if any, 
that could materially affect such results. However, in the opinion 
of the Company, the monthly results contain all adjustments 
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair 
statement of the results for the periods presented.

NEWS RELEASE

AMES NAMES ETTORE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
-------------------------------------------------------

ROCKY HILL, Conn. -- Ames Department Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMES) announced 
today that Joseph R. Ettore has been appointed President and Chief Executive 
Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Ettore was formerly President and Chief 
Executive Officer of Jamesway Corporation, a discount retail chain based in 
Secaucus, N.J. Ettore replaces Peter Thorner, former President and Chief 
Operating Officer, who has resigned to pursue personal interests.

According to Paul M. Buxbaum, Ames Chairman, the appointment of Ettore is a 
logical step in the evolution of Ames, enabling the company to be even more 
competitive and achieve its full potential going forward.

Buxbaum said, "Joe Ettore, a veteran of the retail industry, has the proven 
merchandising skills that we feel are needed to take Ames to the next level. 
His appointment, along with the company's new, three-year, $300 million credit 
facility, should allow Ames to continue to build on its positive momentum."

Ames, which operates 306 stores in the Northeast, reported its first annual net 
profit in five years on April 5, 1994.
