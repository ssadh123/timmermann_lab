CoreStates Reports Solid First Quarter Earnings

Philadelphia, April 19, 1994--CoreStates Financial Corp today reported 
net income for the first quarter of $91,912,000 or 72 cents per share, 
reflecting strong returns on average assets of 1.48% and on average equity of 
17.72%.

Net income for the first quarter of 1993, before a change in accounting 
principles, was $75,050,000 or 58 cents per share. The 1993 figures have been 
restated for the acquisition of Constellation Bancorp during the first quarter
of 1994, which is accounted for as a pooling of interests. All figures reflect
the two-for-one split in CoreStates' common stock on October 15, 1993.

Terrence A. Larsen, chairman, said earnings were up about 14% over the 
year-earlier quarter, excluding effects of the pooling. With the Constellation
pooling, net income was up 24%.

He said year-to-year revenue growth was "less than what we had been 
seeing in recent quarters," on both credit and fee-based products and 
services. He noted, however, that the banking company did see a pickup of loan
demand in March, and that trend has continued to build so far in April. He 
said revenue slowing may have

been related to severe weather in the region.

"The banking industry continues to face challenges on both margins and 
volume growth," said Larsen, "and we are not immune to those issues."

"Revenue growth is particularly an issue, and earnings are being driven 
at least as much by expense control as they are by revenue growth."

Larsen said total non-financial expenses declined slightly, though the 
majority of the cost savings from the Constellation acquisition will not begin
until the second quarter.

"We continue to chip away at our expense ratio, which has come down a bit 
in each recent quarter, excluding the one-time charges associated with the 
Constellation acquisition," he said. "This is an area where we will be 
focusing greater attention."

"As our performance ratios suggest," he said, "we are continuing to 
outperform the industry. We have confidence that the quality of our people, in
whom we have made substantial investments over the last three years, will 
enable us to maintain our leadership position in the industry."

The company's investment in the joint venture Electronic Payment 
Services, Inc., was restructured in December. This action adds $3 million to 
quarterly revenues over ten years, representing recognition of deferred gains 
from CoreStates' contribution of its former electronic payment services 
businesses to the venture. 

On a restated basis, non-performing assets were down from $538 million a 
year ago to $464 million on March 31. The decrease reflected continuous 
decline in non-performing assets in the original CoreStates portfolio and 
declines during the middle quarters of 1993 in Constellation's non-performing 
assets. These declines were partly offset by implementation in the first 
quarter of a previously-announced plan to move to earlier recognition of 
non-performing assets in the Constellation portfolio.

The provision for loan losses was $25 million, down from the

restated $27.5 million of a year earlier. Net charge-offs were $30.2 million, 
compared to $20.7 million in the first quarter of 1993. The reserve for loan 
losses, strengthened by a $120 million supplemental provision charged to 
Constellation's fourth quarter, grew to $533 million, or 142% of non-performing
loans, as of March 31. 

"We recognized going in that there would be a need to manage the 
Constellation portfolio aggressively, and I am happy to say that we are right 
on plan in our progress so far," Larsen said.

He said that sales of Constellation securities undertaken in the quarter 
to create a better fit with CoreStates' asset and liability management program
had resulted in $5 million in securities gains, more than offsetting first 
quarter earnings dilution that otherwise would have been caused by the 
acquisition.

Consolidated total assets at March 31 were $25.7 billion, including $18.5
billion consolidated net loans. Consolidated deposits were $18.7 billion.

Shareholders' equity at March 31 was $2.0 billion, or 7.9% of total 
assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 or core capital as a percentage of 
quarterly average assets) was 7.8% for the quarter. Tier 1 capital at March 31
was 8.9% of risk-adjusted assets and total capital was 13.1% of risk-adjusted 
assets, compared to minimum regulatory requirements of 4% and 8%, 
respectively.
