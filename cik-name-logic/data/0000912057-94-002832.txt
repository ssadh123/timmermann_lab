Item 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On August 21, 1994, Investors Bank Corp. ("IBC"), Firstar Corporation
("Firstar") and Firstar Corporation of Minnesota ("Firstar Minnesota") entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Agreement"), pursuant to
which IBC will be merged (the "Merger") with and into Firstar Minnesota.
Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of Common Stock of IBC would
become .8676 shares of Firstar Common Stock and each outstanding share of IBC's
Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series 1991 would become the right to
receive $27.50 (plus accumulated and unpaid dividends) in cash (subject to
dissenters' rights). The 303,240 outstanding warrants to purchase 202,160
shares of IBC Common Stock would become warrants to purchase 175,394 shares of
Firstar Common Stock. The Merger is intended to be tax free for federal income
tax purposes to holders of IBC Common Stock and to be accounted for as a
"pooling of interest." The Merger is subject to a number of conditions,
including regulatory approval.

The Agreement also calls for the merger of Investors Savings Bank, F.S.B.,
the federal savings bank subsidiary of IBC, with and into Firstar Bank
Minnesota, N.A. on the date of, and immediately after effectiveness of, the
Merger.

Firstar may terminate the Agreement on or before September 11, 1994 after
completion of its due diligence investigation of certain loan files. Investors
may terminate the Agreement if the trading price of Firstar Common Stock during
the ten trading days ending three days before the special stockholders' meeting
to approve the Merger is below $29 per share and at least 12.5% below an index
composed of certain commercial banks.

The Agreement also requires IBC to use its best efforts to repurchase
shares of IBC Common Stock to be held in treasury for issuance upon exercise of
outstanding options and warrants, to the extent such repurchases do not exceed
$2,000,000.

The approval and announcement of the Merger is exempt from the provisions
of the IBC Shareholder Rights Plan. To make clear this clear, Investors has
amended its Shareholder Rights Agreement.

All of the executive officers and directors of IBC have entered into voting
agreements that require them to vote for the Merger at a special meeting of
stockholders that will be called for such purpose.

The foregoing summary of the Agreement does not purport to be complete.
Reference is made to the press release and the complete copy of the Agreement
filed as Exhibits to this Form 8-K for more complete information.

("Agreement"), among FIRSTAR CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation ("Firstar"),
FIRSTAR CORPORATION OF MINNESOTA, a Minnesota corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Firstar ("Sub"), and INVESTORS BANK CORP., a Delaware corporation
("Investors").

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Firstar, Sub and
Investors have approved the merger of Investors with and into Sub (the "Merger")
in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof and of the Plan of Merger in
the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A executed concurrently herewith between Sub
and Investors, and joined in by Firstar for certain limited purposes (the "Plan
of Merger");

WHEREAS, Investors owns all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Investors Savings Bank, F.S.B. ("Investors Bank") and Sub owns all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Firstar Bank of Minnesota, N.A.
("Firstar Bank"); and the parties hereto have agreed to cause Investors Bank and
Firstar Bank to execute an Agreement of Merger substantially to the effect of
EXHIBIT B (the "Bank Merger Agreement"), whereby Investors Bank will be merged
into Firstar Bank (the "Bank Merger") immediately after the Effective Time (as
defined in SECTION 1.02 hereof);

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Firstar, Sub and
Investors believe that such proposed Merger, the exchange of shares of Firstar
Common Stock (as defined in SECTION 2.01(a) hereof) for shares of Investors
Common Stock (as defined in SECTION 2.01 hereof) and the payment of cash for
shares of Investors Preferred Stock (as defined in SECTION 2.01 hereof),
pursuant and subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger
(collectively, the "Merger Agreements"), is desirable and in the best interests
of their respective corporations and stockholders; and

WHEREAS, Firstar, Sub and Investors desire to make certain
representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and
also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I
THE MERGER

1.01. THE MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Firstar, Sub and Investors agree to effect the Merger of Investors
with and into Sub in accordance with the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the
"MBCA") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL").

1.02. EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. Subject to the provisions of
the Merger Agreements, (a) articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") shall
be duly prepared and executed by Sub and Investors and thereafter delivered to
the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota for filing, as provided in the
MBCA, on the Closing Date (as defined in SECTION 1.03) and (b) a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly prepared and executed by Sub
and Investors and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware for filing, as

Page 14 of 94

<PAGE>

provided in the DGCL, on the Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective
upon the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Minnesota and the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or at such time on the Closing Date as is provided in the
Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

1.03. CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date (the "Closing Date") to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the fifth business day after the latest to
occur of (i) receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals of the Merger, the
Bank Merger and, if desired by Firstar, the Conversion (as defined in SECTION
1.04) from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal
Reserve Board"), the Office of Thrift Supervision of the Department of the
Treasury (the "OTS") and the United States Comptroller of the Currency (the
"Comptroller") and the expiration of any waiting periods imposed by law and (ii)
the date on which the stockholders of Investors approve the Merger. The Closing
will take place at the offices of Firstar, unless another place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Closing
does not take place on the date referred to in the first sentence of this
Section because any condition to the obligations of Firstar and Sub, on the one
hand, or Investors, on the other hand, under this Agreement is not met on that
date, the other party may postpone the Closing from time to time to any
designated subsequent business day not more than ten business days after the
original or postponed date on which the Closing was to occur by delivering
notice of such postponement on the date the Closing was to occur.

1.04. FORM OF TRANSACTION. Firstar at its reasonable discretion
may restructure the Merger and/or the Bank Merger provided that, as a result of
such change, there is no (a) effect upon the consideration to be delivered
pursuant to ARTICLE II or change in the tax treatment to the recipients of
Firstar Common Stock to be delivered in the Merger, the holders of options or
warrants to purchase shares of Investors or any other holder of a security of
Investors, or change in the accounting treatment of the transactions
contemplated hereby as a pooling-of-interests, (b) increase in the obligations
of Investors or any Investors Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement, except for
the obligations set forth in SECTION 7.01 and SECTION 7.06 of this Agreement, or
(c) decrease in the obligations of Firstar to Investors, any Investors
Subsidiary or any officer, director, employee, representative or agent of any of
them set forth in this Agreement. Such restructuring may include (i) changing
the Firstar Subsidiaries (as defined in SECTION 4.02) that are parties to the
Merger and/or the Bank Merger and/or the party surviving either of such
transactions and/or (ii) converting Investors Bank to a national banking
association (the "Conversion") immediately after the Effective Time and prior to
merging the resulting bank into Firstar Bank. At the request of Firstar, the
parties each will take or perform any necessary or advisable steps to
restructure the transaction. In the event the merger between Firstar Bank and
Investors Bank is restructured as provided in this SECTION 1.04, references in
this Agreement to the Bank Merger shall be deemed to include references to the
restructured transaction and references to the Bank Merger Agreement shall be
deemed to include references to the documents effecting the restructured
transaction.

and Investors agrees to cause Investors Bank to execute the Bank Merger
Agreement within ten days from the date hereof, and Sub, as the sole shareholder

ARTICLE II
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON INVESTORS CAPITAL STOCK

2.01. EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Investors' common stock, $.01 par value ("Investors Common Stock"), or
Investors' Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series 1991, $.01 par value
("Investors Preferred Stock"), but subject to the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL with respect to the rights of dissenting holders of Investors Preferred
Stock:

(a) CONVERSION OF INVESTORS COMMON STOCK. Subject to adjustment
pursuant to SECTION 2.01(e) and SECTION 2.05, each then issued and outstanding
share of Investors Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive
0.8676 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, $1.25 par value, of Firstar ("Firstar Common Stock"), including with each
such share one-half of one Firstar Preferred Share Purchase Right ("Firstar
Right") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of January 20, 1989,
between Firstar and Firstar Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "Firstar Rights
Agreement"). Prior to the Distribution Date (as defined in the Firstar Rights
Agreement), all references in this Agreement to the Firstar Common Stock to be
received pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed to include the Firstar Rights.

(b) CONVERSION OF INVESTORS PREFERRED STOCK. Each then issued and
outstanding share of Investors Preferred Stock shall be converted into the right
to receive $27.50 plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares of
Investors Preferred Stock to the Effective Time, payable in cash.

(c) STOCK HELD BY INVESTORS. Each then issued and outstanding share
of Investors Common Stock or Investors Preferred Stock owned by Investors or any
direct or indirect subsidiary of Investors (other than shares held in a
fiduciary capacity) and each share of Investors Common Stock or Investors
Preferred Stock issued and held in Investors' treasury will be cancelled and
retired.

(d) CANCELLATION OF SHARES. All shares of Investors Common Stock and
Investors Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Firstar Common Stock or cash,
as the case may be, to be issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such certificate in accordance with the Plan of Merger, without interest.

(e) ADJUSTMENT. If prior to the Effective Time Firstar shall declare
a stock dividend or distribution upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or
combine its shares of Firstar Common Stock or declare a dividend or make a
distribution on Firstar Common Stock of any security convertible into Firstar
Common Stock or exercisable to purchase Firstar Common Stock (including, without
limitation, distribution of any Firstar Rights after a Distribution Date),
appropriate adjustment or adjustments will be made in the Exchange Ratio.

2.02. EFFECT ON OPTIONS TO PURCHASE INVESTORS COMMON STOCK. Each
Investors Stock Option (as defined in SECTION 3.03(b)) which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become and represent an
option (a "Firstar Stock Option") to purchase, for the aggregate price payable
by such option holder on exercise of the Investors Stock Option, the number of
shares of Firstar Common Stock which he or she would have received pursuant to
the Merger if such option had been exercised in full immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Firstar shall pay cash to holders of Investors Stock Options in
lieu of issuing fractional shares of Firstar Common

Page 16 of 94

<PAGE>

Stock upon exercise of a Firstar Stock Option. After the Effective Time, each
Firstar Stock Option shall be exercisable on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the Investors Stock Option as of the Effective Time.

2.03. EFFECT ON WARRANTS TO PURCHASE INVESTORS COMMON STOCK. Each
Investors Warrant (as defined in SECTION 3.03(b)) which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
pursuant to the Supplemental Warrant Agreement (as defined in SECTION 6.07) and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become and represent a
warrant (a "Firstar Warrant") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such Investors Warrant, the same number of shares of
Firstar Common Stock as the holder of such Investors Warrant would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such
warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, at a price per share
equal to (x) the aggregate purchase price under the Investors Warrant for the
shares of Investors Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such
Investors Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the
number of full shares of Firstar Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to
such Warrant. Firstar shall pay cash to holders of Investors Warrants in lieu
of issuing fractional shares of Firstar Common Stock upon exercise of a Firstar
Warrant. After the Effective Time, each Firstar Warrant shall be exercisable on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Investors Warrant as
of the Effective Time.

2.04. EFFECT ON INVESTORS RESTRICTED STOCK. Each share of
Investors Restricted Stock (as defined in SECTION 3.03(b)) which is not fully
vested at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, become and represent the right to
receive a number of shares of Firstar Common Stock (not to exceed the Exchange
Ratio) with a value as of the Effective Time equal to the "fair value" of such
Investors Restricted Stock as determined by an independent third party expert
selected by Inventors taking into account the terms and conditions (other than
any rights to a tax offset bonus), including vesting schedule, as were
applicable under the Investors Restricted Stock Award Agreement (as defined in
SECTION 3.03(b)) as of the Effective Time, and Firstar shall, as of the
Effective Time, issue the appropriate number of shares of Firstar Common Stock
(decreased to the nearest full share) to each holder of Investors Restricted
Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if treatment in accordance with this
sentence does not prevent the delivery of the opinions contemplated by SECTION
8.02(d), then each share of Investors Restricted Stock under agreements dated
January 4, 1994 which is not fully vested at the Effective Time shall not be
converted as provided in the preceding sentence, but instead shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the holder thereof, become and represent
the number of shares of Firstar Common Stock ("Firstar Restricted Stock")
determined by multiplying such share of Investors Restricted Stock by the
Exchange Ratio, subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting
schedule, as were applicable under the Investors Restricted Award Agreement (as
defined in SECTION 3.03(b)) as of the Effective Time.

2.05. ADJUSTMENT TO EXCHANGE RATIO. If the Environmental Reports
delivered pursuant to SECTION 7.07 indicate that any cleanup, removal, remedial
action or other response is required and if the estimated costs of such
remediation as set forth in the Environmental Reports and/or actual costs of
such remediation are greater than $500,000, then, in addition to any other
rights that Firstar may have pursuant to this Agreement, Firstar shall have the
right to adjust the Exchange Ratio otherwise provided in SECTION 2.01(a) with
the effect that the aggregate market value of Firstar Common Stock (based upon
an assumed price per share of Firstar Common Stock of $32.125 otherwise to be
delivered to the holders of Investors Common Stock as of the Effective Time
(including any fractional shares) shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the
total costs of remediation.

to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material
obligation or the loss of a material benefit under, or the creation of a
material lien, pledge, security interest or other encumbrance on assets (any
such conflict, violation, default, right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration loss or creation, a "Violation"), pursuant to any provision of (a)
the Investors Certificate, the by-laws of Investors or the charter, certificate
or articles of incorporation or by-laws of any Investors Subsidiary or (b)
except (i) as set forth in the Investors Disclosure Letter or (ii) as
contemplated by the next sentence hereof, any loan or credit agreement, note,
mortgage, indenture, lease, Investors Benefit Plan (as defined in SECTION 3.11)
or other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, franchise, license,
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable
to Investors or any Subsidiary of Investors or their respective properties or
assets which Violation pursuant to this CLAUSE (b) would have an Investors
Material Adverse Effect. Other than in connection or in compliance with the
provisions of the DGCL or the MBCA, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Securities Act"), the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the
"Exchange Act"), the securities or "blue sky" laws of the various states, and
consents, authorizations, approvals, notices or exemptions required under the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"), the SLHC Act, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the "FDI Act"), the Home Owners Loan
Act, as amended (the "HOLA"), and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), no consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any court,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or
instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), is required on
the part of Investors or any of the Investors Subsidiaries in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Bank
Merger Agreement by Investors or Investors Bank, as the case may be, or the
consummation by Investors or Investors Bank, as the case may be, of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the failure to obtain which would
have an Investors Material Adverse Effect.

3.05. INVESTORS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) The consolidated
balance sheets of Investors as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the related
consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of cash flows and
consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity for the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1993 (the "Latest Statement Date"), accompanied
by the unqualified opinion of KPMG Peat Marwick, copies of which have been
furnished by Investors to Firstar; the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
Investors as of June 30, 1994 and the related consolidated statement of income,
consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated
statements of cash flows for the six months then ended, in the form prepared for
Investors' internal use, copies of which have been furnished by Investors to
Firstar; and like financial information included in Forms 10-Q filed with the
SEC subsequent to the Latest Statement Date (collectively, the "Investors
Financial Statements"), have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles as utilized in the Investors Financial Statements applied
on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto), and present fairly the consolidated financial condition of Investors
at the dates, and the consolidated results of operations, changes in
stockholders' equity and cash flows for the periods, stated therein. In the
case of interim fiscal periods, all adjustments, consisting only of normal

Page 21 of 94

<PAGE>

recurring items, which management of Investors believes necessary for a fair
presentation of such financial information, have been made, subject to year-end
audit adjustments, none of which could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations
of Investors.

(b) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance
sheet of Investors and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, or in the notes
thereto (the "Investors Balance Sheet"), neither Investors nor any Investors
Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on a
balance sheet, or in the notes thereto, prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, except (i) for liabilities or obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Latest Statement Date that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have an Investors Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) as otherwise reflected in the Investors Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement. Except as disclosed in the Investors Disclosure
Letter, neither Investors nor any Investors Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that are not required to be reflected on a balance sheet, or in the notes
thereto, except for liabilities or obligations that do not, individually or in
the aggregate, have an Investors Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Without limitation to the foregoing, Investors' consolidated
reserve for losses on loans included in the Investors Financial Statements as of
June 30, 1994 was $3,198,338, representing .36% of total consolidated loans held
in portfolio, and Investors' consolidated reserve for losses on real estate was
$120,043, representing 2.27% of total consolidated real estate owned as a result
of foreclosure ("REO") reflected on such statements. The aggregate amount of
such reserve for losses on loans and reserve for losses on REO was adequate to
absorb reasonably expectable losses in the loan and REO portfolios of Investors
and Investors Bank. To the knowledge of Investors, there are no facts which
would cause it to increase the level of such reserve for losses on loans and
REO. The loan portfolio and REO portfolio of Investors Bank as of June 30, 1994
in excess of such reserves is, to the best knowledge and belief of the executive
officers of Investors and Investors Bank after due inquiry as to potential
losses, and based on past loan loss experience, fully realizable on REO and
fully collectible in accordance with the terms of the documentation relating to
the loans in such portfolio. The documentation relating to loans made by
Investors Bank and relating to all security interests, mortgages and other liens
with respect to all collateral for such loans, taken as a whole, is adequate for
the enforcement of the material terms of such loans and of the related security
interests, mortgages and other liens. The terms of such loans and of the
related security interests, mortgages and other liens comply in all material
respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including without
limitation laws, rules and regulations relating to the extension of credit).
Except as set forth in the Investors Disclosure Letter, (A) as of June 30, 1994,
there are no loans, leases, other extensions of credit or commitments to extend
credit of Investors Bank that have been or, to Investors' knowledge, should have
been classified by Investors Bank as nonaccrual, as restructured, as 90 days
past due, as still accruing and doubtful of collection or any comparable
classification and (B) no material information with respect to the loan
portfolios of Investors Bank has been withheld from Firstar. Not later than
three days after the date hereof, Investors will have provided Firstar with
access to true, correct and complete in all material respects written
information concerning the loan portfolios of Investors Bank.

3.06. REPORTS. Since January 1, 1991, Investors and the Investors
Subsidiaries have filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with
any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that were and are
required to be filed with (i) the SEC, including but not limited to Forms 10-K,
Forms 10-Q, Forms 8-K and proxy statements, (ii) the OTS, (iii) the FDIC, and
(iv) any other applicable federal or state securities, or savings institution
authorities (all

Page 22 of 94

<PAGE>

such reports and statements are collectively referred to herein as the
"Investors Reports"). As of their respective dates, the Investors Reports filed
prior to the date hereof complied in all material respects with all of the
statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by the regulatory
authority with which they were filed (including, to the extent applicable, Rule
10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act) and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein.

3.07. AUTHORIZATIONS; COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. (a)
Investors and its Subsidiaries hold all authorizations, permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities which
are material to the operations of the businesses of Investors and the Investors
Subsidiaries (the "Investors Permits"), including appropriate authorizations
from the OTS. Investors and the Investors Subsidiaries are in compliance with
the terms of the Investors Permits, except where the failure so to comply could
not reasonably be expected to have an Investors Material Adverse Effect. Except
as disclosed in the Investors Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement
or in the Investors Disclosure Letter, the businesses of Investors and the
Investors Subsidiaries are not being, and have not been, conducted in violation
of any domestic (federal, state or local) or foreign law, statute, ordinance or
regulation of any Governmental Entity (collectively "Laws"), except for possible
violations which individually or in the aggregate do not and, insofar as
reasonably can be foreseen, in the future will not, have an Investors Material
Adverse Effect. Except (i) as set forth in the Investors Disclosure Letter,
(ii) for regular, periodic reviews and examinations by Governmental Entities,
and (iii) for investigations or reviews by Governmental Entities other than
savings institution regulatory authorities where the outcome thereof will not
have an Investors Material Adverse Effect, as of the date hereof, no
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Investors,
any of the Investors Subsidiaries or any Investors' Property (as defined below)
is pending or, to the knowledge of Investors, threatened, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same.

(b) The Investors Disclosure Letter identifies each parcel of real
estate currently owned, leased or otherwise possessed or controlled by Investors
or any Investors Subsidiary on the date of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, REO and properties managed or controlled by Investors Bank in
connection with its lending or fiduciary operations (collectively, the
"Investors Property"), except that the Investors Disclosure Letter need not
identify residential real estate owned as a result of foreclosures having an
appraised value of less than $500,000. Except as set forth in the Investors
Disclosure Letter, neither Investors nor any Investors Subsidiary nor any of the
Investors Property owned or leased by them for use in the operation of their
respective businesses is in violation of any applicable zoning ordinance or
other law, regulation or requirement relating to the operation of any properties
used, including, without limitation, applicable environmental protection laws,
rules and regulations (collectively, "Environmental Laws"), other than
violations that, in the aggregate with any other conditions described in this
SECTION 3.07(b), would not result in costs that would be material to Investors
and the Investors Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and neither Investors nor any
Investors Subsidiary has received any notice of any such violation, or the
existence of any condemnation proceeding with respect to any Investors Property.
Except as set forth in the Investors Disclosure Letter, no Toxic Substances (as
defined below) have been deposited or disposed of in, on or under any Investors
Property during the period in which Investors or any of the Investors
Subsidiaries has owned, occupied, managed, controlled or operated such
properties, except to the extent the same, in the aggregate with any other
conditions described in this SECTION 3.07(b), would not result in costs that
would be material to Investors and the Investors Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Except as set forth in the Investors Disclosure Letter, Investors has no
knowledge (A) that prior owners, occupants or operators of all or any part of
the Investors Property ever used such properties as a dump or

Page 23 of 94

<PAGE>

gasoline service station, (B) that prior owners, occupants or operators of all
or part of the Investors Property ever deposited or disposed of or allowed to be
deposited or disposed of in, on or under such properties any Toxic Substances or
(C) that any past, present or known future event, condition, circumstances,
plans, errors or omissions have existed or occurred, are existing or occurring
or are reasonably expected to exist or occur on or with respect to any Investors
Property, or any other property as to which Investors or any Investors
Subsidiary has held or currently holds ownership or indicia of ownership
("Investors Interested Property"), except as to the matters in CLAUSES (B) AND
(C) to the extent the same, in the aggregate with any other conditions described
in this SECTION 3.07(b), would not result in costs that would be material to
Investors and the Investors Subsidiaries taken as a whole. To the best
knowledge of Investors, there are no conditions or circumstances in connection
with the Investors Property that could reasonably be anticipated to (i) cause
any Investors Property to be subject to any restrictions on ownership,
occupancy, use or transferability under any applicable Environmental Laws or
(ii) materially reduce the value of any Investors Property. To the best
knowledge of Investors and its Subsidiaries, neither Investors nor any Investors
Subsidiary has been identified as a potentially responsible party by any
Governmental Entity in a matter arising under any Environmental Laws. For
purposes of this Agreement, (1) "Toxic Substances" shall mean petroleum or
petroleum-based substance or waste, solid waste, PCBs, pesticides, herbicides,
lead, radioactive materials, urea formaldehyde foam insulation, or substances
defined as "hazardous substances" or "toxic substances" in any Environmental
Laws; (2) materials will be considered to be deposited or disposed of in, on or
under any real property if such materials have been stored, treated, recycled,
used or accidentally or intentionally spilled, released, dumped, emitted or
otherwise placed, deposited or disposed of, or used in any construction, in, on
or under such property; and (3) costs of violations or conditions shall take
into account, without limitation, liabilities, damages, penalties, injunctive
relief or removal, remediation or other costs under any applicable Environmental
Law.

3.08. LITIGATION AND CLAIMS. Except as disclosed in the Investors
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or in the Investors Disclosure
Letter: (a) none of Investors, any of the Investors Subsidiaries or any
Investors' Property is subject to any continuing order of, or written agreement
or memorandum of understanding with any federal or state savings institution or
insurance authority or other Governmental Entity, or any judgment, order, writ,
injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator, including,
without limitation, cease-and-desist or other orders of any savings institution
regulatory authority, (b) there is no action, suit, litigation, proceeding or
arbitration ("Proceeding") against or affecting Investors or any Subsidiary of
Investors or, to the knowledge of Investors, any directors, officers, employees
or agents of Investors or any Subsidiary of Investors (in their respective
capacities as directors, officers, employees or agents) pending or, to the
knowledge of Investors, threatened, which would, if adversely determined, have
an Investors Material Adverse Effect or, to the knowledge of Investors, any
basis therefor, and (c) there are no uncured material violations, or violations
with respect to which material refunds or restitutions may be required, cited in
any compliance report to Investors or any Investors Subsidiary as a result of
the examination by any savings institution regulatory authority.

3.09. TAXES. Investors and each Investors Subsidiary has filed
all tax returns required to be filed by them and has paid (or Investors has paid
on its behalf), or has set up an adequate reserve for the payment of, all taxes
required to be paid as shown on such returns, except to the extent such
nonpayment did not result in a liability material to Investors and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and the most recent Investors financial
statements contained in the Investors Reports reflect an adequate reserve for
all taxes payable by Investors and its Subsidiaries accrued through the date of
such financial statements. The Investors Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of
the date hereof, the following information with respect to Investors and each
Subsidiary of Investors:

Page 24 of 94

<PAGE>

(a) the most recent tax year for which the United States Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") has completed its examination of such corporation, (b) whether
there is an examination pending by the IRS with respect to such corporation and,
if so, the tax years involved, (c) whether such corporation has executed or
filed with the IRS any agreement which is still in effect extending the period
for assessment and collection of any federal tax and, if so, the tax years
covered by such agreement and the expiration date of such extension, and (d)
whether there are any existing material disputes as to foreign, state, or local
taxes. There are no liens for taxes upon the assets of Investors or of any
Investors Subsidiary, except for statutory liens for taxes not yet delinquent or
the validity of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and, in either case, only if adequate reserves therefor have been
established on Investors' books in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Except as disclosed in the Investors Disclosure Letter, neither
Investors nor any Investors Subsidiary is a party to any action or proceeding by
any governmental authority for assessment and collection of taxes, and no claim
for assessment and collection of taxes has been asserted against any of them.
For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "tax" (including, with correlative
meaning, the terms "taxes" and "taxable") shall include all federal, state,
local and foreign income, profits, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, sales,
employment, use, personal and real property, withholding, excise and other
taxes, duties or assessments of any nature whatsoever, together with all
interest, penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts.
Investors and each Investors Subsidiary has withheld from its employees (and
timely paid to the appropriate governmental agency) amounts which are proper and
accurate in all material respects for all periods through the date hereof in
material compliance with all tax withholding provisions of applicable federal,
state, foreign and local laws (including without limitation income, social
security and employment tax withholding for all types of compensation). Except
as disclosed in the Investors Disclosure Letter, and except that prior to March
1984 Investors was part of the affiliated group for which Interregional
Financial Group, Inc. was the parent, neither Investors nor any Investors
Subsidiary has ever been a member of an affiliated group of corporations (within
the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code")) filing consolidated federal income tax returns, other than the
affiliated group of which Investors is the common parent. To the best knowledge
of Investors, neither Investors nor any Investors Subsidiary has made any
payments, or been a party to an agreement that under any circumstances could
obligate it to make payments based upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby constituting a change of the nature described in Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code, that are or will not be deductible because of
Section 280G of the Code.

3.10. CERTAIN AGREEMENTS. Except as discussed in the Investors
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as disclosed in the
Investors Disclosure Letter, and except for this Agreement, as of the date
hereof, neither Investors nor any Investors Subsidiary is a party to any oral or
written (i) consulting agreement not terminable on 60 days' or less notice or
employment agreement or other agreement providing any term of employment,
compensation guarantee, or severance benefit, (ii) union, guild or collective
bargaining agreement, (iii) agreement or plan, including any stock option plan,
stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan, any
of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of
which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will
be calculated on the basis of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iv) contract, agreement or understanding to repurchase assets previously sold
(or to indemnify or otherwise compensate the purchaser in respect of such
assets), (v) contract containing covenants which limit the ability of Investors
or any Investors Subsidiary to compete in any line of business or with any
person or which involve any restriction of the geographical area in which, or
method by which, Investors or any Investors Subsidiary may carry on its business
(other than as may be required by law or applicable

Page 25 of 94

<PAGE>

regulatory authorities), (vi) any contract, agreement or other instrument or
undertaking which is not terminable by Investors or any Investors Subsidiary
without additional payment or penalty within 60 days and obligates Investors or
any Investors Subsidiary for payments or other consideration with a value in
excess of $100,000, other than loan agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business, or (vii) other executory material agreement as defined by
the instructions to Exhibit 10 under Item 601 of SEC Regulation S-K. Except as
set forth in the Investors Disclosure Letter, neither Investors nor any of the
Investors Subsidiaries is in Violation of any loan or credit agreement, note,
mortgage, indenture or other agreement, obligation or instrument applicable to
Investors or any Investors Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets,
except for any such Violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have an Investors Material Adverse Effect. Investors has delivered a valid and
effective notice of termination pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Electronic Data
Processing and Management Information Service Agreement (the "EDP Agreement")
between Investors and Financial Information Trust (n/k/a Newtrend), dated April
30, 1990, as a result of which the EDP Agreement will terminate without penalty
in February 1996.

3.11. BENEFIT PLANS. (a) The Investors Disclosure Letter lists
(i) each employee bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, stock purchase, stock
appreciation right, stock option and severance pay plan, (ii) each pension,
profit sharing, stock bonus, thrift, savings and employee stock ownership plan,
and (iii) every other employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")
(collectively "Benefit Plans"), which Investors or any Investors Subsidiary
maintains or to which Investors or any Investors Subsidiary contributes on
behalf of current or former employees. Except as disclosed in the Investors
Disclosure Letter, all of the plans and programs listed in the Investors
Disclosure Letter (collectively, "Investors Benefit Plans") comply with all
applicable requirements of ERISA and all other applicable federal and state
laws, including without limitation the reporting and disclosure requirements of
Part 1 of Title I of ERISA. Each of the Investors Benefit Plans that is
intended to be a pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, thrift, savings or
employee stock ownership plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has been determined by the IRS to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, and,
except as disclosed in Investors Disclosure Letter, there exist no circumstances
that would adversely affect the qualified status of any such Investors Benefit
Plan under that section. No Investors Benefit Plan is a defined benefit pension
plan covered by Title IV of ERISA, and no such Plan is a "multi-employer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. Except as set forth in the
Investors Disclosure Letter, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of
Investors, threatened litigation, governmental proceeding or investigation
against or relating to any Investors Benefit Plan, and to the knowledge of
Investors there is no reasonable basis for any material proceedings, claims,
actions or proceedings against any Plan. Except as set forth in the Investors
Disclosure Letter, no Investors Benefit Plan has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975(c) of the
Code) since the date on which said sections became applicable to such Plan, and
no Investors Benefit Plan has engaged in a transaction involving the purchase or
sale of employer securities by such Plan from or to a "disqualified person"
(within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code). Neither Investors nor any
Subsidiary of Investors has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency"
(within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, with
respect to any Investors Benefit Plan. All Investors Benefit Plans that are
group health plans, within the meaning of Section 4980B of the Code or Section
601 of ERISA, have been operated in material compliance with the group health
plan continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Section
601 of ERISA to the extent such requirements are applicable.

(b) Investors has delivered to Firstar copies of (i) each Investors
Benefit Plan, (ii) current summary plan descriptions of each Investors Benefit
Plan for which they are required, (iii) each trust agreement, insurance policy
or other instrument relating to the funding of any Investors Benefit Plan, (iv)
the most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 series) and accompanying schedules
filed with the IRS or United States Department of Labor with respect to each
Investors Benefit Plan for which they are required, (v) the most recent
determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to each Investors Benefit
Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code, (vi) the most
recent available financial statements for each Investors Benefit Plan that has
assets, and (vii) the most recent audited financial statements for each
Investors Benefit Plan for which audited financial statements are required by
ERISA.

(c) The Investors Disclosure Letter describes any obligation that
Investors and/or any Subsidiaries of Investors has to provide health and welfare
benefits to retirees and other former employees or their dependents (other than
rights arising solely under Section 601 of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code or
under Minnesota statutes requiring continuation of life insurance) including
information as to the number of retirees, other former employees and dependents
entitled to such coverage and their ages.

3.12. INSURANCE. Investors and each Investors Subsidiary is
presently insured, and during each of the past five calendar years has been
insured, for reasonable amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies against such risks as, to the best knowledge of Investors, companies
engaged in a similar business would, in accordance with good business practice,
customarily be insured. Investors has delivered to Firstar correct and complete
copies of all material policies of insurance of Investors and the Investors
Subsidiaries currently in effect. Neither Investors nor any Investors
Subsidiary has any liability for material unpaid premiums or premium adjustments
not properly reflected on the Investors Financial Statements and no notice of
cancellation or termination has been received by Investors or any Investors
Subsidiary with respect to any material insurance policy currently in effect.
Within the last three years, neither Investors nor any Subsidiary of Investors
has been refused any insurance with respect to any assets or operations, nor has
any coverage been limited in any material respect as to any assets or
operations, by any insurance carrier to which it has applied for any such
insurance or with which it has carried insurance during the last five years.

3.13. CONDUCT OF INVESTORS TO DATE. Except as disclosed in

connection with FHLB Borrowings, mortgaged, pledged, or subjected to lien,
claim, security interest, charge, encumbrance or restriction any of its assets
or properties; (f) neither Investors nor any Investors Subsidiary has discharged

enemy, or other similar or dissimilar casualty or event or otherwise, and
whether or not covered by insurance; (j) neither Investors nor any Investors
Subsidiary has cancelled or compromised any debt to an extent exceeding $100,000
owed to Investors or any Investors Subsidiary or claim to an extent exceeding
$100,000 asserted by Investors or any Investors Subsidiary; (k) neither
Investors nor any Investors Subsidiary has entered, or agreed to enter, into any
agreement or arrangement granting any right of refusal or other preferential

the consent of any party to the transfer and assignment of any such material
assets, properties or rights; (l) there has not been any other transaction,
commitment, dispute or other event or condition of any character (whether or not
in the ordinary course of business) individually or in the aggregate having or
which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future is reasonably likely
to have, an Investors Material Adverse Effect, other than any changes resulting
primarily by reason of changes in savings institution laws or regulations (or
interpretations thereof), changes in the general level of interest rates or
changes in economic, financial or market conditions affecting the savings
institution industry generally in the regions in which Investors and the
Investors Subsidiaries operate; and (m) there has not been any change in the
method of accounting or accounting practices of Investors or any of the
Investors Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in the Investors Disclosure Letter,
none of Investors' President and Chief Executive Officer, any Executive Vice

Investors or the senior personnel administrator of Investors has any knowledge
of the announced or anticipated resignation of (1) any officer or key employee
of Investors or any of the Investors Subsidiaries or (2) other employees of
Investors or any Investors Subsidiary, in the case of this CLAUSE (2) at a rate
substantially higher than the historical resignation rate for such employees of
Investors or the Investors Subsidiaries, other than, in either case,
resignations that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely
to have an Investors Material Adverse Effect. From and after January 1, 1994
through the date of this Agreement, no customers of Investors or any Investors
Subsidiary have indicated that they will stop or decrease the rate of business
done with Investors or any Investors Subsidiary (except for changes in the
ordinary course of business) that would, individually or in the aggregate, have
an Investors Material Adverse Effect.

reflected in the Investors Financial Statements, for any lien for current taxes
not yet delinquent, for pledges to secure deposits and for such other liens,
security interests, claims, charges, options or other encumbrances and
imperfections of title which do not materially affect the value of personal or
real property reflected in the Investors Financial Statements or acquired since
the date of such Statements and which do not materially interfere with or impair
the present and continued use of such property, Investors and its Subsidiaries
have good title, free and clear of any liens, security interests, claims,
charges, options or other encumbrances, to all of the personal and real property
reflected in the Investors Financial Statements, and all personal and real
property acquired since the date of such Statements, except such personal and
real property as has been disposed of in the ordinary course of business. The
Investors Disclosure Letter lists all acquisitions or dispositions of capital
assets planned as of the date of this Agreement by Investors or any Investors
Subsidiary, other than individual transactions with a value not in excess of
$100,000. Substantially all Investors' and each Investors Subsidiary's
buildings and equipment in regular use (including such buildings and equipment
as are leased) have been well maintained and are in good and serviceable
condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. The Investors Disclosure Letter
contains a brief description, including terms, of each lease for real and
personal property to which Investors or any Investors Subsidiary is a party.
Investors or the applicable Investors Subsidiary, as lessee, has a valid and
existing leasehold interest under each of such leases, true and correct copies
of which Investors has delivered to Firstar. There is not, under any of such
leases relating to real property or any other material leases, any material
existing default by Investors, its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of
Investors, any other party thereto, or any event with notice or lapse of time or
both would constitute such a material default.

arrangements.

(b) All interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements to
which Investors is subject and other interest rate risk management arrangements

ARTICLE IV
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FIRSTAR AND SUB

Firstar and Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
Investors as follows:

4.01. ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Firstar is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in active status under the laws of the
State of Wisconsin and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not
have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, prospects or
financial condition of Firstar and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (a "Firstar
Material Adverse Effect"). Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota and has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the
failure to have such power or authority would not have a Firstar Material
Adverse Effect. Each of Firstar and Sub is qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each other state or foreign jurisdiction where its ownership or
leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified and where the failure to be so qualified would have a Firstar Material
Adverse Effect. Each of Firstar and Sub is registered as a bank holding company
with the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. Firstar has delivered to
Investors true, accurate and complete copies of the currently effective Restated
Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of Firstar, including all amendments
thereto.

4.02. FIRSTAR SUBSIDIARIES. Except as set forth in the Firstar
Disclosure Letter (which is a letter delivered by Firstar and Sub to Investors
on the date hereof, the receipt thereof having been acknowledged by Investors
executing a copy thereof), Firstar beneficially owns, directly or indirectly,
all of the shares of the outstanding capital stock of Sub and each of the
Subsidiaries listed in the Firstar Disclosure Letter (herein, including Sub,
called collectively the "Firstar Subsidiaries" or individually a "Firstar
Subsidiary"), which constitute Firstar's principal operating subsidiaries as of
the date of this Agreement. No equity securities of any of the Firstar
Subsidiaries are or may become required to be issued by reason of any option,
warrants, calls, rights or agreements of any character whatsoever; there are
outstanding no securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for shares
of any capital stock of any Firstar

Page 31 of 94

<PAGE>

Subsidiary; and there are no other contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements by which any Firstar Subsidiary is bound to issue additional shares
of its capital stock or options, warrants, calls, rights or agreements to
purchase or acquire any additional shares of its capital stock. Except as
provided for under any applicable banking statute and except as set forth in the
Firstar Disclosure Letter, all of the shares of capital stock of each of the
Firstar Subsidiaries owned by Firstar are fully paid and nonassessable (except
as provided in Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law
("WBCL")) and are owned by it free and clear of any claim, lien, encumbrance or
agreement with respect thereto. Each Firstar Subsidiary is a banking
association or a corporation, in each case duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing or in active status under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, and has the corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where the failure to have such power or authority would not have a
Firstar Material Adverse Effect. Each Firstar Subsidiary that is a national
bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System. The deposits of each Firstar
Subsidiary that is a banking institution and accepts deposits are insured by the
FDIC to the extent provided by law. Firstar has delivered to Investors true,
accurate and complete copies of the currently effective Articles of
Incorporation and By-laws of Sub.

4.03. CAPITAL STRUCTURE. As of the date hereof, the authorized
capital stock of Firstar consists of 120,000,000 shares of Firstar Common Stock
and 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00. No shares of
preferred stock are issued and outstanding on the date hereof. Except as
contemplated in the Merger Agreements, as set forth in the Firstar Disclosure
Letter or as set forth in the most recent report of Firstar filed with the SEC
on Form 10-K, there are, as of the date of the Merger Agreements, no outstanding
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character
whatsoever to which Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary is a party or by which it
is bound obligating Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or
any Voting Debt securities of Firstar or of any Firstar Subsidiary or obligating
Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such
option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. All outstanding shares
of Firstar capital stock are, and the shares of Firstar Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to or as specifically contemplated by the Merger Agreements will
be, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except as provided in WBCL
Section 180.0622(2)(b)) and not subject to preemptive rights. As of the date
hereof, the authorized capital stock of Sub consists of 10,000 shares of common
stock, $1.00 par value, 1,000 of which are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable; all of the issued shares are owned by Firstar.

4.04. AUTHORITY. Firstar and Sub have all requisite corporate
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the Plan of Merger and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Firstar and Sub. Approval of this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger by stockholders of Firstar is not required
under the WBCL, the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise. This
Agreement and the Plan of Merger have been duly executed and delivered by
Firstar and Sub, and each constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Firstar
and Sub enforceable in accordance with its terms. Upon execution and delivery
thereof by Investors Bank and Firstar Bank, the Bank Merger Agreement will have
been duly executed and delivered by Firstar Bank and will constitute a valid and
binding obligation of Firstar Bank enforceable in accordance with its terms.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger do not, and
the execution and delivery of the Bank Merger Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, result in any
Violation pursuant to any provision of (a) the Restated Articles of
Incorporation or By-laws of Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary or (b) except (i)
as set forth in the Firstar Disclosure Letter or (ii) as contemplated by the
next sentence hereof, any loan or credit agreement, note,

Page 32 of 94

<PAGE>

mortgage, indenture, lease, Firstar Benefit Plan (as defined in SECTION 4.11) or
other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, franchise, license, judgment,
order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Firstar
or any Firstar Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets which
Violation would have a Firstar Material Adverse Effect. Other than in
connection or in compliance with the provisions of the WBCL and the MBCA, the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the securities or blue sky laws of the various
states, and consents, authorizations, approvals, notices or exemptions required
under the BHC Act, the SLHC Act, the FDI Act, the HOLA and the HSR Act, no
consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is required on the part of Firstar or any
Firstar Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Bank Merger Agreement by Firstar or
Firstar Bank, as the case may be, or the consummation by Firstar or Firstar
Bank, as the case may be, of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
the failure to obtain which would have a Firstar Material Adverse Effect.

4.05. FIRSTAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The consolidated balance
sheets of Firstar as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the related consolidated
statements of income, consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated
statements of shareholders' equity for the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993, accompanied by the unqualified opinion of KPMG Peat Marwick,
copies of which have been furnished by Firstar to Investors; the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of Firstar as of June 30, 1994 and the related
consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement of cash flows and
consolidated statement of shareholders' equity for the six months then ended, in
the form prepared for Firstar's internal use, copies of which have been
furnished by Firstar to Investors; and like financial information included in
Forms 10-Q filed with the SEC subsequent to the Latest Statement Date
(collectively, the "Firstar Financial Statements"), have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as utilized in the
Firstar Financial Statements applied on a consistent basis (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto), and present fairly the consolidated
financial condition of Firstar at the dates, and the consolidated results of
operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the periods,
stated therein. In the case of interim fiscal periods, all adjustments,
consisting only of normal recurring items, which management of Firstar believes
necessary for a fair presentation of such financial information, have been made,
subject to year-end audit adjustments, none of which could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position or results of operations of Firstar.

4.06. REPORTS. Since January 1, 1991, Firstar and the Firstar
Subsidiaries have filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with
any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that were and are
required to be filed with (i) the SEC, including but not limited to Forms 10-K,
Forms 10-Q, Forms 8-K and proxy statements, (ii) the Federal Reserve Board,
(iii) the Comptroller, (iv) the FDIC and (v) any applicable federal or state
securities or banking authorities (all such reports and statements are
collectively referred to herein as the "Firstar Reports"). As of their
respective dates, the Firstar Reports filed prior to the date hereof complied
and will comply in all material respects with all of the statutes, rules and
regulations enforced or promulgated by the regulatory authority with which they
were filed (including, to the extent applicable, Rule 10b-5 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein.

4.07. AUTHORIZATIONS; COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. Firstar
and the Firstar Subsidiaries hold all authorizations, permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities which
are material to the operation of the businesses of Firstar and the Firstar
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (the "Firstar Permits"), including appropriate
authorizations from the Federal Reserve Board and Comptroller, except where the
failure to hold

Page 33 of 94

<PAGE>

the same could not reasonably be expected to have a Firstar Material Adverse
Effect. Firstar and the Firstar Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms
of the Firstar Permits, except where the failure so to comply could not
reasonably be expected to have a Firstar Material Adverse Effect. Except as
disclosed in the Firstar Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the
businesses of Firstar and the Firstar Subsidiaries are not being conducted in
violation of any Law, except for possible violations which individually or in
the aggregate do not, and, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future
will not, have a Firstar Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in the
Firstar Reports filed prior to the date hereof or set forth in the Firstar
Disclosure Letter and except for regular, periodic reviews and examinations by
Governmental Entities, as of the date of this Agreement, no investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Firstar or any of the Firstar
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Firstar, threatened, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, other than, in
each case, those the outcome of which, as far as reasonably can be foreseen,
will not have a Firstar Material Adverse Effect.

4.08. LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in the Firstar Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement or in the Firstar Disclosure Letter,
there is no Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Firstar, threatened
against or affecting Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary which is reasonably
likely to have a Firstar Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary having, or
which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future could have, any such
effect.

4.09. TAXES. Firstar and each of the Firstar Subsidiaries has
filed all tax returns required to be filed by them and has paid (or Firstar has
paid on its behalf), or has set up an adequate reserve for the payment of, all
taxes required to be paid as shown on such returns, and the most recent
financial statements contained in the Firstar Reports reflect an adequate
reserve for all taxes payable by Firstar and the Firstar Subsidiaries accrued
through the date of such financial statements; provided, however, that the
foregoing representation is made only to the best of Firstar's knowledge with
respect to each Firstar Subsidiary that has been, directly or indirectly,
acquired by Firstar subsequent to July 1, 1989. No material deficiencies for
any taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Firstar or any
Firstar Subsidiary.

4.10. CERTAIN AGREEMENTS. Except as disclosed in the Firstar
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, and except for this
Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Firstar nor any Firstar
Subsidiary is a party to any oral or written (i) agreement with any executive
officer or other key employee of Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary the benefits
of which are contingent, or the terms of which are materially altered, upon the
occurrence of a transaction involving Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary of the
nature contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agreement or plan, including any
stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan or stock
purchase plan, any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of
the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits
of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (iii) contract containing covenants that limit the ability of
Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary to compete in any line of business or with any
person or which involve any restriction on the geographical area in which, or
method by which, Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary may carry on its business
(other than as required by law or applicable regulatory authority), or (iv)
other executory agreement as defined by the instructions to Exhibit 10 under
Rule 601 of the SEC. Except as set forth in the Firstar Disclosure Letter,
neither Firstar nor any Firstar Subsidiary is in Violation of any loan or credit
agreement, note, mortgage, indenture or other agreement, obligation or
instrument applicable to Firstar or any Firstar Subsidiary or their

Page 34 of 94

<PAGE>

respective properties or assets, except for any Violation that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Firstar Material Adverse Effect.

4.11. BENEFIT PLANS. (i) With respect to the Benefit Plans
maintained by Firstar and any Firstar Subsidiary or to which Firstar or any
Firstar Subsidiary contributes on behalf of current or former employees as of
the date of this Agreement (the "Firstar Benefit Plans"), individually and in
the aggregate, no event has occurred, and to the knowledge of Firstar or any of
its Subsidiaries, there exists no condition or set of circumstances in
connection with which Firstar or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to any
liability that is reasonably likely to have a Firstar Material Adverse Effect
(except liability for benefits claims and funding obligations payable in the
ordinary course) under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.

(ii) Except as disclosed in the Firstar Reports filed prior to the
date hereof or as set forth in the Firstar Disclosure Letter, with respect to
the Firstar Benefit Plans, individually and in the aggregate, there are no
funded benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or
properly accrued and there are no unfunded benefit obligations which have not
been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, on the financial statements of
Firstar, which obligations are reasonably likely to have a Firstar Material
Adverse Effect.

4.12. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as disclosed
in the Firstar Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or in the
Firstar Disclosure Letter, and except as contemplated by this Agreement, the
Plan of Merger and the Bank Merger Agreement, from and after January 1, 1994 and
to the date of this Agreement: (a) Firstar and the Firstar Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary and usual course
consistent with past practice, (b) Firstar has not declared, set aside or paid
any dividend or other distribution in respect to any of Firstar's capital stock,
except for regular quarterly cash dividends not exceeding $.30 per share on
Firstar Common Stock with usual record and payment dates for such dividends, (c)
other than any changes resulting primarily by reason of changes in banking laws
or regulations (or interpretations thereof), changes in the general level of
interest rates or changes in economic, financial or market conditions affecting
the banking industry generally in the regions in which Firstar and the Firstar
Subsidiaries operate, there has not been any transaction, commitment, dispute or
other event or condition of any character (whether or not in the ordinary course
of business) individually or in the aggregate having or which, insofar as
reasonably can be foreseen, in the future is reasonably likely to have, a
Firstar Material Adverse Effect and (d) there has not been any material change
in the method of accounting or accounting practices of Firstar and the Firstar
Subsidiaries.

4.13. PROPERTIES, LEASES AND OTHER AGREEMENTS. Except as may be
reflected in the Firstar Financial Statements, for any lien for current taxes
not yet delinquent, for pledges to secure deposits and for such other liens,
security interests, claims, charges, options or other encumbrances and
imperfections of title which do not materially affect the value of personal or
real property reflected in the Firstar Financial Statements or acquired since
the date of such Statements and which do not materially interfere with or impair
the present and continued use of such property, Firstar and the Firstar
Subsidiaries have good title, free and clear of any liens, security interests,
claims, charges, options or other encumbrances to all of the personal and real
property reflected in the Firstar Financial Statements, and all personal and
real property acquired since the date of such Statements, except such personal
and real property as has been disposed of in the ordinary course of business.
All leases material to Firstar and the Firstar Subsidiaries pursuant to which
Firstar or any of the Firstar Subsidiaries, as lessee, leases real or personal
property are valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms and
there is not, under any of such leases,

Page 35 of 94

<PAGE>

any material existing default by Firstar, any of the Firstar Subsidiaries or, to
the best knowledge of Firstar, any other party thereto, or any event with notice
or lapse of time or both would constitute such a material default.

4.14. ACCOUNTING AND TAX MATTERS. To the knowledge of Firstar,
neither Firstar nor any of its affiliates has through the date hereof taken or
agreed to take any action that would prevent Firstar from accounting for the
business combination to be effected by the Merger as a pooling of interests or
would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

4.15. REGULATORY IMPEDIMENTS. As of the date hereof, except as
set forth in the Firstar Disclosure Letter, Firstar is not aware of the
existence of any factor that would materially delay or materially hinder
issuance of any of the required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate the

protests by nongovernmental parties.

case with usual record and payment dates for such dividends, and (B) dividends
by a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Investors;

(c)(ii) except as hereinbelow provided, declare or pay any dividends
or make any distributions in any amount on Investors Common Stock in the quarter
in which the Effective Time shall occur and in which the stockholders of
Investors Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends on the shares of
Firstar Common Stock into which the shares of Investors Common Stock have been
converted; it is the intent of this CLAUSE (ii) to provide that the holders of
Investors Common Stock will receive either the payment of cash dividends on
their shares of Investors Common Stock or the payment of cash dividends as the
holders of shares of Firstar Common Stock received in exchange for the shares of

the same calendar quarter both the payment of a cash dividend as holders of
Investors Common Stock and the payment of a cash dividend as holders of the
shares of Firstar Common Stock received in exchange for the shares of Investors
Common Stock; and if Investors does not declare and pay cash dividends in a
particular calendar quarter because of Investors' reasonable expectation that
the Effective Time was to have occurred in such calendar quarter wherein the
holders of Investors Common Stock would have become entitled to receive cash
dividends for such calendar quarter on the shares of Firstar Common Stock to
have been exchanged for the shares of Investors Common Stock, and the Effective
Time does not in fact occur in such calendar

all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in connection herewith.

(b) Investors will, through its Board of Directors, (i) unanimously
recommend to its stockholders approval of such matters, (ii) not withdraw,
modify or amend such recommendations, and (iii) use its best efforts to obtain
such stockholder approval; provided, however, that nothing contained in this
sentence shall prohibit the Board of Directors of Investors from failing to

as a result of the receipt of an unsolicited BONA FIDE written proposal to
acquire Investors pursuant to a merger, consolidation, tender offer, share
exchange, business combination, stock or asset purchase or other similar
transaction if (A) the Board of Directors, after consultation with and based
upon receipt of written advice from Dorsey & Whitney (a copy of which Investors
shall promptly deliver to Firstar), or other counsel acceptable to Firstar,
determines in good faith that such action is required for the Board of Directors
to comply with its fiduciary duties to Investors' stockholders under applicable
law and (B) the Board of Directors of Investors has no reason to believe that

information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission. At the time the S-4
becomes effective and at the time the Prospectus/Proxy Statement is mailed to
the stockholders of Investors and at all times subsequent to such mailing up to
and including the time of the Meeting, the S-4 and such Prospectus/Proxy
Statement (including any supplements thereto), with respect to all information

Firstar for the purpose of inclusion in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement.
Investors shall have the right to review and comment on the form of proxy

S-4 has become effective and of any supplements or amendments thereto, and
Firstar shall furnish Investors with copies of all such documents. Prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, each party shall consult
with the other with respect to any material (other than the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement) that might constitute a "prospectus" relating to the Merger within
the meaning of the Securities Act.

7.03. INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. (a) From and after the
Effective Time, Firstar shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person
who is now, or has been at any time to the date hereof or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, an officer or director of Investors or any of the Investors
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), liabilities or judgments
or amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the
prior written consent of Firstar, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (a "Claim") in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened
to be made, a party or a witness based in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of Investors or any of its Subsidiaries if such Claim pertains to any
matter or fact arising, existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the Merger and other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities") to
the full extent permitted under applicable Delaware or federal law as of the
date hereof or as amended prior to the Effective Time and under the Investors
Certificate and Investors' bylaws as in effect on the date hereof (and Firstar
shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or
proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law and
under the Investors Certificate or such bylaws, upon receipt of any undertaking
contemplated by Section 8.05(a) of the Bylaws of Firstar). Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this SECTION 7.03(a), upon learning
of any Claim, shall notify Firstar (but the failure to so notify Firstar shall
not relieve Firstar from any liability which Firstar may have under this
SECTION 7.03(a) except to the extent Firstar is prejudiced thereby) and shall
deliver to Firstar any undertaking contemplated by Section 8.05(a) of the bylaws
of Firstar. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties as a group
may retain only one law firm to represent them with respect to each matter
under

Page 47 of 94

<PAGE>

this SECTION 7.03(a) unless there is, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict on any one significant issue between the positions of any
two or more Indemnified Parties. Firstar shall use its best efforts to assure,
to the extent permitted under applicable law, that all limitations of liability
existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Investors
Certificate and Investors' bylaws, as in effect as of the date hereof, with
respect to claims or liabilities arising from facts or events existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), shall survive the Merger.
The obligations of Firstar described in this SECTION 7.03(a) shall continue in
full force and effect, without any amendment thereto, for a period of not less
than five years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim. Nothing in this
SECTION 7.03(a) shall affect the obligations to be assumed in the Merger by
Firstar to indemnify former directors and officers of Investors or Investors
Bank pursuant to the terms of the indemnification agreements in effect as of
the date hereof and as disclosed to Firstar in the Investors Disclosure Letter.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the directors, officers, and
employees of Investors and the Investors Subsidiaries who become directors,
officers or employees of Firstar or any of its Subsidiaries, except for the
indemnification rights set forth in SECTION 7.03(a), shall have indemnification
rights with prospective application only. The prospective indemnification
rights shall consist of such rights to which directors, officers and employees
of Firstar are entitled under the provisions of the Restated Articles of
Incorporation of Firstar or similar governing documents of Firstar and its
Subsidiaries, as in effect from time to time after the Effective Time, as
applicable, and provisions of applicable law as in effect from time to time
after the Effective Date.

(c) The obligations of Firstar provided under SECTIONS 7.03(a) are
intended to benefit, and be enforceable against Firstar directly by, the
Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all respective successors of
Firstar.

maintain or cause Sub to maintain Investors' current insurance policy for
directors' and officers' liabilities or an equivalent policy having terms and
conditions no less favorable to all present and former directors and officers of
Investors and the Investors Subsidiaries who are covered by such current
insurance policy than those in effect for such persons on the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that (i) Firstar's obligation under this
SUBSECTION (d) shall be satisfied as to any year at such time as Firstar and/or
Sub shall have incurred annual costs to maintain insurance in accordance with
this subsection equal to 150% of the annual premium charge heretofore paid by
Investors and (ii) such directors and officers may be required to make
application and provide customary representations and warranties to Firstar's
insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such coverage.

7.04. REPORTS. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) Investors
shall prepare and file as and when required all Investors Reports and
(ii) Firstar shall prepare and file as and when required all Firstar Reports.

(b) Investors and Firstar shall prepare such Investors Reports and
Firstar Reports, respectively, such that (i) they comply in all material
respects with all of the statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated
by the regulatory authority with which they are filed and do not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances

Page 48 of 94

<PAGE>

under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) with respect to any
Investors Reports or Firstar Reports containing financial information of the
type included in the Investors Financial Statements or the Firstar Financial
Statements, respectively, the financial information (A) is prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as utilized in the
Investors Financial Statements or the Firstar Financial Statements, as the case
may be, applied on a consistent basis (except as stated therein or in the notes
thereto), (B) presents fairly the consolidated financial condition of Investors
or Firstar, as the case may be, at the dates, and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods, stated therein and (C) in the case of
interim fiscal periods, reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring items, subject to year-end audit adjustments.

7.05. BROKERS OR FINDERS. Each of Firstar and Investors
represents, as to itself, its Subsidiaries and its affiliates, that no agent,
broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person is or will
be entitled to any broker's or finder's fee or any other commission or similar
fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except Piper Jaffray Inc., whose fees and expenses will be paid by Investors in
accordance with Investors' agreement with such firm (a copy of which has been
delivered by Investors to Firstar prior to the date of this Agreement), and each
of Firstar and Investors respectively agree to indemnify and hold the other
harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities or obligations with
respect to any other fees, commissions or expenses asserted by any person on the
basis of any act or statement alleged to have been made by such party or its
affiliate. Investors represents that neither it nor its Subsidiaries has paid
or agreed to pay any fee to its legal counsel, Dorsey & Whitney, or its
certified public accountants, KPMG Peat Marwick, other than on the basis set
forth in SECTION 5.03(n) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

7.06. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS; REASONABLE EFFORTS. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use
all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, subject to the
appropriate vote of stockholders of Investors described in SECTION 8.01(a),
including cooperating fully with the other party. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is reasonably necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest Sub with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of
Sub or Investors, the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement shall take all such necessary action.

7.07. ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITS. Firstar shall engage, at Investors'
expense, an environmental consulting engineering firm, reasonably acceptable to
Investors, to perform environmental site assessments of parcels of the Investors
Property comprising all operating facilities of Investors and the Investors
Subsidiaries (whether owned or leased) or otherwise carried on the books of
Investors or any Investors Subsidiary (other than single family residential real
property) including, but not limited to, "real estate owned" properties of
Investors or any Investors Subsidiary (collectively, the "Audited Properties")
which shall satisfy the American Society of Testing and Materials "Standard
Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment Process" (ASTM Designation: E-1527-93) (the "Environmental Audits")
and render reports of the Environmental Audits (the "Environmental Reports") to
determine, to Firstar's satisfaction, whether there are any indications or
evidence that (i) any Toxic Substance has been stored, deposited, treated,
recycled, used or accidentally or intentionally disposed of, discharged,
spilled, released, dumped, emitted or otherwise placed on, under or at, or used
in any construction on, any such Audited Property, (ii) any such Audited
Property is contaminated by or contains any Toxic Substance or (iii) any
violations of Environmental Laws

Page 49 of 94

<PAGE>

have occurred or are likely to occur on any Audited Property. The scope of the
Environmental Audits shall include any testing or sampling of materials to
determine, to Firstar's satisfaction, whether any cleanup, removal, remedial
action or other response is required to bring the Audited Properties into
material compliance with Environmental Laws or to eliminate any condition that
could result in a material liability as a result of the ownership, lease,
operation or use of any Audited Property and the estimated cost of such cleanup,
removal, remedial action or other response. Firstar will use reasonable efforts
to engage an environmental consulting engineering firm within 10 days of the
date hereof and Firstar and Investors will use reasonable efforts to cause the
Environmental Audits to be completed within 45 days of the date hereof. Nothing
contained in the Environmental Reports shall diminish or expand Investors'
obligations with respect to the representations and warranties in SECTION 3.07
or affect the consequences of any such representation or warranty proving to
have been untrue, incomplete or misleading in any respect. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) if this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are
terminated, then Firstar shall reimburse Investors for expenses incurred
pursuant to this SECTION 7.07 and (ii) this SECTION 7.07 shall not apply to the
Investor Properties identified on EXHIBIT 7.07.

7.08. FIRSTAR BENEFIT PLANS. On or before the first January 1
that is at least 90 days after the Effective Time, Firstar shall provide to
retained employees of Investors or of any Investors Subsidiary all
corporate-wide employee retirement, health, dental, life and long-term
disability benefits that Firstar and its subsidiaries provide to their similarly
situated employees, subject to the age and eligibility requirements for such
benefits. Each such employee's last continuous period of service prior to the
Effective Time with Investors or any Investors Subsidiary shall count for
purposes of determining eligibility and vesting (but not benefit amounts) for
all such benefits. If such coverage under the Firstar benefits is not provided
immediately after the Effective Time, Firstar shall continue the Investors'
plans until the comparable coverage is effective under Firstar's plans so that
no lapse in benefit occurs. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
no preexisting condition limits shall be applied to participants in Investors
Benefit Plans upon their eligibility for such Firstar benefits (except for
continuation of any such limits that were in effect under the respective
Investors Benefit Plans).

10.01. TERMINATION. (a) This Agreement and the Plan of Merger may
be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
stockholders of Investors:

(i) by mutual consent of the Board of Directors of Firstar and the
Board of Directors of Investors;

(ii) by either Firstar or Investors (A) if there has been a breach in
any material respect of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
on the part of Investors, on the one hand, or Firstar and Sub, on the other
hand, respectively, set forth in this Agreement, or (B) if the
representations and warranties of Investors, on the one hand, or Firstar
and Sub, on the other hand, respectively, shall be discovered to have
become materially untrue in the aggregate, in either case which breach or
other condition has not been cured within 10 business days following
receipt by the nonterminating party of notice of such breach or other
condition;

(iii) by either Firstar or Investors if any permanent Injunction
preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have become final and
nonappealable;

(iv) by either the Board of Directors of Firstar or the Board of
Directors of Investors if the Merger shall not have been consummated before
August 15, 1995, for a reason other than the failure of the terminating
party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement;

(v) by the Board of Directors of either of Firstar or Investors if
the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller or the OTS has denied approval
of the Merger or the Bank Merger and neither Firstar nor Investors has,
within 30 days after the entry of the order denying such approval, filed a
petition seeking review of such order as provided by applicable law;

Page 57 of 94

<PAGE>

(vi) by either Investors or Firstar, if this Agreement and the Merger
are not duly approved by the stockholders of Investors after a vote thereon
at a meeting of stockholders (or any adjournment thereof) duly called and
held for such purpose;

(vii) by Investors, on either of the two trading days immediately
after the Ten-Day Calculation Period, as defined below, if both of the
following conditions are satisfied:

(1) the average of the daily closing prices of a share of
Firstar Common Stock as reported on the consolidated tape of the NYSE
during the Ten-Day Calculation Period (the "Firstar Average Price") is
less than $29.00; and

(2) the number obtained by dividing the Firstar Average Price by
the closing price of Firstar Common Stock as reported on the
consolidated tape of the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding
the public announcement of this Agreement is less than the number
obtaining by dividing the Final Index Price (as defined in SUBSECTION
(b) below) by the Initial Index Price (as defined in SUBSECTION (b)
below) and subtracting .125 from such quotient;

(viii) by Investors, if (1) any Person (other than Firstar or any
affiliate of Firstar) shall have commenced (as such term is used in Rule
14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act) a BONA FIDE tender offer for all
outstanding shares of Investors Common Stock or any Person shall have made
a BONA FIDE written offer involving a merger or consolidation of Investors
or the acquisition of all or substantially all of its assets, (2)
Investors' Board of Directors shall determine, based on advice of
Investors' independent financial advisors, that such offer is a material
economic improvement to Investors' stockholders when compared to the
Merger, (3) Investors' Board of Directors, after consultation with and
based upon receipt of written advice from Dorsey & Whitney (a copy of which
Investors shall promptly deliver to Firstar), or other counsel acceptable
to Firstar, determines in good faith that recommending such tender offer or
accepting such written offer is required for the Board of Directors to
comply with its fiduciary duties to Investors' stockholders under
applicable law, and (4) Investors or the Person commencing such tender
offer or submitting such written offer shall have irrevocably paid the
Termination Fee to Firstar; provided, however, that Investors may not
terminate the Agreement pursuant to this SECTION 10.01(a)(viii) until the
expiration of five business days after written notice of any such offer
referenced in this SECTION 10.01(a)(viii) has been delivered to Firstar,
together with a summary of the terms of any such offer;

(ix) without further action of either party hereto, upon the
irrevocable payment to Firstar of the Termination Fee following the
occurrence of a Trigger Event, unless (A) prior to the Trigger Event there
has been a wilful and material breach of this Agreement by Investors other
than a breach resulting from an Excused Action (as defined below), or (B)
such Trigger Event is the occurrence of a Transaction Proposal caused by an
action or inaction by Investors that is a wilful breach of any covenant in
this Agreement, except an Excused Action, or (C) such Trigger Event is an
action or inaction by Investors described in SECTION 9.01(b)(iii) or (iv)
that is not the result of an action that the Board of Directors of
Investors, after consultation with counsel, determines in good faith is
required to comply with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under
applicable law. For purposes of this SECTION 10.01(a)(ix), "Excused
Action" shall mean any action, or the failure to act, by Investors where
the Board of Directors of Investors, after consultation with and based on
the written advice of counsel (a copy of which is furnished to Firstar),
determines in good faith that such actions or inactions are required by
the Board of Directors of Investors to

Page 58 of 94

<PAGE>

comply with its fiduciary duties to Investors' stockholders under
applicable law to facilitate a Transaction Proposal or a Competing
Transaction with a party other than Investors or any of its
Representatives; or

(x) by Firstar, if, after the date hereof, any Person shall have
commenced (as such term is used in Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act) a
BONA FIDE tender offer or exchange offer to acquire at least 20% of the
then outstanding shares of Investors Common Stock, or if the Board of
Directors of Investors shall have withdrawn, modified or changed its
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger.

(b) For purposes of this SECTION 10.01:

(i) The "Index Group" shall mean all of those companies
listed on EXHIBIT 10.01 the common stock of which is publicly
traded and as to which there is no pending publicly announced
proposal at any time during the Ten-Day Calculation Period for
such company to acquire another company or companies in
transactions with a value exceeding 10% of the acquiror's market
capitalization or for such company to be acquired. In the event
that any such company or companies are so removed from the Index
Group, the weights attributed to the remaining companies shall be
adjusted proportionately.

(ii) The "Initial Index Price" shall mean the weighted
average (weighted in accordance with the factors listed on
EXHIBIT 10.01) of the per share closing prices of the common
stock of the companies comprising the Index Group, as reported on
the consolidated transactions reporting system for the market or
exchange on which such common stock is principally traded, on the
trading day immediately preceding the public announcement of this
Agreement.

(iii) The "Final Price" of any company belonging to the
Index Group shall mean the average of the daily closing sale
prices of a share of common stock of such company, as reported in
the consolidated transaction reporting system for the market or
exchange on which such common stock is principally traded, during
the Ten-Day Calculation Period.

(iv) The "Final Index Price" shall mean the weighted
average (weighted in accordance with the factors listed on
EXHIBIT 10.01) of the Final Prices for all of the companies
comprising the Index Group.

(v) The "Ten-Day Calculation Period" shall mean the ten

Prospectus/Proxy Statement.

If Firstar or any company belonging to the Index Group declares a stock dividend
or effects a reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement and the
Meeting Date, the closing prices for the common stock of such company shall be
appropriately adjusted for the purposes of the definitions above so as to be
comparable to the price on the date of this Agreement.

10.02. INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW. Subject to the next following
sentence, at any time prior to the 21st day following the date of this
Agreement, Firstar may, by action of the Interstate Banking and Acquisitions
Committee of the Board of Directors of Firstar (the "Firstar Committee"), elect
to terminate this Agreement on behalf of Firstar and Sub as a result of any
information obtained in the course of its investigation and review of (i)
Investors' portfolios of

Page 59 of 94

<PAGE>

consumer loans, commercial real estate loans, second mortgage loans and other
mortgage loans, (ii) all non-accrual and restructured loans, (iii) all REO or
real estate in judgment and (iv) the underwriting of fixed rate and adjustable
rate first mortgage loans, which, in the good faith opinion of the Firstar
Committee, indicates circumstances or events that (a) have, or are reasonably
likely to have, an Investors Material Adverse Effect or (b) materially detract
from the value of Investors and its Subsidiaries to Firstar. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Firstar may pursuant to a written instrument signed by it (which
shall not be deemed to be an amendment or modification to this Agreement)
terminate its rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section as of
any date prior to such 21st day which is specified in such written instrument.
Nothing in this Section shall be construed (i) to limit the period of time
during which Firstar may conduct its investigation and review of Investors, (ii)
to limit any duty of Investors otherwise to cooperate with the investigation and
review by Firstar subsequent to the period established pursuant to the first
sentence of this section, or (iii) to limit or qualify in any respect the
representations and warranties of Investors to Firstar set forth in this
Agreement as a result of any such investigation and review.

10.03. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Investors or Firstar as provided in SECTION 10.01 or SECTION
10.02, this Agreement and the Plan of Merger shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Firstar or Investors or
their respective officers or directors except (a) with respect to SECTIONS 5.08,
6.11, 7.05, 7.07, AND 9.01, and (b) to the extent that such termination (other
than a termination in accordance with SECTION 10.01(a)(ix)) results from the
willful breach by a party hereto of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that
actions by Investors that are reasonably required to facilitate a transaction
that entitles Investors to terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION
10.01(a)(viii) and for the Board of Directors of Investors to comply with its
fiduciary duties to Investors' stockholders under applicable law (as such duties
are determined in accordance with SECTION 10.01(a)(viii)(3)) shall not
constitute a willful breach by Investors of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement for purposes of
this CLAUSE (b).

10.04. AMENDMENT. Subject to the next following sentence, this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger may be amended by the parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors (or, in the case of
Firstar, the Firstar Committee) at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of
Investors, but after any such approval by the stockholders of Investors, no
amendment shall be made which has any of the effects described in Section 251(d)
of the DGCL. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

10.05. EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Firstar and Sub, on the one hand, and Investors, on the other hand, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors (or, in the case of
Firstar, the Firstar Committee), may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered by the
other pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance by the other with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party.

$1.25 par value, of Firstar ("Firstar Common Stock"), including with each such
share one-half of one Firstar Preferred Share Purchase Right ("Right") issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of January 20, 1989, between Firstar
and Firstar Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"). Prior to
the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement), all references in
this Plan of Merger to the Firstar Common Stock to be received pursuant to the
Merger shall be deemed to include the Rights.

(b) CONVERSION OF INVESTORS PREFERRED STOCK. Each then issued and
outstanding share of Investors Preferred Stock shall be converted into the right
to receive $27.50 plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares of
Investors Preferred Stock to the Effective Time, payable in cash.

(c) STOCK HELD BY INVESTORS. Each then issued and outstanding share
of Investors Common Stock or Investors Preferred Stock owned by Investors or any
direct or indirect subsidiary of Investors (other than shares held in a
fiduciary capacity) and each share of Investors Common Stock or Investors
Preferred Stock issued and held in Investors' treasury will be cancelled and
retired.

(d) CANCELLATION OF SHARES. All shares of Investors Common Stock and
Investors Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Firstar Common Stock or cash,
as the case may be, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with the Plan of Merger, without
interest.

(e) If prior to the Effective Time Firstar shall declare a stock
dividend or distribution upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine its
shares of Firstar Common Stock or declare a dividend or make a distribution on
Firstar Common Stock of any security convertible into Firstar Common Stock or
exercisable to purchase Firstar Common Stock (including, without limitation,
distribution of any Firstar Rights after a Distribution Date), appropriate
adjustment or adjustments will be made in the conversion rate set forth in
SUBSECTION (a).

(f) Each outstanding share of Investors Preferred Stock as to which
dissenters' rights have been asserted in accordance with the procedures of the
DGCL and not withdrawn shall be accorded the rights provided by the DGCL and
shall not be converted into or represent rights to receive the cash hereunder
unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect or effectively
withdrawn or lost such dissenters' rights.

2.02. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. As of the
Effective Time, Firstar shall deposit with Firstar Trust Company or such other
bank or trust company designated by Firstar (and reasonably acceptable to
Investors) (the "Exchange Agent") for the benefit of the

Page 66 of 94

<PAGE>

holders of shares of Investors Common Stock and Investors Preferred Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE II through the Exchange Agent,
certificates representing the shares of Firstar Common Stock and cash (such
shares of Firstar Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, and such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to SECTION 2.01 in exchange for shares of
Investors Common Stock and Investors Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The Exchange Agent may invest the cash deposited
with it in such manner as Firstar directs. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investment shall be payable to the
Surviving Corporation. Firstar shall replace any monies lost through any
investment made at its direction pursuant to this SECTION 2.02(a). To the
extent Firstar owns shares of Firstar Common Stock as treasury stock, such
shares may be deposited into the Exchange Fund.

(b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Investors Common Stock and Investors Preferred
Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Firstar Common Stock or cash pursuant to SECTION 2.01 (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Firstar and Investors may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for certificates representing shares of Firstar Common Stock or cash, as the
case may be. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Firstar, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Firstar Common Stock, or the amount of cash, as
the case may be, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this ARTICLE II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certificates surrendered
for exchange by any person deemed an "affiliate" of Investors (as defined in
Section 3.22 of the Agreement) shall not be exchanged for the consideration
deliverable pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE II until Firstar has
received a written agreement from such person as provided in Section 5.06 of the
Agreement. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Investors Common Stock or
Investors Preferred Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
Investors, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Firstar
Common Stock may be issued or the proper amount of cash may be paid to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Investors Common Stock or
Investors Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this SECTION 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the certificate representing shares of Firstar Common Stock and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares of Firstar Common Stock, or cash, as the case
may be, as contemplated by this SECTION 2.02.

(c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Firstar Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Firstar Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Firstar Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to SECTION 2.02(e), until the holder of record of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Firstar Common Stock

Page 67 of 94

<PAGE>

issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, (A) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Firstar Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to SECTION
2.02(e) and (B) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Firstar Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Firstar Common Stock.

(d) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN INVESTORS STOCK. All shares of
Firstar Common Stock and all cash issued or paid upon the surrender for exchange
or payment of shares of Investors Common Stock or Investors Preferred Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to SECTION
2.02(c) or 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Investors Common Stock or Investors
Preferred Stock, SUBJECT, HOWEVER, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Investors on such
shares of Investors Common Stock or Investors Preferred Stock in accordance with
the terms of the Agreement or prior to the date hereof and which remain unpaid
at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Investors Common Stock or Investors Preferred Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Firstar for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Plan of
Merger.

(e) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Plan of Merger to the contrary, neither certificates nor scrip representing
fractional shares of Firstar Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Firstar. Each
holder of shares of Investors Common Stock who would otherwise have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of Firstar Common Stock shall receive in lieu
thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by
the closing price per share of Firstar Common Stock at the Effective Time on the
New York Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape. From time to time at the
request of the Exchange Agent after the determination of amounts of cash to be
paid to holders of Investors Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share
interests, Firstar shall make available such amounts to the Exchange Agent.

(f) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the stockholders of Investors for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Firstar, upon demand, and any
stockholders of Investors who have not theretofore complied with this SECTION
2.02 shall thereafter look only to Firstar for payment of their claim for
Firstar Common Stock or cash, including cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Firstar Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Firstar
Common Stock.

(g) NO LIABILITY. None of Firstar, Sub and Investors shall be liable
to any holder of shares of Investors Common Stock or Investors Preferred Stock
or Firstar Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

(h) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Firstar and Sub shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Agreements
to any former

Page 68 of 94

<PAGE>

holder of shares of Investors Common Stock or Investors Preferred Stock such
amounts as Firstar or Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Firstar or Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the
shares of Investors Common Stock or Investors Preferred Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Firstar or Sub.

2.03. EFFECT ON COMMON STOCK OF SUB. At the Effective Time, the
shares of Sub Common Stock validly issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will continue to evidence 1,000 shares of common stock, $1.00
par value, of the Surviving Corporation so that all shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation will continue to be owned by Firstar. The outstanding
certificates representing shares of Sub Common Stock will, after the Effective
Time, continue to represent the same number of shares of the Surviving
Corporation.

EXHIBIT 5.06 (To Agreement and Plan of Reorganization)

[Form of Investors Affiliate's Letter]

August ___, 1994

Firstar Corporation
777 East Wisconsin Avenue
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202

Gentlemen:

I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed an
"affiliate" of Investors Bank Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Investors"), as
that term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the
rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Act") ("Affiliate"). Pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization among Firstar Corporation, a Wisconsin
corporation ("Firstar"), Firstar Corporation of Minnesota, a Minnesota
corporation ("FCM"), and Investors (the "Reorganization Agreement"), and the
related Plan of Merger by and between Investors and FCM joined in by Firstar for
certain limited purposes, both dated as of August ___, 1994 (together with the
Reorganization Agreement, the "Agreements"), Investors will be merged with and
into FCM (the "Merger").

As a result of the Merger, I may (i) receive shares of common stock of
Firstar, $1.25 par value ("Firstar Common Stock"), (ii) have my warrants issued
under a Warrant Agreement dated October 15, 1991, each of which represents the
right to purchase 2/3 share of Common Stock of Investors, $.01 par value

In connection with the above transactions, I represent and warrant to
Firstar and agree that:

Firstar Warrants acquired by me in connection with the Merger.

C. I have been advised that the offering, sale and delivery of the shares

unless (i) such shares of Merger Stock and/or Firstar Warrants have been

some other exemption from registration under the Act is available with respect
to any such proposed sale, transfer or other disposition.

D. I have carefully read this letter agreement and the Agreements and have
discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of Merger Stock and/or Firstar
Warrants to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for
Investors.

E. I understand that Firstar is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of the shares of Merger Stock and/or Firstar
Warrants for sale, transfer or other disposition by me to make compliance with
an exemption from registration available.

F. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Firstar's
transfer agent(s) and/or the registrar(s) and that there will be placed on the
certificates for the shares of Merger Stock and/or Firstar Warrants I receive in
connection with the Merger or any substitutions therefore, a legend stating in
substance:

"The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a
transaction (the acquisition of Investors Bank Corp.) to which Rule
145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act"), applies and may be sold or otherwise transferred only in
compliance with the limitations of such Rule 145, or upon receipt by
Firstar Corporation of an opinion of counsel acceptable to it that
some other exemption from registration under the Act is available, or
pursuant to a registration statement under the Act. The shares
represented by this certificate may not be sold or otherwise
transferred prior to the publication by Firstar Corporation of an
earnings statement covering at least 30 days of operations subsequent
to [insert the effective date of the Merger]."

G. I hereby agree that, for a period of two (2) years following the
effective date of the Merger, I will obtain an agreement similar to this
agreement from each transferee of the shares of Merger Stock and/or Firstar
Warrants sold or otherwise transferred by me, but only if such transfer is
effected other than in a transaction involving a registered public offering or
as a sale pursuant to Rule 145.

H. Notwithstanding the other provisions hereof, I agree not to sell,
pledge, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of Merger Stock and/or
Firstar Warrants, or reduce my risk relative to the Firstar Common Stock in any
other way, from the date hereof until such time as financial results covering at
least 30 days of combined operations of the parties to the Merger have been
published within the meaning of Section 201.01 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Codification of Financial Reporting Policies. I have not reduced
my risk relative to the Firstar Common Stock to date.

It is understood and agreed that this Agreement will terminate and be of no
further force and effect and the legend set forth in Paragraph F above will be
removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and the
related transfer restrictions shall be lifted forthwith, if the period of time
specified in Paragraph H of this Agreement has passed and (i) my shares of
Merger Stock and/or Firstar Warrants shall have been registered under the Act
for sale, transfer or other disposition by me or on my behalf, (ii) I am not at
the time an Affiliate of Firstar and have held the shares of Merger Stock and/or
Firstar Warrants for at least two (2) years (or such other period as may be
prescribed by the Act and the Rules and Regulations) and Firstar has filed with
the

FIRSTAR AND INVESTORS BANK CORP. ANNOUNCE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

Milwaukee, Wis. -- Firstar Corporation (NYSE:FSR) and Investors Bank Corp.
(NASDAQ:INVS) today announced that they signed a definitive agreement for
Firstar to acquire Investors, parent company of Investors Savings Bank, FSB,
a $1 billion thrift headquartered in Wayzata, Minnesota.

The agreement calls for Firstar Corporation to exchange .8676 of its shares of
common stock for each outstanding share of Investors common stock. based on the
closing price of Firstar stock on August 19, Investors shareholders will receive
Firstar stock worth $27.87 for each Investor share. Investors common stock
warrants will become warrants to purchase Firstar common stock. The total value
of the transaction, including the assumption of Investors stock options, is
approximately $106 million. Upon closing, holders of Investors preferred stock
will receive a cash payment of $27.50 per share, or a total of $8.4 million.

Firstar will repurchase up to 320,000 of its shares which, along with up to
$2,883,477 newly issued shares, will be used in the merger transaction. The
transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests. The merger is
expected to be completed during the first quarter of 1995, subject to approval
by regulators and Investors shareholders. Investors directors and executive
officers have entered into agreements with Firstar to vote their shares in favor
of the merger.

During the 21 days following the signing of the merger agreement, after due
diligence review of Investors' loan files, Firstar may terminate the agreement
under certain circumstances. A termination fee of $4.5 million would be paid to
Firstar by Investors in certain circumstances if the transaction is not
completed.

The merger agreement provides Investors with the right to terminate the
transaction should Firstar's stock price fall below $29 and fall 12.5% relative
to a bank stock index during the 10 trading days prior to the Investors
shareholder meeting to vote on the transaction.

"This transaction will double the asset size of Firstar's Minnesota bank and
give Firstar access to very attractive new markets in the Twin Cities," Firstar
Chairman Roger L. Fitzsimonds said, noting that Investors serves some of the
higher growth communities in Minnesota. "Investors serves 50,000 area
households through deposit services, home mortgage origination and servicing,
and consumer lending. These are long-term customer relationships with excellent
potential for extension into other financial services such as trust and
investment management services."

James M. Burkholder, who is chairman, president and chief executive officer of
Investors, said the affiliation with Firstar would mean greater convenience and
a broader range of services for Investors customers. "Firstar is a well
regarded, highly successful financial institution that possesses extensive
resources and a reputation for quality service and good corporate citizenship.
In addition to delivering strong shareholder returns, we believe this
relationship will be advantageous to our customers, employees and communities."

Investors' 12 banking locations will be merged into Firstar Bank of Minnesota,
which has 24 bank offices in the Twin Cities area. Investors' mortgage banking
operation has another 12 offices that originate mortgage loans. They are
located in the Twin Cities (6 offices); Duluth, Minn. (1); Waukesha, Wis (1);
and the Chicago area (4). The loan production offices will become part of
Firstar's home loan subsidiary, Firstar Home Mortgage Corporation, which is
headquartered in Milwaukee.

Burkholder will be named president and chief executive officer of Firstar Home
Mortgage Corporation following completion of the acquisition. Investors
services approximately $2 billion in home mortgage loans, including $1.2 billion
of loans serviced for others.

"This transaction will double Firstar's loan origination volume corporatewide
and extend the geographic reach of our home mortgage business, which we have
targeted for above-average growth in the coming years," Fitzsimonds said. "Jim
Burkholder's leadership will contribute greatly toward that goal. Within 10
years of its establishment, Investors had become the third largest mortgage
originator in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area. We feel fortunate to be
adding the expertise of Jim and his many fine associates to our organization."
Fitzsimonds added that Burkholder would also serve as a director of Firstar Bank
of Minnesota.

Firstar Corporation is a $14 billion bank holding company headquartered in
Milwaukee. It has 36 banks with 197 offices in Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota,
Illinois, Arizona and Florida. Other subsidiaries provide trust, investment
management, mortgage banking, insurance, securities brokerage and other
financial services for institutions and individuals.
