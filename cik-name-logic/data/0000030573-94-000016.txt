This combined Form 8-K is separately filed by DQE and Duquesne Light Company 

("Duquesne"). DQE and Duquesne are sometimes referred to collectively as the 

"Companies". Information contained herein relating to any individual 

registrant is filed by such registrant on its behalf. No registrant makes any 

representation as to information relating to any other registrant, except that 

information relating to Duquesne is also attributed to DQE.

Item_5.__OTHER_EVENTS

Reference is made to the discussion under "Westinghouse Lawsuit" in Part I, 

Item 3 of the DQE Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 1993 

and the discussion under "Westinghouse Lawsuit" in Note 6 of the DQE Form 10-Q 

Quarterly Reports for the quarters ended March 31, 1994 and June 30, 1994, 

relating to plans for replacement of the steam generators at Beaver Valley 

Units 1 and 2.

A jury trial in the Westinghouse steam generator litigation began 

September 12, 1994 in Federal District Court in Western Pennsylvania. 

Pennsylvania Power Company, Ohio Edison Company, Cleveland Electric 

Illuminating Company, Toledo Edison Company and Duquesne Light Company are 

joined in litigation against Westinghouse Electric Company. Twelve additional 

lawsuits have been brought by other utility companies around the country 

against Westinghouse for similar problems with Westinghouse steam generators. 

This is the first steam generator case to begin trial before a jury. The trial 

is expected to last through mid-December, 1994.

Based on existing knowledge of the condition of the steam generators, 

limited repair options and other companies' experiences with Westinghouse steam 

generators, replacement of the Unit 1 steam generator lower assemblies may be 

as early as 1997. Replacement cost is estimated to be approximately $125 

million. Other utilities with similar units have replaced steam generators at 

costs in this range. Duquesne's interest in Unit 1 is 47.5 percent. 

Duquesne's interest in Unit 2 is 13.74 percent.
