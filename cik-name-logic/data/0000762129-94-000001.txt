Item 5. Other Events

Central Illinois Light Company (the Company) is a subsidiary of CILCORP Inc. 
The Company is a public utility under the laws of the State of Illinois and, 
as such, is subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois Commerce Commission 
(ICC). 

The Company filed a request with the ICC on January 14, 1994, to increase gas 
base rates to reflect both the current costs of providing gas service and the 
net investment of more than $50 million since 1991 in the gas system. The 
revised rates are designed to increase annual gas revenues approximately 
$15.0 million or 8.9% based upon an adjusted test year ended December 31, 
1995. The filing requests a 9.4% return on original cost rate base and a 
12.0% return on common equity. The Company has not increased its base rates 
for gas service since January 1991. Management cannot predict the outcome of 
the filing. A decision from the ICC on the filing is not expected until late 
1994.
