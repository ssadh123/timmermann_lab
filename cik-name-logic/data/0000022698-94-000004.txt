RADIATION SYSTEMS AND COMSAT DECLARE PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER
LAWSUITS TO BE WITHOUT MERIT

STERLING, Va. and BETHESDA, Md. - Radiation Systems, Inc.
(NASDAQ: RADS) and COMSAT Corporation (NYSE:CQ) announced today
that two purported shareholder class-action lawsuits have been
filed in Nevada state court challenging the previously-announced
merger involving the two companies. 

Plaintiffs in the lawsuits allege, among other things, that the
proposed merger consideration is unfair and inadequate. The
lawsuits seek, among other things, to enjoin the merger and, in
the event the merger is consummated, to recover damages.

Radiation Systems and COMSAT stated that the lawsuits are, in
their view, without merit and will be defended against
vigorously. As previously announced, it is anticipated that a
special meeting of Radiation Systems stockholders will be held in
the second quarter of 1994 to vote on approval of the merger.

Radiation Systems, Inc., designs, manufactures and installs a
broad range of antenna turnkey systems and components for radar,
air traffic control, tactical military, satellite communications,
wireless and other specialized uses throughout the world.

COMSAT Corporation is an international communications,
information and entertainment-distribution services company. It
provides voice, video and data services to customers worldwide by
fixed and mobile technologies and is the largest owner and user
of the global INTELSAT and Inmarsat communications satellite
networks. COMSAT Corporation also furnishes satellite systems
integration, wireless networks and technical consulting; offers
on-demand entertainment and information services to the
hospitality industry, and owns the NBA Denver Nuggets.
