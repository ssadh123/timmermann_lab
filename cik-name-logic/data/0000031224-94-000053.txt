EASTERN UTILITIES ANNOUNCES EARNINGS
FOR FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 1994

BOSTON, Mar. 28 -- Eastern Utilities Associates (NYSE Symbol: EUA)

announced today that in accordance with the provisions of the agreement of

merger among EUA, EUA Cogenex Corporation and Northeast Energy Management,

Inc., of Brunswick, ME and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange

Commission regarding acquisitions accounted for as a pooling of interests, it

was reporting on a one-time basis only, the results of operations for the

period ending February 28, 1994. EUA will resume reporting earnings on a

quarterly basis beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 1994.

Consolidated net earnings were $10.7 million, or 56 cents per common

share, on revenues of $99.8 million for the two months ended Feb. 28, 1994,

compared with earnings of $8.4 million, or 49 cents per common share, on

revenues of $91.8 million for the same period in 1993, Chairman and Chief

Executive Officer Donald G. Pardus announced today.

For the 12 months ended Feb. 28, 1994, EUA's net earnings were $47.2

million -- $2.52 per common share -- on revenues of $574.5 million, versus

earnings of $35.3 million or $2.07 per common share on revenues of $538.5

million for the same period a year ago.

"The improvement in earnings for the two month period in 1994 as compared

to the same period in 1993 was due mainly to an increase in kilowatthour sales

of electricity by EUA's retail subsidiaries of 3.8% as a result of colder

weather. Earnings for the twelve month period in 1994 as compared to the same

period in 1993 were positively affected by several factors including the

increase in kilowatthour sales mentioned above, with the most significant

factor being the utilization of investment tax credits during the 1993 tax

year related to the December 1992 EUA Power Corp. Settlement Agreement which

accounted for slightly more than one-half of the increase in earnings per

share," Pardus said.

EUA is a Boston-based investor-owned holding company whose shares are

traded on the New York and Pacific Stock Exchanges. Subsidiaries are

Blackstone Valley Electric Co., Eastern Edison Co., Newport Electric Corp.,

EUA Cogenex Corp., EUA Energy Investment Corp., EUA Ocean State Corp., EUA

Service Corp., and Montaup Electric Co. Together, the companies are known as

the EUA System.
