CHEVRON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OF $425 MILLION

San Francisco, Oct. 25 -- Chevron Corporation today announced third
quarter net income of $425 million ($.65 per share), little changed from the
$420 million ($.64 per share) reported for the third quarter of 1993.
Excluding special items in both periods, results were $407 million ($.63 per
share), down 28 percent from the very strong 1993 third quarter operating
results of $565 million ($.87 per share).

Chairman and CEO Ken Derr said, "Our operating results improved
significantly from this year's second quarter - up 55 percent - primarily due
to higher U.S. refined products sales margins and the absence of refinery
operating problems and incidents that plagued us last quarter. Nevertheless,
margins were not as strong as in last year's third quarter, contributing to
the earnings decline between years."

Third quarter 1994 earnings included a benefit from a previously
announced settlement with the Internal Revenue Service for open tax years 1979
through 1987. Tax and related interest reserves established in prior years
exceeded the net amount of the settlement, resulting in a $301 million benefit
to income. Substantially offsetting this favorable adjustment were
environmental remediation provisions, principally in the U.S. downstream
segment, and other charges totaling $283 million. The net effect of these
special items was a benefit of $18 million to this year's third quarter net
income. In the 1993 third quarter, special items reduced net income by $145
million.

Net income for the first nine months of 1994 was $1.070 billion ($1.64 per
share), up 10 percent from $971 million ($1.49 per share) earned in the 1993
nine months. The 1994 year-to-date earnings were reduced by $23 million of
special charges, whereas the comparable 1993 period included $662 million of
special charges, mostly related to last year's U.S. downstream restructuring
provision.

"Our third quarter operations were also impacted by the decline in U.S.
natural gas prices, which fell during the quarter, averaging about 20 percent
less than in last year's third quarter," continued Derr. "Crude oil prices
also trended down during the quarter, though were still about $1.00 per barrel
higher than in last year's third quarter." Derr also noted that the company's
worldwide net liquids production exceeded one million barrels a day in the
third quarter as international production levels continue to increase. 

"On another positive note, our chemicals operations continued to rebound,
reflecting the improved U.S. economy. While the recent flooding in Southeast
Texas has temporarily hindered production, our restructuring programs and
continuing cost reduction efforts have positioned this business to benefit
from the long-awaited industry turnaround that is finally underway," noted
Derr.

"After high second quarter operating expenses, reflecting a number of
refinery operating and other problems, our operating cost performance improved
markedly in the third quarter," Derr said. "Per barrel costs, adjusted for
special items, fell 43 cents from this year's second quarter to $6.53, about
the same level as our per barrel cost for the year 1993."

Total revenues in the 1994 third quarter were $9.5 billion, up 3 percent
from $9.2 billion in the year earlier quarter. Total revenues for the first
nine months of 1994 were $26.6 billion, down 6 percent from $28.2 billion in
the comparable 1993 period. Year-to-date revenues declined because of lower
refined products and crude oil prices in the first half of the year.

Included in third quarter net income were $30 million of foreign exchange
losses, compared with foreign exchange gains of $9 million in the 1993 third
quarter. For the first nine months, foreign exchange losses were $51 million
compared with $42 million of foreign exchange gains in the 1993 period.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
--------------------------

U.S. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION third quarter earnings of $63 million
included special charges totaling $61 million for environmental remediation
and litigation provisions. This compares with third quarter 1993 earnings of
$125 million, which included special charges of $32 million for prior-year tax
adjustments.

Excluding special items, earnings declined as lower natural gas prices and
decreased liquids production more than offset the benefit of higher crude oil
prices. Compared with the third quarter of 1993, average crude oil
realizations increased $1.03 per barrel to $15.03, but average natural gas
prices declined 44 cents per thousand cubic feet to $1.62. Net liquids
production declined 6 percent to 371,000 barrels per day; net natural gas
production volumes were flat at 2.0 billion cubic feet per day.

INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION earnings for the third quarter
were $131 million, compared with $113 million earned in last year's third
quarter, which included charges of $62 million for prior-year tax adjustments.
Excluding the special charges in last year's results, the earnings decline was
largely due to a $33 million swing in foreign currency effects.

International net liquids production increased 13 percent to 640,000
barrels per day. New production came on stream in early 1994 in the North Sea
and Nigeria and production was also up in Indonesia and Kazakhstan. Natural
gas production increased 22 percent to 573 million cubic feet per day, due to
higher volumes in Canada, Kazakhstan and Australia.

REFINING AND MARKETING
----------------------

U.S. REFINING AND MARKETING operations incurred a net loss of $110 million
in the 1994 third quarter compared with net earnings of $164 million in the
year-ago quarter. This year's results included special charges for
environmental remediation totaling $218 million for various marketing and
refining sites, and reflected the results of the third quarter completion of a
comprehensive evaluation of future clean-up requirements at the company's
service stations and product terminals. The prior-year quarter included $30
million in special charges, mostly related to environmental provisions.
Adjusting for these special charges, third quarter results of $108 million
were down significantly from the $194 million earned in the year-earlier
quarter.

Sales margins for refined products improved from this year's second
quarter, but were still well below those achieved in last year's third
quarter. Ample supplies are holding down product prices. Sales volumes
declined 9 percent, primarily due to the sale of the company's Philadelphia
refinery in August of this year. Output from that refinery had been sold as
unbranded products to third party resellers.

INTERNATIONAL REFINING AND MARKETING net earnings increased to $55 million
from $50 million earned in the 1993 third quarter. Product sales margins
remained depressed, but total sales volumes increased 4 percent. Sales
volumes in the company's marketing operations in Canada, the United Kingdom
and the Caltex areas of operations averaged 12 percent higher, but this was
partially offset by lower sales volumes in the company's international trading
activities. Foreign exchange losses were $1 million, compared with foreign
exchange gains of $4 million in the 1993 quarter.

CHEMICALS
---------

CHEMICALS earnings increased to $68 million in the third quarter, up
sharply from the $6 million earned in the third quarter of 1993. The 1994
quarter included a special charge of $4 million for environmental
remediation; the 1993 quarter included a $9 million charge for prior-year tax
adjustments.

Restructuring and cost reduction programs in recent years have positioned
the company's chemical operations to benefit from the industry upswing. The
improving U.S. economy has stimulated demand, bringing the chemical industry
into better balance. Higher sales volumes and higher prices, particularly for
ethylene and polyethylene, contributed to the increased earnings. Foreign
exchange losses were $8 million and $4 million in the 1994 and 1993
third quarters, respectively.

CORPORATE AND OTHER
-------------------

CORPORATE AND OTHER earnings were $212 million compared with charges of $48
million in the third quarter of 1993. Results in the 1994 quarter included
the reversal of $301 million of tax and related interest reserves resulting
from the company's global settlement with the Internal Revenue Service for
various issues relating to the years 1979 through 1987. The 1993 quarter
included net special charges of $13 million.

In 1994, the company changed its method of distributing certain corporate
expenses to its business segments. As a result, corporate and other charges
in the 1994 third quarter included approximately $47 million that, under the
previous method, would have been allocated to the business segments. This
change had no net income effect, nor did it affect any segment operational
trends.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES
------------------------------------

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, including the company's share of
affiliate expenditures, were $1.042 billion in the quarter, down 5 percent
from $1.095 billion spent in last year's third quarter. Total expenditures
for the first nine months of 1994 were $3.174 billion, up 10 percent from
$2.887 billion spent in the same period in 1993.
