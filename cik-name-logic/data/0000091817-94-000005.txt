Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountants.

On January 11, 1994, the Registrant's Board of Directors, acting upon the
recommendation of the Registrant's Audit Committee of the Board of Directors,
selected the firm of Coopers & Lybrand to replace Deloitte & Touche as its
certified public accountants. Deloitte & Touche was dismissed as the
Registrant's certified public accountants as of that date.

Deloitte & Touche's reports on the Registrant's financial statements for
the past two years have not contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of
opinion, nor were the reports qualified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles.

There were no disagreements with Deloitte & Touche on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure during the Registrant's two most recent fiscal years or any
subsequent interim period preceding the dismissal of Deloitte & Touche.

None of the kinds of events listed in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K
occurred within the Registrant's two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent
interim period preceding the dismissal of Deloitte & Touche.
