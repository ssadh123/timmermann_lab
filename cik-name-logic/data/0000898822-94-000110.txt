5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
PURCHASER.

The Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Company
that:

5.1 Organization, Good Standing, Power, Authority, Etc. 
--------------------------------------------------
The Purchaser has the full power and authority to execute 

-23

<PAGE>
and deliver this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, and to perform
its obligations under this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. The
Purchaser has taken all action required by law, its organizational documents or
otherwise required to be taken by it to authorize the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated to be performed by it hereby and thereby. Each of
this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement is a valid and binding
agreement of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with
their respective terms.

5.2 No Conflicts; No Consents. Neither the execution and
-------------------------
delivery of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement nor the
consummation by the Purchaser of the purchase contemplated hereby will (A)
conflict with, or result in a breach of, any provision of its organizational
documents or (B) violate any statute or law or any judgment, order, writ, in-
junction, decree, rule or regulation applicable to the Purchaser. No consent,
authorization or approval of, or declaration, filing or registration with, or
exemption by, any governmental or regulatory authority is required in connection
with the execution and delivery of, and the performance by the Purchaser of its
obligations under, this Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement the
consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions to be performed by it as
contemplated hereby and thereby, except such as will have been obtained and made
and will be in full force and effect as of the Closing.

5.3 Acquisition for Own Account. The Shares to be
---------------------------
acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and the Option are being
acquired by it for its own account and with no intention of distributing or
reselling the Shares, the Option, the Option Shares or the Exchange Shares or
any part thereof in any transaction that would be in violation of the Act or the
securities laws of any state, without prejudice, however, to the rights of the
Purchaser at all times to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the
Shares, the Option, the Option Shares, the Conversion Shares, the Exchange
Shares or the Exchange Notes under an effective registration statement under the
Act, under an exemption from such registration available under the Act or
pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment, and subject, nevertheless, to the dis-

Purchaser (A) has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and
financial matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
investment in the Shares, (B) fully understands the nature, scope and duration
of the limitations on transfer contained in this Agreement and (C) can bear the
economic risk of an investment in the Shares and can afford a 

-24-

Documents and that it has been afforded the opportunity to ask such questions as
it deemed necessary, and to receive answers from, representatives of the Company
concerning the merits and risks of investing in the Shares, the Option, the
Option Shares and the Exchange Shares and to obtain such additional information
that the Company possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense
that is necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information
contained in the SEC Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing con-
tained in this Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company.

5.4 Available Funds. The Purchaser (or one or more as-
---------------
signees permitted by Section 12) will at the Closing have available to it
sufficient funds to purchase the Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The
Purchaser and each Affiliate of the Purchaser whose consent is necessary to con-
summate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has the full legal right
and power and all corporate or partnership authority and approvals required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no further
corporate or partnership action on the part of any of such entities is required
for this purpose.

6. COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES.

6.1 Restrictions on Transfer. The Purchaser agrees that
------------------------
it will not effect any Transfer (including any Transfer upon foreclosure of a
pledge or other security interest), pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or grant of
a security interest of or in any Covered Security that under applicable law re-
quires prior regulatory approval until such regulatory approval has been
obtained. The Purchaser agrees with the Company that the Purchaser will not
Transfer, pledge, mortgage, hypothecate or grant a security interest in any
Covered Security (unless, with respect to such Covered Security, such Covered
Security was previously issued pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Act) except pursuant to (A) an effective registration statement under
the Act or (B) an applicable exemption from registration under the Act. In
connection with any Transfer by the Purchaser pursuant to clause (B) of the
immediately preceding sentence, the Purchaser shall furnish to the Company an
opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company to the effect that the
proposed Transfer would not be in violation of the Act. The Purchaser further
agrees that until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time (as such term is defined
in the Merger Agreement) and (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, it will not Transfer any shares of Series T Preferred
Stock, Series E 

-25-

<PAGE>
Preferred Stock or Conversion Shares other than to an Affiliate of the Purchaser
who agrees to be bound by the restrictions of this Section 6.1. In the event
the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company
agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in connection with any proposed Transfer
of the shares of Series T Preferred Stock as permitted hereunder to effect an
Exchange of the Series T Preferred Stock for shares of Series E Preferred Stock,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to any such Exchange as set forth
in Section 14.2 by the prospective Transferees of such shares, simultaneously or
as promptly as practicable after any such permitted Transfer. The Purchaser
further agrees that, during the period (the "Restricted Period") ending upon the
earliest to occur of (i) the third anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) a
Change of Control, (iii) a breach by the Company of any of its obligations under
any of Sections 6.6, 6.13, 6.14, 6.16, 6.17 or 6.18 or any of its material
obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement or the Option or any of its
material obligations under the Merger Agreement giving rise to a right of
termination under Section 7.1(iv) thereof, and (iv) the date on which the full
amount of dividends payable on any of the shares of Chicago Preferred Stock for
any two quarterly dividend periods shall not have been paid or the Purchaser
shall be in default of any obligation to redeem, exchange or convert any of the
shares of the Chicago Preferred Stock, the Purchaser will not Transfer any
Covered Security, except (1) to an Affiliate of the Purchaser who agrees to be
bound by the restrictions of this Section 6.1, (2) to a person or entity who
agrees to be bound by the restrictions of this Section 6.1 and Section 6.4, the
Transfer to whom has been approved in advance by the Board of Directors of the
Company, (3) to a person or entity who after such Transfer will beneficially own
(to the knowledge of the Purchaser, based solely on the representation and
warranty of such person or entity, and knowledge available from a review of
publicly available filings made by such person or entity with respect to the
beneficial ownership of Common Stock under Section 13 of the Exchange Act) less
than 5% of the Common Stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis, (4)
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act, (5) in a public offering registered under
the Act pursuant to which, if such offering is not an underwritten offering, no
one person or entity obtains (to the knowledge of the Purchaser, based solely on
the representation and warranty of such person or entity, and knowledge
available from a review of publicly available filings made by such person or
entity with respect to the beneficial ownership of Common Stock under Section 13
of the Exchange Act) more than 5% of the Common Stock of the Company on a fully
diluted basis or (6) pursuant to a tender offer (a) commenced by the Company or
(b) commenced by any other person or entity with respect to which the Board of
Directors of the Company 

-26-
<PAGE>

shall send to shareholders a statement that the Board of Directors (x)
recommends approval of such tender offer, or (y) is neutral with respect to such
tender offer. Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 shall restrict or prohibit
the Purchaser from pledging, mortgaging, hypothecating or granting a security
interest in, or granting participation rights in, any Covered Security; pro-
----
vided, however, that if a pledgee, mortgagee or holder of such security interest
- - ----- -------
forecloses on such Covered Security, it may do so only if such pledgee,
mortgagee or holder of such security interest agrees to be bound by the
restrictions of this Section 6.1 and Section 6.4. Notwithstanding the fore-
going, if none of the events specified in any of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv)
above has occurred (whether before or after termination of the Restricted
Period), then the Purchaser shall not, prior to the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date, Transfer any Covered Security to any person or entity who after
such Transfer will own (to the knowledge of the Purchaser, based solely on the
representation and warranty of such person or entity, and knowledge available
from a review of publicly available filings made by such person or entity with
respect to the beneficial ownership of Common Stock under Section 13 of the
Exchange Act) more than 5% of the Common Stock of the Company on a fully diluted
basis, unless such person or entity agrees to be bound by the terms and restric-
tions of Sections 6.4 and 7 and this penultimate sentence of this Section 6.1. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall prohibit any
Transfer, pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or grant of a security interest of or
in any Covered Security by any insurance regulator acting as conservator or
receiver.

Price with respect to such Conversion Shares shall have been adjusted as a
result of such redemption as contemplated by the Certificate of Amendment) and
(C) the acquisition, ownership, voting or other exercise of rights and
privileges with respect thereto by members of the Purchaser Group of Shares,
Option Shares, Exchange Shares, Exchange Notes, shares of Common Stock, the
Option or any other security of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not pro-
hibited by this Agreement will not trigger any distribution pursuant to such
plan or otherwise cause the Purchaser or the members of the Purchaser Group to
be treated in a manner differently from shareholders of the Company generally. 
The provisions of clauses (A) and (B) of this Section 6.16 shall inure to the
benefits of all holders of Series E Preferred Stock or Conversion Shares,
whether or not the Purchaser.

6.17 Board of Directors; Amendments to By-laws. As
-----------------------------------------
promptly as practicable following the receipt of written notice by the Company
of the receipt by the Purchaser of any regulatory approvals required in
connection with the Purchaser Designees being appointed to the Company's Board
of Directors, the Company shall take the following actions:

(i) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide
that (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall consist of no less than
thirteen or more than seventeen members (subject to increase in accordance with
the provisions contained in the Certificate of Amendment), (ii) the Nominating 

-33-

<PAGE>
Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Nominating Committee") shall consist
of either three or five members and (iii) the number of members of the Board of
Directors may be increased in accordance with the Certificate of Amendment.

(ii) The Company shall cause (i) if the Company's Board of
Directors consists of thirteen or fourteen members, three persons designated by
the Purchaser through the Purchaser Representative ("Purchaser Designees") to be
appointed thereto or (ii) if the Company's Board of Directors consists of fif-
teen, sixteen or seventeen members, four Purchaser Designees to be appointed
thereto, which appointment shall be effective as soon as practicable after the
receipt of notice by the Company as set forth in the first paragraph of this
Section 6.17; provided, however, that if, after customary investigation of any
-------- -------
Purchaser Designee's qualifications, the Board of Directors reasonably
determines in good faith that any Purchaser Designee is not qualified or
acceptable under standards applied fairly and equally to all nominees to the
Board of Directors, the Purchaser through the Purchaser Representative shall
designate another person that meets such standards.

(iii) The Company shall cause (i) (x) if the Nominating
Committee is composed of three members, one Purchaser Designee to be appointed
thereto or (y) if the Nominating Committee is composed of five members, two
Purchaser Designees to be appointed thereto and (ii) such number (which number
shall be at least one and shall be rounded to the nearest whole number) of
Purchaser Designees to be appointed to each other committee of the Board of
Directors equal to the product of the total number of persons on such committee
(including Purchaser Designees) and a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series E Preferred
Stock owned by the Purchaser or its Affiliates (or issuable to the Purchaser
upon the exchange of Shares of Series T Preferred Stock owned by the Purchaser
or its Affiliates) are convertible and the denominator of which is the total
number of outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors (assuming conversion of such shares of Series E
Preferred Stock), with all such appointments to be effective as soon as
practicable after the receipt of notice by the Company as set forth in the first
paragraph of this Section 6.17.

(iv) The Board of Directors of the Company shall amend the
By-laws of the Company to provide that (A) the Board of Directors shall consist
of no less than thirteen or more than seventeen members, subject to clause (C)
below, (B) the Nominating Committee shall consist of three or five members, (C)
the number of members of the Board of Directors may be 

-34-
<PAGE>

increased in accordance with the Certificate of Amendment and (D) so long as the
Purchaser has the right to nominate at least one director, none of the foregoing
provisions of the Company's By-laws, nor the provision contained in Section 8 of
the Company's By-laws providing that each committee of the Board of Directors
shall consist of no fewer than three members, may be amended by the Board of
Directors of the Company absent the affirmative vote of 95% of the members of
the Board of Directors.

(v) The Purchaser Designees appointed to the Company's Board
of Directors effective as soon as practicable after the receipt of notice by the
Company as set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 6.17 (as
contemplated by this Section) shall be appointed to serve until the next
succeeding annual meeting of shareholders of the Company to be held after such
appointment. Commencing with such annual meeting of shareholders of the Company
and at each annual meeting of shareholders of the Company thereafter, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to nominate to the Company's Board of Directors (in
addition to any rights granted to the holders of Shares, Exchange Shares or
Option Shares as set forth in the Certificate of Amendment) (i) if the Company's
Board of Directors consists of thirteen or fourteen members, three directors or
(ii) if the Company's Board of Directors consists of fifteen, sixteen or
seventeen members, four directors. The Company shall cause such Purchaser Des-
ignees (unless, after customary investigation of any Purchaser Designee's
qualifications, the Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith that
such person is not qualified or acceptable under standards applied fairly and
equally to all nominees, in which event the Purchaser shall designate another
person that meets the foregoing standards) to be included in the slate of nomi-
nees recommended by the Board of Directors or the Nominating Committee to the
Company's shareholders for election as directors, and the Company shall use its
best efforts to cause the election of such designees, including voting all
shares for which the Company holds proxies (unless otherwise directed by the
shareholder submitting such proxy) or is otherwise entitled to vote, in favor of
the election of such persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser's
right to nominate members of the Board of Directors shall be reduced as follows,
if, but only if, the Purchaser has Transferred shares of Series T Preferred
Stock, shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Conversion Shares issued with respect
to the Series E Preferred Stock, Exchange Notes issued with respect to the
Series T Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock or Chicago Preferred Stock
Notes and as a result no longer holds at least 75% of the Original Investment:

"Original Investment" shall mean the aggregate number of shares of Series T
Preferred Stock purchased hereunder, the aggregate number of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock issued upon the consummation of the Exchange, the aggregate
number of Conversion Shares into which such shares of Series E Preferred Stock
could be converted, the aggregate principal amount of Exchange Notes for which
such shares have been exchanged, the aggregate 

-36-
<PAGE>

liquidation preference or principal amount, as applicable, of Chicago Preferred
Stock Notes for which Series T Stock has been exchanged or any combination of
the foregoing; provided, however, that in determining the amount of the Original
-------- -------
Investment at any time remaining, no shares of Series T Preferred stock shall be
included to the extent that such shares have been exchanged for Series E Pre-
ferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock or Exchange Notes, no shares of Series E
Preferred Stock shall be included to the extent that such shares have been
converted into Conversion Shares or exchanged for Exchange Notes and no Exchange
Notes shall be included to the extent that such Exchange Notes have been
converted into Conversion Shares.

(vi) For so long as the Purchaser has the right to nominate
at least one director, commencing with the annual meeting of the Board of
Directors of the Company next succeeding the appointment of Purchaser Designees
to the Board of Directors pursuant to subsection (ii) of this Section 6.17, and
at each annual meeting of the Board of Directors thereafter, the Purchaser shall
be entitled to such number of Purchaser Designees to be appointed to each
committee of the Board of Directors (including the Nominating Committee) as
follows: (A) (i) if the Nominating Committee is composed of three members, one
Purchaser Designee shall be appointed thereto or (ii) if the Nominating
Committee is composed of five members, two Purchaser Designees shall be
appointed thereto; and (B) such number (which number shall be at least one and
shall be rounded to the nearest whole number) of Purchaser Designees shall be
appointed to each other committee of the Board of Directors equal to the product
of the total number of persons on such committee (including Purchaser Designees)
and a fraction the numerator of which is the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Common Stock the shares of Series E Preferred Stock owned by the Purchaser (or
for which shares of Series T Preferred Stock owned by the Purchaser are
exchangeable) are convertible into and (2) the number of Conversion Shares owned
by the Purchaser and the denominator of which is the total number of outstanding
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors (assuming conversion of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred
Stock). If the Purchaser holds Exchange Notes issued with respect to the Series
E Preferred Stock, the foregoing fraction shall be calculated assuming
conversion of such Exchange Notes. If the Purchaser Transfers shares of Series
E Preferred Stock, Conversion Shares or Exchange Notes issued with respect to
the Series E Preferred Stock and as a result no longer holds all of the Original
Investment, its right to have Purchaser Designees appointed to the committees
(other than the Nominating Committee) of the Board of Directors shall be reduced
so that such number of 

-37-

<PAGE>
Purchaser Designees on each such committee equals the product of the total
number of persons on such committee (including Purchaser Designees) and a
fraction the numerator of which is the sum of (a) the number of shares of Common
Stock the shares of Series E Preferred Stock owned by the Purchaser (or for
which shares of Series T Preferred Stock owned by the Purchaser are
exchangeable) are convertible into and (b) the number of Conversion Shares owned
by the Purchaser and the denominator of which is the total number of outstanding
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors (assuming conversion of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred
Stock) rounded to the nearest whole number. If the Purchaser holds Exchange
Notes issued with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock, the foregoing
fraction shall be calculated assuming conversion of such Exchange Notes. The
number of Purchaser Designees that the Purchaser shall be entitled to have
appointed to the Nominating Committee shall be reduced only to the extent such
that such number does not exceed the number of Purchaser Designees that the
Purchaser shall have the right to nominate to the Board of Directors.

(vii) In the event any Purchaser Designee shall cease to serve
as a director for any reason (other than by reason of a reduction of the number
of Purchaser Designees entitled to be members of the Board of Directors) the
Company shall cause the vacancy resulting thereby to be filled by another
Purchaser Designee. If a Purchaser Designee ceases to serve on a committee of
the Board of Directors (other than by reason of a reduction of the number of
Purchaser Designees entitled to be members of such committee), such Purchaser
Designee shall be replaced by another Purchaser Designee.

(viii) So long as the Purchaser retains the right pursuant to
this Section 6.17 to designate one or more Purchaser Designees, the Board of
Directors shall be composed of no less than thirteen or more than seventeen mem-
bers (except if additional members are elected in accordance with the Certif-
icate of Amendment or pursuant to the terms of the New Preferred Stock) and the
size of the Nominating Committee shall be either three or five members, except,
in either case, on account of vacancies caused by the resignations of members.

(ix) The Purchaser shall appoint the Purchaser Representative
to act on its behalf, vis-a-vis the Company, concerning the designation of
nominees to the Company's Board of Directors and the Company shall be entitled
to conclusively rely upon any instructions given to it by the Purchaser Rep-
resentative pursuant to this Section 6.17.

6.18 Specified Corporate Action. The Company will not
--------------------------
consummate, or agree to consummate, any transaction that would constitute a
Specified Corporate Action unless at the time of the consummation of such
transaction (A) the Company has sufficient funds legally available to it (after
giving effect to such transaction) to redeem at the then applicable price all
outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock, Series
G Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and Series T Preferred Stock
pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment, (B) such redemption shall not be
prohibited by any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, by applicable law or otherwise, (C) the Board of Directors of the
Company, including a majority of the directors who are not officers or employees
of the Company, shall have adopted a resolution confirming that such funds are
available and that the holders of Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred
Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred Stock and Series T Preferred
Stock have the right to require such redemption and (D) the Company has set
aside sufficient funds through the Mandatory Redemption Date or Specified
Corporate Action Redemption date, as applicable, to redeem the shares of Series
E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series H
Preferred Stock and Series T Preferred Stock held by such holders (except that
no funds need be set aside with respect to such Shares held by any such holder
who has theretofore notified the Company that it will not require redemption of
such shares).

6.19 Regulatory Approvals. The Company shall take all
--------------------
steps necessary, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate
therein, such that no approvals by any federal or state bank regulatory
authority will be required to be obtained by the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company, the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Exchange), other than
as may be provided in certain agreed upon arrangements with such authorities,
which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Company (the
"Bank Regulatory Arrangements"). Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 6.19, the Purchaser shall not be required to take any actions, or enter
into any arrangements that will subject the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
to regulation or oversight by any federal or state bank regulatory authority or
impose any restrictions upon the operations of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (other than restrictions on any banking or non-banking transactions
between the Purchaser and its Affiliates and California Central Bank Trust
Corporation (the "Bank") and restrictions on the Purchaser and its Affiliates
seeking to direct the management or policies of the Bank).

-39-

<PAGE>
6.20 Agreed Treatment. So long as any shares of Chicago
----------------
Preferred Stock are outstanding (i) for United States federal income tax
purposes, the Company and the Purchaser shall treat such shares as stock and not
as indebtedness and any distributions thereon as distributions in respect of
stock and not as interest and (ii) the Company shall treat such shares as equity
capital and dividends paid thereon as dividends paid on capital for financial
and regulatory accounting and reporting purposes to the extent it is permitted
to do so under relevant accounting or reporting standards. 

7. STANDSTILL.

7.1 Prohibited Activities. The Purchaser hereby agrees
---------------------
that during the Standstill Period it will not, nor will it permit any member of
the Purchaser Group to, directly or indirectly, unless in any such case
specifically requested in advance to do so by the Board of Directors of the
Company (provided, however, that nothing in this Article VII shall prohibit the
-------- -------
Purchaser during the Merger Period from taking any actions in furtherance of the
Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement) as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement):

(A) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire by
purchase or by joining a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other
"group" (as such term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act,
hereinafter referred to as "13D Group"), any securities of the Company entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors, or securities convertible into
or exercisable or exchangeable for such securities (collectively, "Restricted
Securities") or any material portion of the assets or businesses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
-------- -------
prohibit any member of the Purchaser Group from acquiring any Restricted Secu-
rities (i) upon conversion of convertible securities of the Company currently
owned by the Purchaser Group or acquired pursuant to this Agreement or upon ex-
ercise of the Option or upon the consummation of the Exchange, (ii) as a result
of a stock split, stock dividend or similar recapitalization by the Company,
(iii) upon the execution of unsolicited buy orders by any member of the
Purchaser Group that is a registered broker-dealer for the bona fide account of
accounts managed by it that are unaffiliated and not acting in concert with any
member of the Purchaser Group, (iv) pursuant to the exercise of any warrant,
option or other right to acquire Restricted Securities ("Rights") that it
receives directly from the Company pursuant to a distribution to stockholders or
from acquiring such Rights directly from the Company 

-40-
<PAGE>

or (v) as a result of debts previously contracted or in a fiduciary capacity;
provided further, that if during the Standstill Period, as a result of a
- - -------- -------
business combination transaction between the Company or an affiliate of the
Company and any other entity which is not an affiliate of any member of the
Purchaser Group (an "Other Entity"), any one or more members of the Purchaser
Group shall acquire beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of
the Exchange Act) of Restricted Securities in such business combination, such
members may continue to own beneficially such Restricted Securities so acquired
by such members and such Restricted Securities shall continue to be subject to
the provisions of this Section;

(B) participate in, or encourage, the formation of any
13D Group which owns or seeks to acquire beneficial ownership of, or otherwise
acts in respect of, Restricted Securities;

(C) make, or in any way participate in, directly or
indirectly, any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are defined or used
in Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act) or become a "participant" in any
"election contest" (as such terms are defined or used in Rule 14a-11 under the
Exchange Act) with respect to the Company, or initiate, propose or otherwise
solicit stockholders for the approval of one or more stockholder proposals with
respect to the Company or induce or attempt to induce any other person to
initiate any stockholder proposal, provided, however, that the limitation
contained in this paragraph (C) shall not apply to any matter to be voted on by
the Company's stockholders that is not initiated or proposed by any member of
the Purchaser Group or any Affiliate thereof or the solicitation by any member
of the Purchaser Group of proxies for the election to the Board of Directors of
the Company of any Purchaser Designee;

(D) except as permitted by the Certificate of
Amendment or this Agreement, call or seek to have called any meeting of the
stockholders of the Company; or

(E) otherwise act, directly or indirectly, alone or in
concert with others, to seek to control the management, Board of Directors,
policies or affairs of the Company, or solicit, propose, seek to effect or
negotiate with the Company or any other person with respect to any form of busi-
ness combination transaction with the Company or any affiliate thereof (other
than an Other Entity with respect to which any member of the Purchaser Group or
any affiliate thereof shall have filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC with respect
to any class of equity securities of such Other Entity prior to the public
announcement of the Company's intent to consummate a 

-41-

<PAGE>
business transaction with such Other Entity) or any restructuring, recapi-
talization or similar transaction with respect to the Company or any affiliate
thereof (except as aforesaid), or solicit, make or propose or encourage or
negotiate with any other person with respect to, or announce an intent to make,
any tender offer or exchange offer for any Restricted Securities (other than the
Exchange, an exchange of shares of Series E Preferred Stock for Conversion
Shares or the exchange of Shares, Option Shares or Exchange Shares for Exchange
Notes as contemplated hereby or by the Certificate of Amendment) or disclose an
intent, purpose, plan or proposal with respect to the Company or any Restricted
Securities inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 7.1, including an
intent, purpose, plan or proposal that is conditioned on or would require the
Company to waive the benefit of, or amend, any provisions of this Section 7.1,
or assist, participate in, facilitate, encourage or solicit any effort or
attempt by any person to do or seek to do any of the foregoing; provided,
--------
however, that it is agreed that nothing herein shall affect the right of any
- - -------
Purchaser Designee (i) to act as a member of the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof and (ii) to take any action necessary or
advisable to carry out his obligations as a director of the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any breach of Section 7.1(A) caused by an
acquisition of a non-material amount of Restricted Securities shall have been
cured within 30 days after the Purchaser becomes aware of such breach, then no
breach of this Section 7.1 shall be deemed to have occurred. Further not-
withstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 7.1 shall prohibit
or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or following any event rise to a right of termination under
Section 7.1(vii) of the Merger Agreement, any proposal by Chicago to acquire
100% of the outstanding common stock of New York though a merger, tender offer
or other acquisition transaction at a price equal to or greater than $20 per
common share. 

7.2 Voting and Other Rights. Nothing in this Section 7
-----------------------
shall preclude members of the Purchaser Group, (A) from exercising the voting
and other rights granted to the Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement or any of
the Transaction Documents or (B) in the case of any proposed merger, sale of
assets or similar transaction that under the Certificate of Amendment requires a
vote of the holders of Restricted Securities and has been approved or
recommended by the Board of Directors of the Company, or in the case of a tender
or exchange offer made without encouragement by or the participation of the
Purchaser or any of its affiliates (if the Board of Directors of the Company
shall send to shareholders a statement 

-42-
<PAGE>

that the Board of Directors (i) recommends approval of such tender or exchange
offer, or (ii) is neutral with respect to such tender or exchange offer) from
making an offer to the Board of Directors of the Company, in respect of such
transaction, upon terms more favorable to the Company or its stockholders than
those of the other transaction, as proposed.

7.3 Standstill Period. As used herein, the term
-----------------
"Standstill Period" shall mean the period from the date that the Closing occurs
until the earliest to occur of (each a "Termination Event"):

(A) the date on which the Purchaser holds Common Stock
which, together with any Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of other
securities held by the Purchaser (including Common Stock into which shares of
Series E Preferred Stock would be convertible assuming Exchange of shares of
Series T Preferred Stock), represents less than 5% of the Common Stock of the
Company on a fully diluted basis;

(B) the designation of any date as the termination
date of the Standstill Period by a majority of the directors of the Company
(excluding any Purchaser Designees and any directors elected by the holders of
Shares, Option Shares or Exchange Shares pursuant to the Certificate of
Amendment) at a duly convened meeting thereof or by all of the directors of the
Company by written consent;

(C) the Company's breach of any of its material
obligations contained in the Registration Rights Agreement or the Merger
Agreement;

(D) default in the payment of principal or interest

payable on the Series E Preferred Stock, the Series F Preferred Stock, the
Series G Preferred Stock, the Series H Preferred Stock or the Series T Preferred
Stock for any two quarterly dividend periods shall not have been paid; provided,
--------
however, that this paragraph (E) shall not be a Termination Event with respect
- - -------
to any provision of Section 7.1 except the provisions contained therein
prohibiting the Purchaser or its Affiliates from making a tender offer for all
the outstanding shares of Common Stock or entering into an agreement of merger
or consolidation (including soliciting, making, proposing or 

-43-

<PAGE>
negotiating with respect thereto, or announcing an interest to make such a
tender offer or to consummate such a merger or consolidation);

(F) the date on which the full amount of dividends
payable on the Series E Preferred Stock, the Series F Preferred Stock, the

Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 14 hereof;

(G) the Company or any of its material Subsidiaries
shall commence a voluntary case concerning itself under Title 11 of the United
States Code entitled "Bankruptcy" as now or hereafter in effect, or any
successor thereto (the "Bankruptcy Code") or any insurance insolvency laws that,
in the case of a Subsidiary of the Company, has had or would have a Material
Adverse Effect; or an involuntary case is commenced against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and the petition not controverted within 10 days, or is not
dismissed within 60 days after commencement of the case, which, in the case of a
Subsidiary of the Company, has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect; or a
custodian (as defined in the Bankruptcy Code) is appointed for, or takes charge
of, all or any substantial part of the property of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, which, in the case of a Subsidiary of the Company, has had or
would have a Material Adverse Effect; or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
commences any other proceeding under any reorganization, arrangement, adjustment
of debt, relief of debtors, rehabilitation, dissolution, insolvency or
liquidation or similar law of any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in
effect, relating to the Company or such Subsidiary, or there is commenced
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any such proceeding which remains
undismissed for a period of 60 days, which, in the case of a Subsidiary of the
Company, has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect; or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is adjudicated insolvent or bankrupt, which, in the case of
a Subsidiary of the Company, has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect; or
any order of relief or other order approving any such case or proceeding is
entered, which, in the case of a Subsidiary of the Company, has had or would
have a Material Adverse Effect; or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

a Subsidiary of the Company, has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect; or
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall call a general meeting of its
creditors with a view to arranging a composition or adjustment of its debts,
which, in the case of a Subsidiary of the Company, has had or would have a
Material Adverse Effect; or any corporate action is taken by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing, which, in
the case of a Subsidiary of the Company, has had or would have a Material
Adverse Effect;

(H) without encouragement by or the participation of
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, the acquisition by any person or 13D
Group (other than members of the Purchaser Group or Affiliates thereof) of, the
commencement of a tender offer by such person or 13D Group for, or the public
announcement of an intention to acquire, Restricted Securities which, if added
to the Restricted Securities (if any) already owned by such person or 13D Group,
would represent thirty percent (30%) or more of the total voting power
(including rights to acquire voting power) of the Company's Restricted
Securities, or the receipt by such person or 13D Group of the Company's
agreement or consent to make such acquisition; provided, however, that such a
-------- -------
public announcement or commencement of a tender offer shall end the Standstill
Period only if such person or 13D Group shall have received the Company's
agreement or consent to make such intended acquisition, and such a tender offer
shall terminate the Standstill Period only if and when the Board of Directors of
the Company shall end to shareholders a statement that the Board of Directors
(i) recommends approval of such tender offer or (ii) is neutral with respect to
such tender offer; or

(I) after the consummation of the Exchange, the
failure of any of the Purchaser Designees to be elected to the Board of

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in accordance with Section 6.1, a transferee
of the Purchaser (other than an Affiliate of the Purchaser) is required to agree
to be bound by the provisions of this Section 7.1, such agreement shall also
provide that the events described in paragraph (E), (F) or (I) shall not be a
Termination Event with respect to such transferee and its Affiliates.

8. INDEMNIFICATION.

8.1 Indemnification by the Company. In addition to all
------------------------------
other sums due hereunder or provided for in this Agreement, the Company agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, agents, employees, subsidiaries, partners and
controlling persons (each, an "indemnified party") to the fullest extent
permitted by law from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, expenses
(including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel) or other
liabilities ("Liabilities") resulting from any breach of any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement or any
legal, administrative or other actions brought by any person or entity,

indemnified person's role therein or in the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable under this
Section 8.1: (i) for any amount paid in settlement of claims without the
Company's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or (ii) to
the extent that it is finally judicially determined that such Liabilities
resulted primarily from a breach by the Purchaser of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or
the willful misconduct of the Purchaser; provided further, that if and to the
-------- -------
extent that such indemnification is unenforceable for any reason, the Company
shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such
indemnified liability that shall be permissible under applicable laws. In
connection with the obligation of the Company to indemnify for Liabilities as
set forth above, the Company further agrees to reimburse each indemnified party
for all such expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and other
charges of counsel) as they are incurred by such indemnified party.

8.2 Notification. Each indemnified party under this
------------
Section 8 will, promptly after the receipt of notice of the commencement of any
action or other proceeding against such indemnified party in respect of which
indemnity may be sought from the Company under this Section 8, notify the
Company in writing of the commencement thereof. The omission of any indemnified
party so to notify the Company of any such action shall not relieve the Company
from any liability that it may have to such indemnified party (A) other than
pursuant to this Section 8 or (B) under this Section 8 unless, and only to the
extent that, such omission results in the Company's forfeiture of substantive
rights or defenses. In case any such action or 

-46-
<PAGE>

other proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall
notify the Company of the commencement thereof, the Company shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party;
provided, however, that any indemnified party may, at its own expense, retain
- - -------- -------
separate counsel to participate in such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in any action or proceeding in which both the Company and an indemnified party
is, or is reasonably likely to become, a party, such indemnified party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel at the Company's expense and to
control its own defense of such action or proceeding if, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to such indemnified party, (i) there are or may be legal
defenses available to such indemnified party or to other indemnified parties
that are different from or additional to those available to the Company or (ii)
any conflict or potential conflict exists between the Company and such
indemnified party that would make such separate representation advisable;
provided, however, that (1) any such separate counsel employed by the
- - -------- -------
indemnified party at the Company's expense shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, (2) the indemnified party will not, without the prior written
consent of the Company, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judg-
ment in such action or proceeding unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of the Company from all liability arising or
that may arise out of such action or proceeding relating to any matter subject
to indemnification hereunder and (3) in no event shall the Company be required
to pay fees and expenses under this Section 8 for more than one firm of
attorneys representing the indemnified parties in any jurisdiction in any one
legal action or group of related legal actions. The Company agrees that the
Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened
claim, action or proceeding relating to any matter subject to indemnification
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of the Purchaser and each other indemnified party from all
liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding. 
The rights accorded to indemnified parties hereunder shall be in addition to any
rights that any indemnified party may have at common law, by separate agreement
or otherwise. 

8.3 Registration Rights Agreement. Notwithstanding
-----------------------------
anything to the contrary in this Section 8, the indemnification and contribution
provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement shall govern any claim made with
respect to registration statements filed pursuant thereto or sales made
thereunder.

10. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES
AND COVENANTS.

Notwithstanding any right of the Purchaser fully to
investigate the affairs of the Company and notwithstanding any knowledge of
facts determined or determinable by the Purchaser pursuant to such investigation
or right of investigation, the Purchaser has the right to rely fully upon the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained
in this Agreement. All such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Closing hereunder, except that the representations and warranties shall survive
only for a period of two years from the Closing.

11. PERFORMANCE; WAIVER.

The provisions of this Agreement (including this Section 11)
may be modified or amended, and waivers and consents to the performance and
observance of the terms hereof may be given by written instrument executed and
delivered by the Company and (A) prior to the Closing, by the Purchaser and (B)
after the Closing by the holder or holders of the Shares representing 66-2/3% of
the aggregate outstanding Shares, including Conversion Shares and Exchange
Shares (if Exchange Notes issued with respect to the Shares are outstanding such
percentage shall be calculated on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of
such Exchange Notes). The failure at any time to require performance of any
provision hereof shall in no way affect the full right to require such
performance at any time thereafter (unless performance thereof has been waived
in accordance with the terms hereof for all purposes and at all times by the
parties to whom the benefit of such performance is to be rendered). The waiver
by any party to this Agreement of a breach of any provision hereof shall not be
taken or held to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of such provision of any
other provision or as a waiver of the provision itself.

12. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement by
or on behalf of the parties hereto shall bind, and inure the benefit of, the
respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that
-------- -------
the rights and obligations of either party hereto may not be assigned without
the prior written consent of the other parties except that (A) prior to the
Closing, the Purchaser may assign all or any 

-48-
<PAGE>

portion of its right to purchase the Shares (and the corresponding obligations)
to one or more Affiliates of the Purchaser, in which event the Purchaser will be
relieved of its obligations hereunder to the extent so assumed by such Affiliate
or Affiliates and such Affiliate or Affiliates will be considered to be included
within each of the term "Purchaser" for all purposes of this Agreement and (B)
assignments of all or a portion of the Purchaser's rights and obligations here-
under may be made by the Purchaser in connection with transfers permitted under
clause (1) or (2) of Section 6.1, in which event the assigning Purchaser shall
be relieved of its obligations to the extent so assigned by the transferee. 
Each such assignment shall be made by such assignee and assignor, as the case
may be, and the Company executing an Assignment Agreement pursuant to which the
assignee shall expressly agree to become a party to this Agreement and to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement.

14. EXCHANGE.

14.1 The Exchange. The shares of Series T Preferred Stock
------------
purchased hereunder shall be exchangeable at any time and from time to time by
the holder thereof into shares of Series E Preferred Stock having the same
aggregate liquidation preference as the shares of Series T Preferred Stock

election to effect such exchange (each such exchange, an "Exchange" and all such
Exchanges collectively, the "Exchange"), subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of all applicable conditions set forth in Section 14.2, and, upon any such

----------------------
Company to effect an Exchange are subject to satisfaction of the following
conditions at or prior to such Exchange (unless expressly waived in writing by

-51-
<PAGE>
(i) Hart-Scott-Rodino. The waiting period under the
-----------------
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act") shall have
expired or been terminated, to the extent applicable.

(ii) Regulatory Matters. There shall have been re-
------------------
ceived, and shall be in full force and effect, all requisite approvals under the
statutes and regulations of each jurisdiction (x) in the United States of
America or any state, territory or possession thereof and (y) each other
jurisdiction wherever located that is material to the issuance by the Company

14.4 Other.
-----

(i) From and after the date of this Agreement until
the consummation of the Exchange, each of the Company and the Purchaser shall
act with good faith towards, and shall use its reasonable efforts to consummate,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and neither the Company nor the
Purchaser will take any action that would prohibit or impair its ability to
consummate the Exchange; provided that the Company and the Purchaser shall
--------
consult and coordinate with one another regarding the obtaining of any
regulatory approvals which will be required in connection with the consummation
of the Exchange (including, at the Purchaser's option, to delay in taking ef-
forts to obtain such approvals until the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the termination thereof); provided,
--------
further, that without the prior written consent of the Company, the Purchaser
- - -------
agrees that prior to the end of the Merger Period it will not file any applica-
tion with any insurance regulatory body seeking approval for the Exchange. The
Purchaser may, at its sole discretion, however, seek approval under the HSR Act
to exchange shares of Series T Preferred Stock into shares of Series E Preferred
Stock prior to the end of the Merger Period, and may exchange shares of Series T
Preferred Stock for shares of Series E Preferred Stock, at any time and from
time to time, to the extent the conditions to the Exchange set forth in Section
14.2 can be satisfied without requiring the receipt of any regulatory approvals
other than in respect of the HSR Act. Without 

-52-
<PAGE>

limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the end of the Merger
Period the Purchaser and the Company shall make and cause their respective
Subsidiaries to make all necessary filings, as soon as practicable, including,
without limitation, those required under applicable insurance laws, in order to
facilitate prompt consummation of the Exchange and/or the performance of the
covenants contained in Section 6.17. In addition, from and after the end of the
Merger Period the Company and the Purchaser shall each use their respective best
efforts, and shall cooperate fully with each other (i) to comply as promptly as
practicable with all governmental requirements applicable to the Exchange and/or
the performance of the covenants contained in Section 6.17 and (ii) to obtain as
promptly as practicable all necessary permits, orders or other consents of
governmental entities and consents of all third parties necessary for the
consummation of the Exchange and/or the performance of the covenants contained
in Section 6.17. Each of the Company and the Purchaser shall use reasonable
efforts to provide such information and communications to governmental entities
as such governmental entities may reasonably request. Each of the Company and
the Purchaser shall provide to the other party copies of all applications in ad-
vance of filing or submission of such applications to governmental entities in
connection with the Exchange Agreement; provided that the Purchaser may redact
--------
confidential portions that relate solely to the business or financial condition
of the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

(ii) Hart-Scott-Rodino. To the extent applicable, the
-----------------
Company and the Purchaser shall make all filings and furnish all information
required with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
HSR Act and shall use their best efforts to obtain the early termination of the
waiting period thereunder; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the
-------- -------
Purchaser shall be required to agree to dispose of or hold separate any portion
of its business or assets.

ferred Stock, the liquidation preference of such shares plus accrued and unpaid

-------- -------
the Company may not cause any such sales following the occurrence of a Specified

---------------------------------

The undersigned, being the President and the Secretary,
respectively, of The Continental Corporation, hereby certify and set forth:

1. The name of the corporation is THE CONTINENTAL
CORPORATION (the "Corporation").

2. The certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was
filed by the Department of State on the 15th day of May, 1968.

3. The certificate of incorporation of the Corporation is
hereby amended, pursuant to section 502 of the Business Corporation Law, by the
addition of a provision stating the number, designation, relative rights,
preferences and limitations of the shares of (i) a series of Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series E (the "Series E Preferred Stock"), (ii) a
series of Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series F (the "Series F Preferred Stock")
and (iii) a series of Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series G (the "Series G
Preferred Stock"), (iv) a series of Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series H (the

ated and that the number of shares and the designations, relative rights
preferences and limitations of the shares of each such series, and the
qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof are as follows:

<PAGE>
Article 1. Series E Preferred Stock.
------------------------

Stock"). The number of shares initially constituting the Series E Preferred
Stock shall be 828,100, which number may be decreased (but not increased) by the
Board of Directors without a vote of stockholders; provided, however, that such
-------- -------
number may not be decreased below the sum of (x) the number of then outstanding
shares of Series E Preferred Stock and (y) the number of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock into which the outstanding shares of Series T Preferred Stock
are exchangeable.

(b) The Series E Preferred Stock shall, with respect to
dividend rights and rights on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, rank pari
----
passu with the Corporation's $2.50 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock,

other classes and series of capital stock of the Corporation now or hereafter
authorized including, without limitation, the Common Stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock").

(c) Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings set forth in Article 6 below. 

Section 2. Dividends and Distributions.
---------------------------

(a) The holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, in
preference to the holders of shares of Common Stock and of any shares of other
capital stock of the Corporation other than the Other Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of
the assets of the Corporation at the time legally available therefor, cumulative
cash dividends at an annual rate on the 

-2-

<PAGE>

Liquidation Preference thereof equal to 9.75% (subject to increase pursuant to
Section 2(b)), calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months, accruing and payable in equal quarterly payments, in immediately
available funds, on the Business Day immediately preceding the last day of
March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred
to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date") commencing on the Business Day
immediately preceding December 31, 1994, provided, however, that with respect to
-------- -------
such first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, the holders of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the
Board of Directors, out of the assets of the Corporation at the time legally
available therefor, a cumulative cash dividend in respect of each share of
Series E Preferred Stock in the amount of (i) 9.75% (or the then effective
annual rate) of the Liquidation Preference multiplied by (ii) a fraction equal
to (A) the number of days from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding)
such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date divided by (B) 360. No interest shall be
payable in respect of any dividend payment on the Series E Preferred Stock that
may be in arrears.

(b) If (i) a private placement or public offering of the
New Preferred Stock or the New Senior Notes, pursuant to which the Corporation
shall receive at least $100,000,000 in gross proceeds is not consummated within
360 days after the termination of the Merger Agreement or (ii) the annual
dividend rate on the New Preferred Stock or the annual interest rate on the New
Senior Notes, as applicable, exceeds 13%, then the annual rate of the cumulative
cash dividends shall be increased to a rate of 10.75%, effective (x) in the case
of clause (i), the date that is 360 days after the termination of the Merger
Agreement, and (y) in the case of clause (ii), the date of the issuance of the
New Preferred Stock or the New Senior Notes, as applicable. If on any date (A)
all of the Purchaser Designees shall not have been elected to the Corporation's
Board of Directors or any such Purchaser Designees shall not have been appointed
to the committees of the Corporation's Board of Directors, in accordance with
the provisions of Section 6.17 of the Securities Purchase Agreement, (B) the
Corporation shall have failed to declare, or shall have failed to pay, the full
amount of dividends payable on the Series E Preferred Stock for six quarterly
dividend periods, (C) the Corporation shall have failed to satisfy its
obligation to convert shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 10
or (D) a breach of any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase
Agreement or any of the Corporation's material obligations under the
Registration Rights Agreement shall have occurred then, effective as of the date
of such failure or breach, the annual rate of the cumulative cash dividends
shall be increased to a 

-3-

<PAGE>
rate of 11.75% and shall remain at such rate until such time as (1) the Pur-
chaser Designees shall have been elected to the Corporation's Board of Directors
and appointed to the committees of the Corporation's Board of Directors in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.17 of the Securities Purchase
Agreement, (2) all dividends accrued to date on the Series E Preferred Stock
shall have been declared and paid in full, (3) any conversion obligations in
respect of the Chicago Preferred Stock that have become due shall have been
fully satisfied and (4) there shall exist no breach of any of the Material
Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or any of the Corporation's
material obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, as the case may
be, at which time the annual rate of the cumulative cash dividends shall be
reduced to a rate of 9.75%, subject to being increased to a rate of 11.75% in
the event of each and every subsequent event of the character indicated above.

(c) Dividends payable pursuant to Section 2(a) shall begin
to accrue and be cumulative from the Issue Date, and shall accrue on a daily
basis, in each case whether or not declared. Dividends paid on the shares of
Series E Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such
dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro
rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares of Series E Preferred Stock
at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock entitled to
receive payment of a dividend declared thereon, which record date shall be not
more than 60 days, nor less than 10 days, prior to the date fixed for the
payment thereof. Accumulated but unpaid dividends for any past quarterly
dividend periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any
regular Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on such date, not
more than 60 nor less than 10 days preceding the payment date thereof, as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors.

(d) The holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall
not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions except as
provided herein.

Section 3. Voting Rights.
-------------

In addition to any voting rights provided by law, the
holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have the following voting
rights:

(a) Except as otherwise required by applicable law so long
as the Series E Preferred Stock is outstanding, each 

-4-

<PAGE>

share of Series E Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to vote, in
person or by proxy, at a special or annual meeting of stockholders, on all
matters voted on by holders of Common Stock voting together as a single class
with other shares entitled to vote thereon. With respect to any such vote, each
share of Series E Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to cast that
number of votes per share as is equal to the number of votes that such holder
would be entitled to cast had such holder converted his shares of Series E Pre-
ferred Stock into Common Stock on the record date for determining the
stockholders of the Corporation eligible to vote on any such matters.

(b) Unless the consent or approval of a greater number of
shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a single class, in person or by proxy, at a special or annual
meeting of stockholders called for the purpose, shall be necessary to (i)
authorize, adopt or approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
that would increase or decrease the par value of the shares of Series E
Preferred Stock, or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of
the shares of Series E Preferred Stock, (ii) amend, alter or repeal the
Certificate of Incorporation so as to affect the shares of Series E Preferred
Stock adversely or (iii) effect the voluntary liquidation, dissolution, winding
up, recapitalization or reorganization of the Corporation, or the consolidation
or merger of the Corporation with or into any other Person, or the sale or other
distribution to another Person of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; provided, however, that no separate vote of the holders of Series E
-------- -------
Preferred Stock shall be required to effect any of the transactions described in
clause (iii) above unless such transaction would either require a class vote
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above or would require a vote by any shareholders
of the Corporation (other than pursuant to this sentence); provided further,
-------- -------
that no separate vote of the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock as a class
shall be required in the case of a recapitalization, reorganization,
consolidation or merger of, or sale by, the Corporation if (A)(a) such
recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger or sale constitutes a
Specified Corporate Action, (b) the Corporation has sufficient funds legally
available to it (after giving effect to such transaction) to redeem, at the then
applicable price hereunder and pursuant to the terms hereof, all the outstanding
shares of Series E Preferred Stock, (c) such redemption shall not be prohibited
by any agreement to which the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
by applicable law or otherwise, (d) the Board of Directors of the 

-5-

<PAGE>
Corporation, including a majority of the directors who are not officers or
employees of the Corporation, shall have adopted a resolution confirming that
such funds are available and that the holders of Series E Preferred Stock have
the right to require such redemption and (e) the Corporation shall have set
aside sufficient funds to redeem through the Mandatory Redemption Date the
shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such holders (except that no funds
need be set aside with respect to such shares held by any such holder who has
theretofore notified the Corporation (whether pursuant to Section 6(c) or
otherwise) that it will not require redemption of such shares) or (B) (1) the
Corporation shall be the resulting or surviving corporation, (2) the resulting
or surviving corporation will have after such recapitalization, reorganization,
consolidation or merger no Senior Stock or Parity Stock either authorized or
outstanding (except such Parity Stock of the Corporation as may have been
authorized or outstanding immediately preceding such consolidation or merger) or
such stock of the resulting or surviving corporation (having the same powers,
preferences and special rights of any such Parity Stock) as may be issued in
exchange therefor), (3) each holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
immediately preceding such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or
merger will receive in exchange therefor the same number of shares of stock,
with the same preferences, rights and powers, of the resulting or surviving
corporation, (4) after such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or
merger the resulting or surviving corporation shall not be in breach of any of
the terms hereof, any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase
Agreement or any of its material obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement and (5) all or substantially all the holders of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Corporation immediately prior to such consolidation or
merger are entitled to receive shares representing 50% or more of the then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the resulting or surviving corporation
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

(c) If on any date (i) the Corporation shall have failed to
declare, or shall have failed to pay, the full amount of dividends payable on
any series of Chicago Preferred Stock, for six quarterly dividend periods or
(ii) a breach of any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase
Agreement or any of the Corporation's material obligations under the Reg-
istration Rights Agreement shall have occurred, then the number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors shall, without further action, be increased
by two and the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have, in
addition to the other voting rights set forth herein with respect to the Series
E Preferred Stock, the exclusive right, together with the 

-6-

<PAGE>

holders of all other series of Chicago Preferred Stock, voting separately as a
single class together with the holders of such other series of Chicago Preferred
Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created
directorship, by written consent as provided herein, or at a special meeting of
such holders called as provided herein. Any such additional directors shall
continue as directors (subject to reelection or removal as provided in Section
3(d)(ii)) and the holders of Series E Preferred Stock shall have such additional
voting rights until such time as (A) dividends then payable on all series of
Chicago Preferred Stock shall have been declared and paid in full and (B) there
shall exist no breach of any of the Material Provisions of the Securities
Purchase Agreement or any of the Corporation's material obligations under the
Registration Rights Agreement, as the case may be, at which time such additional
directors shall cease to be directors, the number of directors constituting the
Board of Directors shall be reduced by two and such additional voting rights of
the holders of all series of Chicago Preferred Stock shall terminate, subject to
revesting in the event of each and every subsequent event of the character
indicated above.

(d) (i) The foregoing right of holders of shares of Series
E Preferred Stock to take any action as provided in Section 3(c) may be
exercised at any annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of
holders of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock held for such purpose as
hereinafter provided or at any adjournment thereof, or by the written consent,
delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, of the holders of the minimum
number of shares required to take such action.

So long as such right to vote continues (and unless such
right has been exercised by written consent of the minimum number of shares
required to take such action), the President of the Corporation may call, and
upon the written request of holders of record of at least 5% of the aggregate
outstanding shares of Chicago Preferred Stock addressed to the Secretary of the
Corporation at the principal office of the Corporation, shall call, a special
meeting of the holders of shares entitled to vote as provided herein. Such
meeting shall be held within 30 days after delivery of such request to the
Secretary, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the by-laws
of the Corporation for the holding of meetings of stockholders.

(ii) At each meeting of stockholders at which the holders of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a
single class together with the holders of all other series of Chicago Preferred
Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation as provided in Section 3(c) or
to take any action, the presence in person or by proxy 

-7-

<PAGE>
of the holders of record of one-third of the total aggregate number of shares of
Chicago Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter
shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. At any such meeting
or at any adjournment thereof:

(A) the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares
of Chicago Preferred Stock shall not prevent the election of
directors other than those to be elected by the holders of shares
of Chicago Preferred Stock, and the absence of a quorum of the
holders of shares of any other class or series of capital stock
shall not prevent the election of directors to be elected by the
holders of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock or the taking of any
action as provided in Section 3(c); and

(B) in the absence of a quorum of the holders of
shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, a majority of the holders of
such shares present in person or by proxy shall have the power to
adjourn the meeting as to the actions to be taken by the holders
of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock from time to time and place
to place without notice other than announcement at the meeting
until a quorum shall be present.

For taking of any action as provided in Section 3(b) or
Section 3(c) by the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, each such
holder shall have one vote for each share of such stock standing in his name on
the transfer books of the Corporation as of any record date fixed for such
purpose or, if no such date be fixed, at the close of business on the Business
Day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held; provided, however, that shares of Chicago Preferred Stock held
-------- -------
by the Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Corporation shall not be deemed to
be outstanding for purposes of taking any action as provided in this Section 3.

Each director elected by the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock as provided in Section 3(c) shall, unless his term shall expire
earlier in accordance with the provisions thereof, hold office until the annual
meeting of stockholders next succeeding his election or until his successor, if
any, is elected and qualified.

If any director so elected by the holders of Chicago
Preferred Stock shall cease to serve as a director before his term shall expire
(except by reason of the termination of the voting rights accorded to the
holders of Chicago Preferred 

-8-

<PAGE>
Stock in accordance with Section 3(c)), the holders of the Chicago Preferred
Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote for such director may, by written
consent as provided herein, or at a special meeting of such holders called as
provided herein, elect a successor to hold office for the unexpired term of the
director whose place shall be vacant.

Any director elected by the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, may be removed from office
with or without cause only by the vote or written consent of the holders of at
least a majority of the aggregate outstanding shares of Chicago Preferred Stock
at the time of removal. A special meeting of the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock may be called in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 3(d)(i).

shall not have converted shares of Series E Preferred Stock at a time required
by Section 10, at such time and thereafter until all conversion obligations
provided in Section 10 that have come due shall have been satisfied or all
necessary funds have been set apart for payment, or whenever the Corporation

shall have been paid in full or declared and set apart for payment, or whenever
the Corporation shall not have converted shares of Series E Preferred Stock at
a time required by Section 10, at such time and thereafter until all conversion

Corporation shall not have paid the Optional Redemption Price, the Mandatory
Redemption Price, Special Redemption Price or the Maturity Redemption Price
when due, at such time and thereafter until all such amounts have been paid in

any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of Parity Stock pursuant
to any mandatory redemption, put, sinking fund or other similar obligation
contained in such Parity Stock, pro rata with the Series E Preferred Stock in
proportion to the total amount then required to be applied by the Corporation
to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise acquire shares of Series E Preferred Stock
and shares of such Parity Stock.

(d) The Corporation shall not permit any Subsidiary of the
Corporation, or cause any other Person, to purchase or otherwise acquire for
consideration any shares of capital stock of the Corporation unless the
Corporation could, pursuant to Section 4(c), purchase such shares at such time
and in such manner.

Section 5. Optional Redemption.
-------------------

(a) (i) The Corporation shall not have any right to redeem
any shares of Series E Preferred Stock prior to December 30, 2001. Thereafter
(A) at any time after December 31, 2001 or (B) at any time, so long as shares of
Common Stock shall have traded on the New York Stock Exchange (or another
national securities exchange or on Nasdaq) on each trading day during a 30-
consecutive trading day period (each of which trading days shall be after
December 30, 2001 and no more than 5 Business Days prior to the date notice is
given of an Optional Redemption (as defined below)) and had a Closing Price on
at least 20 of such trading days in excess of 150% of the Conversion Price in

-10-

<PAGE>
date of redemption (any such date an "Optional Redemption Date") at a price per
share (the "Optional Redemption Price") equal to (A) the following prices per
share (stated as a percentage of the Liquidation Preference of such share) plus
(B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon,
whether or not declared or payable, to the applicable Optional Redemption Date,
in immediately available funds:

Optional Redemption Price
If Redeemed as a Percentage of
During the Period Liquidation Preference 
----------------- -------------------------

December 30, 2001 to 102.775%
December 29, 2002 

December 30, 2002 to 101.850%
December 29, 2003

December 30, 2003 to 100.925%
December 29, 2004

December 30, 2004 and 100%
thereafter

(ii) If the Corporation shall determine to redeem less than
all the shares of Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding pursuant to
paragraph (i), the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly
as may be) so that the number of shares redeemed from each holder shall be the
same proportion of all the shares to be redeemed that the total number of shares
of Series E Preferred Stock then held by such holder bears to the total number
of shares of Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any shares of Series E
Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section 5(a) at any time when holders
of shares of Series E Preferred Stock have the right to require the Corporation
to redeem the shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6 or an
event giving rise to such a right has occurred shall be redeemed at a price
equal to higher of the price to be paid pursuant to Section 5(a) and the price
to be paid pursuant to Section 6.

(b) Notice of any Optional Redemption shall specify the
Optional Redemption Date, the Optional Redemption Price, the place or places of
payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of the shares
of Series E Preferred Stock, that on and after the date of such Optional
Redemption 

-11-

<PAGE>

dividends will cease to accrue on such shares, the then effective Conversion
Price and that the right of holders to convert shares of Series E Preferred
Stock shall terminate at the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Optional Redemption Date (unless the Corporation defaults in the
payment of the Optional Redemption Price) and be given by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York (if such publication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation
or securities exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more than 45, days
prior to the Optional Redemption Date; and, in any case, a similar notice shall
be mailed at least 30, but not more than 45, days prior to the Optional
Redemption Date to each holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, at such
holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation. In
order to facilitate the redemption of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, the
Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed, or may cause the transfer books of the
Corporation for the Series E Preferred Stock to be closed, not more than 60 days
or less than 45 days prior to the Optional Redemption Date.

(c) On the date of any Optional Redemption that is
specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 5(b), the Corporation shall, and
at any time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Optional
Redemption Date the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with
a bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that
is "well capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable bank regulations and
having a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited
by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the Optional
Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Optional Redemption Price. In the event that
moneys are deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) in respect of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock that are converted in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10, such moneys shall, upon such conversion, revert to the general funds
of the Corporation and, upon demand, such bank or trust company shall pay over
to the Corporation such moneys and shall be relieved of all responsibilities to
the holders of such converted shares in respect thereof. Any interest accrued
on funds deposited 

-12-

<PAGE>
pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be paid from time to time to the Corporation
for its own account.

(d) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 5(c) in respect of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 5(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Optional Redemption Date (i)
the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding, (ii) the
rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue, and (iii) all rights
of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall cease
and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Optional Redemption Price
therefor and the right to convert such shares into shares of Common Stock until
the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Optional
Redemption Date (and to receive accrued and unpaid dividends thereon), in ac-
cordance with Section 10; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall
-------- -------
default in the payment of the Optional Redemption Price the shares of Series E
Preferred Stock shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders
thereof shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series E Preferred Stock
until such time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall have been
waived by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock.

(e) Any notice that is mailed as herein provided shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock receives such notice, and failure to give
such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice, to the holders of any shares
designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any other shares of Series E Preferred Stock. On or after the
Optional Redemption Date, each holder of the shares called for redemption,
subject to their right to convert shares of Series E Preferred Stock as provided
in section 10, shall surrender the certificate evidencing such shares to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice and shall thereupon be
entitled to receive payment of the Optional Redemption Price. If less than all
the shares evidenced by any such surrendered certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate shall be issued evidencing the unredeemed shares.

Section 6. Mandatory Redemption at the Option of the Holder.
------------------------------------------------

(a) If one or more events constituting a Specified
Corporate Action shall occur, each holder of shares of the 

-13-

<PAGE>

Series E Preferred Stock shall have the right, on the date or dates specified in
Section 6(b) (the "Mandatory Redemption Date"), to require the Corporation to
redeem (a "Mandatory Redemption") all or any part of the shares of Series E Pre-
ferred Stock then held by such holder as such holder may elect at a price per
share (the "Mandatory Redemption Price") equal to (A) the following prices per
share (stated as a percentage of the Liquidation Preference of such share) plus
(B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon,
whether or not declared or payable, to the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date,
in immediately available funds:

If the Mandatory

Period Liquidation Preference 
---------------- -------------------------

December 30, 1994 to 110.4%
June 29, 1995

December 30, 1995 to 126.7%
June 29, 1996

June 30, 1996 and 138.0%
thereafter

(b) The date fixed for each Mandatory Redemption shall be
fixed by the Corporation and shall be not less than 60 days nor more than 90
days following the occurrence of any Specified Corporate Action giving rise
thereto (or, in the case of a Specified Corporate Action described in clause
(iii) of the definition of "Specified Corporate Action," not less than 60 days
nor more than 90 days following the date on which the Corporation obtains actual
knowledge of such Specified Corporate Action); provided, however, that in the
-------- -------
event of a Specified Corporate Action that constitutes a Control Transaction, in
addition to the dates fixed for a Specified Corporate Action Redemption as
specified above, an additional Specified Corporate Action Redemption Date shall
be set for the date and time immediately preceding the consummation of any such
Control Transaction; provided, further, that, upon the request of a holder, the
-------- -------
Board of Directors shall agree to extend the date of redemption in respect of
any such Specified Corporate Action (without changing the consideration that is
otherwise payable 

-14-

<PAGE>
in respect of such redemption other than with respect to adjustments to the
amount of accrued and unpaid dividends included in such redemption price) to the
extent necessary for any holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to avoid
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, provided, that no such
redemption extension shall be for a period greater than six months. The
Corporation shall, within 5 days of the occurrence of a Specified Corporate
Action (or, in the case of a Specified Corporate Action described in clause
(iii) of the definition of "Specified Corporate Action," within 5 days of the
date on which the Corporation obtains actual knowledge of such Specified
Corporate Action), give notice thereof by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such
publication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation or securities
exchange requirement), and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed to
each holder of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock, at such holder's address
as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation. Each such notice shall
specify the Specified Corporate Action that has occurred and the date of such
occurrence, the place or places of payment, the then effective Mandatory
Redemption Price and Conversion Price and the date the right of such holder to
require a Mandatory Redemption shall terminate.

(c) If the notice sent by the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6(b) shall contain (i) a form inquiring as to whether a holder of shares
of Series E Preferred Stock intends to surrender the certificate(s) representing
such shares for redemption pursuant to this Section 6 and (ii) a stamped self-
addressed envelope for return of such form to the Corporation or its designee,
within ten Business Days of such notice, each holder shall return such inquiry
form to the Corporation and shall indicate in such form the proportion of such
holder's shares of Series E Preferred Stock that will be surrendered for
redemption pursuant to this Section 6. If such notice shall indicate that if a
holder does not respond prior to ten Business Days after the date of such notice
that such holder will be deemed to have notified the Corporation that it will
not require the redemption of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by
such holder for purposes of Section 3(b) and such holder does not respond to the
Corporation's inquiry prior to ten Business Days after the date of such notice,
such holder will be deemed to have notified the Corporation that it will not
require the redemption of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such
holder for purposes of Section 3(b). Nothing contained in this Section 6(c)
shall affect the right of a holder of Series E Preferred Stock to require the
Corporation to redeem such shares pursuant to Section 6(a).

-15-

<PAGE>

(d) Each holder of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock
shall have the right, at such holder's option exercisable at any time on 30
days' notice to the Corporation on or after December 30, 2009 (the date of any
such exercise, the "Special Redemption Date"), to require the Corporation to
redeem (a "Special Redemption") all or any part of the shares of Series E
Preferred Stock then held by such holder as such holder may elect by written
notice delivered at least 30 days prior to the Special Redemption Date at a
price per share equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the Liquidation Preference of
such share and (B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon whether or not declared or payable to the Special Redemption Date (the
"Special Redemption Price") in immediately available funds.

(e) On the date fixed for any Mandatory Redemption or on
any Special Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
who elects to have shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by it redeemed shall
surrender the certificate representing such shares to the Corporation at the
place designated in such notice together with an election to have such
redemption made and shall thereupon be entitled to receive payment therefor
provided in this Section 6. If less than all the shares represented by any such
surrendered certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued rep-
resenting the unredeemed shares. From and after the date of such redemption (i)
the rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all
rights of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock so redeemed shall
cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Mandatory
Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price therefor; provided, however, that
-------- -------
if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the Mandatory Redemption
Price the shares of Series E Preferred Stock that were to be redeemed shall
thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have all of
the rights of a holder of Series E Preferred Stock until such time as such
default shall no longer be continuing or shall have been waived by holders of at
least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock.

Section 7. Redemption Upon Maturity.
------------------------

(a) On December 30, 2034 (the "Maturity Date"), the
Corporation shall redeem (the "Maturity Redemption") the remaining outstanding
shares of the Series E Preferred Stock at a price per share (the "Maturity
Redemption Price") equal to (A) 100% of the Liquidation Preference per share
plus (B) an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not
declared or payable, to the Maturity Date, in immediately available funds.

-16-

(c) On the Maturity Date, the Corporation shall, and at any
time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Maturity Date the
Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or trust
company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well
capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable banking regulations and having
a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited by the
Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for
such redemption shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Maturity Redemption Price. In the event that
moneys are deposited pursuant to this Section 7(c) in respect of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock that are converted in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10, such moneys shall, upon such conversion, revert to the general funds
of the Corporation and, upon demand, such bank or trust company shall pay over
to the Corporation such moneys and shall be relieved of all responsibilities to
the holders of such converted shares in respect thereof. Any interest accrued
and unpaid on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be paid from
time to time to the Corporation for its own account.

upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 7(c) in respect of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 7(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Maturity Date, (i) the rights
to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of the
holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate,
excepting only the right to receive the Maturity Redemption Price therefor;
provided, however, that

if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the Maturity Redemption
Price, the shares of Series E Preferred Stock that were to be redeemed shall
thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have all of
the rights of a holder of Series E Preferred Stock until such time as such
default shall no longer be continuing.

Section 8. Acquired Shares.
---------------

Any shares of Series E Preferred Stock converted, exchanged,
redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly
after the acquisition thereof. All such shares of Series E Preferred Stock
shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of preferred
stock, par value $4.00 per share, of the Corporation and, upon the filing of an
appropriate certificate with the Department of State of the State of New York,
may be reissued as part of another series of preferred stock, par value $4.00

Date (but subject to the provisions of Section 10(b)) to convert, subject to the
terms and provisions of this Section 10, each share of Series E Preferred Stock
into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
(calculated as to each conversion to the nearest 1/100th of a share of Common
Stock) for each full share of Series E Preferred Stock as is equal, subject to
Section 10(g), to the quotient of (i) the Liquidation Preference divided by (ii)
the Conversion Price (as defined below) then in effect, except that with respect
to any share that shall be called for redemption, such right shall terminate at
the close of business on the date of redemption for such share, unless in any
such case the Corporation shall default in performance or payment due upon
redemption thereof. The Conversion Price initially shall be $15.75, and
thereafter shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 10(d). Such
conversion right shall be exercised by the surrender of the shares of Series E
Preferred Stock to be converted to the Corporation at any time during usual
business hours at its principal place of business to be maintained by it,
accompanied by written notice that the holder elects to convert such shares and
specifying the name or names (with addresses) in which a certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued and 

-19-

<PAGE>

(if so required by the Corporation) by a written instrument or instruments of
transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation duly executed by the
holder or its duly authorized legal representative and transfer tax stamps or
funds therefor, if required pursuant to Section 10(k). All shares of Series E
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion shall be delivered to the Corporation
for cancellation and cancelled by it and no shares shall be issued in lieu
thereof.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the surrender, as
herein provided, of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock for conversion
pursuant to Section 10(a), the Corporation shall deliver to or upon the written
order of the holder of the shares so surrendered a certificate or certificates
representing the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
into which such shares may be or have been converted in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 10. Subject to the following provisions of this
paragraph and of Section 10(d), such conversion shall be deemed to have been
made immediately prior to the close of business on the date that such shares
shall have been surrendered in satisfactory form for conversion, and the Person
or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of
such shares shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder
or holders of such Common Stock at such appropriate time, and such conversion
shall be at the Conversion Price in effect at such time; provided, however, that
-------- -------
no surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to
receive the Common Stock deliverable upon such conversion as the record holder
or holders of such Common Stock while the share transfer books of the
Corporation shall be closed (but not for any period in excess of five days), but
such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled
to receive such Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all
purposes immediately prior to the close of business on the next succeeding day
on which such share transfer books are open, and such conversion shall be deemed
to have been made at, and shall be made at the Conversion Price in effect at,
such time on such next succeeding day. In case of any Optional Redemption,
Special Redemption or Maturity Redemption of any shares of Series E Preferred
Stock, the right of conversion shall cease and terminate, as to the shares to be
redeemed, at the close of business on (A) the Business Day immediately preceding
the Optional Redemption Date, in the case of an Optional Redemption, (B) the
Business Day immediately preceding the Special Redemption Date, in the case of
the Special Redemption, and (C) the Business Day immediately preceding the
Maturity Date, in the case of a Maturity Redemption, unless the Corporation
shall default in the 

-20-

<PAGE>
payment of the applicable redemption price for the shares to be redeemed.

If the last day for the exercise of the conversion right
shall not be a Business Day, then such conversion right may be exercised on the
next preceding Business Day.

(c) To the extent permitted by law, when shares of Series E
Preferred Stock are converted, all dividends accrued and unpaid (whether or not
declared or currently payable) on the Series E Preferred Stock so converted to
the date of conversion shall be immediately due and payable and must accompany
the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion; provided, however, that
-------- -------
if shares being converted are held by a Person other than the original holder or
any of its Affiliates and such shares are not "restricted securities" (as
defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended), then no such
accrued and unpaid dividends shall be payable when such shares are converted.

(d) The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as
follows:

(i) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding shares
of Common Stock in Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment
plan approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors), (B) subdivide the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (C) combine
the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (D)
issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock,
then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such event shall be adjusted (and any other appropriate actions shall be taken
by the Corporation) so that the holder of any share of Series E Preferred Stock
thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of
shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation that such holder
would have owned or would have been entitled to receive upon or by reason of any
of the events described above, had such share of Series E Preferred Stock been
converted immediately prior to the occurrence of such event. An adjustment made
pursuant to this Section 10(d)(i) shall become effective retroactively (A) in
the case of any such dividend or distribution, to the opening of business on the
day immediately following the close of business on the record date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or
distribution or (B) in the case of any such subdivision, combination or
reclassification, 

-21-

<PAGE>

to the close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes
effective.

(ii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time issue or sell shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or any options, warrants or
other rights to acquire shares of Common Stock (other than (x) options granted
to any employee or director of the Corporation pursuant to a stock option plan
approved by the shareholders of the Corporation or (y) rights issued pursuant to
a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar arrangement that complies
with Section 10(k))) for a consideration per share less than the Conversion
Price then in effect at the record date or issuance date, as the case may be
(the "Date") referred to in the following sentence (treating the price per share
of any security convertible or exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock as
equal to (A) the sum of the price for such security convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable into Common Stock plus any additional consideration payable (without
regard to any anti-dilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or
exercise of such security into Common Stock divided by (B) the number of shares
of Common Stock initially underlying such convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable security), other than issuances or sales for which an adjustment is
made pursuant to another paragraph of this Section 10(d), then, and in each such
case, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be adjusted by dividing the
Conversion Price in effect on the day immediately prior to the Date by a
fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Date plus the number of ad-
ditional shares of Common Stock issued or to be issued (or the maximum number
into which such convertible or exchangeable securities initially may convert or
exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights initially may be
exercised) and (y) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Date plus the number
of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration (if any of such
aggregate consideration is other than cash, as valued by the Board of Directors
including a majority of the Directors who are not officers or employees of the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, which determination shall be conclusive
and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) for the total number of
such additional shares of Common Stock so issued (or into which such convertible
or exchangeable securities may convert or exchange or for which such options,
warrants or other rights may be exercised plus the aggregate amount of any
additional consideration initially payable upon conversion, exchange or exercise
of such security) would purchase at the Conversion Price. Such 

-22-

<PAGE>
adjustment shall be made whenever such shares, securities, options, warrants or
other rights are issued, and shall become effective retroactively to a date
immediately following the close of business (i) in the case of issuance to
stockholders of the Corporation, as such, on the record date for the de-
termination of stockholders entitled to receive such shares, securities,
options, warrants or other rights and (ii) in all other cases, on the date
("issuance date") of such issuance; provided, however, that the determination as
-------- -------
to whether an adjustment is required to be made pursuant to this Section
10(d)(ii) shall only be made upon the issuance of such shares or such
convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights, and
not upon the issuance of the security into which such convertible or
exchangeable security converts or exchanges, or the security underlying such
option, warrants or other right; provided, further, that if any convertible or
-------- -------
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights (or any portions
thereof) that shall have given rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section
10(d)(ii) shall have expired or terminated without the exercise thereof and/or
if by reason of the terms of such convertible or exchangeable securities,
options, warrants or other rights there shall have been an increase or
increases, with the passage of time or otherwise, in the price payable upon the
exercise or conversion thereof, then the Conversion Price hereunder shall be
readjusted (but to no greater extent than originally adjusted) on the basis of
(x) eliminating from the computation any additional shares of Common Stock cor-
responding to such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or
other rights as shall have expired or terminated, (y) treating the additional
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or issuable pursuant to the
previous exercise of such convertible or exchangeable securities, options,
warrants or other rights as having been issued for the consideration actually
received and receivable therefor and (z) treating any of such convertible or
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights that remain
outstanding as being subject to exercise or conversion on the basis of such
exercise or conversion price as shall be in effect at the time.

(iii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time distribute to all holders of shares of its Common Stock (including
any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which
the Corporation is the resulting or surviving corporation and the Common Stock
is not changed or exchanged or a redemption of any rights or other securities
issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement) cash, evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation or another
issuer, securities of the Corporation or another issuer or other assets
(excluding 

-23-

<PAGE>

(A) Permitted Dividends described in clause (B) of the definition thereof and
(B) securities for which adjustment is made under Section 10(d)(i) or Section
10(d)(ii)), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price then in effect
shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior
to the date of such distribution by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall
be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date referred to
below and (y) the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price of the
Common Stock less the then Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive) of the
portion of the cash, evidences of indebtedness, securities or other assets so
distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share
of Common Stock (but such denominator not to be less than one); provided,
--------
however, that no adjustment shall be made with respect to any distribution of
- - -------
rights to purchase securities of the Corporation if the holder of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive such rights upon
conversion at any time of shares of Series E Preferred Stock into Common Stock
unless such rights are subsequently redeemed by the Corporation, in which case
such redemption shall be treated for purposes of this Section 10(d)(iii) as a
dividend on the Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such
distribution is made and shall become effective retroactively to a date
immediately following the close of business on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.

(iv) In the case the Corporation at any time or from
time to time shall take any action affecting its Common Stock, other than an
action described in any of Section 10(d)(i) through Section 10(d)(iii),
inclusive, or Section 10(h), then, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted in
such manner and at such time as the Board of Directors of the Corporation (other
than Purchaser Designees or directors elected pursuant to Section 3(c)) in good
faith determines to be equitable in the circumstances (such determination to be
evidenced in a resolution, a certified copy of which shall be mailed to the
holders of the Series E Preferred Stock).

(v) The Corporation may make such reductions in the
Conversion Price, in addition to those required by subparagraphs (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) of this Section 10(d), as the Board of Directors considers to be
advisable in order to avoid or to diminish any income tax to holders of Common
Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or
distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as
such for income tax purposes.

-24-

<PAGE>
(vi) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no adjustment under this Section 10(d) need be made to the Conversion Price
unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of
the Conversion Price then in effect. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried
forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent
adjustment, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried
forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1% of such
Conversion Price. Any adjustment to the Conversion Price carried forward and
not theretofore made shall be made immediately prior to the conversion of any
shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that any
-------- -------
such adjustment shall in any event be made no later than three years after the
occurrence of the event giving rise to such adjustment.

(e) If the Corporation shall take a record of the holders
of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or
other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to
stockholders thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or
distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Price then in
effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.

(f) Upon any increase or decrease in the Conversion Price,
then, and in each such case, the Corporation promptly shall deliver to each
registered holder of Series E Preferred Stock at least 10 Business Days prior to
effecting any of the foregoing transactions a certificate, signed by the
President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, setting forth in
reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which
such adjustment was calculated and specifying the increased or decreased Con-
version Price then in effect following such adjustment.

(g) No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional
shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any shares of Series E Preferred
Stock. If more than one share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be surrendered
for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of
the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock
so surrendered. If the conversion of any share or shares of Series E Preferred
Stock results in a fraction, an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day preceding the day
of conversion shall be paid to such holder in cash by the Corporation on the
date of issuance 

-25-

<PAGE>
of the certificates representing the shares issued by the Corporation upon such
conversion.

(h) In case of any capital reorganization or re-
classification or other change of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than
a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value
to par value), or in case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with
or into another Person (other than a consolidation or merger in which the
Corporation is the resulting or surviving Person and which does not result in
any reclassification or change of outstanding Common Stock), or in case of any
sale or other disposition to another Person of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Corporation (any of the foregoing, a "Transaction"), the
Corporation, or such successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall
execute and deliver to each holder of Series E Preferred Stock at least 10
Business Days prior to effecting any of the foregoing Transactions a certificate
that the holder of each share of Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding shall
have the right thereafter to convert such share of Series E Preferred Stock into
the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities (of the Corporation
or another issuer) or property or cash receivable upon such Transaction by a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series E
Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such Transaction.
Such certificate shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly
equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section
10. If, in the case of any such Transaction, the stock, other securities, cash
or property receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of
stock or other securities of a Person other than the successor or purchasing
Person and other than the Corporation, which controls or is controlled by the
successor or purchasing Person or which, in connection with such Transaction,
issues stock, securities, other property or cash to holders of Common Stock,
then such certificate also shall be executed by such Person, and such Person
shall, in such certificate, specifically acknowledge the obligations of such
successor or purchasing Person and acknowledge its obligations to issue such
stock, securities, other property or cash to the holders of Series E Preferred
Stock upon conversion of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock as provided
above. The provisions of this Section 10(h) and any equivalent thereof in any
such certificate similarly shall apply to successive Transactions. The
provisions of this Section 10(h) and any equivalent thereof in any such
certificate are and shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the
requirements with respect to a Mandatory Redemption.

-26-

(i) In case at any time or from time to time:

(A) the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any
other distribution) on its Common Stock (other than a Permitted Dividend);

(B) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to
the holders of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or
purchase any shares of stock of any class or of any other rights or warrants;

(C) there shall be any reclassification of the Common
Stock (other than a subdivision or combination of the outstanding Common Stock,
or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par
value to par value), or any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is
a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Corporation is
required, or any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Corporation; or

(D) the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Corporation; then the Corporation shall mail to
each holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock at such holder's address as it
appears on the transfer books of the Corporation, as promptly as possible but in
any event at least ten days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified,
a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose
of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants or, if a record is not to
be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be
entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y)
the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effec-
tive; provided that in the case of any event to which Section 10(h) applies, the
--------
Corporation shall give at least 10 days' prior written notice as aforesaid. 
Such notice also shall specify the date as of which it is expected that holders
of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for
shares of stock or other securities or property or cash deliverable upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up.

(j) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep
available for issuance upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock, such
number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock as will from time
to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of
Series E Preferred Stock, and shall take all action required to increase 

-27-

<PAGE>
the authorized number of shares of Common Stock if at any time there shall be
insufficient authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to permit such
reservation or to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock.

(k) The Corporation shall not adopt a shareholders right
plan, "poison pill" or similar arrangement unless such plan or arrangement shall
provide that (i) each holder of a share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive thereunder, upon conversion of a share of Series E Preferred
Stock (in accordance with the terms hereof) prior to the earlier to occur of
either the date of redemption of the rights issued under such plan or the date
of expiration of the rights issued under such plan, rights for each share of
Common Stock issued upon conversion of such share of Series E Preferred Stock in
an amount equal to the amount of rights issued with respect to each outstanding
share of Common Stock pursuant to such plan and (ii) if such rights are redeemed
prior to the conversion of any share of Series E Preferred Stock into Common
Stock, then upon conversion of such share of Series E Preferred Stock the holder
thereof shall receive an amount in cash equal to the amount in cash that such
holder would have received had he converted such share of Series E Preferred
Stock prior to such redemption (unless prior to such conversion the Conversion
Price applicable to such share of Series E Preferred Stock shall have been
adjusted pursuant to Section 10(d)(iii) as a result of such redemption).

(1) The issuance or delivery of certificates for Common
Stock upon the conversion of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be made
without charge to the converting holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
for such certificates or for any tax in respect of the issuance or delivery of
such certificates or the securities represented thereby, and such certificates
shall be issued or delivered in the respective names of, or in such names as may
be directed by, the holders of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock converted;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax
- - -------- -------
that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and
delivery of any such certificate in a name other than that of the holder of the
shares of Series E Preferred Stock converted, and the Corporation shall not be
required to issue or deliver such certificate unless or until the Person or
Persons requesting the issuance or delivery thereof shall have paid to the
Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.

Section 11. Exchange.
--------

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 11, the
Corporation shall have the right, with the consent of the holders of all of the
outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock (which consent may be withheld
for any reason whatsoever), at any time but on only one occasion, to exchange
all (but not less than all) of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock for
Convertible Subordinated Notes of the Corporation ("Convertible Notes"), at a
price per share equal to the Liquidation Preference per share, with the
Convertible Notes valued for such purpose at their face value. Simultaneously
with such exchange the Corporation shall pay to each holder of Series E
Preferred Stock an amount per share in cash equal to all accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon, whether or not declared or currently payable, to the date
fixed for exchange thereof. The Convertible Notes shall have an annual
interest rate equal to the annual dividend rate on Series E Preferred Stock and
shall contain other terms substantially similar to the Series E Preferred Stock,
including the date of maturity thereof and the right to convert such notes into
shares of Common Stock.

(b) Notice of an exchange of shares of Series E Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 11(a) shall be given by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such
publication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation or securities
exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more than 60, days prior to the
date fixed for exchange; and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at
least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the date fixed for exchange to
each holder at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the
Corporation. In order to facilitate the exchange of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock hereunder the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be exchanged, or may
cause the transfer books of the Corporation for the Series E Preferred Stock to
be closed, not more than 60 days or less than 30 days prior to the date fixed
for exchange.

(c) On the date of any exchange being made pursuant to
Section 11(a) that is specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 11(b), the
Corporation shall, and at any time after the date that is 10 days prior to the
date of exchange the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be exchanged (i) the Convertible Notes
necessary for such exchange and (ii) an amount in cash equal to all dividends
payable with respect thereto upon such exchange with a bank or trust company in
the 

-29-

<PAGE>
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well capitalized" within
the meaning of the applicable banking regulations and having a capital and
surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any Convertible Notes so deposited by the
Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for
such exchange shall revert to the Corporation. After such reversion, any such
bank or trust company shall, upon demand, return to the Corporation such
unclaimed Convertible Notes and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be
relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock to be exchanged shall look only to the Corporation for
the delivery of the Convertible Notes. In the event that Convertible Notes and
moneys are deposited pursuant to this Section 11(c) in respect of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock that are converted in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10, such Convertible Notes and moneys shall, upon such conversion,
revert to the Corporation and, upon demand, such bank or trust company shall
return to the Corporation such Convertible Notes and moneys and shall be
relieved of all responsibilities to the holders of such converted shares in re-
spect thereof. Any interest accrued on Convertible Notes deposited pursuant to
this Section 11(c) shall accrue for the accounts of, and be payable to, the
holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be exchanged therefor.

(d) Notice of exchange having been given as aforesaid and
not having been deemed terminated as aforesaid, upon the deposit of Convertible
Notes pursuant to clause (i) of Section 11(c) and the deposit of the cash
referred to in clause (ii) of Section 11(c) in respect of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock to be exchanged pursuant to Section 11(a), notwithstanding that
any certificates for such shares shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, from and after the date of exchange designated in the notice of
exchange (i) the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed
outstanding, (ii) the rights to receive dividends thereon (except as provided in
paragraph (b) above) shall cease to accrue, and (iii) all rights of the holders
of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be exchanged shall cease and terminate,
excepting only the right to receive the Convertible Notes therefor, the right to
receive the dividends described in paragraph (b) above and the right to convert
such shares into shares of Common Stock until the close of business on the
Business Day preceding the date of exchange, in accordance with Section 10;
provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the execution and
- - -------- -------
delivery of the Convertible Notes, the shares of Series E Preferred Stock that
were to be exchanged shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the
holders thereof shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series E Preferred
Stock until 

-30-

<PAGE>

such time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall have been
waived by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock.

Section 12. Sinking Fund.
-------------

(a) So long as any shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, the Corporation shall, on the final business day (any such date,
the "Sinking Fund Date") of each calendar year after 2003, (i) set aside a sum
of money equal to 3-1/3% of the aggregate liquidation preference of the shares
of Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding, and (ii) apply such money to
redeem such number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock at the Sinking Fund
Redemption Price (the Corporation's obligations described in this paragraph in
respect of any Sinking Fund Date being hereinafter referred to as the "Sinking
Fund Obligation" for such date) at a price per share (the "Sinking Fund
Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) the Liquidation Preference of such
share and (B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon, whether or not declared or payable, to the applicable Sinking Fund
Date, in immediately available funds; provided, however, that if the Corporation
-------- -------
for any reason fails to discharge its Sinking Fund Obligation on any Sinking
Fund Date, such Sinking Fund Obligation, to the extent not discharged, shall
become an additional Sinking Fund Obligation for each succeeding Sinking Fund
Date until fully discharged; provided, further, that no shares of Series E
-------- -------
Preferred Stock purchased or acquired by the Corporation otherwise than through
redemption pursuant to this paragraph or pursuant to an Optional Redemption may
be credited against the Sinking Fund Obligation in respect of any Sinking Fund
Date.

(b) The shares to be redeemed pursuant to paragraph (a)
shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be) so that the number of shares
redeemed from each holder shall be the same proportion of all the shares to be
redeemed that the total number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock then held
by such holder bears to the total number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
then outstanding.

(c) Notice of the Sinking Fund Redemption shall be given by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by applicable law,
rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more
than 60, days prior to the Sinking Fund Date and, in any case, a similar notice
shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the Sinking
Fund Date to each holder of 

-31-

<PAGE>

shares of Series E Preferred Stock, at such holder's address as it appears on
the transfer books of the Corporation.

(d) On the Sinking Fund Date, the Corporation shall, and at
any time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Sinking Fund
Date the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or
trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well
capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable banking regulations and having
a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited by the
Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for
such redemption shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the

<PAGE>

Series F Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared
by the Board of Directors, out of the assets of the Corporation at the time
legally available therefor, a cumulative cash dividend in respect of each share

such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date divided by (B) 360. No interest shall be
payable in respect of any dividend payment on the Series F Preferred Stock that

(b) If (i) a private placement or public offering of the

shall receive at least $100,000,000 in gross proceeds is not consummated within
360 days after the termination of the Merger Agreement or (ii) the annual

the case may be, at which time the annual rate of the cumulative cash dividends
shall be reduced to a rate of 9.75%, subject to being increased to a rate of
11.75% in the event of each and every subsequent event of the character
indicated above.

(c) Dividends payable pursuant to Section 2(a) shall begin

basis, in each case whether or not declared. Dividends paid on the shares of
Series F Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such
dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro
rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares of Series F Preferred Stock
at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock entitled to
receive payment of a dividend declared thereon, which record date shall be not
more than 60 days nor less than 10 days prior to the date fixed for the payment
thereof. Accumulated but unpaid dividends for any past quarterly dividend
periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any regular
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on such date, not more
than 60 nor less than 10 days preceding the payment date thereof, as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors.

(d) The holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall
not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions except as

-------- -------
separate vote of the holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall be required to
effect any of the transactions described in clause (iii) above unless such
transaction would either require a class vote pursuant to clause (i) or (ii)
above or would require a vote by any shareholders of the Corporation (other than
pursuant to this sentence); provided further, that no separate vote of the
-------- -------
holders of the Series F Preferred Stock as a class shall be required in the case
of a recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or merger of, or sale by,
the Corporation if (A) (a) such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation,
merger or sale constitutes a Specified Corporate Action, (b) the Corporation has
sufficient funds legally available to it (after giving effect to such
transaction) to redeem, at the then applicable price hereunder and pursuant to
the terms hereof, all the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock, (c)
such redemption shall not be prohibited by any agreement to which the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, by applicable law or
otherwise, (d) the Board of Directors of the Corporation, including a majority
of the directors who are not officers or employees of the Corporation, shall
have adopted a resolution confirming that such funds are available and that
the holders of Series F Preferred Stock have the right to require such
redemption and (e) the Corporation shall have set aside sufficient
funds through the Specified Corporation Action Redemption Date to redeem the
shares of Series F Preferred Stock held by such holders (except that no funds
need be set aside with respect to such shares held by any such holder who has
theretofore notified the Corporation (whether pursuant to Section 6(a)(iii) or
otherwise) that it will not require redemption of such shares) or (B) (1) the
Corporation shall be the resulting or surviving corporation, (2) the resulting
or surviving corporation will have after such recapitalization, reorganization,
consolidation or merger no Senior Stock or Parity Stock either authorized or
outstanding (except such Parity Stock of the Corporation as may have been
authorized or outstanding immediately preceding such consolidation or merger) or
such stock of the resulting or surviving corporation (having the same powers,
preferences and special rights of any such Parity Stock) as may be issued in
exchange therefor), (3) each holder of shares of Series F Preferred Stock
immediately preceding such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or
merger will receive in exchange therefor the same number of shares of stock,
with the same preferences, rights and powers, 

-36-

<PAGE>
of the resulting or surviving corporation, (4) after such recapitalization,
reorganization, consolidation or merger the resulting or surviving corporation
shall not be in breach of any of the terms hereof, any of the Material
Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or any of its material obliga-
tions under the Registration Rights Agreement and (5) all or substantially all
the holders of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
immediately prior to such consolidation or merger are entitled to receive shares
representing 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the

directors.

(b) If on any date (i) the Corporation shall have failed to
declare, or shall have failed to pay, the full amount of dividends payable on
any series of Chicago Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods or (ii)
a breach of any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement
or any of the Corporation's material obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement shall have occurred, then the number of directors constituting the
Board of Directors shall, without further action, be increased by two and the
holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall have, in addition to the
other voting rights set forth herein with respect to the Series F Preferred
Stock, the exclusive right, together with the holders of all other series of
Chicago Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class together with the
holders of such other series of Chicago Preferred Stock, to elect two directors
of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorship, by written consent
as provided herein, or at a special meeting of such holders called as provided
herein. Any such additional directors shall continue as directors (subject to
reelection or removal as provided in Section 3(c)(ii)) and the holders of
Series F Preferred Stock shall have such additional voting rights
until such time as (A) dividends then payable on all series of Chicago Preferred
Stock shall have been declared and paid in full and (B) there shall exist no
breach of any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or
any of the Corporation's material obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement, as the case may be, at which time such additional directors shall
cease to be directors, the number of directors constituting the Board of Di-
rectors shall be reduced by two and such additional voting rights of the holders
of all series of Chicago Preferred Stock shall terminate, subject to revesting
in the event of each and every subsequent event of the character indicated
above.

(c) (i) The foregoing right of holders of shares of Series
F Preferred Stock to take any action as provided in 

-37-

<PAGE>
Section 3(b) may be exercised at any annual meeting of stockholders or at a
special meeting of holders of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, held for such
purpose as hereinafter provided or at any adjournment thereof, or by the written
consent, delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, of the holders of the
minimum number of shares required to take such action.

So long as such right to vote continues (and unless such
right has been exercised by written consent of the minimum number of shares
required to take such action), the President of the Corporation may call, and
upon the written request of holders of record of at least 5% of the aggregate
outstanding shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, addressed to the Secretary of the
Corporation at the principal office of the Corporation, shall call, a special
meeting of the holders of shares entitled to vote as provided herein. Such
meeting shall be held within 30 days after delivery of such request to the
Secretary, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the by-laws
of the Corporation for the holding of meetings of stockholders.

(ii) At each meeting of stockholders at which the holders of
shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a
single class together with the holders of all other series of Chicago Preferred
Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation as provided in Section 3(b) or
to take any action, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record
of one-third of the total aggregate number of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock
then outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter shall be necessary and
sufficient to constitute a quorum. At any such meeting or at any adjournment
thereof:

(A) the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of
Chicago Preferred Stock shall not prevent the election of
directors other than those to be elected by the holders of shares
of Chicago Preferred Stock, and the absence of a quorum of the
holders of shares of any other class or series of capital stock
shall not prevent the election of directors to be elected by the
holders of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, or the taking of
any action as provided in Section 3(b); and

(B) in the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of
Chicago Preferred Stock, a majority of the holders of such shares
present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the
meeting as to the actions to be taken by the holders of shares of
Chicago Preferred Stock, from time to time and place to place
without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a
quorum shall be present.

-38-

<PAGE>
For taking of any action as provided in Section 3(a) or
Section 3(b) by the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, each such
holder shall have one vote for each share of such stock standing in his name on
the transfer books of the Corporation as of any record date fixed for such
purpose or, if no such date be fixed, at the close of business on the Business
Day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held; provided, however, that shares of Chicago Preferred Stock held
-------- -------
by the Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Corporation shall not be deemed to
be outstanding for purposes of taking any action as provided in this Section 3.

Each director elected by the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, as provided in Section 3(b) shall, unless his term shall expire
earlier in accordance with the provisions thereof, hold office until the annual
meeting of stockholders next succeeding his election or until his successor,
if any, is elected and qualified.

If any director so elected by the holders of Chicago Pre-
ferred Stock shall cease to serve as a director before his term shall expire
(except by reason of the termination of the voting rights accorded to the
holders of Chicago Preferred Stock, in accordance with Section 3(b)), the
holders of the Chicago Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote for
such director may, by written consent as provided herein, or at a special
meeting of such holders called as provided herein, elect a successor to hold
office for the unexpired term of the director whose place shall be vacant.

Any director elected by the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, may be removed from office
with or without cause only by the vote or written consent of the holders of at
least a majority of the aggregate outstanding shares of Chicago Preferred Stock
at the time of removal. A special meeting of the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, may be called in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 3(c)(i).

chase, or otherwise acquire shares of Series F Preferred Stock and shares of
such Parity Stock.

(d) The Corporation shall not permit any Subsidiary of the

consideration any shares of capital stock of the Corporation unless the
Corporation could, pursuant to Section 4(c), purchase such shares at such time
and in such manner.

December 30, 2003 to 100.925%
December 29, 2004

December 30, 2004 and 100%
thereafter

(ii) If the Corporation shall have the right to, or shall
determine to, redeem less than all the shares of Series F Preferred Stock then
outstanding pursuant to paragraph (i), the shares to be redeemed shall be
selected pro rata (as nearly as may be) so that the number of shares redeemed
from each holder 

-41-

<PAGE>
shall be the same proportion of all the shares to be redeemed that the total
number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock then held by such holder bears to
the total number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock then outstanding.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any shares of Series F
Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section 5(a) at any time when the
holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock have the right to require the
Corporation to redeem the shares of Series F Preferred Stock pursuant to Section
6 or an event giving rise to such a right has occurred shall be redeemed at a
price equal to higher of the price to be paid pursuant to Section 5(a) and the

(b) Notice of any Optional Redemption shall specify the
Optional Redemption Date fixed for redemption, the Optional Redemption Price,
the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and
surrender of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock and that on and after the
date of such Optional Redemption dividends will cease to accrue on such shares
and be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough
of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by
applicable law, rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), not less
than 30, nor more than 45, days prior to the Optional Redemption Date; and, in
any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 45,
days prior to the Optional Redemption Date to each holder of shares of Series F
Preferred Stock, at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of
the Corporation. In order to facilitate the redemption of shares of Series F
Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed, or may cause
the transfer books of the Corporation for the Series F Preferred Stock to be
closed, not more than 60 days or less than 45 days prior to the Optional
Redemption Date.

(c) On the date of any Optional Redemption that is
specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 5(b), the Corporation shall, and
at any time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Optional
Redemption Date the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Series F Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with
a bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that
is "well capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable bank regulations and
having a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited
by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the Optional
Redemption Date shall revert to the 

-42-

<PAGE>

general funds of the Corporation. After such reversion, any such bank or trust
company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts
and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility
in respect thereof and any holder of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be
redeemed shall look only to the Corporation for the payment of the Optional Re-
demption Price. Any interest accrued on funds deposited pursuant to this
Section 5(c) shall be paid from time to time to the Corporation for its own
account.

(d) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 5(c) in respect of shares of
Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 5(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Optional Redemption Date (i)
the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding, (ii) the
rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue, and (iii) all rights
of the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall cease
and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Optional Redemption Price
therefor; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the
-------- -------
payment of the Optional Redemption Price, the shares of Series F Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have
all of the rights of a holder of Series F Preferred Stock until such time as
such default or failure shall no longer be continuing or shall have been waived
by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series F Pre-
ferred Stock.

(e) Any notice that is mailed as herein provided shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of
shares of Series F Preferred Stock receives such notice, and failure to give
such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice, to the holders of any shares
designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any other shares of Series F Preferred Stock. On or after the
Optional Redemption Date fixed for redemption as stated in such notice, each
holder of the shares called for redemption shall surrender the certificate
evidencing such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice
and shall thereupon be entitled to receive payment of the Optional Redemption
Price. If less than all the shares evidenced by any such surrendered
certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued evidencing the
unredeemed shares.

Amount for the purposes of such Specified Corporate Action Redemption shall be
the highest price per share of Common Stock paid by any acquiror in such Control
Transaction); provided, further, that, upon the request of a holder, the Board

of Directors shall agree to extend the date of redemption in respect of any such
Specified Corporate Action (without changing the consideration that is otherwise
payable in respect of such redemption other than with respect to adjustments to
the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends included in such redemption price) to
the extent necessary for any holder of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to
avoid liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, provided that no such
--------
redemption extension shall be for a period greater than six months. The
Corporation shall, within 5 days of the occurrence of a Specified Corporate
Action (or, in the case of a Specified Corporate Action described in clause
(iii) of the definition of "Specified Corporate Action," within 5 days of the
date on which the Corporation obtains actual knowledge of such Specified Corpo-
rate Action), give notice thereof by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such pub-
lication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation or securities
exchange requirement), and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed to
each holder of shares of the Series F Preferred Stock, at such holder's address
as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation. Each such notice shall
specify the Specified Corporate Action that has occurred and the date of such
occurrence, the place or places of payment, the then effective Specified
Corporate Action Redemption Price and the date the right of such holder to
require a Specified Corporate Action Redemption shall terminate.

(iii) If the notice sent by the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6(a)(ii) shall contain (i) a form inquiring as to whether a holder of
shares of Series F Preferred Stock intends to surrender the certificate(s)
representing such shares for redemption pursuant to this Section 6(a) and (ii) a
stamped self-addressed envelope for return of such form to the Corporation or
its designee, within ten Business Days of such notice, each holder shall return
such inquiry form to the Corporation and shall indicate in such form the
proportion of such holder's shares of Series F Preferred Stock that will be
surrendered for redemption pursuant to this Section 6(a). If 

-45-

<PAGE>
such notice shall indicate that if a holder does not respond prior to ten
Business Days after the date of such notice that such holder will be deemed to
have notified the Corporation that it will not require the redemption of the
shares of Series F Preferred Stock held by such holder for purposes of Section
3(b) and such holder does not respond to the Corporation's inquiry prior to ten
Business Days after the date of such notice, such holder will be deemed to have
notified the Corporation that it will not require the redemption of the shares
of Series F Preferred Stock held by such holder for purposes of Section 3(b). 
Nothing contained in this Section 6(a)(iii) shall affect the right of a holder
of Series F Preferred Stock to require the Corporation to redeem such shares
pursuant to Section 6(a)(i).

(b) (i) If at any time the Additional Amount is greater
than 0, then each holder of shares of the Series F Preferred Stock shall have
the right, at such holder's option exercisable at any time (such time, the
"Conversion Date") on 30 days' notice to the Corporation, to require the
Corporation to redeem (a "Conversion Redemption") all or any part of the shares
of Series F Preferred Stock then held by such holder at a price per share (the
"Conversion Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the Liquidation
Preference of such shares, (B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and
unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared or payable, to the applicable
Conversion Redemption Date and (C) the Additional Amount, in immediately
available funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the redemption of any
portion of such shares occurs during the first two years following the Issue
Date or would in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Corporation have
a material adverse effect on the Corporation, then the Corporation may elect to
deliver with respect to such shares, in lieu of cash, notes, including
subordinated notes, of the Corporation ("Notes") (x) having a final maturity
date no later than ten years from the date of issuance, and (y) having such
other terms and conditions as shall result in a determination that such Notes
have a fair market value as of the date of their proposed issuance at least
equal to the sum of (1) the Conversion Redemption Price with respect to such
shares and (2) customary underwriting discounts and commissions payable with
respect to the sale of securities of a type comparable to the Notes, or shares
of nonconvertible preferred stock ("Redemption Preferred Stock") having the
terms and conditions described in clauses (x) and (y) in lieu of Notes. The
Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause the Notes or the Redemption
Preferred Stock to be registered for immediate resale pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act prior to the issuance thereof. 
If such registration statement is not effective within 120 days of 

-46-

<PAGE>

the date of such issuance then the annual interest rate of the Notes or the
annual dividend rate of the Redemption Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be
increased by 0.5% per annum until such securities are sold pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act. For purposes of this
Section 6(b), "fair market value" shall mean the fair market value of the Notes
or Redemption Preferred Stock, as the case may be, as determined by an
investment banking firm of national standing selected by the Corporation and
reasonably acceptable to the holders of a majority of the shares of Series F
Preferred Stock electing to effect such Conversion Redemption. In the case that
the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver either Notes or Redemption
Preferred Stock, it shall be the election of the Corporation whether to deliver
such Notes or Redemption Preferred Stock, except that, if, the sale of the
security to be delivered by the Corporation to effect a Conversion Redemption
would give rise to an additional liability on the part of such holder upon the
sale thereof and it shall so notify the Corporation in writing, the Corporation
shall deliver to such holder the other type of security specified in such
notice.

(c) Each holder of shares of the Series F Preferred Stock
shall have the right, at such holder's option exercisable at any time on 30
days' notice to the Corporation on or after December 30, 2009 (the date of any
such exercise, the "Special Redemption Date"), to require the Corporation to
redeem (a "Special Redemption") all or any part of the shares of Series F
Preferred Stock then held by such holder as such holder may elect by written
notice delivered at least 30 days prior to the Special Redemption Date at a
price per share equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the Liquidation Preference of
such share, (B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon whether or not declared or payable to the Special Redemption Date and
(C) the Additional Amount, determined as of the date immediately prior to the
Special Redemption Date (the "Special Redemption Price") in immediately
available funds.

(d) On the date fixed for any Specified Corporate Action
Redemption or on any Conversion Redemption Date or Special Redemption Date, each
holder of shares of Series F Preferred Stock who elects to have shares of Series
F Preferred Stock held by it redeemed shall surrender the certificate
representing such shares to the Corporation (i) at the place designated in such
notice in the case of a Specified Corporate Action Redemption or (ii) at the
Corporation's principal place of business to be maintained by it, in the case of
a Conversion Redemption or Special Redemption, together with an election to have
such redemption made and shall thereupon be entitled to receive payment therefor
provided in this Section 6. If less 

-47-

<PAGE>
than all the shares represented by any such surrendered certificate are
redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. 
From and after the date of such redemption (i) the rights to receive dividends
thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of the holders of shares of
Series F Preferred Stock so redeemed shall cease and terminate, excepting only
the right to receive the Specified Corporate Action Redemption Price or
Conversion Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price therefor, as applicable;
provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the
- - -------- -------
applicable redemption price the shares of Series F Preferred Stock that were to
be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof
shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series F Preferred Stock until such
time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall have been waived by
holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series F Preferred
Stock.

Section 7. Redemption Upon Maturity.
------------------------

(a) On December 30, 2034 (the "Maturity Date"), the
Corporation shall redeem (the "Maturity Redemption") the remaining outstanding
shares of the Series F Preferred Stock at a price per share (the "Maturity
Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the Liquidation Preference
per share, (B) an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether
or not declared or payable, to the Maturity Date and (C) the Additional Amount,
determined as of the date immediately prior to the Maturity Date, in immediately
available funds.

(b) Notice of the Maturity Redemption shall be given by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by applicable law,
rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more
than 60, days prior to the Maturity Date and, in any case, a similar notice
shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the Maturity
Date to each holder of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, at such holder's
address as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation.

(c) On the Maturity Date, the Corporation shall, and at any
time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Maturity Date the
Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series F
Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or trust
company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well
capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable banking regulations and having
a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited by the
Corporation and 

-48-

<PAGE>

unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for such redemption
shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After such reversion, any
such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such
unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of
all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of shares of Series F
Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the Corporation for the
payment of the Maturity Redemption Price. Any interest accrued and unpaid on
funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be paid from time to time to
the Corporation for its own account.

(d) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 7(c) in respect of shares of
Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 7(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Maturity Date, (i) the rights
to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of the
holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate,
excepting only the right to receive the Maturity Redemption Price therefor;
provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the
- - -------- -------
Maturity Redemption Price, the shares of Series F Preferred Stock that were to
be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof
shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series F Preferred Stock until such
time as such default shall no longer be continuing.

Section 8. Acquired Shares.
---------------

Any shares of Series F Preferred Stock exchanged, redeemed,
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in
any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the
acquisition thereof. All such shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall upon
their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, par
value $4.00 per share, of the Corporation and, upon the filing of an appropriate
certificate with the Department of State of the State of New York, may be
reissued as part of another series of preferred stock, par value $4.00 per
share, of the Corporation subject to the conditions or restrictions on issuance
set forth herein, but in any event may not be reissued as shares of Series F
Preferred Stock or Parity Stock unless all of the shares of Series F Preferred
Stock issued on the Issue Date shall have already been redeemed or exchanged.

<PAGE>
Section 9. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
--------------------------------------

(a) If the Corporation shall commence a voluntary case
under the United States bankruptcy laws or any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar law of any other country, or consent to the entry of an order for
relief in an involuntary case under any such law or to the appointment of a
receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other
similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property,
or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or admit in writing its
inability to pay its debts generally as they become due (any such event, a
"Voluntary Liquidation Event"), or if a decree or order for relief in respect of
the Corporation shall be entered by a court having jurisdiction in the premises
in an involuntary case under the United States bankruptcy laws or any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law of any other country, or appointing a
receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other
similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property,
or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and on account of any
such event the Corporation shall liquidate, dissolve or wind up, or if the
Corporation shall otherwise liquidate, dissolve or wind up, no distribution
shall be made (i) to the holders of shares of Junior Stock unless, prior
thereto, the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall have received
(A) if a Voluntary Liquidation Event shall have occurred, the Optional Redemp-
tion Price with respect to each share and (B) if a Voluntary Liquidation Event
shall not have occurred, the Liquidation Preference and all accrued and unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared or currently payable, to the date of
distribution, with respect to each share, or (ii) to the holders of shares of
Parity Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series F Preferred Stock
and all Parity Stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of
all shares of the Series F Preferred Stock (which amounts are set forth in
clauses (A) and (B) above) and Parity Stock are entitled upon such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up.

(b) Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation
with or into any other Person nor the sale or transfer of all or any part of the
Corporation's assets for cash, securities or other property shall be deemed to
be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation for purposes of
this Section 9.

Section 10. Exchange.
--------

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, the
Corporation shall have the right, with the consent of the holders of all of the
outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock (which consent may be withheld
for any reason whatsoever), at any time but on only one occasion, to exchange
all (but not less than all) of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock for
Subordinated Notes of the Corporation ("Subordinated Notes"), at a price per
share equal to the Liquidation Preference per share, with the Subordinated Notes
valued for such purpose at their face value. Simultaneously with such exchange
the Corporation shall pay to each holder of Series F Preferred Stock an amount
per share in cash equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or
not declared or currently payable, to the date fixed for exchange thereof. The
Subordinated Notes shall have an annual interest rate equal to the annual
dividend rate on Series F Preferred Stock and shall contain other terms
substantially similar to the Series F Preferred Stock, including the date of
maturity thereof.

(b) Notice of an exchange of shares of Series F Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 10(a) shall be given by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such
publication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation or securities
exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more than 60, days prior to the
date fixed for exchange; and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at
least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the date fixed for exchange to
each holder at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the
Corporation. In order to facilitate the exchange of shares of Series F
Preferred Stock hereunder the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be exchanged, or may
cause the transfer books of the Corporation for the Series F Preferred Stock to
be closed, not more than 60 days or less than 30 days prior to the date fixed
for exchange.

(c) On the date of any exchange being made pursuant to
Section 10(a) that is specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 10(b), the
Corporation shall, and at any time after the date that is 10 days prior to the
date of exchange the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be exchanged (i) the Subordinated Notes
necessary for such exchange and (ii) an amount in cash equal to all dividends
payable with respect thereto upon such exchange with a bank or trust company in
the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well capitalized"
within the meaning of the applicable banking 

-51-

<PAGE>
regulations and having a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any
Subordinated Notes so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of
two years from the date designated for such exchange shall revert to the Corpo-
ration. After such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon
demand, return to the Corporation such unclaimed Subordinated Notes and
thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in
respect thereof and any holder of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be ex-
changed shall look only to the Corporation for the delivery of the Subordinated
Notes. Any interest accrued on Subordinated Notes deposited pursuant to this
Section 10(c) shall accrue for the accounts of, and be payable to, the holders
of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be exchanged therefor.

(d) Notice of exchange having been given as aforesaid and
not having been deemed terminated as aforesaid, upon the deposit of Subordinated
Notes pursuant to clause (i) of Section 10(c) and the deposit of the cash
referred to in clause (ii) of Section 10(c) in respect of shares of Series F
Preferred Stock to be exchanged pursuant to Section 10(a), notwithstanding that
any certificates for such shares shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, from and after the date of exchange designated in the notice of
exchange (i) the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed
outstanding, (ii) the rights to receive dividends thereon (except as provided in
paragraph (b) above) shall cease to accrue, and (iii) all rights of the holders
of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be exchanged shall cease and terminate,
excepting only the right to receive the Subordinated Notes therefor and the
right to receive the dividends described in paragraph (b) above; provided,
--------
however, that if the Corporation shall default in the execution and delivery of
- - -------
the Convertible Notes, the shares of Series F Preferred Stock that were to be
exchanged shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof
shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series F Preferred Stock until such
time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall have been waived by
holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series F Preferred
Stock.

Section 11. Additional Amount.
-----------------

(a) For the purposes of this Article 2, "Additional Amount"
shall mean an amount per share equal to the product of (i) the excess of the sum
of (1) the Market Price of a share of Common Stock and (2) if the Corporation
shall have issued a right or rights with respect to its outstanding shares of
Common Stock pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement, during the period commencing on 

-52-

<PAGE>

the "distribution date" of such right or rights (i.e., the date on which such
----
right or rights commence to trade separately from the Common Stock) and ending
on the "triggering date" of such right or rights (i.e., the date on which such
----
right or rights commence to be exercisable), the Market Price of such right or
rights over the Conversion Amount, in effect as hereinafter determined and (ii)
(x) the Liquidation Preference divided by (y) such Conversion Amount, in all
cases calculated as of the applicable determination date. The Additional Amount
shall in no event be less than zero. The Conversion Amount initially shall be
$15.75, and shall thereafter be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section
11(b). For the purpose of calculating the Additional Amount in connection with
an Optional Redemption, Specified Corporate Action Redemption, Special
Redemption or Conversion Redemption, except as otherwise set forth in Section
6(a)(ii), the Market Price of the Common Stock and, if applicable, rights shall
be the average of the Market Price of such securities on the five trading days
immediately preceding and the five trading days immediately following the date
of notice of such redemption.

(b) The Conversion Amount shall be subject to adjustment as
follows:

(i) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding shares
of Common Stock in Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment
plan approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors), (B) subdivide the out-
standing shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (C) combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (D) issue
any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock, then,
and in each such case, the Conversion Amount in effect immediately prior to such
event shall be adjusted so that if the holder of any share of Series F Preferred
Stock were entitled to convert such share into such number of shares of Common
Stock as equals the Liquidation Preference divided by the Conversion Amount and
such holder thereafter surrendered such share for conversion, such holder would
be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities
of the Corporation that such holder would have owned or would have been entitled
to receive upon or by reason of any of the events described above had such share
of Series F Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior to the occurrence
of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 11(b)(i) shall
become effective retroactively (A) in the case of any such dividend or distri-
bution, to the opening of business on the day immediately following the close of
business on the record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to 

-53-

<PAGE>
receive such dividend or distribution or (B) in the case of any such
subdivision, combination or reclassification, to the close of business on the
day upon which such corporate action becomes effective.

(ii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time issue or sell shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or any options, warrants or
other rights to acquire shares of Common Stock (other than options granted to
any employee or director of the Corporation pursuant to a stock option plan
approved by the shareholders of the Corporation)) for a consideration per share
less than the Conversion Amount then in effect at the record date or issuance
date, as the case may be (the "Date") referred to in the following sentence,
including, without limitation, upon exercise of rights issued pursuant to a
shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar arrangement (treating the
price per share of any security convertible or exchangeable or exercisable into
Common Stock as equal to (A) the sum of the price for such security convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock plus any additional consideration
payable (without regard to any antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion,
exchange or exercise of such security into Common Stock divided by (B) the
number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying such convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable security), other than issuances or sales for which
an adjustment is made pursuant to another paragraph of this Section 11(b), then,
and in each such case, the Conversion Amount then in effect shall be adjusted by
dividing the Conversion Amount in effect on the day immediately prior to the
Date by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Date plus the number
of additional shares of Common Stock issued or to be issued (or the maximum
number into which such convertible or exchangeable securities initially may
convert or exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights
initially may be exercised) and (y) the denominator of which shall be the sum of
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Date
plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration (if
any of such aggregate consideration is other than cash, as valued by the Board
of Directors including a majority of the Directors who are not officers or
employees of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, which determination
shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) for
the total number of such additional shares of Common Stock so issued (or into
which such convertible or exchangeable securities may convert or exchange or for
which such options, warrants or other rights may be 

-54-

<PAGE>

exercised plus the aggregate amount of any additional consideration initially
payable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such security) would purchase
at the Conversion Amount. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such shares,
securities, options, warrants or other rights are issued, and shall become
effective retroactively to a date immediately following the close of business
(i) in the case of issuance to stockholders of the Corporation, as such, on the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
shares, securities, options, warrants or other rights and (ii) in all other
cases, on the date ("issuance date") of such issuance; provided, however, that
-------- -------
the determination as to whether an adjustment is required to be made pursuant to
this Section 11(b)(ii) shall only be made upon the issuance of such shares or
such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights,
and not upon the issuance of the security into which such convertible or
exchangeable security converts or exchanges, or the security underlying such
option, warrants or other right; provided, further, that if any convertible or
-------- -------
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights (or any portions
thereof) that shall have given rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section
11(b)(ii) shall have expired or terminated without the exercise thereof and/or
if by reason of the terms of such convertible or exchangeable securities,
options, warrants or other rights there shall have been an increase or
increases, with the passage of time or otherwise, in the price payable upon the
exercise or conversion thereof, then the Conversion Amount hereunder shall be
readjusted (but to no greater extent than originally adjusted) on the basis of
(x) eliminating from the computation any additional shares of Common Stock cor-
responding to such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or
other rights as shall have expired or terminated, (y) treating the additional
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or issuable pursuant to the
previous exercise of such convertible or exchangeable securities, options,
warrants or other rights as having been issued for the consideration actually
received and receivable therefor and (z) treating any of such convertible or
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights that remain
outstanding as being subject to exercise or conversion on the basis of such
exercise or conversion price as shall be in effect at the time.

(iii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time distribute to all holders of shares of its Common Stock (including
any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which
the Corporation is the resulting or surviving corporation and the Common Stock
is not changed or exchanged or a redemption of any rights or other securities
issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, 

-55-

<PAGE>
"poison pill" or similar arrangement) cash, evidences of indebtedness of the
Corporation or another issuer, securities of the Corporation or another issuer
or other assets (excluding (A) Permitted Dividends described in clause (B) of
the definition thereof and (B) securities for which adjustment is made under
Section 11(b)(i) or Section 11(b)(ii)), then, and in each such case, the
Conversion Amount then in effect shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion
Amount in effect immediately prior to the date of such distribution by a
fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price of the
Common Stock on the record date referred to below and (y) the denominator of
which shall be such Current Market Price of the Common Stock less the then Fair
Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, which
determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the cash, evidences of
indebtedness, securities or other assets so distributed or of such subscription
rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock (but such denominator
not to be less than one). Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such
distribution is made and shall become effective retroactively to a date im-
mediately following the close of business on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.

(iv) In the case the Corporation at any time or from
time to time shall take any action affecting its Common Stock, other than an
action described in any of Section 11(b)(i) through Section 11(b)(iii),
inclusive, then, the Conversion Amount shall be adjusted in such manner and at
such time as the Board of Directors of the Corporation (other than Purchaser
Designees or directors elected pursuant to Section 3(b)) in good faith
determines to be equitable in the circumstances (such determination to be
evidenced in a resolution, a certified copy of which shall be mailed to the
holders of the Series F Preferred Stock).

(v) The Corporation may make such reductions in the
Conversion Amount, in addition to those required by subparagraphs (i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv) of this Section 11(b), as the Board of Directors considers to be
advisable in order to avoid or to diminish any income tax to holders of Common
Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or
distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as
such for income tax purposes.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section
11(b), no adjustment to the Conversion Amount shall be made with respect to any
rights issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement unless the "triggering date" (i.e., the date on which such rights 
----

-56-

<PAGE>

commence to be exercisable) shall have occurred or such rights shall have been
redeemed, in which event adjustments under clause (ii) and clause (iii),
respectively, shall be made.

(c) If the Corporation shall take a record of the holders
of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or
other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to
stockholders thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or
distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Amount then in
effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.

(d) Upon any increase or decrease in the Conversion Amount,
then, and in each such case, the Corporation promptly shall deliver to each
registered holder of Series F Preferred Stock at least 10 Business Days prior to
effecting any of the foregoing transactions a certificate, signed by the
President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, setting forth in
reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which
such adjustment was calculated and specifying the increased or decreased Con-
version Amount then in effect following such adjustment.

Section 12. Sinking Fund.
-------------

(a) So long as any shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, the Corporation shall, on the final business day (any such date,
the "Sinking Fund Date") of each calendar year after 2003, (i) set aside a sum
of money equal to 3-1/3% of the aggregate liquidation preference of the shares
of Series F Preferred Stock then outstanding, and (ii) apply such money to
redeem such number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock at the Sinking Fund
Redemption Price (the Corporation's obligations described in this paragraph in
respect of any Sinking Fund Date being hereinafter referred to as the "Sinking
Fund Obligation" for such date) at a price per share (the "Sinking Fund
Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) the Liquidation Preference of such
share, (B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon, whether or not declared or payable, to the applicable Sinking Fund Date
and (C) the Additional Amount (as defined in Section 11), determined as of the
date immediately prior to the Sinking Fund Date, in immediately available funds;
provided, however, that if the Corporation for any reason fails to discharge its
- - -------- -------
Sinking Fund Obligation on any Sinking Fund Date, such Sinking Fund Obligation,
to the extent not discharged, shall become an additional Sinking Fund Obligation
for each succeeding Sinking Fund Date until fully discharged; provided, further,
-------- -------
that no 

-57-

<PAGE>
shares of Series F Preferred Stock purchased or acquired by the Corporation
otherwise than through redemption pursuant to this paragraph or pursuant to an
Optional Redemption may be credited against the Sinking Fund Obligation in
respect of any Sinking Fund Date.

(b) Notice of the Sinking Fund Redemption shall be given by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by applicable law,
rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more
than 60, days prior to the Sinking Fund Date and, in any case, a similar notice
shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the Sinking
Fund Date to each holder of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, at such holder's
address as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation.

(c) The shares to be redeemed pursuant to paragraph (a)
shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be) so that the number of shares
redeemed from each holder shall be the same proportion of all the shares to be
redeemed that the total number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock then held
by such holder bears to the total number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock
then outstanding.

(d) On the Sinking Fund Date, the Corporation shall, and at
any time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Sinking Fund
Date the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Series F Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or
trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well
capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable banking regulations and having
a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited by the
Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for
such redemption shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Sinking Fund Redemption Price. Any interest
accrued and unpaid on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 12(c) shall be
paid from time to time to the Corporation for its own account.

(e) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 12(c) in respect of shares of
Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed

-58-
<PAGE>
pursuant to Section 12(a), notwithstanding that any certificates for such
shares shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, from and after the
Sinking Fund Date, (i) the rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to
accrue and (ii) all rights of the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock
shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Sinking Fund
Redemption Price therefor; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall 
-------- -------
default in the payment of the Sinking Fund Redemption Price, the shares of
Series F Preferred Stock that were to be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed
to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have all of the rights of a
holder of Series F Preferred Stock until such time as such default shall no
longer be continuing.

capital stock of the Corporation other than the Other Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of
the assets of the Corporation at the time legally available therefor, cumulative
cash dividends at an annual rate on the Liquidation Preference thereof equal to

a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, accruing and payable in equal
quarterly payments, in immediately available funds, on the Business Day
immediately preceding the last day of March, June, September and December in
each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date") commencing on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of
the issuance of such shares of Series G Preferred Stock; provided, however, that
-------- -------
with respect to such first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date with respect to any
shares of Series G Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Series G Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors, out of the assets of the Corporation at the time legally available
therefor, a cumulative cash dividend in respect of each share of Series G Pre-
ferred Stock in the amount of (i) 9.75% (or the then effective annual rate) of
the Liquidation Preference multiplied by (ii) a fraction equal to (A) the number
of days from (and including) the date of the issuance of such shares of Series G
Preferred Stock to (but excluding) such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date divided
by (B) 360. No interest shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment on
the Series G Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.

(b) If (i) a private placement or public offering of the
New Preferred Stock or the New Senior Notes, pursuant to which the Corporation
shall receive at least $100,000,000 in gross proceeds is not consummated within
360 days after the termination of the Merger Agreement or (ii) the annual
dividend rate on the New Preferred Stock or the annual interest rate on the New

of clause (i), the date that is 360 days after the termination of the Merger

-60-
<PAGE>
Agreement, and (y) in the case of clause (ii) the date of the issuance of the
New Preferred Stock or the New Senior Notes, as applicable. If on any date (A)
all of the Purchaser Designees shall not have been elected to the Corporation's
Board of Directors or any such Purchaser Designees shall not have been appointed
to the committees of the Corporation's Board of Directors, in accordance with
the provisions of Section 6.17 of the Securities Purchase Agreement, (B) the
Corporation shall have failed to declare, or shall have failed to pay, the full
amount of dividends payable on the Series G Preferred Stock for six quarterly
dividend periods, (C) the Corporation shall have failed to satisfy its
obligation to convert shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Article 1,
Section 10 or (D) a breach of any of the Material Provisions of the Securities
Purchase Agreement or any of the Corporation's material obligations under the
Registration Rights Agreement shall have occurred then, effective as of the date
of such failure or breach, the annual rate of the cumulative cash dividends
shall be increased to a rate of 11.75% and shall remain at such rate until such
time as (1) the Purchaser Designees shall have been elected to the Corporation's
Board of Directors and appointed to the committees of the Corporation's Board of
Directors in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.17 of the Securities
Purchase Agreement, (2) all dividends accrued to date on the Series G Preferred
Stock shall have been declared and paid in full, (3) any conversion obligations
in respect of the Chicago Preferred Stock that have become due shall have been
fully satisfied and (4) there shall exist no breach of any of the Material
Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or any of the Corporation's
material obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, as the case may
be, at which time the annual rate of the cumulative cash dividends shall be re-
duced to a rate of 9.75%, subject to being increased to a rate of 11.75% in the
event of each and every subsequent event of the character indicated above.

(c) Dividends payable on a share of Series G Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 2(a) shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from the
date of issuance of such share of Series G Preferred Stock, and shall accrue on
a daily basis, in each case whether or not declared. Dividends paid on the
shares of Series G Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of
such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be
allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares of Series G
Preferred Stock at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record
date for the determination of holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock
entitled to receive payment of a dividend declared thereon, which record date
shall be not more than 60 days nor less than 10 days prior to the date fixed for
the payment

-61-
<PAGE>
thereof. Accumulated but unpaid dividends for any past quarterly
dividend periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any
regular Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on such date, not
more than 60 nor less than 10 days preceding the payment date thereof, as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors.

(d) The holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall
not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions except as
provided herein.

clause (iii) above unless such transaction would either require a class vote
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above or would require a vote by any shareholders
of the Corporation (other than pursuant to this sentence); provided further,
-------- -------
that no separate vote of the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock as a class
shall be required in the case of a recapitalization, reorganization,
consolidation or merger of, or sale by, the Corporation if (A) (a) such
recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger or sale constitutes a
Specified Corporate Action, (b) the Corporation has sufficient funds legally
available to it (after giving effect to such transaction) to redeem, at the then
applicable price hereunder and pursuant to the terms

-62-
<PAGE>
hereof, all the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock, (c) such
redemption shall not be prohibited by any agreement to which the Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, by applicable law or otherwise, (d) the
Board of Directors of the Corporation, including a majority of the directors

resolution confirming that such funds are available and that the holders of
Series G Preferred Stock have the right to require such redemption and (e)
the Corporation shall have set aside sufficient funds through the Specified
Corporation Action Redemption Date to redeem the shares of Series G Preferred
Stock held by such holders (except that no funds need be set aside with respect
to such shares held by any such holder who has theretofore notified the
Corporation (whether pursuant to Section 6(a)(iii) or otherwise) that it will
not require redemption of such shares) or (B) (1) the Corporation shall be the
resulting or surviving corporation, (2) the resulting or surviving corporation
will have after such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or merger
no Senior Stock or Parity Stock either authorized or outstanding (except such
Parity Stock of the Corporation as may have been authorized or outstanding
immediately preceding such consolidation or merger) or such stock of the
resulting or surviving corporation (having the same powers, preferences and
special rights of any such Parity Stock) as may be issued in
exchange therefor), (3) each holder of shares of Series G Preferred Stock
immediately preceding such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or
merger will receive in exchange therefor the same number of shares of stock,
with the same preferences, rights and powers, of the resulting or surviving
corporation, (4) after such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or
merger the resulting or surviving corporation shall not be in breach of any of
the terms hereof, any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase
Agreement or any of its material obligations under the Registration Rights

of capital stock of the Corporation immediately prior to such consolidation or

any series of Chicago Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods or (ii)
a breach of any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement
or any of the Corporation's material obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement shall have occurred, then the number of directors constituting the
Board of Directors shall, without

-63-
<PAGE>
further action, be increased by two and the holders of shares of Series G
Preferred Stock shall have, in addition to the other voting rights set forth
herein with respect to the Series G Preferred Stock, the exclusive right,
together with the holders of all other series of Chicago Preferred Stock
voting separately as a single class together with the holders of such other
series of Chicago Preferred Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation
to fill such newly created directorship, by written consent as provided herein,
or at a special meeting of such holders called as provided herein. Any such
additional directors shall continue as directors (subject to reelection or
removal as provided in Section 3(c)(ii)) and the holders of Series
G Preferred Stock shall have such additional voting rights until such time as
(A) dividends then payable on all series of Chicago Preferred Stock shall have
been declared and paid in full and (B) there shall exist no breach of any of the
Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or any of the
Corporation's material obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, as

directors, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be
reduced by two and such additional voting rights of the holders of all series of
Chicago Preferred Stock shall terminate, subject to revesting in the event of
each and every subsequent event of the character indicated above.

(c) (i) The foregoing right of holders of shares of Series
G Preferred Stock to take any action as provided in Section 3(b) may be
exercised at any annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of
holders of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, held for such purpose as
hereinafter provided or at any adjournment thereof, or by the written consent,
delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, of the holders of the minimum
number of shares required to take such action.

So long as such right to vote continues (and unless such
right has been exercised by written consent of the minimum number of shares
required to take such action), the President of the Corporation may call, and
upon the written request of holders of record of at least 5% of the aggregate
outstanding shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, addressed to the Secretary of the
Corporation at the principal office of the Corporation, shall call, a special
meeting of the holders of shares entitled to vote as provided herein. Such
meeting shall be held within 30 days after delivery of such request to the
Secretary, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the by-laws
of the Corporation for the holding of meetings of stockholders.

(ii) At each meeting of stockholders at which the
holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall have

-64-
<PAGE>
the right, voting separately as a single class together with the holders of
all other series of Chicago Preferred Stock, to elect two directors of the
Corporation as provided in Section 3(b) or to take any action, the presence in
person or by proxy of the holders of record of one-third of the total aggregate
number of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to
vote on the matter shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum.
At any such meeting or at any adjournment thereof:

(A) the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares
of Chicago Preferred Stock, shall not prevent the election of
directors other than those to be elected by the holders of shares
of Chicago Preferred Stock, and the absence of a quorum of the
holders of shares of any other class or series of capital stock
shall not prevent the election of directors to be elected by the
holders of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, or the taking of
any action as provided in Section 3(b); and

(B) in the absence of a quorum of the holders of
shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, a majority of the holders of
such shares present in person or by proxy shall have the power to
adjourn the meeting as to the actions to be taken by the holders
of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, from time to time and place
to place without notice other than announcement at the meeting
until a quorum shall be present.

For taking of any action as provided in Section 3(a) or
Section 3(b) by the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, each such
holder shall have one vote for each share of such stock standing in his name on
the transfer books of the Corporation as of any record date fixed for such
purpose or, if no such date be fixed, at the close of business on the Business
Day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held; provided, however, that shares of Chicago Preferred Stock held
-------- -------
by the Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Corporation shall not be deemed to
be outstanding for purposes of taking any action as provided in this Section 3.

Each director elected by the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, as provided in Section 3(b) shall, unless his term shall expire
earlier in accordance with the provisions thereof, hold office until the annual
meeting of stockholders next succeeding his election or until his successor,
if any, is elected and qualified.

-65-
<PAGE>
If any director so elected by the holders of Chicago
Preferred Stock shall cease to serve as a director before his term shall expire
(except by reason of the termination of the voting rights accorded to the
holders of Chicago Preferred Stock, in accordance with Section 3(b)), the
holders of the Chicago Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote for
such director may, by written consent as provided herein, or at a special
meeting of such holders called as provided herein, elect a successor to hold
office for the unexpired term of the director whose place shall be vacant.

Any director elected by the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, may be removed from office
with or without cause only by the vote or written consent of the holders of at
least a majority of the aggregate outstanding shares of Chicago Preferred Stock
at the time of removal. A special meeting of the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock may be called in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 3(c)(i).

may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any Parity Stock
pursuant to any mandatory redemption, put, sinking fund or other similar ob-
ligation contained in such Parity Stock, pro rata with the Series G Preferred

Corporation to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise acquire shares of Series G
Preferred Stock and shares of such Parity Stock.

(d) The Corporation shall not permit any Subsidiary of the
Corporation, or cause any other Person, to purchase or otherwise acquire for
consideration any shares of capital stock of the Corporation unless the
Corporation could, pursuant to Section 4(c), purchase such shares at such time
and in such manner.

Section 5. Optional Redemption.
-------------------

(a) (i) The Corporation shall not have any right to redeem
any shares of Series G Preferred Stock prior to December 30, 2001. Thereafter,
(A) at any time, if no shares of the Series E Preferred Stock remain
outstanding, so long as shares of Common Stock shall have traded on the New York
Stock Exchange (or another national securities exchange or on Nasdaq) on each

December 30, 2003 to 100.925%
December 29, 2004

December 30, 2004 and 100%
thereafter

(ii) If the Corporation shall have the right to, or shall
determine to, redeem less than all the shares of Series G Preferred Stock then
outstanding pursuant to paragraph (i), the shares to be redeemed shall be
selected pro rata (as nearly as may be) so that the number of shares redeemed
from each holder shall be the same proportion of all the shares to be redeemed
that the total number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock then held by such
holder bears to the total number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock then
outstanding.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any shares of Series G
Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section 5(a) at any time when holders
of shares of Series G Preferred Stock have the right to require the Corporation
to redeem the shares of Series G Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6 or an
event giving rise to such a right has occurred shall be redeemed at a price
equal to the higher of the price to be paid pursuant to Section 5(a) and the
price to be paid pursuant to Section 6.

(b) Notice of any Optional Redemption shall specify the
Optional Redemption Date fixed for redemption, the Optional

-68-
<PAGE>
Redemption Price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made
upon presentation and surrender of the shares of Series G Preferred Stock and
that on and after the date of such Optional Redemption dividends will cease
to accrue on such shares and be given by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such
publication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation or
securities exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more than 45, days
prior to the Optional Redemption Date; and, in any case, a similar notice
shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 45, days prior to the Optional
Redemption Date to each holder of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, at such
holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation. In
order to facilitate the redemption of shares of Series G Preferred Stock,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of shares
of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed, or may cause the transfer books
of the Corporation for the Series G Preferred Stock to be closed, not more
than 60 days or less than 45 days prior to the Optional Redemption Date.

(c) On the date of any Optional Redemption that is
specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 5(b), the Corporation shall, and
at any time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Optional
Redemption Date the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with
a bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that
is "well capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable bank regulations and
having a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited
by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the Optional
Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Optional Redemption Price. Any interest
accrued on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be paid from time
to time to the Corporation for its own account.

(d) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 5(c) in respect of shares of
Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 5(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Optional Redemption Date (i)

-69-
<PAGE>
the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding, (ii) the
rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue, and (iii) all rights
of the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall cease
and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Optional Redemption Price
therefor; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the
-------- -------
payment of the Optional Redemption Price, the shares of Series G Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have
all of the rights of a holder of Series G Preferred Stock until such time as
such default or failure shall no longer be continuing or shall have been waived
by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series G Pre-
ferred Stock.

(e) Any notice that is mailed as herein provided shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock receives such notice, and failure to give
such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice, to the holders of any shares
designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any other shares of Series G Preferred Stock. On or after the
Optional Redemption Date fixed for redemption as stated in such notice, each
holder of the shares called for redemption shall surrender the certificate
evidencing such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice
and shall thereupon be entitled to receive payment of the Optional Redemption
Price. If less than all the shares evidenced by any such surrendered
certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued evidencing the
unredeemed shares.

Option of the Holder. 
--------------------------

(a) (i) If one or more events constituting a Specified
Corporate Action shall occur, each holder of shares of the Series G Preferred
Stock shall have the right, at such holder's option on the date or dates
specified in Section 6(a)(ii) (the "Specified Corporate Action Redemption

-------- -------
Preferred Stock that was not outstanding for at least ten Business Days prior to
the date of the notice of the Specified Corporate Action shall only be entitled
to receive upon such Specified Corporate Action Redemption the amount specified
in clause (II) above.

(ii) The date fixed for each Specified Corporate Action
Redemption shall be fixed by the Corporation and shall be not less than 60 days
nor more than 90 days following the occurrence of any Specified Corporate Action
giving rise thereto (or, in the case of a Specified Corporate Action as
described in clause (iii) of the definition of "Specified Corporate Action," not
less than 60 days nor more than 90 days following the date on which the
Corporation obtains actual knowledge of such Specified Corporate Action);
provided, however, that in the event of a Specified Corporate Action that

constitutes a Control Transaction, in addition to the dates fixed for a
Specified Corporate Action Redemption as specified above, an additional
Specified Corporate Action Redemption Date shall be set for the date and time
immediately preceding the consummation of any such Control Transaction (and the
Market Price utilized in determining the Additional Amount for the purposes of
such Specified Corporate Action Redemption shall be the highest price per share
of Common Stock paid by any acquiror in such Control Transaction); provided,

further, that, 
- - -------

-71-
<PAGE>
upon the request of a holder, the Board of Directors shall agree
to extend the date of redemption in respect of any such Specified Corporate
Action (without changing the consideration that is otherwise payable in respect
of such redemption other than with respect to adjustments to the amount of
accrued and unpaid dividends included in such redemption price) to the extent
necessary for any holder of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to avoid
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, provided that no such
--------
redemption extension shall be for a period greater than six months. The
Corporation shall, within 5 days of the occurrence of a Specified Corporate
Action (or, in the case of a Specified Corporate Action described in clause
(iii) of the definition of "Specified Corporate Action," within 5 days of the
date on which the Corporation obtains actual knowledge of such Specified Corpo-
rate Action), give notice thereof by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such pub-
lication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation or securities
exchange requirement), and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed to
each holder of shares of the Series G Preferred Stock, at such holder's address
as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation. Each such notice shall
specify the Specified Corporate Action that has occurred and the date of such
occurrence, the place or places of payment, the then effective Specified
Corporate Action Redemption Price and the date the right of such holder to
require a Specified Corporate Action Redemption shall terminate.

(iii) If the notice sent by the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6(a)(ii) shall contain (i) a form inquiring as to whether a holder of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock intends to surrender the certificate(s)
representing such shares for redemption pursuant to this Section 6(a) and (ii) a
stamped self-addressed envelope for return of such form to the Corporation or
its designee, within ten Business Days of such notice, each holder shall return
such inquiry form to the Corporation and shall indicate in such form the
proportion of such holder's shares of Series G Preferred Stock that will be sur-
rendered for redemption pursuant to this Section 6. If such notice shall
indicate that if a holder does not respond prior to ten Business Days after the
date of such notice that such holder will be deemed to have notified the
Corporation that it will not require the redemption of the shares of Series G
Preferred Stock held by such holder for purposes of Section 3(b) and such
holder does not respond to the Corporation's inquiry prior to ten Business Days
after the date of such notice, such holder will be deemed to have notified the
Corporation that it will not require the redemption of the shares of Series G
Preferred Stock held by such holder for purposes of Section 3(b). Nothing
contained in this Section 6(a)(iii)

-72-
<PAGE>
shall effect the right of a holder of Series G Preferred Stock to require the
Corporation to redeem such shares pursuant to Section 6(a)(i).

(b) At any time after December 30, 1995, the holder of any
shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall have the right, at such holder's option
exercisable at any time upon 30 days' notice to the Corporation, to require the
Corporation to redeem (a "Holder's Election Redemption") all or any part of the
shares of Series G Preferred Stock then held by such holder at a price per share
(the "Holder's Election Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the
Liquidation Preference of such share, (B) an amount per share equal to all
accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared or payable, to the
date specified for such Holder's Election Redemption and (C) the Additional
Amount measured as of the date of any such redemption, in immediately available
funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the redemption of any portion of such
shares would in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Corporation have a
material adverse effect on the Corporation, then the Corporation may elect to
deliver with respect to such shares, in lieu of cash, notes, including
subordinated notes, of the Corporation ("Notes") (x) having a final maturity
date no later than ten years from the date of issuance, and (y) having such
other terms and conditions as shall result in a determination that such Notes
have a fair market value as of the date of their proposed issuance at least
equal to the sum of (1) the Holder's Election Redemption Price with respect to
such shares and (2) customary underwriting discounts and commissions payable
with respect to the sale of securities of a type comparable to the Notes or
shares of nonconvertible preferred stock ("Redemption Preferred Stock") having
the terms and conditions described in clauses (x) and (y) in lieu of Notes. The
Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause the Notes or the Redemption
Preferred Stock to be registered for immediate resale pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act prior to the issuance thereof. 
If such registration statement is not effective within 120 days of the date of
such issuance then the annual interest rate of the Notes or the annual dividend
rate of the Redemption Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be increased by
0.5% per annum until such securities are sold pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act. For purposes of this Section
6(b), "fair market value" shall mean the fair market value of the Notes or Re-
demption Preferred Stock, as the case may be, as determined by an investment
banking firm of national standing selected by the Corporation and reasonably
acceptable to the holders of a majority of the shares of Series G Preferred
Stock electing to effect such Holder's Election Redemption. In the case that
the Corporation shall be entitled

-73-
<PAGE>
to deliver either Notes or Redemption Preferred Stock, it shall be the
election of the Corporation whether to deliver such Notes or Redemption
Preferred Stock, except that, if, the sale of the security to be delivered
by the Corporation to effect a Holder's Election Redemption would give rise
to an additional liability on the part of such holder upon the sale thereof
and it shall so notify the Corporation in writing, the Corporation shall
deliver to such holder the other type of security specified in such notice.

(c) Each holder of shares of the Series G Preferred Stock
shall have the right, at such holder's option exercisable at any time on 30
days' notice to the Corporation on or after December 30, 2009 (the date of any
such exercise, the "Special Redemption Date"), to require the Corporation to
redeem (a "Special Redemption") all or any part of the shares of Series G
Preferred Stock then held by such holder as such holder may elect by written
notice delivered at least 30 days prior to the Special Redemption Date at a
price per share equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the Liquidation Preference of
such share, (B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon whether or not declared or payable to the Special Redemption Date and
(C) the Additional Amount, determined as of the date immediately prior to the
Special Redemption Date (the "Special Redemption Price") in immediately
available funds.

(d) On the date fixed for any Specified Corporate Action
Redemption, Holder's Election Redemption or Special Redemption, each holder of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock who elects to have shares of Series G
Preferred Stock held by it redeemed shall surrender the certificate representing
such shares to the Corporation (i) at the place designated in such notice in the
case of a Specified Corporate Action Redemption or (ii) at the Corporation's
principal place of business to be maintained by it, in the case of a Holder's
Election Redemption or Special Redemption, together with an election to have
such redemption made and shall thereupon be entitled to receive payment therefor
provided in this Section 6. If less than all the shares represented by any such
surrendered certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued rep-
resenting the unredeemed shares. From and after the date of such redemption (i)
the rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all
rights of the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock so redeemed shall
cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Specified Corporate
Action Redemption Price or Holder's Election Redemption Price or Special
Redemption Price therefor, as applicable; provided, however, that if the
-------- -------
Corporation shall default in the payment of the applicable redemption price or,
in the case of a Holder's Election Redemption, elect to postpone payment thereof

-74-

<PAGE>
in accordance with Section 6(b), the shares of Series G Preferred Stock that
were to be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders
thereof shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series G Preferred Stock
until such time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall have been
waived by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series G
Preferred Stock or, in the case of a Holder's Election Redemption, so postponed,
the date on which the Holder's Election Redemption Price is paid.

Section 7. Redemption Upon Maturity.
------------------------

(a) On December 30, 2034 (the "Maturity Date"), the
Corporation shall redeem (the "Maturity Redemption") the remaining outstanding
shares of the Series G Preferred Stock at a price per share (the "Maturity
Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the Liquidation Preference
per share, (B) an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether
or not declared or payable, to the Maturity Date and (C) the Additional Amount,
determined as of the date immediately prior to the Maturity Date, in immediately
available funds.

(b) Notice of the Maturity Redemption shall be given by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by applicable law,
rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more
than 60, days prior to the Maturity Date and, in any case, a similar notice
shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the Maturity
Date to each holder of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, at such holder's
address as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation.

(c) On the Maturity Date, the Corporation shall, and at any
time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Maturity Date the
Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series G
Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or trust
company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well
capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable banking regulations and having
a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited by the
Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for 
such redemption shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look 

-75-

<PAGE>

only to the Corporation for the payment of the Maturity Redemption Price. Any
interest accrued and unpaid on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c)
shall be paid from time to time to the Corporation for its own account.

(d) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 7(c) in respect of shares of
Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 7(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Maturity Date, (i) the rights
to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of the
holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate,
excepting only the right to receive the Maturity Redemption Price therefor;
provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the
- - -------- -------
Maturity Redemption Price, the shares of Series G Preferred Stock that were to
be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof
shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series G Preferred Stock until such
time as such default shall no longer be continuing.

Section 8. Acquired Shares.
---------------

Any shares of Series G Preferred Stock exchanged, redeemed,
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in
any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the
acquisition thereof. All such shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall upon
their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, par
value $4.00 per share, of the Corporation and, upon the filing of an appropriate
certificate with the Department of State of the State of New York, may be
reissued as part of another series of preferred stock, par value $4.00 per
share, of the Corporation subject to the conditions or restrictions on issuance
set forth herein, but in any event may not be reissued as shares of Series G
Preferred Stock or Parity Stock unless all of the issued and outstanding shares
of Series G Preferred Stock shall have already been redeemed or exchanged.

Section 9. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
--------------------------------------

(a) If the Corporation shall commence a voluntary case
under the United States bankruptcy laws or any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar law of any other country, or consent to the entry of an
order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law or to the appointment
of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or 

-76-
<PAGE>
other similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its
property, or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or admit in
writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due (any such
event, a "Voluntary Liquidation Event"), or if a decree or order for relief in
respect of the Corporation shall be entered by a court having jurisdiction in
the premises in an involuntary case under the United States bankruptcy laws or
any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law of any other country, or
appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator
(or other similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its
property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and on
account of any such event the Corporation shall liquidate, dissolve or wind up,
or if the Corporation shall otherwise liquidate, dissolve or wind up, no
distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of shares of Junior Stock unless,
prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall have
received (A) if a Voluntary Liquidation Event shall have occurred, the Optional
Redemption Price with respect to each share and (B) if a Voluntary Liquidation
Event shall not have occurred, the Liquidation Preference and all accrued and
unpaid dividends, whether or not declared or currently payable, to the date of
distribution, with respect to each share, or (ii) to the holders of shares of
Parity Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series G Preferred Stock
and all Parity Stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of
all shares of the Series G Preferred Stock (which amounts are set forth in
clauses (A) and (B) above) and Parity Stock are entitled upon such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up.

(b) Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation
with or into any other Person nor the sale or transfer of all or any part of the
Corporation's assets for cash, securities or other property shall be deemed to
be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation for purposes of
this Section 9.

Section 10. Exchange.
--------

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, the
Corporation shall have the right, with the consent of the holders of all of the
outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock (which consent may be withheld
for any reason whatsoever), at any time but on only one occasion, to exchange
all (but not less than all) of the shares of Series G Preferred Stock for
Subordinated Notes of the Corporation ("Subordinated Notes"), at a price per
share equal to the Liquidation Preference per share, with the Subordinated Notes
valued for such 

-77-
<PAGE>

purpose at their face value. Simultaneously with such exchange the Corporation
shall pay to each holder of Series G Preferred Stock an amount per share in cash
equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared or
currently payable, to the date fixed for exchange thereof. The Subordinated
Notes shall have an annual interest rate equal to the annual dividend rate on
Series G Preferred Stock and shall contain other terms substantially similar to
the Series G Preferred Stock, including the date of maturity thereof.

(b) Notice of an exchange of shares of Series G Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 10(a) shall be given by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such
publication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation or securities
exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more than 60, days prior to the
date fixed for exchange; and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at
least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the date fixed for exchange to
each holder at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the
Corporation. In order to facilitate the exchange of shares of Series G
Preferred Stock hereunder the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be exchanged, or may
cause the transfer books of the Corporation for the Series G Preferred Stock to
be closed, not more than 60 days or less than 30 days prior to the date fixed
for exchange.

(c) On the date of any exchange being made pursuant to
Section 10(a) that is specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 10(b), the
Corporation shall, and at any time after the date that is 10 days prior to the
date of exchange the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be exchanged (i) the Subordinated Notes
necessary for such exchange and (ii) an amount in cash equal to all dividends
payable with respect thereto upon such exchange with a bank or trust company in
the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well capitalized"
within the meaning of the applicable banking regulations and having a capital
and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any Subordinated Notes so deposited by
the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated
for such exchange shall revert to the Corporation. After such reversion, any
such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, return to the Corporation such
unclaimed Subordinated Notes and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be 
relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of shares of
Series G Preferred Stock to be exchanged shall look only to the Corporation for
the delivery of the Subordinated Notes. Any interest accrued on Subordinated
Notes 

-78-

<PAGE>
deposited pursuant to this Section 10(c) shall accrue for the accounts of, and
be payable to, the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be exchanged
therefor.

(d) Notice of exchange having been given as aforesaid and
not having been deemed terminated as aforesaid, upon the deposit of Subordinated
Notes pursuant to clause (i) of Section 10(c) and the deposit of the cash
referred to in clause (ii) of Section 10(c) in respect of shares of Series G
Preferred Stock to be exchanged pursuant to Section 10(a), notwithstanding that
any certificates for such shares shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, from and after the date of exchange designated in the notice of
exchange (i) the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed
outstanding, (ii) the rights to receive dividends thereon (except as provided in
paragraph (b) above) shall cease to accrue, and (iii) all rights of the holders
of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be exchanged shall cease and terminate,
excepting only the right to receive the Subordinated Notes therefor and the
right to receive the dividends described in paragraph (b) above; provided,
--------
however, that if the Corporation shall default in the execution and delivery of
- - -------
the Convertible Notes, the shares of Series G Preferred Stock that were to be
exchanged shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof
shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series G Preferred Stock until such
time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall have been waived by
holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series G Preferred
Stock.

Section 11. Additional Amount.
-----------------

(a) For the purposes of this Article 3, "Additional Amount"
shall mean an amount per share equal to the product of (i) the excess of the sum
of (1) the Market Price of a share of Common Stock and (2) if the Corporation
shall have issued a right or rights with respect to its outstanding shares of
Common Stock pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement, during the period commencing on the "distribution date" of such
right or rights (i.e., the date on which such right or rights commence to trade
----
separately from the Common Stock) and ending on the "triggering date" of such
right or rights (i.e., the date on which such right or rights commence to be
----
exercisable), the Market Price of such right or rights over the Conversion
Amount, in effect as hereinafter determined and (ii) (x) the Liquidation
Preference divided by (y) such Conversion Amount, in all cases calculated as of
the applicable determination date. The Additional Amount shall in no event be
less than zero. The Conversion Amount initially shall be $17.75, and shall
thereafter be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 11(b). For the
purpose of calculating 

-79-

<PAGE>

the Additional Amount in connection with an Optional Redemption, Specified
Corporate Action Redemption, Special Redemption or Holder's Election Redemption,
except as otherwise set forth in Section 6(a)(ii), the Market Price of the
Common Stock and, if applicable, rights shall be the average of the Market Price
of such securities on the five trading days immediately preceding and the five
trading days immediately following the date of notice of such redemption.

(b) The Conversion Amount shall be subject to adjustment as
follows:

(i) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding shares
of Common Stock in Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment
plan approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors), (B) subdivide the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (C) combine
the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (D)
issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock,
then, and in each such case, the Conversion Amount in effect immediately prior
to such event shall be adjusted so that if the holder of any share of Series G
Preferred Stock were entitled to convert such share into such number of shares
of Common Stock as equals the Liquidation Preference divided by the Conversion
Amount and such holder thereafter surrendered such share for conversion, such
holder would be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock or
other securities of the Corporation that such holder would have owned or would
have been entitled to receive upon or by reason of any of the events described
above had such share of Series G Preferred Stock been converted immediately
prior to the occurrence of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this
Section 11(b)(i) shall become effective retroactively (A) in the case of any
such dividend or distribution, to the opening of business on the day immediately
following the close of business on the record date for the determination of
holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution or (B)
in the case of any such subdivision, combination or reclassification, to the
close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective.

(ii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time issue or sell shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or any options, warrants or
other rights to acquire shares of Common Stock (other than options granted to
any employee or director of the Corporation pursuant to a stock option plan
approved by the shareholders of the Corporation)) 

-80-

<PAGE>
for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Amount then in effect at
the record date or issuance date, as the case may be (the "Date") referred to in
the following sentence, including, without limitation, upon exercise of rights
issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement (treating the price per share of any security convertible or
exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock as equal to (A) the sum of the
price for such security convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Common
Stock plus any additional consideration payable (without regard to any anti-
dilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such security
into Common Stock divided by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock initially
underlying such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security), other than
issuances or sales for which an adjustment is made pursuant to another paragraph
of this Section 11(b), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Amount then
in effect shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Amount in effect on the
day immediately prior to the Date by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock issued or to be
issued (or the maximum number into which such convertible or exchangeable
securities initially may convert or exchange or for which such options, warrants
or other rights initially may be exercised) and (y) the denominator of which
shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Date plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration (if any of such aggregate consideration is other than cash, as
valued by the Board of Directors including a majority of the Directors who are
not officers or employees of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, which
determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of
Directors) for the total number of such additional shares of Common Stock so
issued (or into which such convertible or exchangeable securities may convert or
exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights may be exercised
plus the aggregate amount of any additional consideration initially payable upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of such security) would purchase at the
Conversion Amount. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such shares,
securities, options, warrants or other rights are issued, and shall become
effective retroactively to a date immediately following the close of business
(i) in the case of issuance to stockholders of the Corporation, as such, on the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
shares, securities, options, warrants or other rights and (ii) in all other
cases, on the date ("issuance date") of such issuance; provided, however, that
-------- -------
the determination as to whether an adjustment is required to be made pursuant to
this Section

-81-
<PAGE>
11(b)(ii) shall only be made upon the issuance of such shares or
such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights,
and not upon the issuance of the security into which such convertible or
exchangeable security converts or exchanges, or the security underlying such
option, warrants or other right; provided, further, that if any convertible or
-------- -------
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights (or any portions
thereof) that shall have given rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section
11(b)(ii) shall have expired or terminated without the exercise thereof and/or
if by reason of the terms of such convertible or exchangeable securities,
options, warrants or other rights there shall have been an increase or
increases, with the passage of time or otherwise, in the price payable upon the
exercise or conversion thereof, then the Conversion Amount hereunder shall be
readjusted (but to no greater extent than originally adjusted) on the basis of
(x) eliminating from the computation any additional shares of Common Stock
corresponding to such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants
or other rights as shall have expired or terminated, (y) treating the additional
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or issuable pursuant to the
previous exercise of such convertible or exchangeable securities, options,
warrants or other rights as having been issued for the consideration actually
received and receivable therefor and (z) treating any of such convertible or
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights that remain
outstanding as being subject to exercise or conversion on the basis of such
exercise or conversion price as shall be in effect at the time.

(iii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time distribute to all holders of shares of its Common Stock (including
any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which
the Corporation is the resulting or surviving corporation and the Common Stock
is not changed or exchanged or a redemption of any rights or other securities
issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar arrange-
ment) cash, evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation or another issuer,
securities of the Corporation or another issuer or other assets (excluding (A)
Permitted Dividends described in clause (B) of the definition thereof and (B)
securities for which adjustment is made under Section 11(b)(i) or Section
11(b)(ii)), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Amount then in effect
shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Amount in effect immediately prior
to the date of such distribution by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall
be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date referred to
below and (y) the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price of the
Common Stock less the then Fair Market Value (as determined by 

-82-

<PAGE>

the Board of Directors of the Corporation, which determination shall be
conclusive) of the portion of the cash, evidences of indebtedness, securities or
other assets so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants
applicable to one share of Common Stock (but such denominator not to be less
than one). Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made
and shall become effective retroactively to a date immediately following the
close of business on the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such distribution.

(iv) In the case the Corporation at any time or from
time to time shall take any action affecting its Common Stock, other than an
action described in any of Section 11(b)(i) through Section 11(b)(iii),
inclusive, then, the Conversion Amount shall be adjusted in such manner and at
such time as the Board of Directors of the Corporation (other than Purchaser
Designees or directors elected pursuant to Section 3(b)) in good faith
determines to be equitable in the circumstances (such determination to be
evidenced in a resolution, a certified copy of which shall be mailed to the
holders of the Series G Preferred Stock).

(v) The Corporation may make such reductions in the
Conversion Amount, in addition to those required by subparagraphs (i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv) of this Section 11(b), as the Board of Directors considers to be
advisable in order to avoid or to diminish any income tax to holders of Common
Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or
distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as
such for income tax purposes.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section
11(b), no adjustment to the Conversion Amount shall be made with respect to any
rights issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement unless the "triggering date" (i.e. the date on which such rights
----
commence to be exercisable) shall have occurred or such rights shall have been
redeemed, in which event adjustments under clause (ii) and clause (iii),
respectively, shall be made.

(c) If the Corporation shall take a record of the holders
of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or
other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to
stockholders thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or
distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Amount then in
effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.

-83-
<PAGE>
(d) Upon any increase or decrease in the Conversion Amount,
then, and in each such case, the Corporation promptly shall deliver to each
registered holder of Series G Preferred Stock at least 10 Business Days prior to
effecting any of the foregoing transactions a certificate, signed by the
President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, setting forth in
reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which
such adjustment was calculated and specifying the increased or decreased Con-
version Amount then in effect following such adjustment.

Section 12. Sinking Fund.
-------------

(a) So long as any shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, the Corporation shall, on the final business day (any such date,
the "Sinking Fund Date") of each calendar year after 2003, (i) set aside a sum
of money equal to 3-1/3% of the aggregate liquidation preference of the shares
of Series G Preferred Stock then outstanding, and (ii) apply such money to
redeem such number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock at the Sinking Fund
Redemption Price (the Corporation's obligations described in this paragraph in
respect of any Sinking Fund Date being hereinafter referred to as the "Sinking
Fund Obligation" for such date) at a price per share (the "Sinking Fund
Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) the Liquidation Preference of such
share, (B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon, whether or not declared or payable, to the applicable Sinking Fund Date
and (C) the Additional Amount (as defined in Section 11), determined as of the
date immediately prior to the Sinking Fund Date, in immediately available funds;
provided, however, that if the Corporation for any reason fails to discharge its
- - -------- -------
Sinking Fund Obligation on any Sinking Fund Date, such Sinking Fund Obligation,
to the extent not discharged, shall become an additional Sinking Fund Obligation
for each succeeding Sinking Fund Date until fully discharged; provided, further,
-------- -------
that no shares of Series G Preferred Stock purchased or acquired by the
Corporation otherwise than through redemption pursuant to this paragraph or
pursuant to an Optional Redemption may be credited against the Sinking Fund
Obligation in respect of any Sinking Fund Date.

(b) The shares to be redeemed pursuant to paragraph (a)
shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be) so that the number of shares
redeemed from each holder shall be the same proportion of all the shares to be
redeemed that the total number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock then held
by such holder bears to the total number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock
then outstanding.

-84-
<PAGE>
(c) Notice of the Sinking Fund Redemption shall be given by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by applicable law,
rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more
than 60, days prior to the Sinking Fund Date and, in any case, a similar notice
shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the Sinking
Fund Date to each holder of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, at such holder's
address as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation.

(d) The shares to be redeemed pursuant to paragraph (a)
shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be) so that the number of shares
redeemed from each holder shall be the same proportion of all the shares to be
redeemed that the total number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock then held
by such holder bears to the total number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock
then outstanding.

(e) On the Sinking Fund Date, the Corporation shall, and at
any time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Sinking Fund
Date the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Series G Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or
trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well
capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable banking regulations and having
a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited by the
Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for
such redemption shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Sinking Fund Redemption Price. Any interest
accrued and unpaid on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be
paid from time to time to the Corporation for its own account.

(f) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 12(c) in respect of shares of
Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 12(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Sinking Fund Date, (i)
the rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all
rights of the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall cease
and terminate, excepting only the right to

-85-
<PAGE>
receive the Sinking Fund Redemption Price therefor; provided, however, that
-------- -------
if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the Sinking Fund Redemption
Price, the shares of Series G Preferred Stock that were to be redeemed shall
thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have all
of the rights of a holder of Series G Preferred Stock until such time as such
default shall no longer be continuing.

Article 4. Series H Preferred Stock.
------------------------

Section 1. Designation and Number.
----------------------

(a) The shares of such series shall be designated as
"Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series H" (the "Series H Preferred Stock"). The
number of shares initially constituting the Series H Preferred Stock shall be
400,000 which number may be decreased (but not increased) by the Board of
Directors without a vote of stockholders; provided, however, that such number
may not be decreased below the sum of (x) the number of then outstanding shares
of Series H Preferred Stock and (y) such number of shares as may be necessary to
satisfy the dividend payments referenced in Section 2 hereof.

(b) The Series H Preferred Stock shall, with respect to
dividend rights and rights on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, rank pari
----
passu with the Corporation's $2.50 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock,

Stock, Series E (the "Series E Preferred Stock"), Cumulative Preferred Stock,

<PAGE>
Section 2. Dividends and Distributions.
---------------------------

(a) The holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock, in
preference to the holders of shares of Common Stock and of any shares of other
capital stock of the Corporation other than the Other Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of
the assets of the Corporation at the time legally available therefor, cumulative
cash dividends at an annual rate on the Liquidation Preference thereof equal to
12%, calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months, accruing and payable in equal quarterly payments, in immediately
available funds or, with respect to any dividends declared before the third
anniversary of the Issue Date, in additional shares of Series H Preferred Stock
having an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the aggregate amount of such
dividends (provided, however, that to the extent the amount of any such dividend
-------- -------
payable to any holder, valued at the Liquidation Preference thereof, does not
equal an integral multiple of one one-twentieth (1/20th) of a share of Series H
Preferred Stock, such fractional amount shall be paid in cash to such holder),
on the Business Day immediately preceding the last day of March, June, September
and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a
"Quarterly Dividend Payment Date") commencing on the Business Day immediately
preceding December 31, 1994; provided, however, that with respect to such first
-------- -------
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, the holders of shares of Series H Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors, out of the assets of the Corporation at the time legally available
therefor, a cumulative dividend in respect of each share of Series H Preferred
Stock in the amount of (i) 12% of the Liquidation Preference multiplied by (ii)
a fraction equal to (A) the number of days from (and including) the Issue Date
to (but excluding) such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date divided by (B) 360. No
interest shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment on the Series H
Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.

(b) Dividends payable pursuant to Section 2(a) shall begin
to accrue and be cumulative from the Issue Date, and shall accrue on a daily
basis, in each case whether or not declared. Dividends paid on the shares of
Series H Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such
dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro
rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares of Series H Preferred Stock
at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock entitled to
receive payment of a dividend declared thereon, which record date shall be not
more than 60 days nor less than 10

-87-
<PAGE>
days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. Accumulated but unpaid
dividends for any past quarterly dividend periods may be declared and paid at
any time, without reference to any regular Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, to
holders of record on such date, not more than 60 nor less than 10 days preceding
the payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.

(c) The holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall
not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions except as
provided herein.

Section 3. Voting Rights.
-------------

In addition to any voting rights provided by law, the
holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall have the following voting
rights:

(a) Unless the consent or approval of a greater number of
shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a single class, in person or by proxy, at a special or annual
meeting of stockholders called for the purpose, shall be necessary to (i)
authorize, adopt or approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
that would increase or decrease the par value of the shares of Series H
Preferred Stock, or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of
the shares of Series H Preferred Stock, (ii) amend, alter or repeal the
Certificate of Incorporation so as to affect the shares of Series H Preferred
Stock adversely or (iii) effect the voluntary liquidation, dissolution, winding
up, recapitalization or reorganization of the Corporation, or the consolidation
or merger of the Corporation with or into any other Person, or the sale or other
distribution to another Person of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; provided, however, that no separate vote of the holders of Series H
-------- -------
Preferred Stock shall be required to effect any of the transactions described in
clause (iii) above unless such transaction would either require a class vote
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above or would require a vote by any shareholders
of the Corporation (other than pursuant to this sentence); provided further,
-------- -------
that no separate vote of the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock as a class
shall be required in the case of a recapitalization, reorganization,
consolidation or merger of, or sale by, the Corporation if (A) (a) such re-
capitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger or sale constitutes a
Specified Corporate Action, (b) the Corporation has sufficient funds legally
available to it (after giving effect to such transaction) to redeem, at the then
applicable

-88-
<PAGE>
price hereunder and pursuant to the terms hereof, all the outstanding
shares of Series H Preferred Stock, (c) such redemption shall not be prohibited
by any agreement to which the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
by applicable law or otherwise, (d) the Board of Directors of the Corporation,
including a majority of the directors who are not officers or employees of the
Corporation, shall have adopted a resolution confirming that such funds are
available and that the holders of Series H Preferred Stock have the right to re-
quire such redemption and (e) the Corporation shall have set aside sufficient
funds through the Specified Corporation Action Redemption Date to redeem the
shares of Series H Preferred Stock held by such holders (except that no funds
need be set aside with respect to such shares held by any such holder who has
theretofore notified the Corporation (whether pursuant to Section 6(a)(iii) or
otherwise) that it will not require redemption of such shares) or (B) (1) the
Corporation shall be the resulting or surviving corporation, (2) the resulting
or surviving corporation will have after such recapitalization, reorganization,
consolidation or merger no Senior Stock or Parity Stock either authorized or
outstanding (except such Parity Stock of the Corporation as may have been
authorized or outstanding immediately preceding such consolidation or merger) or
such stock of the resulting or surviving corporation (having the same powers,
preferences and special rights of any such Parity Stock) as may be issued in
exchange therefor), (3) each holder of shares of Series H Preferred Stock
immediately preceding such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or
merger will receive in exchange therefor the same number of shares of stock,
with the same preferences, rights and powers, of the resulting or surviving
corporation, (4) after such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or
merger the resulting or surviving corporation shall not be in breach of any of
the terms hereof, any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase
Agreement or any of its material obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement and (5) all or substantially all the holders of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Corporation immediately prior to such consolidation or
merger are entitled to receive shares representing 50% or more of the then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the resulting or surviving corporation
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

(b) If on any date (i) the Corporation shall have failed to
declare, or shall have failed to pay, the full amount of dividends payable on
any series of Chicago Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods or (ii)
a breach of any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement
or any of the Corporation's material obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement shall have occurred, then the number

-89-
<PAGE>
of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall, without further
action, be increased by two and the holders of shares of Series H Preferred
Stock shall have, in addition to the other voting rights set forth herein
with respect to the Series H Preferred Stock, the exclusive right, together
with the holders of all other series of Chicago Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a single class together with the holders of such other series
of Chicago Preferred Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to
fill such newly created directorship, by written consent as provided herein,
or at a special meeting of such holders called as provided herein. Any such
additional directors shall continue as directors (subject to reelection or
removal as provided in Section 3(c)(ii)) and the holders of Series H Preferred
Stock shall have such additional voting rights until such time as (A)
dividends then payable on all series of Chicago Preferred Stock shall have
been declared and paid in full and (B) there shall exist no breach of any of the
Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or any of the Corpora-
tion's material obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, as the case
may be, at which time such additional directors shall cease to be directors, the
number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced by two
and such additional voting rights of the holders of all series of Chicago
Preferred Stock shall terminate, subject to revesting in the event of each and
every subsequent event of the character indicated above.

(c) (i) The foregoing right of holders of shares of Series
H Preferred Stock to take any action as provided in Section 3(b) may be
exercised at any annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of
holders of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, held for such purpose as
hereinafter provided or at any adjournment thereof, or by the written consent,
delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, of the holders of the minimum
number of shares required to take such action.

So long as such right to vote continues (and unless such
right has been exercised by written consent of the minimum number of shares
required to take such action), the President of the Corporation may call, and
upon the written request of holders of record of at least 5% of the aggregate
outstanding shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, addressed to the Secretary of the
Corporation at the principal office of the Corporation, shall call, a special
meeting of the holders of shares entitled to vote as provided herein. Such
meeting shall be held within 30 days after delivery of such request to the
Secretary, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the by-laws
of the Corporation for the holding of meetings of stockholders.

-90-
<PAGE>
(ii) At each meeting of stockholders at which the holders of
shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a
single class together with the holders of all other series of Chicago Preferred
Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation as provided in Section 3(b) or
to take any action, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record
of one-third of the total aggregate number of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock
then outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter shall be necessary and suf-
ficient to constitute a quorum. At any such meeting or at any adjournment
thereof:

(A) the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of
Chicago Preferred Stock, shall not prevent the election of
directors other than those to be elected by the holders of shares
of Chicago Preferred Stock, and the absence of a quorum of the
holders of shares of any other class or series of capital stock
shall not prevent the election of directors to be elected by the
holders of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, or the taking of
any action as provided in Section 3(b); and

(B) in the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of
Chicago Preferred Stock, a majority of the holders of such shares
present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the
meeting as to the actions to be taken by the holders of shares of
Chicago Preferred Stock, from time to time and place to place
without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a
quorum shall be present.

For taking of any action as provided in Section 3(a) or
Section 3(b) by the holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock, each such
holder shall have one vote for each share of such stock standing in his name on
the transfer books of the Corporation as of any record date fixed for such
purpose or, if no such date be fixed, at the close of business on the Business
Day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held; provided, however, that shares of Chicago Preferred Stock held
-------- -------
by the Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Corporation shall not be deemed to
be outstanding for purposes of taking any action as provided in this Section 3.

Each director elected by the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, as provided in Section 3(b) shall, unless his term shall expire
earlier in accordance with the provisions thereof, hold office until the annual
meeting of

-91-
<PAGE>
stockholders next succeeding his election or until his successor, if
any, is elected and qualified.

If any director so elected by the holders of Chicago
Preferred Stock shall cease to serve as a director before his term shall expire
(except by reason of the termination of the voting rights accorded to the
holders of Chicago Preferred Stock, in accordance with Section 3(b)), the
holders of the Chicago Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote for
such director may, by written consent as provided herein, or at a special
meeting of such holders called as provided herein, elect a successor to hold
office for the unexpired term of the director whose place shall be vacant.

Any director elected by the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, may be removed from office
with or without cause only by the vote or written consent of the holders of at
least a majority of the aggregate outstanding shares of Chicago Preferred Stock
at the time of removal. A special meeting of the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, may be called in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 3(c)(i).

Section 4. Certain Restrictions.
--------------------

(a) So long as any shares of Series H Preferred Stock
remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not declare or make any Restricted
Payment.

(b) Whenever quarterly dividends payable on shares of

such time and thereafter until all unpaid dividends payable, whether or not
declared, on the outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall have been
paid in full or declared and set apart for payment at such time and thereafter
until all necessary funds have been set apart for payment, or whenever the
Corporation shall not have paid the Optional Redemption Price, the Specified
Corporate Action Redemption Price or the Maturity Redemption Price when due, at
such time and thereafter until all such amounts have been paid in full or set
apart for payment, the Corporation shall not: (A) declare or pay dividends, or
make any other distributions, on any shares of Junior Stock, or (B) declare or
pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of Parity Stock,
except dividends or distributions paid ratably on the Series H Preferred Stock

proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all shares of the Series
H Preferred Stock and Parity Stock are then entitled.

-92-

<PAGE>
(c) Whenever dividends payable on shares of Series H
Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are not paid in full, at such time and
thereafter until all unpaid dividends payable, whether or not declared, on the
outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or
declared and set apart for payment, at such time and thereafter until all
necessary funds have been set apart for payment, or whenever the Corporation
shall not have paid the Optional Redemption Price, the Specified Corporate
Action Redemption Price or the Maturity Redemption Price when due, at such time
and thereafter until all such amounts have been paid in full or set apart for
payment, the Corporation shall not redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for
consideration any shares of Junior Stock or Parity Stock; provided, however,
-------- -------
that (A) the Corporation may accept shares of any Parity Stock or Junior Stock
for conversion into Junior Stock and (B) the Corporation may at any time redeem,
purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any Parity Stock pursuant to any
mandatory redemption, put, sinking fund or other similar obligation contained in
such Parity Stock, pro rata with the Series H Preferred Stock in proportion to
the total amount then required to be applied by the Corporation to redeem,
repurchase, or otherwise acquire shares of Series H Preferred Stock and shares
of such Parity Stock.

(d) The Corporation shall not permit any Subsidiary of the
Corporation, or cause any other Person, to purchase or otherwise acquire for
consideration any shares of capital stock of the Corporation unless the
Corporation could, pursuant to Section 4(c), purchase such shares at such time
and in such manner.

Section 5. Optional Redemption.
-------------------

(a) (i) The Corporation shall not have any right to redeem
any shares of Series H Preferred Stock prior to December 30, 1999. Thereafter,

tion") all or a portion of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock, on not more
than 45 nor less than 30 days' notice of the date of redemption (any such date,
an "Optional Redemption Date") at a price per share (the "Optional Redemption
Price") equal to the sum of (A) the following prices per share (stated as a per-
centage of the Liquidation Preference of such share) and (B) an amount per share
equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared or
payable, to the applicable Optional Redemption Date in immediately available

December 29, 2004

(ii) If the Corporation shall have the right to, or shall
determine to, redeem less than all the shares of Series H Preferred Stock then
outstanding pursuant to paragraph (i), the shares to be redeemed shall be
selected pro rata (as nearly as may be) so that the number of shares redeemed
from each holder shall be the same proportion of all the shares to be redeemed
that the total number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock then held by such
holder bears to the total number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock then
outstanding.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any shares of Series H
Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section 5(a) at any time when the
holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock have the right to require the
Corporation to redeem the shares of Series H Preferred Stock pursuant to Section
6 or an event giving rise to such a right has occurred shall be redeemed at a
price equal to higher of the price to be paid in Section 5(a) and the price to
be paid pursuant to Section 6.

(b) Notice of any Optional Redemption shall specify the
Optional Redemption Date fixed for redemption, the Optional Redemption Price,
the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and
surrender of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock and that on and after the
date of such Optional Redemption dividends will cease to accrue on such shares
and be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough
of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by
applicable law, rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), not less
than 30, nor more than 45, days prior to the Optional Redemption 

-94-

<PAGE>
Date; and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at least 30, but not
more than 45, days prior to the Optional Redemption Date to each holder of
shares of Series H Preferred Stock, at such holder's address as it appears on
the transfer books of the Corporation. In order to facilitate the redemption of
shares of Series H Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may fix a record date
for the determination of shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed, or
may cause the transfer books of the Corporation for the Series H Preferred Stock
to be closed, not more than 60 days or less than 45 days prior to the Optional
Redemption Date.

(c) On the date of any Optional Redemption that is
specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 5(b), the Corporation shall, and
at any time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Optional
Redemption Date the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Series H Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with
a bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that
is "well capitalized" within the meaning of applicable bank regulations and
having a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited
by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the Optional
Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Optional Redemption Price. Any interest
accrued on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be paid from time
to time to the Corporation for its own account.

(d) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 5(c) in respect of shares of
Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 5(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Optional Redemption Date (i)
the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding, (ii) the
rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue, and (iii) all rights
of the holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall cease
and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Optional Redemption Price
therefor; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the
-------- -------
payment of the Optional Redemption Price, the shares of Series H Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have
all of the rights of a holder of Series H Preferred 

-95-

<PAGE>

Stock until such time as such default or failure shall no longer be continuing
or shall have been waived by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding
shares of Series H Preferred Stock.

(e) Any notice that is mailed as herein provided shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of
shares of Series H Preferred Stock receives such notice, and failure to give
such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice, to the holders of any shares
designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any other shares of Series H Preferred Stock. On or after the
Optional Redemption Date fixed for redemption as stated in such notice, each
holder of the shares called for redemption shall surrender the certificate
evidencing such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice
and shall thereupon be entitled to receive payment of the Optional Redemption
Price. If less than all the shares evidenced by any such surrendered
certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued evidencing the
unredeemed shares.

Section 6. Mandatory Redemption at the Option
of the Holder. 
---------------------------------

(a) (i) If one or more events constituting a Specified
Corporate Action shall occur, each holder of shares of the Series H Preferred
Stock shall have the right, at such holder's option on the date or dates
specified in Section 6(a)(ii) (the "Specified Corporate Action Redemption
Date"), to require the Corporation to redeem (a "Specified Corporate Action
Redemption") all or any part of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock then held
by such holder as such holder may elect at a price per share equal to the sum of
(A) the Liquidation Preference of such share and (B) an amount per share equal
to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared or payable,
to the applicable Specified Corporate Action Redemption Date, in immediately
available funds (the "Specified Corporate Action Redemption Price").

(ii) The date fixed for each Specified Corporate Action
Redemption shall be fixed by the Corporation and shall be not less than 60 days
nor more than 90 days following the occurrence of any Specified Corporate Action
giving rise thereto (or, in the case of a Specified Corporate Action as
described in clause (iii) of the definition of "Specified Corporate Action,"
not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days following the date on which the
Corporation obtains actual knowledge of such Specified Corporate Action);
provided, however, that in the event of a Specified Corporate Action that 
- - -------- -------

-96-

<PAGE>
constitutes a Control Transaction, in addition to the dates fixed for a
Specified Corporate Action Redemption as specified above, an additional
Specified Corporate Action Redemption Date shall be set for the date and time
immediately preceding the consummation of any such Control Transaction;
provided, further, that, upon the request of a holder, the Board of Directors
- - -------- -------
shall agree to extend the date of redemption in respect of any such Specified
Corporate Action (without changing the consideration that is otherwise payable
in respect of such redemption other than with respect to adjustments to the
amount of accrued and unpaid dividends included in such redemption price) to the
extent necessary for any holder of shares of Series H Preferred Stock to avoid
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, provided that no such
--------
redemption extension shall be for a period greater than six months. The
Corporation shall, within 5 days of the occurrence of a Specified Corporate
Action (or, in the case of a Specified Corporate Action described in clause
(iii) of the definition of "Specified Corporate Action," within 5 days of the
date on which the Corporation obtains actual knowledge of such Specified Corpo-
rate Action), give notice thereof by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such
publication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation or securities
exchange requirement), and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed to
each holder of shares of the Series H Preferred Stock, at such holder's address
as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation. Each such notice shall
specify the Specified Corporate Action that has occurred and the date of such
occurrence, the place or places of payment, the then effective Specified
Corporate Action Redemption Price and the date the right of such holder to
require a Specified Corporate Action Redemption shall terminate.

(iii) If the notice sent by the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6(a)(ii) shall contain (i) a form inquiring as to whether a holder of
shares of Series H Preferred Stock intends to surrender the certificate(s)
representing such shares for redemption pursuant to this Section 6(a) and (ii) a
stamped self-addressed envelope for return of such form to the Corporation or
its designee, within ten Business Days of such notice, each holder shall return
such inquiry form to the Corporation and shall indicate in such form the
proportion of such holder's shares of Series H Preferred Stock that will be
surrendered for redemption pursuant to this Section 6(a). If such notice shall
indicate that if a holder does not respond prior to ten Business Days after the
date of such notice that such holder will be deemed to have notified the
Corporation that it will not require the redemption of the shares of Series H
Preferred Stock held by such holder for purposes of Section 

-97-

<PAGE>

3(b) and such holder does not respond to the Corporation's inquiry prior to ten
Business Days after the date of such notice, such holder will be deemed to have
notified the Corporation that it will not require the redemption of the shares
of Series H Preferred Stock held by such holder for purposes of Section 3(b). 
Nothing contained in this Section 6(a)(iii) shall affect the right of a holder
of Series H Preferred Stock to require the Corporation to redeem such shares
pursuant to Section 6(a)(i).

(b) On the date fixed for any Specified Corporate Action
Redemption, each holder of shares of Series H Preferred Stock who elects to have
shares of Series H Preferred Stock held by it redeemed shall surrender the
certificate representing such shares to the Corporation at the place designated
in such notice, together with an election to have such redemption made and shall
thereupon be entitled to receive payment therefor provided in this Section 6. 
If less than all the shares represented by any such surrendered certificate are
redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. 
From and after the date of such redemption (i) the rights to receive dividends
thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of the holders of shares of
Series H Preferred Stock so redeemed shall cease and terminate, excepting only
the right to receive the Specified Corporate Action Redemption Price therefor;
provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the
- - -------- -------
applicable redemption price the shares of Series H Preferred Stock that were to
be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof
shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series H Preferred Stock until such
time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall have been waived by
holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series H Preferred
Stock.

Section 7. Redemption Upon Maturity.
------------------------

(a) On December 30, 2004 (the "Maturity Date"), the
Corporation shall redeem (the "Maturity Redemption") the remaining outstanding
shares of the Series H Preferred Stock at a price per share (the "Maturity
Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the Liquidation Preference
per share, and (B) an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon,
whether or not declared or payable, to the Maturity Date in immediately
available funds.

requirement), not less than 30, nor more than 60, days prior to the Maturity
Date and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at least 30, but not
more than 60, days prior to the Maturity Date to each holder of shares of Series
H Preferred Stock, at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books
of the Corporation.

(c) On the Maturity Date, the Corporation shall, and at any
time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Maturity Date the
Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series H
Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or trust
company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well
capitalized within the meaning of applicable banking regulations and having a
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited by the
Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for
such redemption shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Maturity Redemption Price. Any interest
accrued and unpaid on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be
paid from time to time to the Corporation for its own account.

(d) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 7(c) in respect of shares of
Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 7(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Maturity Date, (i) the rights
to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of the
holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate,
excepting only the right to receive the Maturity Redemption Price therefor;
provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the
- - -------- -------
Maturity Redemption Price, the shares of Series H Preferred Stock that were to
be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof
shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series H Preferred Stock until such
time as such default shall no longer be continuing.

Section 8. Acquired Shares.
---------------

Any shares of Series H Preferred Stock exchanged, redeemed,
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or 

-99-

<PAGE>

any of its Subsidiaries in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled
promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares of Series H Preferred
Stock shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of
preferred stock, par value $4.00 per share, of the Corporation and, upon the
filing of an appropriate certificate with the Department of State of the State
of New York, may be reissued as part of another series of preferred stock, par
value $4.00 per share, of the Corporation subject to the conditions or
restrictions of issuance set forth herein, but in any event may not be reissued
as shares of Series H Preferred Stock or Parity Stock unless all of the shares
of Series H Preferred Stock issued on the Issue Date shall have already been
redeemed or exchanged.

thereto, the holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall have received
(A) if a Voluntary Liquidation Event shall have occurred, the Optional
Redemption Price with respect to each share and (B) if a Voluntary Liquidation
Event shall not have occurred, the Liquidation Preference and all accrued and

Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for
such exchange shall revert to the Corporation. After such reversion, any such
bank or trust company shall, upon demand, return to the Corporation such
unclaimed Subordinated Notes and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be
relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of shares of
Series H Preferred Stock to be exchanged shall look only to the Corporation for

(b) If (i) a private placement or public offering of the

shall receive at least $100,000,000 in gross proceeds is not consummated within
360 days after the termination of the Merger Agreement or (ii) the annual

breach, the annual rate of the cumulative cash dividends shall be increased to a

Agreement, (2) all dividends accrued to date on the Series T Preferred Stock

event of each and every subsequent event of the character indicated above.

(c) Dividends payable pursuant to Section 2(a) shall begin

determination of holders of shares of Series T Preferred Stock entitled to
receive payment of a dividend declared thereon, which record date shall be not
more than 60 days nor less than 10 days prior to the date fixed for the payment 
thereof. Accumulated but unpaid dividends for any past quarterly dividend
periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any regular
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on such date, not more
than 60 nor less than 10 days preceding the payment date thereof, as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors.

(d) The holders of shares of Series T Preferred Stock shall

-------- -------
that no separate vote of the holders of the Series T Preferred Stock as a class

Subsidiaries is a party, by applicable law or otherwise, (d) the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, including a majority of the directors who

to such shares held by any such holder who has theretofore notified the Cor-
poration (whether pursuant to Section 6(a)(iii) or otherwise) that it will not
require redemption of such shares) or (B) (1) the Corporation shall be the
resulting or surviving corporation, (2) the resulting or 

-106-
<PAGE>
surviving corporation will have after such recapitalization, reorganization,

preferences and special rights of any such Parity Stock) as may be issued in
exchange therefor), (3) each holder of shares of Series T Preferred Stock
immediately preceding such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or
merger will receive in exchange therefor the same number of shares of stock,
with the same preferences, rights and powers, of the resulting or surviving
corporation, (4) after such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or
merger the resulting or surviving corporation shall not be in breach of any of

any series of Chicago Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods or (ii)
a breach of any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement
or any of the Corporation's material obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement shall have occurred, then the number of directors constituting the
Board of Directors shall, without further action, be increased by two and the 
holders of shares of Series T Preferred Stock shall have, in addition to the 
other voting rights set forth herein with respect to the Series T 
Preferred Stock, the exclusive right, together with the holders of all
other series of Chicago Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single
class together with the holders of such other series of Chicago
Preferred Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such
newly created directorship, by written consent as provided herein, or
at a special meeting of such holders called as provided herein. Any
such additional directors shall continue as directors (subject to

of Series T Preferred Stock shall have such additional voting rights
until such time as (A) dividends then payable on all series of Chicago

<PAGE>

of the Corporation's material obligations under the Registration Rights

holders of shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, held for such purpose as
hereinafter provided or at any adjournment thereof, or by the written consent,
delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, of the holders of the minimum
number of shares required to take such action.

So long as such right to vote continues (and unless such
right has been exercised by written consent of the minimum number of shares
required to take such action), the President of the Corporation may call, and
upon the written request of holders of record of at least 5% of the aggregate
outstanding shares of Chicago Preferred Stock, addressed to the Secretary of the
Corporation at the principal office of the Corporation, shall call, a special
meeting of the holders of shares entitled to vote as provided herein. Such
meeting shall be held within 30 days after delivery of such request to the
Secretary, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the by-laws
of the Corporation for the holding of meetings of stockholders.

(ii) At each meeting of stockholders at which the holders
of shares of Series T Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting 
separately as a class together with the holders of all other series of
Chicago Preferred Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation as provided
in Section 3(b) or to take any action, the presence in person or by proxy of 
the holders of record of one-third of the total aggregate number of shares of
Chicago Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter 
shall be necessary and to constitute a quorum. At any such meeting or at any
adjournment thereof:

(A) the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of
Chicago Preferred Stock shall not prevent the election of
directors other than those to be elected by the holders of shares
of Chicago Preferred Stock, and the absence of a quorum of the
holders of shares of any other class or series of capital stock
shall not prevent the election of 

-108-

<PAGE>

directors to be elected by the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, or the taking of any action as provided in
Section 3(b); and

(B) in the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of

present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the
meeting as to the actions to be taken by the holders of shares of
Chicago Preferred Stock, from time to time and place to place
without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a
quorum shall be present.

For taking of any action as provided in Section 3(a) or
Section 3(b) by the holders of shares of Series T Preferred Stock, each such

the transfer books of the Corporation as of any record date fixed for such
purpose or, if no such date be fixed, at the close of business on the Business
Day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the day on which the

If any director so elected by the holders of Chicago Pre-
ferred Stock shall cease to serve as a director before his term shall expire
(except by reason of the termination of the voting rights accorded to the
holders of Chicago Preferred Stock, in accordance with Section 3(b)), the
holders of the Chicago Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote for
such director may, by written consent as provided herein, or at a special
meeting of such holders called as provided herein, elect a successor to hold
office for the unexpired term of the director whose place shall be vacant.

Any director elected by the holders of shares of Chicago
Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, may be removed from office
with or without cause only by the vote or written consent of the holders of at
least a majority of the aggregate outstanding shares of Chicago Preferred Stock

-109-

Section 5. Optional Redemption.
-------------------

(a) (i) The Corporation shall not have any right to redeem
any shares of Series T Preferred Stock prior to December 30, 2001. Thereafter,
(A) at any time, so long as shares of Common Stock shall have traded on the New
York Stock Exchange (or another national securities exchange or on Nasdaq) on
each trading day during a 30-consecutive trading day period (each of which
trading days shall be after December 30, 2001 and no more than 5 Business Days

December 30, 2003 to 100.925%
December 29, 2004

December 30, 2004 and 100%
thereafter

(ii) If the Corporation shall have the right to, or shall
determine to, redeem less than all the shares of Series T Preferred Stock then
outstanding pursuant to paragraph (i), the shares to be redeemed shall be
selected pro rata (as nearly as may be) so that the number of shares redeemed
from each holder shall be the same proportion of all the shares to be redeemed
that the total number of shares of Series T Preferred Stock then held by such
holder bears to the total number of shares of Series T Preferred Stock then
outstanding.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any shares of Series T
Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section 5(a) at any time when the
holders of shares of Series T Preferred Stock have the right to require the
Corporation to redeem the shares of Series T Preferred Stock pursuant to Section
6 or an event giving rise to such a right has occurred shall be redeemed at a
price equal to higher of the price to be paid in Section 5(a) and the price to
be paid pursuant to Section 6.

(b) Notice of any Optional Redemption shall specify the
Optional Redemption Date fixed for redemption, the Optional Redemption Price,
the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and
surrender of the shares of Series T Preferred Stock and that on and after the
date of such Optional Redemption dividends will cease to accrue on such shares
and be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough
of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by
applicable law, rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), not less
than 30, nor more than 45, days prior to the Optional Redemption Date; and, in
any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 45,
days prior to the Optional Redemption Date to each holder of shares of Series T
Preferred Stock, at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books
of the Corporation. In order to facilitate the redemption of shares of Series T

determination of shares of Series T Preferred Stock to be redeemed, or may cause
the transfer books of the Corporation for the Series T Preferred 

-112-

<PAGE>

Stock to be closed, not more than 60 days or less than 45 days prior to the
Optional Redemption Date.

(c) On the date of any Optional Redemption that is
specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 5(b), the Corporation shall, and
at any time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Optional
Redemption Date the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Series T Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with
a bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that
is "well capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable bank regulations and
having a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited
by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the Optional
Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series T Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Optional Redemption Price. Any interest
accrued on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be paid from time
to time to the Corporation for its own account.

(d) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 5(c) in respect of shares of
Series T Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 5(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Optional Redemption Date (i)
the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding, (ii) the
rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue, and (iii) all rights
of the holders of shares of Series T Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall cease
and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Optional Redemption Price
therefor; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the
-------- -------
payment of the Optional Redemption Price, the shares of Series T Preferred Stock
shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have
all of the rights of a holder of Series T Preferred Stock until such time as
such default or failure shall no longer be continuing or shall have been waived
by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series T Pre-
ferred Stock.

(e) Any notice that is mailed as herein provided shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of
shares of Series T Preferred Stock receives such notice, and failure to give
such notice by mail, or 

-113-

<PAGE>

any defect in such notice, to the holders of any shares designated for
redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption
of any other shares of Series T Preferred Stock. On or after the Optional
Redemption Date fixed for redemption as stated in such notice, each holder of
the shares called for redemption shall surrender the certificate evidencing such
shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice and shall
thereupon be entitled to receive payment of the Optional Redemption Price. If
less than all the shares evidenced by any such surrendered certificate are
redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued evidencing the unredeemed shares.

Section 6 Mandatory Redemption at the Option
of the Holder. 
---------------------------------

(a) (i) If one or more events constituting a Specified
Corporate Action shall occur, each holder of shares of the Series T Preferred
Stock shall have the right, at such holder's option on the date or dates
specified in Section 6(a)(ii) (the "Specified Corporate Action Redemption
Date"), to require the Corporation to redeem (a "Specified Corporate Action
Redemption") all or any part of the shares of Series T Preferred Stock then held
by such holder as such holder may elect at a price per share equal to the
greater of (I) the sum of (A) the following prices per share (stated as a
percentage of the Liquidation Preference of such share) and (B) an amount per
share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared
or payable, to the applicable Specified Corporate Action Redemption Date

If the Specified Corporate Specified Corporate Action

Occurs During the Period Liquidation Preference 
------------------------ ----------------------------

December 30, 1994 to 110.4%
June 29, 1995 

June 30, 1995 to 116.8%
December 29, 1995

December 30, 1995 to 126.7%
June 29, 1996

June 30, 1996 and 138.0%
thereafter

and (II) the sum of (x) 100% of the Liquidation Preference of such share, (y) an
amount per share equal to all accrued and 

-114-

<PAGE>
unpaid dividends thereon whether or not declared or payable to the Specified
Corporate Action Redemption Date and (z) the Additional Amount measured as of
the date of any such redemption, in either case in immediately available funds
(the "Specified Corporate Action Redemption Price").

(ii) The date fixed for each Specified Corporate Action
Redemption shall be fixed by the Corporation and shall be not less than 60 days
nor more than 90 days following the occurrence of any Specified Corporate Action
giving rise thereto (or, in the case of a Specified Corporate Action as
described in clause (iii) of the definition of "Specified Corporate Action," not
less than 60 days nor more than 90 days following the date on which the
Corporation obtains actual knowledge of such Specified Corporate Action);
provided, however, that in the event of a Specified Corporate Action that
- - -------- -------
constitutes a Control Transaction, in addition to the dates fixed for a
Specified Corporate Action Redemption as specified above, an additional
Specified Corporate Action Redemption Date shall be set for the date and time
immediately preceding the consummation of any such Control Transaction (and the
Market Price utilized in determining the Additional Amount for the purposes of
such Specified Corporate Action Redemption shall be the highest price per share
of Common Stock paid by any acquiror in such Control Transaction); provided,
--------
further, that, upon the request of a holder, the Board of Directors shall 
- - -------
agree to extend the date of redemption in respect of any such Specified
Corporate Action (without changing the consideration that is otherwise
payable in respect of such redemption other than with respect to
adjustments to the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends included in
such redemption price) to the extent necessary for any holder of
shares of Series T Preferred Stock to avoid liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, provided that no such redemption extension
--------
shall be for a period greater than six months. The Corporation shall, within 5
days of the occurrence of a Specified Corporate Action (or, in the case of a
Specified Corporate Action described in clause (iii) of the definition of
"Specified Corporate Action," within 5 days of the date on which the Corporation
obtains actual knowledge of such Specified Corporate Action), give notice
thereof by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by
applicable law, rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), and, in
any case, a similar notice shall be mailed to each holder of shares of the
Series T Preferred Stock, at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer
books of the Corporation. Each such notice shall specify the Specified
Corporate Action that has occurred and the date of such occurrence, the place or
places 

-115-

<PAGE>
of payment, the then effective Specified Corporate Action Redemption Price and
the date the right of such holder to require a Specified Corporate Action
Redemption shall terminate.

(iii) If the notice sent by the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6(a)(ii) shall contain (i) a form inquiring as to whether a holder of
shares of Series T Preferred Stock intends to surrender the certificate(s)
representing such shares for redemption pursuant to this Section 6(a) and (ii) a
stamped self-addressed envelope for return of such form to the Corporation or
its designee, within ten Business Days of such notice, each holder shall return
such inquiry form to the Corporation and shall indicate in such form the
proportion of such holder's shares of Series T Preferred Stock that will be
surrendered for redemption pursuant to this Section 6(a). If such notice shall
indicate that if a holder does not respond prior to ten Business Days after the
date of such notice that such holder will be deemed to have notified the
Corporation that it will not require the redemption of the shares of Series T
Preferred Stock held by such holder for purposes of Section 3(b) and such holder
does not respond to the Corporation's inquiry prior to ten Business Days after
the date of such notice, such holder will be deemed to have notified the Corpo-
ration that it will not require the redemption of the shares of Series T
Preferred Stock held by such holder for purposes of Section 3(b). Nothing
contained in this Section 6(a)(iii) shall affect the right of a holder of Series
T Preferred Stock to require the Corporation to redeem such shares pursuant to
Section 6(a)(i).

(b) If at any time the Additional Amount is greater than 0,
then each holder of shares of the Series T Preferred Stock shall have the right,
at such holder's option exercisable at any time (such time, the "Conversion
Date") on 30 days' notice to the Corporation, to require the Corporation to
redeem (a "Conversion Redemption") all or any part of the shares of Series T
Preferred Stock then held by such holder at a price per share (the "Conversion
Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the Liquidation Preference of
such shares, (B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon, whether or not declared or payable, to the applicable Conversion
Redemption Date and (C) the Additional Amount, in immediately available funds. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the redemption of any portion of such shares
would in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Corporation have a
material adverse effect on the Corporation, then the Corporation may elect to
deliver with respect to such shares, in lieu of cash, notes, including
subordinated notes, of the Corporation ("Notes") (x) having a final maturity
date no later than ten years from the date of issuance, and (y) having such
other 

-116-

<PAGE>

terms and conditions as shall result in a determination that such Notes have a
fair market value as of the date of their proposed issuance at least equal to
the sum of (1) the Conversion Redemption Price with respect to such shares and
(2) customary underwriting discounts and commissions payable with respect to the
sale of securities of a type comparable to the Notes, or shares of
nonconvertible preferred stock ("Redemption Preferred Stock") having the terms
and conditions described in clauses (x) and (y) in lieu of Notes. The
Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause the Notes or the Redemption
Preferred Stock to be registered for immediate resale pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act prior to the issuance thereof. 
If such registration statement is not effective within 120 days of the date of
such issuance then the annual interest rate of the Notes or the annual dividend
rate of the Redemption Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be increased by
0.5% per annum until such securities are sold pursuant to an effective reg-
istration statement under the Securities Act. For purposes of this Section
6(b), "fair market value" shall mean the fair market value of the Notes or Re-
demption Preferred Stock, as the case may be, as determined by an investment
banking firm of national standing selected by the Corporation and reasonably
acceptable to the holders of a majority of the shares of Series T Preferred
Stock electing to effect such Conversion Redemption. In the case that the Cor-
poration shall be entitled to deliver either Notes or Redemption Preferred
Stock, it shall be the election of the Corporation whether to deliver such Notes
or Redemption Preferred Stock, except that, if, the sale of the security to be
delivered by the Corporation to effect a Conversion Redemption would give rise
to an additional liability on the part of such holder upon the sale thereof and
it shall so notify the Corporation in writing, the Corporation shall deliver to
such holder the other type of security specified in such notice.

(c) Each holder of shares of the Series T Preferred Stock
shall have the right, at such holder's option exercisable at any time on 30
days' notice to the Corporation on or after December 30, 2009 (the date of any
such exercise, the "Special Redemption Date"), to require the Corporation to
redeem (a "Special Redemption") all or any part of the shares of Series T
Preferred Stock then held by such holder as such holder may elect by written
notice delivered at least 30 days prior to the Special Redemption Date at a
price per share equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the Liquidation Preference of
such share, (B) an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon whether or not declared or payable to the Special Redemption Date and
(C) the Additional Amount, determined as of the date immediately prior to the
Special Redemption Date (the "Special Redemption Price") in immediately
available funds.

-117-

<PAGE>
(d) On the date fixed for any Specified Corporate Action
Redemption or on any Conversion Redemption Date or Special Redemption Date, each
holder of shares of Series T Preferred Stock who elects to have shares of Series
T Preferred Stock held by it redeemed shall surrender the certificate
representing such shares to the Corporation (i) at the place designated in such
notice in the case of a Specified Corporate Action Redemption or (ii) at the
Corporation's principal place of business to be maintained by it, in the case of
a Conversion Redemption or Special Redemption, together with an election to have
such redemption made and shall thereupon be entitled to receive payment therefor
provided in this Section 6. If less than all the shares represented by any such
surrendered certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued rep-
resenting the unredeemed shares. From and after the date of such redemption (i)
the rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all
rights of the holders of shares of Series T Preferred Stock so redeemed shall
cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Specified Corporate
Action Redemption Price or Conversion Redemption Price or Special Redemption
Price therefor, as applicable; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall
-------- -------
default in the payment of the applicable redemption price the shares of Series T
Preferred Stock that were to be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to be
outstanding and the holders thereof shall have all of the rights of a holder of
Series T Preferred Stock until such time as such default shall no longer be
continuing or shall have been waived by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then
outstanding shares of Series T Preferred Stock.

Section 7. Redemption Upon Maturity.
------------------------

(a) On December 30, 2034 (the "Maturity Date"), the
Corporation shall redeem (the "Maturity Redemption") the remaining outstanding
shares of the Series T Preferred Stock at a price per share (the "Maturity
Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the Liquidation Preference
per share, (B) an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether
or not declared or payable, to the Maturity Date and (C) the Additional Amount,
determined as of the date immediately prior to the Maturity Date, in immediately
available funds.

(b) Notice of the Maturity Redemption shall be given by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by applicable law,
rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more
than 60, days prior to the Maturity Date and, in any case, a similar notice
shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the Maturity
Date to each holder of shares of Series T 

-118-

<PAGE>

Preferred Stock, at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books
of the Corporation.

(c) On the Maturity Date, the Corporation shall, and at any
time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Maturity Date the
Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series T
Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or trust
company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, that is "well
capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable banking regulations and having
a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any moneys so deposited by the
Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for
such redemption shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After
such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to
the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series T Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Maturity Redemption Price. Any interest
accrued and unpaid on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be
paid from time to time to the Corporation for its own account.

(d) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 7(c) in respect of shares of
Series T Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 7(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Maturity Date, (i) the rights
to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of the
holders of shares of Series T Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate,
excepting only the right to receive the Maturity Redemption Price therefor;
provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the
- - -------- -------
Maturity Redemption Price, the shares of Series T Preferred Stock that were to
be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof
shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series T Preferred Stock until such
time as such default shall no longer be continuing.

Section 8. Acquired Shares.
---------------

Any shares of Series T Preferred Stock exchanged, redeemed,
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in
any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the
acquisition thereof. All such shares of Series T Preferred Stock shall upon
their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, par
value $4.00 per share, of the Corporation and, upon 

-119-

<PAGE>
the filing of an appropriate certificate with the Department of State of the
State of New York, may be reissued as part of another series of preferred stock,
par value $4.00 per share, of the Corporation subject to the conditions or
restrictions on issuance set forth herein, but in any event may not be reissued
as shares of Series T Preferred Stock or Parity Stock unless all of the shares
of Series T Preferred Stock issued on the Issue Date shall have already been
redeemed or exchanged.

Section 9. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
--------------------------------------

(a) If the Corporation shall commence a voluntary case
under the United States bankruptcy laws or any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar law of any other country, or consent to the entry of an order for
relief in an involuntary case under any such law or to the appointment of a
receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other
similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property,
or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or admit in writing its
inability to pay its debts generally as they become due (any such event, a
"Voluntary Liquidation Event"), or if a decree or order for relief in respect of
the Corporation shall be entered by a court having jurisdiction in the premises
in an involuntary case under the United States bankruptcy laws or any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law of any other country, or appointing a
receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other
similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property,
or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and on account of any
such event the Corporation shall liquidate, dissolve or wind up, or if the
Corporation shall otherwise liquidate, dissolve or wind up, no distribution
shall be made (i) to the holders of shares of Junior Stock unless, prior
thereto, the holders of shares of Series T Preferred Stock shall have received
(A) if a Voluntary Liquidation Event shall have occurred, the Optional Redemp-
tion Price with respect to each share and (B) if a Voluntary Liquidation Event
shall not have occurred, the Liquidation Preference and all accrued and unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared or currently payable, to the date of
distribution, with respect to each share, or (ii) to the holders of shares of
Parity Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series T Preferred Stock

-120-

<PAGE>

(b) Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation
with or into any other Person nor the sale or transfer of all or any part of the
Corporation's assets for cash, securities or other property shall be deemed to
be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation for purposes of
this Section 9.

Section 10. [Intentionally omitted.]

Section 11. Additional Amount.
-----------------

(a) For the purposes of this Article 5, "Additional Amount"
shall mean an amount per share equal to the product of (i) the excess of the sum
of (1) the Market Price of a share of Common Stock and (2) if the Corporation
shall have issued a right or rights with respect to its outstanding shares of
Common Stock pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement, during the period commencing on the "distribution date" of such
right or rights (i.e., the date on which such right or rights commence to trade
----
separately from the Common Stock) and ending on the "triggering date" of such
right or rights (i.e., the date on which such right or rights commence to be
----
exercisable), the Market Price of such right or rights over the Conversion
Amount, in effect as hereinafter determined and (ii) (x) the Liquidation
Preference divided by (y) such Conversion Amount, in all cases calculated as of
the applicable determination date. The Additional Amount shall in no event be
less than zero. The Conversion Amount initially shall be $15.75, and shall
thereafter be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 11(b). For the
purpose of calculating the Additional Amount in connection with an Optional
Redemption, Specified Corporate Action Redemption, Special Redemption or
Conversion Redemption, except as otherwise set forth in Section 6(a)(ii), the
Market Price of the Common Stock and, if applicable, rights shall be the average
of the Market Price of such securities on the five trading days immediately
preceding and the five trading days immediately following the date of notice of
such redemption.

(b) The Conversion Amount shall be subject to adjustment as
follows:

(i) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding shares
of Common Stock in Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment
plan approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors), (B) subdivide the out-
standing shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (C) combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (D) issue
any shares of its 

-121-

<PAGE>
capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock, then, and in each such
case, the Conversion Amount in effect immediately prior to such event shall be
adjusted so that if the holder of any share of Series T Preferred Stock were
entitled to convert such share into such number of shares of Common Stock as
equals the Liquidation Preference divided by the Conversion Amount and such
holder thereafter surrendered such share for conversion, such holder would be
entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of
the Corporation that such holder would have owned or would have been entitled to
receive upon or by reason of any of the events described above had such share of
Series T Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior to the occurrence of
such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 11(b)(i) shall become
effective retroactively (A) in the case of any such dividend or distribution, to
the opening of business on the day immediately following the close of business
on the record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive such dividend or distribution or (B) in the case of any such
subdivision, combination or reclassification, to the close of business on the
day upon which such corporate action becomes effective.

(ii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time issue or sell shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or any options, warrants or
other rights to acquire shares of Common Stock (other than options granted to
any employee or director of the Corporation pursuant to a stock option plan
approved by the shareholders of the Corporation)) for a consideration per share
less than the Conversion Amount then in effect at the record date or issuance
date, as the case may be (the "Date") referred to in the following sentence,
including, without limitation, upon exercise of rights issued pursuant to a
shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar arrangement (treating the
price per share of any security convertible or exchangeable or exercisable into
Common Stock as equal to (A) the sum of the price for such security convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock plus any additional consideration
payable (without regard to any antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion,
exchange or exercise of such security into Common Stock divided by (B) the
number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying such convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable security), other than issuances or sales for which
an adjustment is made pursuant to another paragraph of this Section 11(b), then,
and in each such case, the Conversion Amount then in effect shall be adjusted by
dividing the Conversion Amount in effect on the day immediately prior to the
Date by a fraction (x) the numerator of which 

-122-

<PAGE>

shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock issued or
to be issued (or the maximum number into which such convertible or exchangeable
securities initially may convert or exchange or for which such options, warrants
or other rights initially may be exercised) and (y) the denominator of which
shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Date plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration (if any of such aggregate consideration is other than cash, as
valued by the Board of Directors including a majority of the Directors who are
not officers or employees of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, which
determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of
Directors) for the total number of such additional shares of Common Stock so
issued (or into which such convertible or exchangeable securities may convert or
exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights may be exercised
plus the aggregate amount of any additional consideration initially payable upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of such security) would purchase at the
Conversion Amount. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such shares,
securities, options, warrants or other rights are issued, and shall become
effective retroactively to a date immediately following the close of business
(i) in the case of issuance to stockholders of the Corporation, as such, on the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
shares, securities, options, warrants or other rights and (ii) in all other
cases, on the date ("issuance date") of such issuance; provided, however, that
-------- -------
the determination as to whether an adjustment is required to be made pursuant to
this Section 11(b)(ii) shall only be made upon the issuance of such shares or
such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights,
and not upon the issuance of the security into which such convertible or
exchangeable security converts or exchanges, or the security underlying such
option, warrants or other right; provided, further, that if any convertible or
-------- -------
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights (or any portions
thereof) that shall have given rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section
11(b)(ii) shall have expired or terminated without the exercise thereof and/or
if by reason of the terms of such convertible or exchangeable securities,
options, warrants or other rights there shall have been an increase or
increases, with the passage of time or otherwise, in the price payable upon the
exercise or conversion thereof, then the Conversion Amount hereunder shall be
readjusted (but to no greater extent than originally adjusted) on the basis of
(x) eliminating from the computation any additional shares of Common Stock cor-
responding to such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or
other rights 

-123-

<PAGE>
as shall have expired or terminated, (y) treating the additional shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued or issuable pursuant to the previous
exercise of such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or
other rights as having been issued for the consideration actually received and
receivable therefor and (z) treating any of such convertible or exchangeable
securities, options, warrants or other rights that remain outstanding as being
subject to exercise or conversion on the basis of such exercise or conversion
price as shall be in effect at the time.

(iii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from
time to time distribute to all holders of shares of its Common Stock (including
any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which
the Corporation is the resulting or surviving corporation and the Common Stock
is not changed or exchanged or a redemption of any rights or other securities
issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement) cash, evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation or another
issuer, securities of the Corporation or another issuer or other assets
(excluding (A) Permitted Dividends described in clause (B) of the definition
thereof and (B) securities for which adjustment is made under Section 11(b)(i)
or Section 11(b)(ii)), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Amount then
in effect shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Amount in effect
immediately prior to the date of such distribution by a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the
record date referred to below and (y) the denominator of which shall be such
Current Market Price of the Common Stock less the then Fair Market Value (as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, which determination
shall be conclusive) of the portion of the cash, evidences of indebtedness,
securities or other assets so distributed or of such subscription rights or
warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock (but such denominator not to be
less than one). Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is
made and shall become effective retroactively to a date immediately following
the close of business on the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such distribution.

(iv) In the case the Corporation at any time or from
time to time shall take any action affecting its Common Stock, other than an
action described in any of Section 11(b)(i) through Section 11(b)(iii),
inclusive, then, the Conversion Amount shall be adjusted in such manner and at
such time as the Board of Directors of the Corporation (other than Purchaser
Designees or directors elected pursuant to Section 

-124-

<PAGE>

3(b)) in good faith determines to be equitable in the circumstances (such
determination to be evidenced in a resolution, a certified copy of which shall
be mailed to the holders of the Series T Preferred Stock).

(v) The Corporation may make such reductions in the
Conversion Amount, in addition to those required by subparagraphs (i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv) of this Section 11(b), as the Board of Directors considers to be
advisable in order to avoid or to diminish any income tax to holders of Common
Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or
distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as
such for income tax purposes.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section
11(b), no adjustment to the Conversion Amount shall be made with respect to any
rights issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement unless the "triggering date" (i.e., the date on which such rights
----
commence to be exercisable) shall have occurred or such rights shall have been
redeemed, in which event adjustments under clause (ii) and clause (iii),
respectively, shall be made.

(c) If the Corporation shall take a record of the holders
of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or
other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to
stockholders thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or
distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Amount then in
effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.

(d) Upon any increase or decrease in the Conversion Amount,
then, and in each such case, the Corporation promptly shall deliver to each
registered holder of Series T Preferred Stock at least 10 Business Days prior to
effecting any of the foregoing transactions a certificate, signed by the
President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, setting forth in
reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which
such adjustment was calculated and specifying the increased or decreased Con-
version Amount then in effect following such adjustment.

Section 12. Sinking Fund.
-------------

(a) So long as any shares of Series T Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, the Corporation shall, on the final business day (any such date,
the "Sinking Fund Date") of each calendar year after 2003, (i) set aside a sum
of money equal to 

-125-

<PAGE>
3-1/3% of the aggregate liquidation preference of the shares of Series T
Preferred Stock then outstanding, and (ii) apply such money to redeem such
number of shares of Series T Preferred Stock at the Sinking Fund Redemption
Price (the Corporation's obligations described in this paragraph in respect of
any Sinking Fund Date being hereinafter referred to as the "Sinking Fund
Obligation" for such date) at a price per share (the "Sinking Fund Redemption
Price") equal to the sum of (A) the Liquidation Preference of such share, (B) an
amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or
not declared or payable, to the applicable Sinking Fund Date and (C) the
Additional Amount (as defined in Section 11), determined as of the date
immediately prior to the Sinking Fund Date, in immediately available funds;
provided, however, that if the Corporation for any reason fails to discharge its
- - -------- -------
Sinking Fund Obligation on any Sinking Fund Date, such Sinking Fund Obligation,
to the extent not discharged, shall become an additional Sinking Fund Obligation
for each succeeding Sinking Fund Date until fully discharged; provided, further,
-------- -------
that no shares of Series T Preferred Stock purchased or acquired by the
Corporation otherwise than through redemption pursuant to this paragraph or
pursuant to an Optional Redemption may be credited against the Sinking Fund
Obligation in respect of any Sinking Fund Date.

(b) Notice of the Sinking Fund Redemption shall be given by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York (if such publication shall be required by applicable law,
rule, regulation or securities exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more
than 60, days prior to the Sinking Fund Date and, in any case, a similar notice
shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the Sinking
Fund Date to each holder of shares of Series T Preferred Stock, at such holder's
address as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation.

(c) The shares to be redeemed pursuant to paragraph (a)
shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be) so that the number of shares
redeemed from each holder shall be the same proportion of all the shares to be
redeemed that the total number of shares of Series T Preferred Stock then held
by such holder bears to the total number of shares of Series T Preferred Stock
then outstanding.

(d) On the Sinking Fund Date, the Corporation shall, and at
any time after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Sinking Fund
Date the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Series T Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or
trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New 

-126-

<PAGE>

York, that is "well capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable banking
regulations and having a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Any
moneys so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years
from the date designated for such redemption shall revert to the general funds
of the Corporation. After such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall,
upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon
such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect
thereof and any holder of shares of Series T Preferred Stock to be redeemed
shall look only to the Corporation for the payment of the Sinking Fund Re-
demption Price. Any interest accrued and unpaid on funds deposited pursuant to
this Section 12(c) shall be paid from time to time to the Corporation for its
own account.

(e) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
upon the deposit of funds pursuant to Section 12(c) in respect of shares of
Series T Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to Section 12(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Sinking Fund Date, (i) the
rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of
the holders of shares of Series T Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate,
excepting only the right to receive the Sinking Fund Redemption Price therefor;
provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the
- - -------- -------
Sinking Fund Redemption Price, the shares of Series T Preferred Stock that were
to be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders
thereof shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series T Preferred Stock
until such time as such default shall no longer be continuing.

Section 13. Exchange for Series E Preferred Stock.
--------------------------------------

(a) Exchange. Outstanding shares of Series T Preferred
--------
Stock shall be exchangeable at any time and from time to time by the holder
thereof into shares of Series E Preferred Stock having the same aggregate liqui-
dation preference as the shares of Series T Preferred Stock exchanged therefor,
upon two business days' written notice by such holder of the election to effect
such exchange (each such exchange, an "Exchange" and all such Exchanges
collectively, the "Exchange"), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all
applicable conditions set forth in Section 13(b), and, upon any such Exchange,

hereby grants to the Optionee, for the period beginning on (x) if the Merger
-

Agreement terminates pursuant to Section 7.1(iv) or Section 7.1(vii) thereof,

the Termination Date or (y) if the Merger Agreement terminates other than
-

pursuant to Section 7.1(iv) or Section 7.1(vii) thereof, the earlier of the

120th day after the Termination Date or the date of the occurrence of a

Specified Corporate Action (the "Commencement Date"), and ending at

December __, 2001 (the "Expiration Date"), the exclusive and irrevocable right

and option (this "Option") 

<PAGE>

to purchase from the Corporation for cash in an amount equal to $125,000,000.00

(the "Exercise Price") a total of 62,500 shares (the "Shares") of Cumulative

Preferred Stock, Series G (the "Series G Preferred Stock"), par value $4.00 per

share, of the Corporation, as such Series G Preferred Stock is designated in the

Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation. Accordingly, the exercise

price per Share shall be $200.00 (the "Exercise Price Per Share"). Notwith-

standing the foregoing, if, prior to the Commencement Date, all then outstanding

Chicago Preferred Stock is redeemed or purchased pursuant to Section 15 of the

Securities Purchase Agreement, the Option will terminate and such date of re-

demption or purchase will be deemed to be the Expiration Date. 

2. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
-------------

shall have the meanings specified in the Securities Purchase Agreement.

3. Exercise of Option. This Option may be exercised in whole or in
------------------

part by the Optionee from time to time between the Commencement Date and the

Expiration Date. Upon any partial exercise of this Option, the remainder of

this Option shall remain in effect and may be exercised at any time or times

thereafter until the Expiration Date. If the Optionee wishes to exercise this

Option, the Optionee 

2

<PAGE>

shall send a written notice to the Corporation specifying its intention to

exercise this Option and setting forth a date (not less than 5 business days and

not more than 10 business days from the date of such notice), time and place for

the closing of such purchase. The place specified in such notice shall be the

offices of the Corporation unless otherwise agreed to by the Optionee and the

Corporation. Each date on which the notice is sent to the Corporation by a

means provided for in Section 8.3 hereof shall be deemed to be the exercise date

with respect to such purchase and is referred to herein as the "Exercise Date." 

The Option may be exercised only with respect to full shares of Series G

Preferred Stock. No fractional shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall be

issued.

4. Payment and Delivery of Certificates.
------------------------------------

a. Delivery of Funds and the Acknowledgement. Upon any
-----------------------------------------

exercise of all or any part of this Option, the Optionee shall on the Exercise

Date (i) deliver to the Corporation an Election to Exercise in the form of

Exhibit A hereto and (ii) make payment to the Corporation of the aggregate

Exercise Price Per Share for the Shares being purchased by delivery of a

certified or bank check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a

bank designated by the Corporation.

3

<PAGE>

b. Delivery of the Shares. Upon payment (or deemed payment in
----------------------

accordance with Section 4.1) of the Exercise Price Per Share for the Shares

being purchased, the Corporation shall deliver to the Optionee certificates

representing the number of Shares being purchased by the Optionee from the

Corporation, registered in the name of the Optionee. The issuance of any Shares

upon the exercise of this Option and the delivery of certificates representing

such Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any tax or other

charge in respect of such issuance.

c. Put Option. At any time that the Optionee would be entitled
----------

to cause the redemption of any Shares pursuant to Article 3, Section 6 of the

Certificate of Amendment if it were the holder of such Shares, in lieu of

exercising all or any part of this Option, the Optionee may, in the case of the

Holder's Election Redemption, the first anniversary of the Commencement Date or,

in the case of any other redemption, at any time on or after the Commencement

Date, instead require the Corporation to repurchase this Option (or any portion

thereof) for cash at a price equal to the Value (as hereinafter defined for pur-

poses of this Section 4.3) of this Option. For purposes of this Section 4.3,

the Value of this Option (or such portion) shall equal the product of (i) the
-

number of Shares for 

4

<PAGE>

which this Option (or such portion) is exercisable, multiplied by (ii) the
--

excess, if any, of (A) the applicable redemption price per Share at such time
-

pursuant to Article 3, Section 6 of the Certificate of Amendment (which will be,

in each case hereunder, the sum of (x) 100% of the Liquidation Preference of

such share and (y) the Additional Amount), over (B) the Exercise Price Per
-

Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable redemption price is the

Holder's Election Redemption Price and the redemption of any portion of this

Option would (I) cause any two of Standard's & Poor's ("S&P"), Moody's Investor
-

Services ("Moody's") and A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best") to downgrade the rating

of (a) the Corporation's securities, in the case of S&P or Moody's or (b) the

pooled rating of the Subsidiaries of the Corporation engaged in the insurance

business, in the case of A.M. Best or (II) in the reasonable judgment of the
--

Board of Directors of the Corporation have a material adverse effect on the

financial condition of the Corporation, then the Corporation may elect to

deliver with respect to such portion of this Option in lieu of cash senior non-

convertible notes of the Corporation ("Notes") (x) having a final maturity date

no later than December 31, 2006, and (y) having such other terms and conditions

as shall result in a determination that such Notes have a fair market value as

of 

5

<PAGE>

the date of their proposed issuance at least equal to the sum of (1) the Value

of this Option (or such portion) and (2) customary underwriting discounts and

commissions payable with respect to the sale of securities of a type comparable

to the Notes; provided, however, that if the issuance of senior nonconvertible
-------- -------

notes would cause the event described in clause (I) of this sentence or in the
-

reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of the Corporation have a material

adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation, then the

Corporation may elect to issue, in lieu of senior nonconvertible notes, subordi-

nated nonconvertible notes (in which case the term "Notes" shall mean such

subordinated nonconvertible notes) or shares of nonconvertible preferred stock

("Redemption Preferred Stock"), in each case having the terms and conditions

described in clauses (x) and (y) of this sentence. The Corporation shall use

its best efforts to cause the Notes or the Redemption Preferred Stock to be

registered for immediate resale pursuant to an effective registration under the

Act prior to the issuance thereof. If such registration statement is not

effective within 60 days of the date of such issuance then the annual interest

rate of the Notes or the annual dividend rate of the Redemption Preferred Stock,

as applicable, shall be increased by 0.5% per annum until such securities are

sold 

6

<PAGE>

pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act. For purposes of

this Section 4.3 "fair market value" shall mean the fair market value of the

Notes or Redemption Preferred Stock, as the case may be, as determined by an

investment banking firm of national standing selected by the Corporation and

reasonably acceptable to the Optionees electing to effect such Holder's Election

Redemption. In the case that the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver

either subordinated nonconvertible notes or Redemption Preferred Stock, it shall

be the election of the Corporation whether to deliver such Notes or Redemption

Preferred Stock, except that, if the sale of the security to be delivered by the

Corporation pursuant to the terms hereof would give rise to an additional

liability on the part of the Optionee and it shall so notify the Corporation in

writing, the Corporation shall deliver the type of security specified in such

notice.

5. Transfer.
--------

a. Restrictions on Transferability. The Optionee will not
-------------------------------

effect any sale, assignment, transfer, disposition by gift or distribution in

liquidation or otherwise ("Transfer") (including any Transfer upon foreclosure

of a pledge or other security interest), pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or

grant of a security interest of or in this 

7

<PAGE>

Option or any of the Shares or any Subordinated Notes issued upon exchange for

the Shares (the "Exchange Notes") that under applicable law requires prior

regulatory approval until such regulatory approval has been obtained. The

Optionee agrees that, until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time (as such term

is defined in the Merger Agreement) and (ii) the Termination Date, it will not

Transfer any portion of the Option, except to an Affiliate of the Optionee who

agrees to be bound by the restrictions of this Section 5 and of Sections 6.1 and

6.4 of the Securities Purchase Agreement. The Optionee will not Transfer,

pledge, mortgage, hypothecate or grant a security interest in this Option, any

of the Shares or Exchange Notes (unless, with respect to such Shares or Exchange

Notes, such Shares or Exchange Notes were previously issued pursuant to an

effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended

(the "Act")) except pursuant to (A) an effective registration statement under

the Act or (B) an applicable exemption from registration under the Act. In

connection with any Transfer by the Optionee pursuant to clause (B) of the

immediately preceding sentence, the Optionee shall furnish to the Corporation an

opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to the effect that

the proposed transfer or conveyance would not be in violation of the Act. The 

8

<PAGE>

Optionee may not, during the period (the "Restricted Period") ending upon the

earliest to occur of (i) the third anniversary of the date hereof, (ii) a Change

of Control, (iii) a breach by the Corporation of any of its obligations under

any of Sections 6.6, 6.13, 6.14, 6.16, 6.17, 6.18 or Section 14 of the

Securities Purchase Agreement or any of its material obligations under the

Registration Rights Agreement or any of its material obligations under the

Merger Agreement giving rise to a right of termination under Section 7.1(iv)

thereof, and (iv) the date on which the full amount of dividends payable on the

Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock,

Series H Preferred Stock or Series T Preferred Stock for any two quarterly

dividend periods shall not have been paid, the Optionee will not Transfer any

portion of the Option, the Shares or the Exchange Notes except (1) to an

Affiliate of the Purchaser, who agrees to be bound by the restrictions of this

Section 5.1 and Sections 6.1 and 6.4 of the Securities Purchase Agreement,

(2) to a person or entity who agrees to be bound by the restrictions of this

Section 5.1 and Sections 6.1 and 6.4 of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the

Transfer to whom has been approved in advance by the Board of Directors of the

Corporation, (3) to a person or entity who after such Transfer will beneficially

own (to the know

9

<PAGE>

ledge of the Optionee, based solely on the representation and warranty of such

person or entity, and knowledge available from a review of publicly available

filings made by such person or entity with respect to the beneficial ownership

of Common Stock under Section 13 of the Exchange Act) less than 5% of the Common

Stock on a fully diluted basis, (4) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act, or (5)

pursuant to a tender offer (a) commenced by the Corporation or (b) commenced by

any other person or entity with respect to which the Board of Directors of the

Corporation shall send to shareholders a statement that the Board of Directors

(x) recommends approval of such tender offer, or (y) is neutral with respect to

such tender offer. Other than as set forth in the first sentence of this

Section 5.1, nothing contained in this Section 5.1 shall restrict or prohibit

the Purchaser from pledging, mortgaging, hypothecating or granting a security

interest in, or granting participation rights in, the Option, the Shares or the

Exchange Notes; provided, however, that if a pledgee, mortgagee or holder of
-------- -------

such security interest forecloses on the Option, the Shares or the Exchange

Notes during the Restricted Period, it may do so only if such pledgee, mortgagee

or holder of such security interest agrees to be bound by the restrictions of

this Section 5.1 and Sections 6.1 and 6.4 of the Securities 

10

<PAGE>

Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if none of the events

specified in any of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) above has occurred (whether

before or after termination of the Restricted Period), then the Purchaser shall

not, prior to the fifth anniversary of December __, 1994, Transfer any portion

of the Option, the Shares or the Exchange Notes to any person or entity who

after such Transfer will own (to the knowledge of the Purchaser, based solely on

the representations and warranty of the Person, and knowledge available from a

review of publicly available filings made by such person or entity with respect

to the beneficial ownership of Common Stock under Section 13 of the Exchange

Act) more than 5% of the Common Stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis,

unless such person or entity agrees to be bound by the terms and restrictions of

the penultimate sentence of Section 6.1, Section 6.4 and Section 7 of the

Purchase Agreement and this penultimate sentence of Section 6.1 of the Purchase

Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall

prohibit any Transfer, pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or grant of a security

interest of or in the Option by any insurance regulator acting as conservator or

receiver.

been disposed of in accordance with such registration statement, (ii) this

Option shall have been sold as permitted by Rule 144 under the Act and the

purchaser thereof does not receive "restricted securities" as defined in Rule

144 or (iii) this Option shall have been otherwise transferred, a new Option not

bearing a legend restricting further transfer shall have been delivered by the

Corporation and subsequent public distribution of this Option shall not in the

opinion of counsel to the Optionee require registration under the Act, this

Option shall be subject to a stop-transfer order and shall bear the legend set

forth hereon. So long as the Shares or Exchange Notes are Registrable

Securities, the Shares or Exchange Notes shall be subject to a stop-transfer

order and shall bear the following legend by which each holder thereof shall be

bound:

"[THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE AND ANY SHARES OR OTHER
SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON EXCHANGE HEREOF] [THIS NOTE] MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR
SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO (i) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR (ii) AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION
THEREOF. ANY SALE PURSUANT TO CLAUSE (ii) OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE MUST
BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE
ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES TO THE EFFECT SUCH SALE IS NOT IN VIOLATION OF
THE ACT."

c. Removal of Legends. After termination of the requirement
------------------

that all or part of such legend be placed 

12

<PAGE>

upon this Option, a certificate representing the Shares or an Exchange Note, the

Corporation shall, upon receipt by the Corporation of evidence reasonably

satisfactory to it that such requirement has terminated and upon the written

request of the holder of this Option, such Shares or such Exchange Note, issue a

new Option, certificate for such Shares or Exchange Note that does not bear such

legend.

d. Transfer of Option. Subject to Section 5.1, this Option
-------------------

shall be transferable, in whole or in part, upon delivery thereof to the

Corporation accompanied by an Assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit B

hereto duly endorsed by the Optionee. Upon any registration of transfer, the

Corporation shall deliver a new Option to the person entitled thereto. This

Option may be exchanged, at the option of the Optionee, for another Option, or

other Options of different denominations, of like tenor and representing in the

aggregate the right to purchase a like number of Shares upon surrender to the

Corporation. 

6. Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall retain and reserve
----------------------

a sufficient number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock in order to meet its

obligation hereunder. The Corporation agrees not to issue, sell, assign,

pledge, hypothecate, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of

-------------------------------------

any Shares upon exercise of this Option, without the prior written consent of

the Optionee, the Corporation will not (i) alter or repeal the Certificate of

Incorporation so as to affect the holders of Series G Preferred Stock adversely

or (ii) authorize, adopt or approve an amendment to the Certificate of

Incorporation that would increase or decrease the par value of the Series G

Preferred Stock, or alter or change the powers, preference or special rights of

the Series G Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this

Section 7 shall prohibit the Corporation from effecting a recapitalization,

reorganization, consolidation or merger of, or sale by, the Corporation prior to

the Commencement Date or, if after the Commencement Date, if (A)(a) such

recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger or sale constitutes a

Agreement"), the Purchaser has agreed to purchase from the Company, and the
Company has agreed to issue to the Purchaser, (i) shares of the Company's
Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series T, par value $4.00 per share (the "Series T

2. Registration Under Securities Act, etc.

2.1 Shelf Registration.

request, on or before eleven months after the Merger Termination Date, the
Company shall file a "shelf" registration statement with respect to the
Registrable Securities (as defined below) and pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act (the "Shelf Registration"); provided, however, that if the
Company and a majority of the holders of Registrable Securities agree that it
would not be in the best interest of the Company or the holders to file a
"shelf" registration statement, the Company may file such other registration
statement or registration statements as is appropriate, each of which registra-
tion statement will be deemed to be a Shelf Registration Statement for all
purposes of this Agreement except those relating to the continuous effectiveness
of such registration statement. The Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-3 (or
any successor form) if the Company is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or such
successor form). The Company shall use its best efforts to have the Shelf
Registration declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable after such
filing, and shall use its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration
continuously effective, subject to Section 2.6(a), from the date such Shelf
Registration is declared effective until such time as all of the Registrable
Securities shall cease to be Registrable Securities. 

(II) Series T Demand Registration. At any time after the
Merger Termination Date, if the Purchaser shall hold shares of Series T
Preferred Stock, the Purchaser shall have the right to make one written request
that the Company effect the registration under the Securities Act of all (but
not less than all) of the outstanding shares of Series T Preferred Stock owned
by the Purchaser (the "Series T Demand Registration") and all Series E Preferred
Stock exchangeable for such Series T Preferred Stock, which Series T Demand
Registration shall specify that the Series T Preferred Stock is to be
distributed in a widely disbursed, underwritten public offering, that will not
require regulatory approval of any governmental agency (other than under the
Securities Act or the Hart-Scott-Rodino Anti-Trust Improvements Act of 1976 (the
"HSR")). The Series T Demand Registration will require that consummation of the
Exchange of Series T Preferred Stock for Series E Preferred Stock on 

2

<PAGE>

a share for share basis occurs upon purchase of the Series T Preferred Stock in
such underwritten public offering. The Series T Preferred Stock Demand
Registration will require, in conformity with the terms of the Certificate of
Amendment, and Sections 14.1 and 14.2 of the Purchase Agreement, that the terms
of the applicable underwriting agreement shall obligate the several underwriters
to ensure that the distribution of Series E Preferred Stock does not require
regulatory approval (other than under the Securities Act or the HSR). Included
as part of the Purchaser's notice to the Company of the Series T Demand
Registration shall be separate opinions of counsel to the Purchaser and counsel
to the managing underwriter(s), each of which counsel shall be acceptable to the
Company, which opinions shall each state, in terms satisfactory to the Company,
that the sale of securities contemplated by, and in the manner set forth in, the
Series T Demand Registration does not require regulatory approval.

(III) Obligation to Effect Registration. Upon receipt of
the Series T Demand Registration and the opinion of counsel referenced in
section 2.1(a)(II) hereof, the Company will promptly use commercially reasonable
efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of the Series T
Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock relating to such Series T
Preferred Stock, which the Company has been so requested to register pursuant to
section 2.1(a)(II), all to the extent required to permit the disposition (in
accordance with the required method of disposition as aforesaid) of the Series T
Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock so to be registered and will
use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC within 60 days of such
demand a Registration Statement (the "Series T Demand Registration Statement")
for such Series T Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock; provided that
the Company will not be required to effect any Series T Preferred Stock Demand
Registration if the terms of such registration, including but not limited to the
proposed method of distribution, violate the provisions of the Certificate of
Amendment.

(b) Supplements and Amendments; Expenses. The Company
shall supplement or amend, if necessary, the Shelf Registration and such other
registration statement(s) as may be filed pursuant to section 2.1(a) (the "Other
Registration Statements") as required by the regis

3

<PAGE>

tration form utilized by the Company or by the instructions applicable to such
registration form or by the Securities Act or as reasonably required by the
Purchaser or the holder or holders of (or any underwriter for) a majority of the
Registrable Securities and the Company shall furnish to the holders of the
Registrable Securities to which the Shelf Registration relates copies of any
such supplement or amendment prior to its being used and/or filed with the
Commission. The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with
the Shelf Registration and the Other Registration Statements, if any, whether or
not they become effective, and whether all, none or some of the Registrable
Securities are sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration or the Other Registration
Statements, if any. In no event shall the Shelf Registration or the Other
Registration Statements, if any, include securities other than Registrable
Securities, unless the Purchaser consents to such inclusion.

(c) Underwriting Procedures. If the Purchaser so elects
or, in the event the Purchaser does not hold 50% of the Registrable Securities,
if the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities so elect, the offer-
ing of all or a portion of such Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration shall be in the form of an underwritten offering and the managing
underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering shall be selected by the
Purchaser or such holders, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the
Company. The Purchaser or such holders shall provide the Company with notice of
the identity of the managing underwriter or underwriters it or they have
selected a reasonable time prior to the commencement of any such underwritten
offering.

2.2 Incidental Registration.

(a) Right to Include Registrable Securities. If at any
time subsequent to the first anniversary of the Merger Termination Date the
Company at any time proposes to register any of its Common Stock under the
Securities Act by registration on any form other than Form S-4 or S-8, whether
or not for sale for its own account, it will each such time give prompt written
notice to all registered holders of Registrable Securities of its intention to
do so and of such holders' rights under this Section 2.2. Upon the written
request of any such holder (a "Requesting Holder") made as promptly as
practicable and in any event within 20 days after the receipt of any such notice
(10 days 

4

<PAGE>

if the Company states in such written notice or gives telephonic or telecopied
notice to all registered holders of Registrable Securities, with written
confirmation to follow promptly thereafter, stating that (i) such registration
will be on Form S-3 and (ii) such shorter period of time is required because of
a planned filing date) (which request shall specify the Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by such Requesting Holder and the intended method of
disposition), the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the
registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities that the
Company has been so requested to register by the Requesting Holders thereof to
the extent required to permit the disposition of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended methods thereof described as aforesaid; provided,
however, that prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in
connection with such registration, immediately upon notification to the Company
from the managing underwriter of the price at which such securities are to be
sold, if such price is below the price which any Requesting Holder shall have
indicated to be acceptable to such Requesting Holder, the Company shall so
advise such Requesting Holder of such price, and such Requesting Holder shall
then have the right to withdraw its request to have its Registrable Securities
included in such registration statement; provided further, that if, at any time
after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and
prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection
with such registration, the Company shall determine for any reason not to
register or to delay registration of such securities, the Company may, at its
election, give written notice of such determination to each Requesting Holder of
Registrable Securities and (i) in the case of a determination not to register,
shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable Securities in
connection with such registration (but not from any obligation of the Company to
pay the Registration Expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice,
however, to the rights of any holder or holders of Registrable Securities under
Section 2.1, and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registering, shall
be permitted to delay registering any Registrable Securities, for the same
period as the delay in registering such other securities. No registration
effected under this Section 2.2 shall relieve the Company of its obligations
under Section 2.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Shelf Registration is
effective at the time the Company proposes to effect a registration subject to
this Section 2.2(a), the Company shall have no obligation to 

5

<PAGE>

notify the holders of Registrable Securities or effect the registration of any
such securities under this Section 2.2(a) unless the securities to be registered
by the Company are to be disposed of in an underwritten offering.

(b) Priority in Incidental Registrations. If the managing
underwriter of any underwritten offering shall inform the Company by letter
that, in its opinion, the number or type of Registrable Securities requested to
be included in such registration would adversely affect such offering, and the
Company has so advised the Requesting Holders in writing, then the Company will
include in such registration, to the extent of the number and type that the
Company is so advised can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering,
first, all securities proposed by the Company to be sold for its own account,
second, such Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration pursuant to this Agreement, pro rata among such Requesting Holders
on the basis of the estimated proceeds from the sale thereof and, third, all
other securities proposed to be registered.

(c) Expenses. The Company will pay all Registration
Expenses in connection with any registration effected pursuant to this Section
2.2.

2.3 Registration Procedures. If and when-ever the Company is
required to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the
Securities Act as provided in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the Company will, as
expeditiously as possible:

(i) prepare and file with the Commission the requisite
registration statement to effect such registration and thereafter use its
best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective;
provided, however, that the Company may discontinue any registration of its
securities that are not Registrable Securities (and, under the circum-
stances specified in Section 2.2(a), its securities that are Registrable
Securities) at any time prior to the effective date of the registration
statement relating thereto;

(ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments
and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration 

6

<PAGE>

statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by
such registration statement until such time as all of such Registrable
Securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of
disposition by the seller or sellers thereof set forth in such registration
statement; provided, however, that in the case of a registration statement
filed pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or 2.1(a)(II), not later than 135 days
after the effective date thereof;

(iii) furnish to each selling holder of Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement, such number of conformed
copies of such registration statement and of each such amendment and
supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits, appropriately
redacted in the case of those exhibits filed on a confidential basis), and
so long as the Company is required to keep such registration statement
effective pursuant to subdivision (ii) such number of copies of the
prospectus contained in such registration statement (including each
preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus) and any other prospectus
filed under Rule 424 under the Securities Act, in conformity with the
requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents, as such
selling holder may reasonably request;

(iv) use its best efforts (x) to register or qualify all
Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such registration
statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such States of
the United States of America where an exemption is not available and as the
selling holder of Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement shall reasonably request, (y) to keep such registration or
qualification in effect for so long as such registration statement remains
in effect and (z) to take any other action that may be necessary or
advisable to enable such selling holders to consummate the disposition in
such jurisdictions of the securities to be sold by such selling holders,
except that the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to (a)
qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdic-
tion wherein it would not, but for the requirements of this subdivision
(iv), be obligated to be so qualified, (b) become subject to taxation in
any 

7

<PAGE>

jurisdiction where it would not then so subject or (c) take any action that
would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

(v) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement to be
registered with or approved by such other federal or state governmental
agencies or authorities as may be necessary in the opinion of counsel to
the Company and counsel to the selling holder or selling holders of
Registrable Securities to enable the seller or sellers thereof to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

(vi) furnish at the effective date of such registration
statement and the date of closing of the sale of the Registrable Securities
(whether or not such sale is underwritten), to each selling holder of
Registrable Securities, and each such selling holder's underwriters, if
any, a signed counterpart of:

(x) an opinion of counsel for the Company, dated the
effective date of such registration statement (or such date of sale,
as applicable), and

(y) a "comfort" letter signed by the independent
public accountants who have certified the Company's financial
statements included or incorporated by reference in such registration
statement,

covering substantially the same matters with respect to such registration
statement (and the prospectus included therein) and, in the case of the
accountants' comfort letter, with respect to events subsequent to the date
of such financial statements, as are customarily covered in opinions of
issuer's counsel and in accountants' comfort letters delivered to the
underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities;

(vii) notify each selling holder of Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, upon
discovery that, or upon the happening of any event known to the Company as
a result of which, the prospectus included in such registration statement,
as 

8

<PAGE>

then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, and, subject to Section 2.6(a), promptly
prepare and, at the request of any such selling holder, furnish to it a
reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such
prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the
purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made;

(viii) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply
with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and, if
required, make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve
months, but not more than eighteen months, beginning with the first full
calendar month after the effective date of such registration statement,
which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of
the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder, and promptly
furnish to each such selling holder of Registrable Securities a copy of any
amendment or supplement to such registration statement or prospectus;

(ix) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and
registrar (which, in each case, may be the Company) for all Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement from and after a date not
later than the effective date of such registration; and

(x) use its best efforts to list all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement on The New York Stock Exchange.

The Company may require each selling holder of Registrable Securities as to
which any registration is being effected to furnish the Company such information
regarding such selling holder and the distribution of such securities as the
Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing.

9

<PAGE>

Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of such
Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the
happening of any event of the kind described in subdivision (vii) of this
Section 2.3, such holder will forthwith discontinue such holder's disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement relating to such
Registrable Securities until such holder's receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by subdivision (vii) of this
Section 2.3 and, if so directed by the Company, will deliver to the Company (at
the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in
such holder's possession of the prospectus relating to such Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

2.4 Underwritten Offerings.

(a) Requested Underwritten Offerings. If requested by the
underwriters for any underwritten offering by holders of Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or any Other Registration
Statement, the Company will use all reasonable efforts to enter into an
underwriting agreement with such underwriters for such offering, such agreement
to be reasonably satisfactory in substance and form to the Company, the
Purchaser (or, if the Purchaser does not hold 50% of the Registrable Securities
to be included in such underwritten offering, the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities to be included in such underwritten offering) and the
underwriters and to contain such representations and warranties by the Company,
such other terms as are customary in agreements of that type, including, without
limitation, indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in Section 2.7
and, in the case of a Series T Demand Registration, the distribution
requirements set forth in the Certificate of Amendment. The holders of the
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by such underwriters will reasonably
cooperate with the Company in the negotiation of the underwriting agreement. 
Such holders of Registrable Securities to be sold by such underwriters shall be
parties to such underwriting agreement and may, at their option, require that
any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on
the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also
be made to and for the benefit of such holders of Registrable Securities and
that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such
underwriters under such underwriting agreement be conditions 

10

<PAGE>

precedent to the obligations of such holders of Registrable Securities. No
holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to make any representations
or warranties to or agreements with the Company other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such holder, such holder's Registrable
Securities and such holder's intended method of distribution or any other
representations required by applicable law.

(b) Incidental Underwritten Offerings. If the Company
proposes to register any of its securities under the Securities Act as
contemplated by Section 2.2 and such securities are to be distributed by or
through one or more underwriters, the Company will, if requested by any
Requesting Holder of Registrable Securities in the notice given to the Company
by such Requesting Holder under Section 2.2(a), use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange for such underwriters to include all the Registrable Securities to be
offered and sold by such Requesting Holder among the securities of the Company
to be distributed by such underwriters, subject to the provisions of Section
2.2(b). The holders of Registrable Securities to be distributed by such
underwriters shall be parties to the underwriting agreement between the Company
and such underwriters and may, at their option, require that any or all of the
representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the
Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and
for the benefit of such holders of Registrable Securities and that any or all of
the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of such
holders of Registrable Securities. Any such Requesting Holder of Registrable
Securities shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or
agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such Requesting Holder, such Requesting
Holder's Registrable Securities and such Requesting Holder's intended method of
distribution or any other representations required by applicable law. The
holders of Registrable Securities, if requested by the managing underwriter or
underwriters of such underwritten offering, shall not, except as part of such
underwritten offering, effect any public sale or distribution of Registrable
Securities of the same class as any securities included in such underwritten
offering (including a sale pursuant to Rule 144) during the 10-day period prior
to, and during the 90-day period beginning on, the closing date of such
underwritten offering, to the extent timely 

11

<PAGE>

notified in writing by the Company or the managing underwriter or underwriters. 
No holder of Registrable Securities may participate in any such underwritten
offering unless such holder (i) agrees to sell such holder's Registrable
Securities on the basis provided in the underwriting agreement and
(ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, and other
documents reasonably required under the terms of the underwriting agreement.

(c) Underwriting Discounts and Commissions. The holders of
Registrable Securities sold in any offering pursuant to Section 2.4(a) or
Section 2.4(b) shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions of the
underwriter or underwriters with respect to the Registrable Securities sold
thereby.

2.5 Preparation; Reasonable Investigation. In connection with
the preparation and filing of each registration statement under the Securities
Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will give the holders of Registrable
Securities registered under such registration statement, their underwriters, if
any, and their respective counsel the opportunity to participate in the
preparation of such registration statement, each prospectus included therein or
filed with the Commission, and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto, and
will give each of them such reasonable access to its books and records and such
opportunities to discuss the business of the Company with its officers and the
independent public accountants who have certified its financial statements as
shall be necessary, in the opinion of such holders' and such underwriters'
respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of
the Securities Act; provided, however, that each such holder, underwriter or
counsel shall receive such information only if such holder, underwriter or
counsel and their respective agents and representatives shall have expressly
agreed that any information that is designated in writing by the Company, in
good faith, as confidential at the time of delivery of such information, shall
be kept confidential by such holder, underwriters, counsel, agent or
representative and not be used for any purpose other than in connection with the
review by such holder, underwriter, counsel, agent or representative of the
registration statement except to the extent (i) disclosure of such information
is required by court or administrative order or applicable law, (ii) disclosure
of such information, in the opinion of counsel to such holder, underwriter,
counsel, agent or representative is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement
or omission 

12

<PAGE>

of a material fact in the registration statement, prospectus or any supplement
or post-effective amendment thereto, (iii) disclosure of such information is in
the opinion of counsel for any such holder, underwriter, counsel, agent or
representative necessary or advisable in connection with any action, claim, suit
or proceeding, directly or indirectly, involving or potentially involving such
holder, underwriter, counsel, agent or representative and arising out of, or
based upon, relating to or involving this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereunder or (iv) such information becomes generally available to
the public other than as a result of a disclosure or failure to safeguard by
such holder, underwriter, counsel, agent or representative. Each selling holder
of such Registrable Securities further agrees that it will, upon learning that
disclosure of any such information is sought pursuant to a court or administra-
tive order, give prompt notice thereof to the Company and allow the Company, at
the Company's expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of
the information deemed confidential. The Company shall promptly notify the
holders of Registrable Securities and their counsel of any stop order issued or
threatened by the Commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent
the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered.

2.6 Limitations, Conditions and Qualifications to Obligations
under Registration Covenants. 

(a) Limitation on Requirement to File or Amend Registration
Statement. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, it is
understood and agreed that the Company shall not be required to file a Registra-
tion Statement, amendment or post-effective amendment thereto or prospectus
supplement or to supplement or amend any Registration Statement if the Company
is then involved in discussions concerning, or otherwise engaged in, an acquisi-
tion, disposition, financing or other material transaction and the Company
determines in good faith that the making of such a filing, supplement or
amendment at such time would materially adversely effect or interfere with such
transaction so long as the Company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter (but
in no event more than 90 days thereafter) make such filing, supplement or
amendment. The Company shall promptly give the holders of Registrable
Securities written notice of such postponement, containing a general statement
of the reasons for such postponement and an approximation of the anticipated
delay, provided, however, that nothing herein shall require the Company to
disclose 

13

<PAGE>

any terms of any such transaction or the identity of any party thereto. Upon
receipt by a holder of notice of an event of the kind described in this Section
2.6(a), such holder shall forthwith discontinue such holder's disposition of
Registrable Securities until such holder's receipt of notice from the Company
that such disposition may continue and of any supplemented or amended prospectus
indicated in such notice.

(b) Provision of Information by Holder. Each selling
holder of Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being effected
agrees, as a condition to the registration obligations with respect to such
selling holder provided herein, to furnish promptly to the Company such
information regarding the selling holder and the distribution of such
Registrable Securities as the Company may, from time to time, reasonably request
in writing to comply with the Securities Act and other applicable law. The
Company may exclude from such registration the Registrable Securities of any
selling holder who unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a
reasonable time after receiving such request. If the identity of a selling
holder of Registrable Securities is to be disclosed in a registration statement,
such selling holder shall be permitted to include all information regarding such
selling holder as it shall reasonably request.

(c) Discontinuation of Offering. Each holder of
Registrable Securities agrees that, upon receipt of written notice from the
Company of (i) the issuance by the Commission of a stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a registration statement or of any order preventing or
suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose or (ii) the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption
from qualification of a registration statement or any Registrable Securities
covered thereby for offer or sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any
proceeding for such purpose, such holder shall forthwith discontinue the
disposition of such Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement or prospectus (but in the case of clause (ii), solely in the
applicable jurisdiction) until such holder's receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by the Company, or until it is
advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable prospectus may
be resumed, and has received copies of any amendments or supplements thereto,
and, if so directed 

14

<PAGE>

by the Company, such holder will deliver to the Company all copies, other than
permanent file copies, then in such holder's possession, of the prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such
notice.

2.7 Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company will, and
hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, in the case of any registration
statement filed pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2, each holder of any Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement, and each other Person who
participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and
each other Person, if any, who controls such holder or any such underwriter
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and their respective
directors, officers, partners, agents and affiliates, against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such holder or
underwriter or any such director, officer, partner, agent, affiliate or
controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise,
including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of legal counsel, insofar
as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement
filed by the Company under which such securities were registered under the
Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the
circumstances in which they were made not misleading, and the Company will
reimburse such holder or underwriter and each such director, officer, partner,
employee, agent, affiliate and controlling Person for any legal or any other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent
that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect
thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registra-
tion statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus,
amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in 

15

<PAGE>

conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of
such holder, underwriter, director, officer, partner, employee, agent, affiliate
or controlling Person, as the case may be, expressly for use in the preparation
thereof; provided further, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case
to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out
of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in any such registration statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein or any
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which
they were made not misleading in a prospectus or prospectus supplement, if
(i) such untrue statement or omission is completely corrected in an amendment or
supplement to such prospectus or prospectus supplement, the seller of the
Registrable Securities has an obligation under the Securities Act to deliver a
prospectus or prospectus supplement in connection with such sale of Registrable
Securities and the seller of Registrable Securities thereafter fails to deliver
such prospectus or prospectus supplement as so amended or supplemented prior to
or concurrently with the sale of Registrable Securities to the person asserting
such loss, claim, damage or liability after the Company has furnished such
seller with a sufficient number of copies of the same or (ii) if the seller
received written notice from the Company of the existence of such an untrue
statement or such an omission and the seller continued to dispose of Registrable
Securities prior to the time of the receipt of either (a) an amended or
supplemented prospectus or prospectus supplement that completely corrected the
untrue statement or the omission or (b) a notice from the Company that the use
of the existing prospectus or prospectus supplement may be resumed. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of such seller or any such director, officer, partner,
employee, agent, affiliate or controlling person and shall survive the transfer
of such securities by such seller.

(b) Indemnification by the Sellers. As a condition to
including any Registrable Securities in any registration statement, the Company
shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from the prospective
seller of such Registrable Securities, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the
same manner and to the same extent as set forth in Section 2.7(a)) the Company,
and each director of the 

16

<PAGE>

Company, each officer of the Company and each other Person, if any, who
participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and
each other Person who controls the Company or any such underwriter within the
meaning of the Securities Act, with respect to any statement or alleged
statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement,
any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or alleged
statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such seller
expressly for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement;
provided, however, that (A) the indemnifying party shall not be liable in any
such case to the extent that any such statement or omission is completely
corrected (x) in the final prospectus, in the case of a preliminary prospectus,
or (y) in an amendment or supplement to a prospectus or prospectus supplement
(provided, however, that nothing in this clause (y) shall limit the indemnifying
party's liability with respect to sales made prior to the receipt by the Company
from the indemnifying party of written notice of such an untrue statement or
such an omission) and (B) the liability of such indemnifying party under this
Section 2.7(b) shall be limited to the amount of proceeds received by such
indemnifying party in the offering giving rise to such liability. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Company or any such director, officer or controlling
person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such holder.

(c) Notices of Claims, etc. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding
involving a claim referred to in Section 2.7(a) or (b), such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party,
give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided,
however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided
herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the
preceding subdivisions of this Section 2.7, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In
case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall
notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying
party shall be enti-

17

<PAGE>

tled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party;
provided, however, that (i) if the indemnified party reasonably believes that it
is advisable for it to be represented by separate counsel because there exists
or may exist a conflict of interest between its interests and those of the
indemnifying party with respect to such claim, or there exist defenses available
to such indemnified party that may not be available to the indemnifying party,
or (ii) if the indemnifying party shall fail to assume responsibility for such
defense, the indemnified party may retain counsel satisfactory to it and, in the
case of clause (i), reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party, and the
indemnifying party shall pay all fees and expenses of such counsel; provided
further, that the indemnifying party shall not be deemed to have failed to
assume responsibility for such defense if the indemnifying party has not
received notice of such claim pursuant to this Section 2.7(c). In the event an
indemnifying party elects not to assume, or shall not be entitled to assume
because of a conflict of interest between its interests and those of the
indemnified party, the defense of a claim, such indemnifying party shall not be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel or firm of
counsel in any jurisdiction in any one legal action or group of related legal
actions for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party in respect of
such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any such indemnified party a
conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of
such indemnified parties in respect of such claim. No indemnifying party shall
be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 
No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party,
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff
to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation or that requires action other than the payment of money by
the indemnifying party.

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in
this Section 2.7 shall for any reason be held by a court to be unavailable to an
indemnified party under Section 2.7(a) or (b) hereof in respect of any loss,
claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, then, in lieu of
the amount paid or payable under Section 2.7(a) or (b), the indemnified party
and the indemnify-

18

<PAGE>

ing party under Section 2.7(a) or (b) shall contribute to the aggregate losses,
claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with investigating the same), (i) in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company and the prospective
sellers of Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement that
resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action or proceeding in
respect thereof, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in
such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action or proceeding in respect
thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations or (ii) if the
allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in
such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
received by the Company and such prospective sellers from the offering of the
securities covered by such registration statement; provided, however, that for
purposes of this clause (ii), the relative benefits received by the prospective
sellers shall be deemed not to exceed the amount of proceeds received by such
prospective sellers. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contri-
bution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 
Such prospective sellers' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section
2.7(d) are several in proportion to the relative value of their respective
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement and not joint. In
addition, no Person shall be obligated to contribute hereunder any amounts in
payment for any settlement of any action or claim effected without such Person's
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(e) Other Indemnification. Indemnification and
contribution similar to that specified in the preceding subdivisions of this
Section 2.7 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Company and
each holder of Registrable Securities with respect to any required registration
or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or
regulation of any governmental authority other than the Securities Act.

(f) Indemnification Payments. The indemnification and
contribution required by this Section 2.7 shall be made by periodic payments of
the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, 

19

as and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is
incurred.

ized terms used herein without definition have the respec-
tive meanings specified in the Purchase Agreement.

In so acting, we have examined the Purchase Agree-
ment, the Option, the Certificate of Incorporation, the
Company's By-laws, and the Certificate of Amendment, and
have also examined and relied upon the representations and
warranties as to factual matters contained in or made pursu-
ant to such documents and upon the originals, or copies
certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of
such records, documents, certificates and other instruments
as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable us
to render the opinion expressed below. We have reviewed,
and rely upon, the receipt, dated December __, 1994, of the
Department of State of the State of New York (the "Depart-
ment") showing the date upon which the Certificate of Amend-
ment was filed with the Department. In rendering the fol-
lowing opinions, we have assumed, with your permission, that
the Certificate of Amendment filed with the Department on
December __, 1994 was accepted by the Department on that
date.

Based upon the foregoing, we are of the following
opinion:

(1) The Company is validly existing as a corpora-
tion in good standing under the laws of the State of
New York;

(2) The Shares, the Option, the Option Shares,
the Exchange Shares and the Conversion Shares and the
Certificate of Amendment have been duly authorized and
(a) the Shares, the Exchange Shares and the Conversion
-
Shares when issued and delivered in accordance with the
terms of the Purchase Agreement and (b) the Option
-
Shares when issued and delivered in accordance with the
terms of the Option, will be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable; and

(3) Each of the Purchase Agreement and the Option
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery thereof by the other party thereto, are the
valid and binding obligations of the Company, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as
to enforceability, to general principles of equity 

<PAGE>
CNA Financial Corporation 3 December __, 1994

(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a pro-
ceeding in equity or at law) and except that no opinion
has been requested and we express no opinion as to
Section 8.1 of the Purchase Agreement insofar as such
Section 8.1 relates to indemnification for liabilities
under the Act, the Exchange Act or state securities
laws.

Our opinions expressed above are limited to the
laws of the State of New York and the Federal laws of the
United States of America.

We are delivering this opinion to you pursuant to
Section 3.1.7 of the Purchase Agreement, and no other person
is entitled to rely on this opinion.

Very truly yours,

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

----------
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the New York
Business Corporation Law (the "NYBCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall

corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and New York shall continue as
the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").
---------------------

SECTION 1.2. [Intentionally omitted.]

SECTION 1.3. Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been
-------
terminated in accordance with the terms hereof and subject to the satisfaction
or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the
consummation of the Merger shall take place as promptly as practicable (and, in
any event, within five business days) after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &
Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, unless another date, time or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

SECTION 1.4. Effective Time. As promptly as practicable
--------------
after the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI, the parties hereto shall cause a certificate of merger (the "New
---
York Certificate") to be executed, verified and delivered to the Department of
- - ----------------
State of the State of New York as provided in Section 907 of the NYBCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the New York Certificate has been
filed by the Department of State of the State of New York in accordance with the
provisions of Section 907 of the NYBCL, or at such later time as may be
specified in the New York Certificate in accordance with applicable law. The
date and time when the Merger shall become effective is herein referred to as
the "Effective Time."
--------------

SECTION 1.5. Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have
--------------------
the effects specified in the NYBCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of New York and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of New York and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

<PAGE>

SECTION 1.6. Directors and Officers; Certificate of
--------------------------------------
Incorporation; By-Laws. (a) At the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub
- - ----------------------
shall become the directors, and the officers of New York shall become the
officers, of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as
the case may be.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation
and the By-Laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior the Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

SECTION 1.7. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective
-----------------------
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Chicago,
Merger Sub, New York or the holders of any shares of New York Common Stock:

(a) Each share of common stock of New York ("New York
--------
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
------------
Effective Time (other than any shares of New York Common Stock to
be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.7(b) and other than any
Dissenting Shares) (the "Converted Shares") shall be converted
----------------
into the right to receive $20 per share in cash (the "Per Share
---------
Merger Consideration" and the aggregate amount of cash into which
--------------------
all shares of New York Common Stock shall be converted, the
"Merger Consideration"). All such shares of New York Common
--------------------
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time evidenced outstanding shares of New York Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) (the "Certificates") shall
------------
thereafter represent the right to receive, upon the surrender of
such certificate in accordance with the provisions of this
Section, the Per Share Merger Consideration into which such
shares have been converted in accordance herewith. The holders
of Certificates previously evidencing shares of New York Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto (including, without
limitation, any rights to vote or to receive dividends and
distributions in respect of such shares), except as otherwise
provided herein.

(b) Each share of New York Common Stock owned by or held
in the treasury of New York or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of New York (other than any share held in a
fiduciary capacity and beneficially owned by a third party or
as a result of debts previously contracted 

-3-

<PAGE>
and other than any share which is part of the regulatory or
statutory capital of such Subsidiary) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be
given with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(d) Each share of Chicago Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted, at Chicago's option, into either (i) the right to
receive a cash payment equal to the liquidation preference of
such share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on such share,
at the Effective Time or (ii) one share of preferred stock of
Chicago or its Affiliate ("Chicago Mirror Preferred Stock"),
------------------------------
having the same terms, designations, preferences, limitations,
privileges, and relative rights as such share of Chicago
Preferred Stock, except that in the case of any series of
convertible preferred stock, the shares shall be convertible
under the same terms and conditions as are set forth in the Cer-
tificate of Amendment creating such series of preferred stock,
including, without limitation, the adjustment provisions thereof,
into such consideration as would have been received by the holder
of such stock had such stock been converted into New York Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Preferred Stock Consideration"). At Chicago's option, and in
-----------------------------
its sole discretion, effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time, any or all shares of Chicago Preferred Stock owned by or
held in the treasury of New York or Chicago or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of New York or Chicago may be
cancelled and extinguished in lieu of the conversion referred to
in the previous sentence. 

SECTION 1.8. Payment Fund. (a) Payment Agent. As of the
------------ -------------
Effective Time, Chicago shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with or
for the account of a bank or trust company (the "Payment Agent") designated by
-------------
Chicago and reasonably satisfactory to New York, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of shares of New York Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) for
exchange through the Payment Agent in accordance with this Article, cash in the
amount of the product of the Per Share Merger Consideration and the number of
Converted Shares (such cash, the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Agent shall,
------------
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the 

-4-

<PAGE>

Payment Fund to holders of shares of New York Common Stock and the Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. Such funds shall be invested by the
Payment Agent only in short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the United
States government or certificates of deposit of commercial banks that have con-
solidated total assets of not less than $5,000,000,000 and are "well
capitalized" within the meaning of the applicable Federal bank regulations. Any
interest or other income earned on the investment of cash held in the Payment
Fund shall be for the account of Chicago.

(b) Payment Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time,
------------------
Chicago shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent and shall be
in such customary form and have such other provisions as Chicago may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for cash. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Payment Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash which such holder has the right to receive in accordance with
Section 1.7, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of New York Common Stock which
is not registered in the transfer records of New York, cash may be issued and
paid in accordance with this Article I to a transferee if the Certificate
evidencing such shares of New York Common Stock is presented to the Payment
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration applicable to the
shares of New York Common Stock evidenced by such Certificate.

(c) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the
---------------------------
Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of New York Common Stock
for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Chicago upon
demand, and any holders of New York Common Stock who have not theretofore
complied with this Article shall thereafter look only to Chicago for the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to this Article. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered 

-5-

<PAGE>
prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any government entity), any
cash or other consideration payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

(d) No Liability. None of Chicago, Merger Sub or the
------------
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of New York Common
Stock for any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(e) Withholding Rights. Chicago or the Payment Agent shall
------------------
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of New York Common Stock such
amounts as Chicago or the Payment Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority by Chicago or the Payment Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of New York Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Chicago or the Payment Agent.

(f) Transfer Taxes. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)
--------------
or (e) above, Chicago shall pay or cause to be paid any transfer or gains tax
(including, without limitation, any real property gains or transfer tax) imposed
in connection with or as a result of the Merger, including any such tax that is
imposed on a shareholder of New York.

SECTION 1.9. Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time,
--------------------
the stock transfer books of New York shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of New York Common Stock thereafter
on the records of New York. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Payment Agent or Chicago for any reason shall be converted into
the Per Share Merger Consideration applicable to the shares of New York Common
Stock evidenced by such shares.

SECTION 1.10. Employee Stock Options. As of the Effective
----------------------
Time, the holder of each outstanding employee stock option ("Option") to
purchase shares of capital stock of New York shall be solely entitled to receive
in exchange for such Option a cash payment from New York in an amount equal to
the 

-6-

<PAGE>

product of (a) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over
the per share exercise price of such Option and (b) the number of shares of New
York Common Stock covered by such Option, whether or not such Option is then
exercisable, except as specified in the Disclosure Letter. New York shall use
its best efforts to cause each holder of an Option (whether or not presently
exercisable) to execute an agreement consenting to the cancellation prior to the
Effective Time of his outstanding Options. 

SECTION 1.11. Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding any
-----------------
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of New York Common
Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are
held by shareholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such shares in accordance with the NYBCL and who shall not have
withdrawn such demand or otherwise have forfeited appraisal rights
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent
-----------------
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such shareholders shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of New York
Common Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of the NYBCL, except
that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who shall have failed to perfect
or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such shares of New York Common Stock under the NYBCL shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective
Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.7, of the
certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of New York
Common Stock.

(b) New York shall give Chicago (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by New York, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the NYBCL and received by New York and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the NYBCL. New York shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Chicago, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal, or offer to settle, or settle, any such demands.

currently owned or leased and conducted. New York is duly qualified to transact
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing (if applicable) in
each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership, leasing
or operation of property requires such qualification, other than any failure to
be so qualified or in good standing as would not, individually or in the
aggregate with all such other failures, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, results of operations,
business or financial condition of New York and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or have a material adverse effect on the ability of New York to perform
its obligations under this Agreement (a "Material Adverse Effect"; provided,
----------------------- --------
however, that the termination fees associated with Section 6.10 of the October
- - -------
SPA, severance obligations arising as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and any impact on the business of New York and its
Subsidiaries, including but not limited to its relationships with employees,
agents, brokers and investment advisory clients, resulting from the execution or
announcement of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall not be considered in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect
shall have occurred). For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary" shall mean,
----------
with respect to any person, any corporation, limited or general partnership,
joint venture, association, joint stock company, trust, unincorporated organi-
zation, or other entity analogous to any of the foregoing of which a majority of
the equity ownership (whether voting stock or comparable interest) is, at the
time, owned, directly or indirectly, by such person.

(the "Annual Report") is an accurate and correct statement of all of the
-------------
information required to be set forth therein by the regulations of the SEC and

<PAGE>
incorporated or organized and is validly existing as a corporation or other
legal entity in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or formation, has the corporate or other power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described
in the SEC Documents and as currently owned or leased and conducted and is duly
qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation or other legal entity
and is in good standing (if applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the
conduct of its business or its ownership, leasing or operation of property
requires such qualification, other than any failure to be so qualified or in
good standing as would not, individually or in the aggregate with all such other
failures, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as
disclosed in the SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement, all of the outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary of New York
has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable and
is owned by New York, directly or through other Subsidiaries of New York (other
than directors' qualifying shares), free and clear of any mortgage, pledge,
lien, security interest, restrictions upon voting or transfer, claim or
encumbrance of any kind ("Encumbrance") (other than such transfer restrictions
-----------
as may exist under federal and state securities, banking and insurance laws or
any Encumbrances between or among New York and/or any Subsidiary of New York or
any liens for taxes not yet due and payable), and there are no rights granted to
or in favor of any third party (whether acting in an individual, fiduciary or
other capacity), other than New York or any Subsidiary of New York, to acquire
any such capital stock, any additional capital stock or any other securities of
any such Subsidiary. There exists no restriction, other than those pursuant to
applicable law or regulation, on the payment of cash dividends by any Subsidiary
of New York. Neither New York nor any of its Subsidiaries holds any interest in
a partnership or joint venture of any kind or any equity interests in any other
person representing more than 10% of the equity interests of such person.

SECTION 2.7. Outstanding Securities. Except as set forth in
----------------------
Section 2.2 and except pursuant to the Chicago SPA, there are no outstanding (i)
securities or obligations of New York convertible into or exchangeable for any
capital stock of New York, (ii) warrants, rights or options to subscribe for or
purchase from New York any such capital stock or any such convertible or
exchangeable securities or obligations or (iii) obligations of New York to
issue, sell, transfer, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or vote such
shares, any such convertible or exchangeable securities or obligations, or any
such warrants, rights or options.

SECTION 2.8. No Contravention, Conflict, Breach, Etc. The

SPA by New York and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and

tion, which violation has or could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (C) any applicable order, decree or judgment of any court or
governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over New York or such
Subsidiary, which violation has or could reasonably be expected to have a Mate-
rial Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in SEC Documents filed with the SEC

the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an event of
default exists or, upon the consummation by New York of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Chicago SPA, will exist under any
indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note or other agreement or instrument for
borrowed money, any guarantee of any agreement or instrument to which New York
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which New York or any such Sub-
sidiary is bound or to which any of the properties or assets of New York or any
such Subsidiary is subject, which event of default, or event that, but for the
giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an event of
default, has or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

the manner described in the SEC Documents and as currently owned or leased and
conducted and all such Licenses are valid and in full force and effect except
such licenses that the failure to have or to be in full force and effect,
individually or in the aggregate, do not have, and are not reasonably expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither New York nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice that any violations are being or
have been alleged in respect of any such License and no proceeding is pending
or, to the best of New York's knowledge, after due inquiry, threatened, to
suspend, revoke or limit any such License. To the best of New York's knowledge,
after due inquiry, New York and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with their respective obligations under such Licenses, with
such exceptions as individually or in the aggregate do not have, and are not
reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect, and no event has

SEC Documents and as currently conducted, free and clear of any Encumbrance that
may materially interfere with the conduct of the business of New York and such
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and to the best of New York's knowledge, after
due inquiry, all material properties held under lease by New York or the
Subsidiaries are held under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases, other than
such imperfections or Encumbrances as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

with any third party, relating to any material liability or remedial action or
potential material liability or remedial action under Environmental Laws (other
than in respect of or related to insurance policies issued by or of New York or
any of its Subsidiaries), except such liability or remedial action as has not
had, or could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect, nor
are there any pending, reasonably anticipated or, to the best knowledge of New

limitation, those relating to the generation, handling, disposal, transportation
or release of hazardous materials (collectively, "Environmental Laws"), other
------------------
than any such failure to be in compliance as would not, individually or in the
aggregate with all such other failures, have a Material Adverse Effect. With
respect to such properties, assets and operations, including any previously
owned, leased or operated properties, assets or operations, to the best
knowledge of New York on the date hereof, after due inquiry, there are no past,
present or reasonably anticipated future events, conditions, circumstances,
activities, practices, incidents, actions or plans of New York or any of its
Subsidiaries that may interfere with or prevent compliance or continued
compliance in all material respects with applicable Environmental Laws, other
than any such interference or prevention as would not, individually or in the
aggregate with any such other interference or prevention, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. The term "hazardous materials" shall mean

any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any
person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate directly or
indirectly any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors of New York may furnish or cause
- - -------- -------
to be furnished information and may participate or cause its representatives to
participate in such discussions and negotiations if the failure to provide such
information could in the opinion of its outside counsel be deemed to cause the
members of such Board of Directors to 

-27-

<PAGE>

breach their fiduciary duties under applicable law; and provided, further, that
-------- -------
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit New York and its directors
from making to its stockholders any recommendation and related filing with the
SEC as required by Rule 14e-2 and 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, with respect to
any tender offer. New York will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. New York will take the nec-
essary steps to inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section. New York will
promptly notify Chicago if any such inquiries or proposals are received by, any
such information is requested from, or any such negotiations or discussions are
sought to be initiated or continued with New York.

------------------------
and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, adopt a shareholders right
plan, poison pill or similar arrangement.

ARTICLE V

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

SECTION 5.1. Notification of Certain Matters. New York
-------------------------------
shall give prompt notice to Chicago, and Chicago shall give prompt notice to New
York, of (A) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which would be likely
to cause (x) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate or (y) any covenant, condition or agreement contained in
this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied and (B) any failure of New
York or Chicago, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder in any
material respect; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
-------- -------
this Section shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

SECTION 5.2. Action by Shareholders. (a) New York, acting
----------------------
through its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law, its
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws: (i) duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a special meeting (the "Special Meeting") of shareholders for
---------------
the purpose of adopting and approving this Agreement and the Merger; (ii)
include in any proxy statement for such Special Meeting the determination and
recommendation of the Board of Directors to the effect that the Board of
Directors, having 

-28-

<PAGE>
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are in
the best interests of New York and its shareholders, has approved this Agreement
and such transactions and recommends that the shareholders vote in favor of the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) use its best
efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Merger and New York shall take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of shareholders
required to obtain such approval. The Board of Directors of New York may fail
to make such a recommendation, or may withdraw, modify, or change any such
recommendation, or recommend any other offer or proposal, if such Board of Di-
rectors, based on the opinion of its outside counsel, determines that making
such recommendation, or the failure to so withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation, or the failure to recommend any other offer or proposal, could
be deemed to cause the members of such Board of Directors to breach their
fiduciary duties under applicable law. Any actions taken by the Board of
Directors of New York in accordance with the previous sentence shall not be
considered a default under this Agreement.

(b) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, New York
shall file with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and shall use its best efforts
to clear with the SEC, a proxy statement with respect to the Special Meeting
(the "Proxy Statement"). Chicago and New York shall cooperate with each other
---------------
in the preparation of any Proxy Statement. Chicago and Merger Sub agree, upon
request and except as otherwise may be required by applicable law, to furnish
New York with all information concerning itself, its subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary
or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement. New York agrees that the
Proxy Statement shall comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. Chicago and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC, and New York shall use its best efforts to make the
Proxy Statement reflect such comments.

(c) Chicago and New York each agrees to use its best
efforts, after consultation with the other parties hereto, to respond promptly
to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or any
preliminary version thereof filed by it and cause such Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the holders of New York Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting at the earliest practicable time following the date hereof.

-29-

<PAGE>

(d) The information included by New York in the Proxy
Statement, and the information furnished by Chicago and Merger Sub for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement, shall not, at the time the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the shareholders of
New York, at the time of the Special Meeting, and at the Effective Time, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or
circumstance relating to Chicago or its officers or directors should be
discovered by Chicago which should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement
to the Proxy Statement, Chicago shall promptly inform New York.

SECTION 5.3. Regulatory Approvals. (a) Each of New York
--------------------
and Chicago shall use all reasonable efforts, and shall reasonably cooperate
with the other in such efforts, to obtain approvals of any regulatory authority
required to be obtained by New York, any Subsidiary of New York, Chicago or any
Affiliate thereof in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section, Chicago shall
not be required to take any actions, or enter into any arrangements that will
subject Chicago or any of its Affiliates to regulation or oversight by any
federal or state bank regulatory authority or impose any restrictions upon the
operations of Chicago or any of its Affiliates (other than restrictions (the
"Bank Restrictions") on any banking or nonbanking transactions between Chicago
or any of its Affiliates and California Central Bank Trust Corporation (the
"Bank") and restrictions on Chicago and its Affiliates seeking to direct the
management and policies of the Bank). In addition, to the extent New York's
ownership interest in the Bank has not been disposed of prior to the Effective
Time, the parties shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to
establish at or prior to the Effective Time a trust (the "Bank Trust") on terms
---- -----
satisfactory to the appropriate bank regulators providing for the disposition of
New York's ownership interest in the Bank following the Effective Time. 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, New
York and Chicago shall make and cause their respective Subsidiaries to make all
necessary filings, as soon as practicable, including, without limitation, those
required under the HSR Act and applicable insurance laws in order to facilitate
prompt consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition, New York and Chicago shall each use their respective best efforts, and
shall cooperate fully with each other (i) to comply as promptly as practicable
with all governmental requirements applicable to the Merger and 

-30-

the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) to obtain as promptly as
practicable all necessary permits, orders or other consents of governmental
entities and consents of all third parties necessary for the consummation of the

Chicago shall use reasonable efforts to provide such information and
communications to governmental entities as such governmental entities may
reasonably request.

(c) Each of the parties shall provide to the other party
copies of all applications in advance of filing or submission of such
applications to governmental entities in connection with this Agreement and
shall keep the other party apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that Chicago may
--------
redact confidential portions that relate solely to the business or financial
condition of Chicago or its Affiliates.

SECTION 5.4. Access. Upon reasonable notice prior to the
------
Effective Time, New York shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to)
afford the officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives of Chicago or any of its Affiliates ("Representatives")
---------------
reasonable access during normal business hours to its properties, books, con-
tracts and records and personnel and advisors (who will be instructed by New
York to cooperate) and New York shall (and shall cause each of the Subsidiaries
to) furnish promptly to Chicago all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Chicago or its Representatives may reasonably
request; provided that any review will be conducted in a way that will not
--------
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of New York's business; provided,
--------
further, that no review pursuant to this Section shall affect or be deemed to
- - -------
modify any representation or warranty made by New York. Chicago will keep all
information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section on a confidential
basis in accordance with the previously executed Agreement between New York (or
its agent) and Chicago (the "Confidentiality Agreement").
-------------------------

SECTION 5.5. Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon
---------------------------------------
the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall
act in good faith toward and use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation,
using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders 

-31-

<PAGE>

of governmental entities and parties to contracts with Chicago or New York and
their respective Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Chicago nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person
that could materially delay or prevent completion of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Chicago SPA.

SECTION 5.6. Employee Matters. Chicago agrees that it will
----------------
maintain in effect New York's current severance policies as disclosed pursuant
to Section 2.20 hereof for the benefit of New York's existing employees for a
period of not less than twelve months following the Effective Time (and, in the
case of officers eligible for benefits under New York's Executive Severance Plan
and Management Severance Plan, two years). 

SECTION 5.7. Public Announcements. Chicago and New York
--------------------
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
-------- -------
consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public
statement as may be required by law or any listing agreement with a national se-
curities exchange to which Chicago or New York is a party if it has used all
reasonable efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such party's
consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner.

SECTION 5.8. Indemnification. (a) From the Effective Time
---------------
through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of New York and its Subsidiaries, determined as of
the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses
-------------------
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any
-----
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that New
York or such Subsidiary would have been permitted under applicable law and the
Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of New York or such Subsidiary in effect
on the date hereof to indemnify 

-32-

<PAGE>
such person (and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law provided the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to in-
demnification). 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any li-
ability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not
materially prejudice the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there
are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received. If such indemnity is not available with
respect to any Indemnified Party, then the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Party shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect relative faults and benefits. In the event that any
claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until the
final disposition of any and all such claims.

(c) Chicago shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance ("D&O Insurance") for the
--- ---------
Indemnified Parties comparable in coverage to the directors' and officers'
insurance policy currently maintained by New York for a period of at least six
years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that Chicago shall not be
-------- -------
required to spend in respect of such coverage annual premiums in excess of 200%
of the premium currently paid by New York for such coverage.

-33-

<PAGE>

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives.

---------------------------------------
Preferred Stock. New York agrees to take all actions as are necessary so as to
- - ---------------
cause the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred
Stock in accordance with their terms as set forth in the New York Certificate of
Incorporation prior to the Special Meeting.
