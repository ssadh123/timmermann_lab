Item 5 Other Events

On March 14, 1994, Eljer Industries, Inc. (the "Company") announced an
agreement in principle to settle for $3.4 million the class action securities
litigation against the Company and certain present and former members of the 
Board of Directors pending in a federal court in Texas. The proposed 
settlement is subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement 
among the parties and approval by the court. The Company believes that a 
significant portion of the proposed settlement amount would be paid by its 
liability insurance carrier. The balance, which is covered by litigation 
reserves, would be paid by the Company.

The suit asserted causes of action based on alleged inadequate disclosures 
by the Company in its 1989 and 1990 annual report to shareholders and in 
particular with respect to the litigation involving the Qest polybutylene 
plumbing system manufactured and sold by the Company's indirect, wholly-owned 
subsidiary, United States Brass Corporation, and with to the availability of 
insurance coverage therefor. The plaintiffs sought unspecified actual and
punitive damages as well as costs and attorneys' fees. In 1992, the court 
certified a plaintiff class consisting of all purchasers of the Company's 
common stock during the period from March 30, 1990 through August 8, 1991.

The press released dated March 14, 1994, describing the above is filed as 
an exhibit hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

ELJER INDUSTRIES ANNOUNCES TENTATIVE
SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER SUIT

DALLAS, Texas, March 14, 1994 -- Eljer Industries, Inc. (NYSE:ELJ) today 
announced an agreement in principle to settle for $3.4 million the class action 
securities litigation against the Company and certain present and former members
of its Board of Directors pending in a federal court in Texas. The proposed 
settlement is subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive settlement 
agreement among the parties and approval by the court. Eljer believes that a
significant portion of the proposed settlement amount would be paid by its 
liability insurance carrier.

The suit, originally filed as four purported class action suits in December
1991 and later consolidated into one, asserted causes of action based on alleged
inadequate disclosures in the Company's 1989 and 1990 annual report to 
shareholders and in particular disclosures with respect to the litigation 
involving the Qest polybutylene plumbing system manufactured and sold by the 
Company's indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, United States Brass Corporation,
and with respect to the availability of insurance coverage therefor. The 
plaintiffs sought unspecified actual and punitive damages as well as costs and 
attorneys fees. In 1992, the court certified a plaintiff class consisting of 
all purchasers of the Company's common stock during the period from March 30, 
1990 through August 8, 1991.

Scott G. Arbuckle, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "We 
believe that the disclosures were fair, accurate and complied with all legal 
requirements and that Eljer had meritorious defenses

to the suit. Nevertheless, we believe that the settlement is in the best 
interests of the Company in order to avoid further litigation costs and exposure
in the event the case was tried. A significant portion of the proposed 
settlement amount will be paid by our liability insurance carrier. The balance,
which is covered by litigation reserves, will be paid by the Company. The
proposed settlement is in accordance with our previously announced strategy and 
commitment to attempt to conclude successfully the significant litigation issues
facing Eljer."
