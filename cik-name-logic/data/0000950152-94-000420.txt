FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

KEYCORP REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY EARNINGS

CLEVELAND, April 19, 1994 -- KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today reported record
quarterly earnings of $209 million for the 1994 first quarter, up 10 percent
from the year-ago quarter. Earnings per common share for the first quarter were
$0.85, also up 10 percent from the 1993 first quarter. Prior year results have
been restated for the March 1, 1994, merger with Society Corporation, accounted
for as a pooling of interests.

"The 1994 first quarter included significant milestones in KeyCorp's 
history as the previously announced merger with Society Corporation was 
approved by shareholders and closed on March 1, 1994," said Victor J. Riley, 
Jr., chairman of the board and chief executive officer. "Completing this 
merger in only five months makes this one of the fastest and smoothest mergers 
in banking history. It also speaks to the merger experience and sense of 
teamwork and accomplishment that characterizes our new company. I'm pleased to 
report that much of the merger and integration effort is behind us. The 
functions of some 40 merger-integration task forces have now shifted to the 
new management team. This, in turn, allows us to direct our efforts toward 
achieving the previously announced expense savings. We are also encouraged by 
early signs related to the revenue enhancement opportunities made possible by 
the merger."

Commenting on financial performance, James W. Wert, senior executive vice
president and chief financial officer, noted, "KeyCorp's financial performance
continued at a high level in the first quarter, with a return on average total
assets of 1.41 percent and a return on average common equity of 19.2 percent,
placing KeyCorp at or near the top of industry rankings for these important
measures. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 60.1 percent from
61.4 percent in the 1993 fourth quarter, after excluding nonrecurring items.
This is particularly encouraging since most merger-related expense savings are
only now in the process of beginning to be realized by the new company. We are
also pleased to note that average loans in the first quarter increased at an
annualized rate of 10 percent from the 1993 fourth quarter, continuing the
growth of recent quarters and partially offsetting the impact of a narrowing of
the net interest margin.

"Credit quality measures also continued to improve," said Wert.
"Nonperforming assets declined $36 million, or 7 percent, from the 1993 fourth
quarter and represented 1.12 percent of loans plus other real estate owned and
other nonperforming assets. Net loan charge-offs also declined in the quarter
to a low level, totaling only $31 million, or just 0.31 percent of average
loans, down from $44 million (0.45 percent) in the 1993 fourth quarter."

Reflecting the improvement in credit quality measures, the provision for loan
losses in the 1994 first quarter was $37 million, down from $56 million in the
year-ago quarter and down $10 million from the 1993 fourth quarter. Even so,
the current quarter's provision was $5 million greater than the net
charge-offs, resulting in a slight increase in the allowance for loan losses
and related nonperforming loan and nonperforming asset coverage ratios.

Net interest income in the 1994 first quarter was up $14 million, or 2
percent, from the year-ago quarter. The favorable impact of a $4.3 billion, or
8 percent,

- more -

KeyCorp Reports Record Quarterly Earnings
April 19, 1994
Page 3

increase in the level of average earning assets was partially offset by a
decline in the net interest margin to 5.03 percent from 5.40 percent in the
year-ago quarter. Compared to the 1993 fourth quarter, net interest income
decreased $10 million, or 2 percent, reflecting a decline in the net interest
margin from 5.21 percent to 5.03 percent in the current quarter. This more
than offset the favorable impact of a $1.7 billion, or 3 percent, increase in
average earning assets. Compared to 1993 periods, narrowing spreads are
attributed to earning assets growth, a modest rise in short-term interest
rates, and the repricing of higher-yielding investment securities and
mortgage-related assets.

Excluding the effects of acquisitions and run-off of out-of-market loans
acquired through regulator-assisted transactions in the State of New York,
average loans in the 1994 first quarter were up $1.7 billion, or 4 percent,
from the year-ago quarter. The benefits of regional diversity were apparent as
the growth in bank loans in the Rocky Mountain and Northwest regions of 8
percent and 7 percent, respectively, continued to outpace growth in the Great
Lakes and Northeast regions, 5 percent and 1 percent, respectively.

Noninterest income in the 1994 first quarter was $227 million. When noncore
items such as special asset management fees and net securities transactions are
excluded from all reporting periods for comparison purposes, core noninterest
income in the current quarter was $218 million, up $13 million or 6 percent
from the year-ago quarter, but down slightly ($2 million) from the 1993 fourth
quarter. This latter decrease reflected a $6 million decline in mortgage
banking income, as the 1993 fourth quarter represented an all-time high in
origination activity, as well as a $3 million decline in credit card fees.
These declines were partially offset by a $3 million increase in trust income
and a $4 million increase in all other income.

Special asset management fees are associated with loan collection work
performed for the FDIC. These fees are anticipated to decrease over time as
the FDIC

Page 4

assets under contract are collected and, therefore, decline. In addition,
these fees exhibit quarter-to-quarter volatility depending on the timing
associated with the loan work-outs. For this reason, they are considered
noncore fee income.

Noninterest expense totaled $543 million in the 1994 first quarter. When
noncore items such as net OREO expense and merger and integration charges are
excluded from all reporting periods for comparison purposes, 1994 first quarter
core noninterest expense was up 3 percent from the year-ago quarter, but down
$18 million, or 3 percent, from the 1993 fourth quarter. Contributing to this
decline were decreases in personnel and other expenses of $10 million and $12
million, respectively, which were partially offset by a $6 million increase in
net occupancy costs. First quarter 1994 net OREO expense was down $10 million
compared to the 1993 fourth quarter.

Another event of the 1994 first quarter was the completion of the acquisition
of Commercial Bancorporation of Colorado, with some $400 million in assets and
10 offices. This acquisition increases KeyCorp's presence in Northeast
Colorado, one of the nation's fastest growing markets. With this acquisition,
Key Bank of Colorado had $587 million in total assets as of March 31, 1994.

Effective January 1, 1994, the corporation adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." This new accounting standard
requires, among other things, that management classify its securities into
three portfolios: securities held to maturity, securities available for sale,
and trading securities. Securities available for sale are adjusted to their
fair values through shareholders' equity with no impact on net income. As a
result of this accounting change, approximately $4.5 billion of securities
were classified as available for sale at March 31, 1994, and shareholders'
equity was reduced by $23 million, representing the net unrealized after-tax
loss on these securities.

At March 31, 1994, assets totaled $61.5 billion and equity capital totaled
$4.5 billion. The March 31, 1994, Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 8.71 
percent.

KEYCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES

INTRODUCTION
On March 1, 1994, KeyCorp ("old KeyCorp"), a financial services holding company
headquartered in Albany, New York, with approximately $33 billion in assets as
of December 31, 1993, merged into and with Society Corporation ("Society"), a
financial services holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, with
approximately $27 billion in assets at year-end 1993. Society was the surviving
corporation of the merger under the name "KeyCorp". Other transactions which
were completed over the past two years and have had a significant impact on the
overall growth and geographic diversification of the combined organization are
described in Note 2, Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures, on page 51 of this
report.

The merger of old KeyCorp and Society (the "Merger") created one of the
country's largest and strongest financial services holding companies with
nearly $60 billion in total assets, the fifth largest branch network, the
sixteenth largest mortgage banking business and an investment management
business with approximately $34 billion in trust assets under management. The
combined results of these companies established a high level of performance as
KeyCorp's 1993 net income reached a record of $709.9 million. KeyCorp was
positioned eleventh among the country's bank holding companies based on
consolidated asset size as of December 31, 1993.

The Merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, the
financial information included in the remainder of this discussion and analysis
of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of KeyCorp
and its subsidiaries (the "Corporation") presents the combined results of old
KeyCorp and Society as if the Merger had been in effect for all periods
presented. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes presented on pages 46 through 72 of this report.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW
Figure 1 presents certain income statement components for 1993 and 1992
expressed on a per Common Share basis. A more detailed analysis of the major
factors affecting the comparability between the periods is provided throughout
this report. Net income for 1993 reached a record level of $709.9 million, or
$2.89 per Common Share, up from the previous record of $592.1 million, or $2.42
per Common Share, achieved in 1992 and $313.7 million, or $1.31 per Common
Share, in 1991. The return on average common equity for 1993 rose to 17.27%, up
from 16.33% and 9.29% in 1992 and 1991, respectively. The return on average
total assets was 1.24% in 1993, 1.13% in 1992 and .60% in 1991.

Record-level earnings were attained in 1993 despite fourth-quarter merger and
integration charges of $118.7 million ($80.6 million after tax, $.33 per Common
Share) recorded in connection with the Merger. In 1992, earnings were also

adversely impacted by similar charges totaling $50.0 million ($34.2
million after tax, $.15 per Common Share) recorded in the first quarter in
connection with the merger with Ameritrust Corporation ("Ameritrust") and $42.7
million ($32.4 million after tax, $.14 per Common Share) recorded in the fourth
quarter in connection with the merger with Puget Sound Bancorp ("PSB"). These
merger and integration charges are described in greater detail in Note 12,
Merger and Integration Charges, on page 63 of this report. Excluding the impact
of these merger and integration charges from noninterest expense, 1993 net
income grew by $131.8 million, or 20%, relative to the previous year. The 1993
improvement reflected a $221.2 million, or 9%, increase in taxable-equivalent
net interest income, a $76.5 million, or 8%, increase in noninterest income,
and a $126.7 million, or 37%, decrease in the provision for loan losses. These
positive factors were offset in part by a $188.7 million, or 9%, increase in
noninterest expense and a $94.3 million, or 34%, increase in tax expense.
Adjusting for the merger and integration charges recorded in both years, the
return on average common equity and the return on average total assets were
19.29% and 1.39%, respectively, in 1993, and 18.25% and 1.26%, respectively, in
1992. The efficiency ratio, which measures the extent to which revenue is
supported by overhead expense, also improved in 1993, decreasing from 60.96% in
1992 to 60.50% on an adjusted basis.

Net income in 1991 was also impacted by merger and integration charges. These
charges totaled $93.8 million ($68.2 million after tax, $.29 per Common Share)
and were recorded during the fourth quarter in connection with the Ameritrust
merger. Excluding the merger and integration

charges in both 1992 and 1991, net income in 1992 grew by $276.8 million, or
72%, relative to the previous year. This 1992 improvement reflected a $306.2
million, or 14%, increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income, a $75.9
million, or 9%, increase in noninterest income and a $127.8 million, or 27%,
decrease in the provision for loan losses. Noninterest expense in 1992
increased $105.8 million, or 5%, after adjusting for the merger and integration
charges in both years. 

On an adjusted basis, the 1991 return on average common equity, return on 
average total assets and efficiency ratios were 11.42%, .73% and 65.27%, 
respectively.

The decreased provision for loan losses in 1993 and 1992 reflected continuing
improvements in asset quality. Total nonperforming assets were $500.1 million
at December 31, 1993, compared with $900.2 million and $1.1 billion at December
31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

KEYCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES

Each of the items referred to in this performance overview is more fully 
described in the following discussion or in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements presented on pages 50 through 72 of this report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NET INTEREST INCOME
Net interest income, which is interest and loan-related
fee income less interest expense, is the principal source of earnings for
KeyCorp's banking affiliates. Net interest income is affected by a number of
factors including the level, pricing and maturity of earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities, interest rate fluctuations, and asset quality. To
facilitate comparisons in the following discussion, net interest income is
presented on a taxable-equivalent basis.

The trends in various components of the balance sheet and their respective
yields and rates which affect interest income and expense are illustrated in
Figure 4. The information presented in Figure 5 provides an analysis of the
effect of changes in yields/rates and average balances on net interest income
in 1993 and 1992. A more in-depth discussion of changes in earning assets and
funding sources is presented in the Financial Condition section beginning on
page 31.

Net interest income was $2.7 billion in 1993, up $221.2 million, or 9%, from
the prior year. This followed an increase of $306.2 million, or 14%, in 1992
relative to the comparable 1991 period. In 1993, the growth in net interest
income resulted from a higher level of average earning assets, as the net
interest margin of 5.31% was unchanged from the prior year.

Average earning assets in 1993 totaled $51.6 billion which represented an
increase of $4.1 billion, or 9%, from the prior year. This followed a slight
increase of $394.4 million, or 1%, in 1992 in comparison with the previous
year. The increase

</TABLE>

in 1993 reflected the impact of acquisitions completed in 1993 as well as
internal growth generated in the loan and securities available for sale
portfolios. Average loans rose $3.0 billion, or 8%, in 1993, while securities
available for sale were up $1.3 billion, or 158%, relative to the prior year.
These increases were partially offset by lower levels in other categories of
earning assets, primarily investment securities. The increase in loans can be
attributed to growth in real estate loans, student loans held for sale, and
lease financing receivables, offset in part by decreases in the consumer and
commercial loan portfolios. The $394.4 million growth in average earning assets
in 1992 reflected increases in investment securities, mortgage loans held for
sale, and loans of $569.6 million, $218.3 million and $157.1 million,
respectively. These increases were partially offset by a $601.1 million decline
in short-term investments, including $457.4 million of Federal funds sold and
security resale agreements. This latter decrease resulted from reduced
short-term funding requirements for loans and the planned reduction of excess
liquidity. The increase in loans in 1992 was restrained by a decline in demand
due to weak economic conditions; strategic efforts to reduce certain types of
lending; the anticipated run-off of certain Ameritrust credits; and the second
quarter sale of branch offices, including the sale of $331.8 million in loans,
required to meet a condition of the regulatory approvals for the merger with
Ameritrust.

As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the net interest margin was 5.31% for 1993 and
1992 and 4.71% in 1991. The net interest margin was unchanged in 1993 as the
decrease in the value of interest-free funds offset the impact of an improved
interest rate spread and the positive effect of a lower level of nonperforming
assets. In 1993 and 1992, the interest rate spread increased by 8 basis points
and 75 basis points, respectively, as the decrease in the rate paid on
interest-bearing liabilities exceeded the decrease in the yield on earning
assets. Several factors were responsible for the widened spreads, including an
interest rate sensitivity position which has enabled the Corporation to benefit
from the lower interest rate environment. This position was enhanced by the use
of interest rate swaps. The notional amount of such swaps increased to $9.6
billion at December 31, 1993, up from $5.6 billion at December 31, 1992, and
$3.8 billion at December 31, 1991. Included in these totals were $1.2 billion,
$623 million and $703 million, respectively, of swaps entered into to
accommodate the needs of customers rather than as part of the Corporation's
asset and liability management. Interest rate swaps contributed $140.3 million
to net interest income and added 27 basis points to the net interest margin in
1993. In 1992, interest rate swaps contributed $93.8 million to net interest
income and added 20 basis points to the net interest margin. The manner in
which interest rate swaps are used in the Corporation's overall program of
asset and liability management is described in the following Asset and
Liability

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT
The Corporation manages its exposure to economic loss from fluctuations in
interest rates through an active program of asset and liability management
within guidelines established by the Corporation's Asset/Liability Management
Committee ("ALCO"). The ALCO has the responsibility for approving the
asset/liability management policies of the Corporation, approving changes in
the balance sheet that would result in deviations from the guidelines in the
policy, approving strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and/or
earnings, and reviewing the interest rate sensitivity positions of the
Corporation and each of the affiliate banks. The ALCO meets twice monthly to
conduct this review and to approve strategies consistent with its policies.

The primary tool utilized by management to measure and manage interest rate
exposure is a simulation model. Use of the model to perform simulations of
changes in interest rates over one- and two-year time horizons has enabled
management to develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk.

In its simulations, management estimates the impact on net interest income from
pro forma 100 and 200 basis point changes in the overall level of interest
rates. ALCO policy guidelines provide that a 200 basis point increase or
decrease over a twelve-month period should not result in more than a 2%
negative impact on net interest income. Simulations as of December 31, 1993,
indicated that the Corporation was positioned within these guidelines and was
slightly liability sensitive.

The simulation model is supplemented with a more traditional tool used in the
banking industry for measuring interest rate risk known as interest rate
sensitivity gap ("gap") analysis. This tool measures the difference between
assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specified time periods. An
asset-sensitive position indicates that there are more rate-sensitive assets
than rate-sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within specified time
horizons, which would generally imply a favorable impact on net interest income
in periods of rising interest rates. Conversely, a liability-sensitive position,
where rate-sensitive liabilities exceed the amount of rate-sensitive assets
repricing or maturing within applicable time frames, would generally imply a
favorable impact on net interest income in periods of declining interest rates.
The interest rate gap analysis table shown in Figure 8 presents the gap position

the impact of off-balance sheet items) of the Corporation at December 31, 1993.
Gap analysis has several limitations. For example, it does not take into
consideration the varying degrees of interest rate sensitivity pertaining to
the assets and liabilities that reprice within one year, whereas such
characteristics are reflected in the simulation model. Thus, at December 31,
1993, the cumulative adjusted interest rate sensitivity gap of 1.41% within the
one-year time frame indicated the Corporation was slightly asset sensitive
whereas the more precise simulation model, previously described, indicated the
Corporation was slightly liability sensitive.

The Corporation's core lending and deposit-gathering businesses tend to
generate significantly more fixed-rate deposits than fixed-rate
interest-earning assets. Left unaddressed, this tendency would place the
Corporation's earnings at risk to declining interest rates as interest-earning
assets would reprice faster than would interest-bearing liabilities. To reduce
this risk, management has utilized its securities portfolio and, for the past
several years, interest rate swaps in the management of interest rate risk. The
decision to use "portfolio" interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk
versus on-balance sheet securities has depended on various factors, including
funding costs, liquidity and capital requirements. The Corporation's
"portfolio" swaps totaled $8.4 billion at December 31, 1993, and consisted
principally of contracts wherein the Corporation receives a fixed rate of
interest, while paying at a variable rate, as summarized in Figure 9.

In addition to "portfolio" swaps, the Corporation has entered into interest
rate swap agreements to accommodate the needs of its customers, typically
commercial loan customers. The Corporation offsets the interest rate risk of
customer swaps by entering into offsetting swaps, primarily with third parties.
These offsetting swaps are also included in the customer swap portfolio. Where
the Corporation does not have an existing loan with the customer, the swap
position of the customer and any offsetting swap with a third party are carried
at their respective fair values. The $1.2 billion notional value of customer
swaps in Figure 9 includes $645 million of interest rate swaps that receive a
fixed rate and pay a variable rate and $569 million of interest rate swaps that
receive a variable rate and pay a fixed rate.

The total notional value of all interest rate swap contracts outstanding was
$9.6 billion and $5.6 billion as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Of the $4.0 billion increase in the total notional amount of interest rate
swaps, $3.3 billion was attributable to "portfolio" swaps. In 1993, old KeyCorp
began utilizing interest rate swaps as part of its management of interest rate
risk. As a result of this new strategy, $3.0 billion of "portfolio" interest
rate swaps were added in 1993. Figure 10 shows the current year activity for
"portfolio" swaps.

At December 31, 1993, the aggregate notional values of interest rate swap
contracts, excluding customer swaps, maturing in each of the years 1994 through
1998 were $2.6 billion, $4.0 billion, $550 million, $200 million and $650
million, respectively.

The credit risk exposure to the counterparties for each interest rate swap
contract is monitored by the appropriate credit committees at both the
Corporate and affiliate bank levels. Based upon detailed credit reviews of the
counterparties, these credit committees establish limitations on the total
credit exposure the Corporation may have with each counterparty and indicate
whether collateral is required. At December 31, 1993, excluding customer swaps,
the Corporation had 18 counterparties to interest rate swap contracts, of which
the largest credit exposure to an individual counterparty was $9.4 million on a
notional amount of $300 million. The average total notional amount of swap
contracts with these 18 counterparties was $464 million with an average credit
exposure of $2.9 million.

NONINTEREST INCOME
As shown in Figure 12, noninterest income totaled $1.0 billion in 1993, up
$76.5 million, or 8%, from the prior year. After excluding the $29.4 million
gain on the sale of Ameritrust Texas Corporation ("ATC") and the $28.3 million
in net securities gains, noninterest income in 1993 was $944.0 million. This
represented an increase of $56.3 million, or 6%, from the comparable amount
reported in 1992; that is after excluding $22.9 million in gains on certain
asset sales, primarily from the sale of branch offices and loans, and net
securities gains totaling $14.6 million recorded in 1992. Adjusting for the
1991 net gains on securities transactions and gains on certain asset sales,
noninterest income in 1992 rose $81.3 million, or 10%, relative to the prior
year.

Trust income, including investment management fees, continued to be a major
source of revenue. At December 31, 1993, the Corporation, through Society
Asset Management, Inc. ("SAMI") and the trust departments of its affiliate
banks and trust subsidiaries, managed assets (excluding corporate trust assets) 
of approximately $34 billion. SAMI, which is

an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, is registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") as an investment advisor and is one of the largest
money managers in the Great Lakes Region. The sale of ATC in September 1993
reduced managed trust assets and trust fees by approximately $4 billion and
$8.0 million, respectively.

Service charges on deposit accounts have long been an important source of
revenue. In 1993, service charges on deposits increased by 7% to $252.5 million
from $236.6 million in 1992, which in turn was $19.2 million, or 9%, higher
than 1991's $217.4 million. Factors contributing to the improvements were a
larger base of business, pricing strategies and other initiatives designed to
offset higher costs associated with the servicing of these accounts.

</TABLE>

The 1993 increase in mortgage banking income as shown in Figure 13 was the
result of $25.5 million of gains realized on sales of servicing rights and
increased fees resulting from a high level of mortgage originations encouraged
by the low interest rate environment. However, the increased fees were more
than offset by an acceleration of the amortization of mortgage servicing rights
(which are netted against servicing fees for reporting purposes) made in
response to continued high levels of mortgage refinancings. 

In 1993, credit card fees decreased $7.4 million, or 9%, primarily due to a
decline in annual membership fees relative to the prior year. This compared to
an increase of $9.5 million, or 13%, in 1992. 

Total other noninterest income increased by $49.1 million, or 21%, in 1993
compared to 1992. Of this increase, $40.1 million in the "miscellaneous"
category related to fees earned by two affiliate companies, Niagara Asset
Corporation and Niagara Portfolio Management Corp., which operate under asset
management contracts with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").
Fees earned by these companies are expected to be at more modest levels in
1994. Also included in the other category are insurance and brokerage
commissions which increased $15.6 million, or 31%, in 1993 over 1992, largely
as a result of increased levels of business activity and management's
continued emphasis on building its fee-based business. Insurance and brokerage
products, such as mutual funds and annuities, are marketed through the branch
network.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE
Noninterest expense, as shown in Figure 14, totaled $2.4 billion in 1993, up
$214.7 million, or 10%, from the 1992 level. In both 1993 and the prior year,
noninterest expense was adversely impacted by merger and integration charges of
$118.7 million and $92.7 million, respectively. In addition, the current year
included several nonrecurring charges totaling $34.4 million. Significant items
included in the latter charges were $21.6 million related to various systems
conversion costs, $7.0 million of facilities-related charges and $4.0 million
associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."
Excluding the merger and integration charges and the nonrecurring items, 1993
expenses rose $154.3 million, or 7%, principally due to increases in personnel
expense, net occupancy expense, marketing expense and the "miscellaneous"
category; the total of which were offset in part by lower fees for professional
services. The overall increase in recurring noninterest expense was due, in
large part, to the impact of acquisitions completed in 1993. These transactions
are described in greater detail in Note 2, Mergers, Acquisitions and
Divestitures, appearing on page 51. The increased scale of operations as a
result of these acquisitions is not reflected in the 1992 figures. The 1991
period also included merger and integration charges of $93.8 million, as well
as $6.9 million of costs associated with a branch optimization program.

Personnel expense increased by $87.1 million, or 9%, in 1993 over 1992,
following an increase of 10% in 1992 over 1991. In addition to the impact of
the acquisitions completed in 1993, the increase over 1992 reflected the
Corporation's January 1, 1993, adoption of SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which added $8.2 million to
1993 employee benefits expense. Excluding the impact of the adoption of SFAS
No. 106 and SFAS No. 112, personnel expense for 1993 increased $74.9 million,
or 7%. SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 112 are more fully described on page 29. At
December 31, 1993, the number of full-time equivalent employees was 29,983, up
3% and 2% from 1992 and 1991 levels, respectively, principally due to
acquisitions.

Merger and integration charges of $118.7 million ($80.6 million after tax, $.33
per Common Share), $92.7 million ($66.6 million after tax, $.29 per Common
Share) and $93.8 million ($68.2 million after tax, $.29 per Common Share) were
recorded in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The merger and integration
charges in 1993 included accruals for expenses, primarily consisting of
investment banking and other professional fees directly related to the Merger
($20.5 million); severance payments and other employee costs ($49.6 million);
systems and facilities costs ($35.7 million); and other costs incident to the
Merger ($12.9 million).

These charges were recorded by the parent company in the fourth quarter of
1993, at which time management determined that it was probable that a liability
for such charges had been incurred and could be reasonably estimated. The
merger and integration charges recorded in connection with the PSB and
Ameritrust mergers in 1992 and the Ameritrust merger in 1991 were similar in
nature.

Although no assurance can be given, it is also expected that, as a result of
the Merger, cost savings will be achieved by the combined institution at an
annual rate of approximately $100 million by the end of the first quarter of
1995. These cost savings are anticipated to result from the integration of
operations and from efficiencies in certain combined lines of business.
Management presently expects that approximately 50% of the annual cost savings
will be achieved in 1994.

One measure used in the banking industry to assess the level of noninterest
expense is the efficiency ratio, which is defined in Figure 14. The efficiency
ratios for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were 60.50%, 60.96% and 65.27%, respectively.
The improvement in the Corporation's efficiency ratios reflected, in large
part, the success achieved in reducing overhead costs through the successful
integration of banking companies, coupled with strong growth in
taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income.

SFAS No. 106, previously referred to on page 28, requires that employers
recognize the cost of providing postretirement benefits over the employees'
active service periods to the date they attain full eligibility for such
benefits. The Corporation elected to recognize the transition obligation,
defined as the unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at the
date the standard is adopted, of approximately $107 million over a 20-year
period. As of December 31, 1993, the weighted average discount rate used in
determining the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement
benefits was reduced from 8.1% to 7.4%. In addition, the assumed rate of
increase in future compensation levels (applicable only to the determination of
pension benefits) was reduced from 4.8% to 4.0%. The net effect of these
assumption changes on 1994 expense levels is not expected to be material.
Another assumption used in the determination of the costs of other
postretirement benefits is the health care cost trend rate. Because of certain
benefit limitations in effect, increasing the rates assumed in each future year
by one percentage point would not have a material impact on the costs for other
postretirement benefits.

The Corporation adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits," during 1993. This standard requires that
employers who provide benefits to former or inactive employees after employment
but before retirement recognize a liability for such benefits if specified
conditions are met. Adoption of this standard increased noninterest expense by
$4.0 million. Postemployment benefits for 1992 and 1991, which were recorded on
a cash basis, were not restated.

INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes for 1993 was $374.0 million, compared with
$279.6 million in 1992 and $136.7 million in 1991. The increases in both 1993
and the prior year resulted from an overall increase in the level of taxable
earnings. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the "Act"), which was
signed into law on August 10, 1993, includes a number of items which impacted
the Corporation's Federal income tax provision. Primary among these items was a
retroactive increase in the Federal statutory tax rate from 34% to 35% as of
January 1, 1993. In addition, the Act places certain limitations on deductible
expenses which take effect after 1993. The effective tax rate (provision for
income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes) was 34.5% in 1993,
32.3% in 1992 and 30.3% in 1991. The effective tax rate was less than the
Federal statutory rate primarily due to tax-exempt income from certain
investment securities and loans. Management expects the Corporation's effective
tax rate to continue to approach the prevailing combined statutory Federal and
state income tax rates. The higher 1993 effective tax rate in comparison to
1992 and 1991 resulted from an increase in the proportion of taxable income to
total pre-tax income, coupled with the previously mentioned increase in the
Federal tax rate from 34% to 35%. Also affecting the 1993 effective tax rate
was a high level of non-deductible expenses included in the merger and
integration charges associated with the Merger.

During the first quarter of 1992, the Corporation adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on the Corporation's financial condition or results
of operations.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

LOANS
At December 31, 1993, total loans outstanding were $40.0 billion, as compared
with $36.0 billion at December 31, 1992, and $35.5 billion at December 31,
1991, as shown in Figure 15. The $4.0 billion, or 11%, increase from the
year-end 1992 level was due, in large part, to the impact of acquisitions which
were completed by the Corporation during 1993. Excluding the $2.5 billion
impact of these acquisitions, loans increased by $1.5 billion since the prior
year end. The internally generated loan growth of $1.5 billion reflected
increases of $1.1 billion in residential real estate loans, $578.5 million in
student loans held for sale and $430.1 million in lease financing receivables.
These increases were partially offset by decreases of $366.2 million in
commercial mortgage and construction loans, $73.0 million in commercial loans,
$98.9 million in consumer loans and $38.1 million in foreign loans. As shown in
Figure 16, the internally generated loan growth was primarily concentrated in
the Great Lakes Region, which has not experienced, to the same degree, the
general economic deterioration and weak loan demand experienced by other
regions of the country.

With respect to geographic concentration, Figure 17 depicts the loan portfolio
at December 31, 1993, by banking region. The Corporation's unique
thirteen-state, four-region profile has provided significant credit risk
diversification. The dangers to banks of regional concentration have been
vividly demonstrated in recent years by the problems of many competitors whose
lending market is confined to one particular area where the economy has
faltered.

Commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 1993, were $9.0 billion, up 1%
from the December 31, 1992, level of $8.9 billion, following a decrease of
$314.9 million, or 3%, from the prior year. The decline in 1992 can be
attributed to weaker loan demand as a consequence of the economic environment
and to strategic efforts to reduce the level of exposure related to
highly-leveraged transactions ("HLT"), principally acquired in the Ameritrust
merger, where there has not been a long-standing relationship with the
borrower. In addition, the decline in 1992 reflected the run-off of certain
other Ameritrust credits which management believed were incompatible with the
Corporation's credit risk profile. At December 31, 1993, the Corporation had
$247.5 million in HLT loans outstanding, down $157.7 million, or 39%, from the
December 31, 1992, level.

Loans secured by real estate totaled $18.4 billion at December 31, 1993,
compared with $15.7 billion at December 31, 1992, and $15.1 billion at December
31, 1991. Loans secured by real estate consist of construction loans,
commercial mortgage loans and one-to-four family residential loans (including
home equity loans). The $2.7 billion, or 17%, increase from 1992 was mainly
attributable to the acquisitions which the Corporation completed during 1993.
Acquisitions accounted for $2.0 billion of the increase in total real estate
loans, including $1.6 billion of the increase in the residential mortgage
portfolio.

Construction loans decreased to $1.2 billion at December 31, 1993, from $1.4
billion at December 31, 1992, and $1.6 billion at December 31, 1991. After
adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, the decrease from year-end 1992 was
$343.0 million. At December 31, 1993, 12% of the portfolio was secured by

properties in the Northeast Region, 54% in the Great Lakes Region, 11% in the
Rocky Mountain Region and 23% in the Northwest Region, the principal banking
markets served by the Corporation.

The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $6.2 billion at December 31,
1993, compared with $5.9 billion at December 31, 1992, and $6.3 billion at
December 31, 1991. This loan category, in general, has concerned many followers
of the banking industry in the last few years. This apprehension stems from
overcapacity in the commercial real estate market, made worse by general
economic deterioration and a resultant deflation in real estate values. The
Corporation manages risk exposure in the construction and commercial mortgage
portfolios through prudent underwriting criteria and by monitoring loan
concentrations by geographic region and property type. Figure 18 details the
industry concentrations within the commercial real estate portfolio at December
31, 1993, and shows the portions of the portfolio which are nonowner-occupied
versus owner-occupied. At December 31, 1993, 41% of the construction portfolio
and 44% of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio were comprised of loans
secured by owner-occupied properties. Those borrowers are engaged in business
activities other than real estate, and the primary source of repayment is not
solely dependent on the real estate market.

One-to-four family residential mortgages (including home equity loans) were
$11.0 billion at December 31, 1993, compared with $8.3 billion at December 31,
1992, and $7.2 billion at December 31, 1991. Excluding the impact of
acquisitions, residential mortgages increased $1.1 billion, or 14%, in 1993. A
significant portion of the loan originations during 1993, as well as in 1992,
is attributable to homeowner refinancings, reflecting the lower level of
interest rates. During 1993 the Corporation continued its strategy of
originating and selling most fixed rate loans with 30-year maturities in the
secondary market (and such loans are classified outside of the loan portfolio
as mortgage loans held for sale), whereas other fixed and adjustable rate loans
are originated to secondary market standards and maintained in the portfolio.
At December 31, 1993, the Corporation's mortgage banking operation serviced
approximately $27 billion in loans owned by both affiliate banks and third
parties.

Consumer loans totaled $9.3 billion at December 31, 1993, compared with $9.1
billion at December 31, 1992, and $10.3 billion at December 31, 1991. The
decrease during 1992 reflected the designation of approximately $1.1 billion of
student loans as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 1992. Consumer loans
also declined in 1992 as a result of the sale of $117.6 million in outstandings
as part of branch sales completed in May and June 1992 in connection with the
Ameritrust merger, and the sale of $240.0 million in student loans in August
1992. Excluding the impact of acquisitions in 1993, the portfolio declined
$98.9 million from the 1992 year-end level.

As previously indicated, during the latter part of 1992 the Corporation
designated its student loan portfolio, totaling approximately $1.1 billion, as
held for sale. Since then, this portfolio has grown to $1.6 billion at December
31, 1993, representing an increase of $578.5 million, or 54%, from the year-end
1992 level. The higher level of outstandings in 1993 reflected the
Corporation's role as a primary provider of education loans to law school
students. In June 1993 the Corporation securitized, without recourse, a portion
of this portfolio totaling $200 million. Management anticipates continued
involvement in these programs and plans to sell or securitize such loans at or
near the time that they enter repayment status.

SECURITIES
At December 31, 1993, the book value of the investment securities portfolio
totaled $11.1 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion, or 24%, from December 31,
1992. The growth in 1993 primarily resulted from an increase of $1.8 billion,
or 30%, in mortgage-backed securities. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the
investment securities portfolio comprised 20% and 18%, respectively, of total
earning assets.

The yield on the investment securities portfolio declined to 6.51% at December
31, 1993, from 7.72% at December 31, 1992. This reduction was attributable to
prepayments on higher-yielding mortgage-backed securities coupled with lower
reinvestment yields resulting from the declining rate environment. The
investment portfolio's market value exceeded its book value by $218.1 million
at December 31, 1993, compared with an excess of $216.8 million at December 31,
1992.

At December 31, 1993, the Corporation had $7.9 billion invested in
mortgage-backed pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations
("CMO") within the investment securities portfolio, compared with $6.1 billion
at December 31, 1992. A mortgage-backed pass-through security depends on the
underlying pool of mortgage loans to provide a cash flow "pass-through" of
principal and interest. The Corporation had $4.3 billion invested in
mortgage-backed pass-through securities at December 31, 1993. A CMO is a
mortgage-backed security that is comprised of classes of bonds created by
prioritizing the cash flows from the underlying mortgage pool in order to meet
different objectives of investors. The Corporation had $3.6 billion invested in
CMO securities at December 31, 1993. The CMO securities held by the Corporation
are primarily shorter-maturity class bonds that were structured to have more
predictable cash flows by being less sensitive to prepayments during periods of
changing interest rates. At December 31, 1993, substantially all of the CMOs
and mortgage-backed pass-through securities held by the Corporation were issued
by Federal agencies or backed by Federal agency pass-through securities.

In 1992, the Corporation transferred the majority of its U.S. Treasury
securities and certain other securities from the investment portfolio to the
"available for sale" portfolio. The specific designation of certain securities
as available for sale was made by the Corporation, as well as a significant
number of other major bank holding companies, in response to a general mandate
of the SEC. The designation of securities as available for sale applies to all
securities that may be held for indefinite periods, including securities that
may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayment
risk, increases in loan demand, or for general liquidity and other similar
factors. Securities which the Corporation has the ability and positive intent
to hold to maturity are included in the investment securities portfolio. At
December 31, 1993, the book value of the available for sale portfolio totaled
$1.7 billion, a decrease of $731.8 million, or 30%, from year-end 1992.

ASSET QUALITY
The Corporation's Loan Review Group measures and determines the level of risk
in the Corporation's loan-related assets. This includes the formulation of
underwriting standards and active line management. Geographic diversification
and variation of the dollar amount of loans throughout the Corporation also
provide a method for managing asset quality. In addition, the Loan Review Group
is responsible for reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses
("Allowance"). The Corporation's Credit Policy/Risk Management Group reviews
corporate assets other than loans, leases and OREO to determine the credit
quality and credit risk inherent in such assets. This Group is also responsible
for commercial and consumer credit policy development, concentration management
and credit systems development.

Allowance methodologies at both old KeyCorp and Society were designed to
provide adequate coverage for both potential and unforeseen loan losses. The
methodology following the Merger will be a hybrid of the methodologies used by
the two organizations. Management will continue to target and maintain a
minimum allowance equal to the allocated requirement plus an unallocated
portion, as appropriate, as shown in Figure 21. Management believes this is an
appropriate posture in light of current and expected economic conditions and
trends, the geographic and industry mix of the portfolio, and similar
risk-related matters. The 1993 provision for loan losses ("Provision") was
$211.7 million compared to $338.4 million in 1992 and $466.2 million in 1991.
The significantly lower Provision in 1993 reflected a corporate-wide
improvement in asset quality, including significant declines in nonperforming
loans.

Most of the charge-offs in 1992 and 1993 were related to problem
credits for which reserves were established in previous periods.

The Allowance at December 31, 1993, was $802.7 million, or 2.00% of loans,
compared with $782.6 million, or 2.17% of loans, at December 31, 1992. As a
percentage of nonperforming loans, the Allowance was 238.69% in 1993 and
141.54% in 1992. Although used as a general indicator, this percentage is not a
primary factor in the determination of the adequacy of the Allowance by
management. As indicated in Figure 21, the unallocated portion of the Allowance
increased in 1993, reflecting continued improvement in overall loan portfolio
quality.

As shown in Figure 24, nonperforming assets totaled $500.1 million at December
31, 1993, down $400.1 million, or 44%, from the December 31, 1992, level. This
followed a decrease of $171.7 million, or 16%, from the previous year. The
significant improvement in 1993 resulted largely from a $216.6 million, or 39%,
decrease in nonperforming loans and a $182.0 million, or 55%, decrease in OREO.
Other nonperforming assets, which are comprised primarily of nonperforming
venture capital investments, decreased $1.5 million, or 10%, in 1993. The
reduction in nonperforming loans was principally

attributable to decreases in nonaccrual commercial (including HLT),
construction and commercial real estate loans. At the end of 1993, nonaccrual
loans in these categories comprised 39%, 12% and 30%, respectively, of total
nonperforming loans and totaled $267.9 million, down $209.1 million, or 44%,
from the previous year-end. This reduction reflected progress made in working
through the credit problems associated with the Ameritrust acquisition. As
indicated in Figure 25, the reduction in OREO was primarily due to the
selective sale of assets.

On a regional basis, all of the Corporation's banks showed improvement in the
ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans plus OREO and other nonperforming
assets. As indicated by Figure 20, the largest basis point improvement was
experienced in the Great Lakes Region.

At December 31, 1993, HLT loans classified as nonperforming amounted to $25.3
million, or 8%, of total nonperforming loans. At December 31, 1992,
nonperforming HLT loans aggregated $4.6 million, or 1%, of total nonperforming
loans. One individual nonperforming HLT loan represented $18.1 million, or 72%,
of the total at December 31, 1993.

DEPOSITS AND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS
Core deposits, defined as domestic deposits other than certificates of deposit
of $100,000 or more, are the Corporation's primary source of funding. These
deposits averaged $40.2 billion in 1993, $37.4 billion in 1992 and $36.2
billion in 1991. The 1993 increase in average core deposits was primarily a
result of acquisitions. The impact of these acquisitions was substantially
offset, however, by the sale of approximately $1.0 billion in deposits late in
the second quarter of 1992 (as part of the agreement reached with the United
States Department of Justice and in accordance with the Federal Reserve Board
order to divest certain branches in connection with the Ameritrust merger) and
the pursuit of other alternatives by consumers in response to declining
interest rates. In 1993, balances shifted significantly from the "other time
deposits" category, consisting primarily of fixed rate certificates of deposit
of less than $100,000, to noninterest-bearing and savings deposits (including
NOW accounts) with higher liquidity, also in response to declining interest
rates.

Purchased funds, which are comprised of large certificates of deposit, deposits
in the foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $9.7 billion for
1993, up $957.1 million, or 11%, from 1992. Average purchased funds were not
materially impacted by the acquisitions completed during 1993. The increase was
largely attributable to increases in foreign office deposits, Federal funds
purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other
short-term borrowings. These increases were partially offset by a decline in
large certificates of deposit.

LIQUIDITY
Liquidity represents the availability of funding to meet the needs of
depositors, borrowers and creditors at a reasonable cost and without adverse
consequences. The Corporation's ALCO actively analyzes and manages the
Corporation's liquidity in coordination with similar committees at each
affiliate bank. The affiliate banks individually maintain liquidity in the form
of short-term money market investments, anticipated prepayments and maturities
on securities and through the maturity structure of their loan portfolios.
Another source of liquidity are those securities classified as available for
sale. In addition, the affiliate banks have access to various sources of
non-core market funding for short-term liquidity requirements should the need
arise. The effective management of balance sheet volumes, mix and maturities
enables the affiliate banks to maintain adequate levels of liquidity while
enhancing profitability.

During 1993, Society National Bank ("SNB"), the Corporation's Ohio bank, issued
$685 million in debt securities under a Medium-Term Bank Note program. These
securities have maturities of less than one year and are included in other
short-term borrowings. The proceeds from the issuance of these securities were
used for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business. During
1993 and 1992, KeyCorp issued $305.1 million and $77.0 million, respectively,
in debt securities under separate Medium-Term Note programs. These securities
have maturities in excess of one year and are included in long-term debt.
Subordinated debt totaling $325 million was also issued by KeyCorp in 1992.
During both the second quarter of 1993 and the fourth quarter of 1992, SNB also
issued $200 million in subordinated long-term debt to be used to supplement its
capital base and to provide funds for loans and investments.

During 1993, KeyCorp redeemed $163.4 million in long-term debt securities due
through 2002 at par plus accrued interest. In addition, KeyCorp redeemed
1,200,000 outstanding shares of Fixed/Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock at 103% of its stated value of $60 million plus accumulated but unpaid
dividends, and 479,394 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at its stated value
of $24 million plus accumulated but unpaid dividends.

The liquidity requirements of the parent company, primarily for dividends to
shareholders, retirement of debt and other corporate purposes, are principally
met through regular dividends from affiliate banks. As of December 31, 1993,
$535.4 million was available in the affiliate banks for the payment of
dividends to the parent company without prior regulatory approval. Excess funds
are maintained in short-term investments. The parent company has no lines of
credit with other financial institutions but has ready access to the capital
markets as a result of its favorable debt ratings.

CAPITAL AND DIVIDENDS
Total shareholders' equity at December 31, 1993, was $4.4 billion, up $466.3
million, or 12%, from the balance at the end of 1992. This followed an increase
of $410.9 million, or 12%, from the prior year. In both years the increase was
principally due to the retention of net income after dividends. Other
significant changes in shareholders' equity in 1993 resulted

Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and
performance. Overall, KeyCorp's capital position remains strong with a ratio of
total shareholders' equity to total assets of 7.37% at December 31, 1993, up
from 7.13% and 6.56% at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Banking industry regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding
companies and their banking and savings association subsidiaries. Based on the
risk-based capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators,
KeyCorp's Tier I and total capital to net risk-adjusted assets ratios at
December 31, 1993, were 8.73% and 12.22%, respectively. These compare favorably
with the minimum requirements of 4.0% for Tier I and 8.0% for total capital. 
The regulatory Tier I leverage ratio standard prescribes a minimum ratio of
3.0%, although most banking organizations are expected to maintain ratios of at
least 100 to 200 basis points above the minimum. At December 31, 1993,
KeyCorp's leverage ratio was 6.72%, substantially higher than the minimum
requirement. Figure 28 presents the details of KeyCorp's capital position at
December 31, 1993 and 1992.

Effective December 1992, Federal bank regulators adopted new regulations to
implement the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act which group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five broad
categories based on certain capital ratios. The five categories are
"well-capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly
capitalized," and "critically undercapitalized." Although these provisions are
not directly applicable to the Corporation under existing law and regulations,
based upon its ratios the Corporation would qualify, and KeyCorp's affiliate
banks do qualify, as "well-capitalized" at December 31, 1993. The FDIC-defined
capital categories, as determined by applying the prompt corrective action
provisions of the law, may not constitute an accurate representation of the
overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or its affiliate banks.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal
Reserve and the FDIC are proposing amendments to their
respective regulatory capital rules to include in Tier I capital
the net unrealized changes in the value of securities available
for sale for purposes of calculating the risk-based and lever-
age ratios. The proposed amendments are in response to the
provisions outlined in SFAS No. 115,"Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which takes
effect for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993.
See Note 4, Investment Securities, on page 55 for a more
complete description of SFAS No. 115. This new accounting
standard establishes, among other things, net unrealized
holding gains and losses on securities available for sale as
a new component of shareholders' equity. If adopted as pro-
posed, the rules could cause the Tier I capital to be subject
to greater volatility. However, neither SFAS No. 115 nor the
capital proposals would have any direct impact on reported
earnings. Based upon the Corporation's securities portfolio
classified as available for sale as of December 31, 1993, the
estimated impact of the new standard would be an increase
to shareholders' equity of approximately $44 million. The
regulatory agencies are also proposing to add an additional
component to the risk-based capital requirements based upon
the level of an institution's exposure to interest rate risk.

Common Shares outstanding and per Common Share data
have been adjusted for a two-for-one stock split effected
on March 22, 1993 by means of a 100% stock dividend.
At December 31, 1993, book value per Common Share was
$17.53 based on 241,547,151 shares outstanding, compared
with $15.64 based on 235,432,181 shares outstanding at
December 31, 1992. KeyCorp's Common Shares are traded
on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEY. The
sales price ranges of the Common Shares and per Common
Share net income and dividends by quarter for each of the
last two years are presented in Figure 30. At year-end 1993,
the closing sales price on the New York Stock Exchange was
$29.75 per share. This price was 170% of year-end book value
per share and had a dividend yield of 3.76%. On January 20,
1994, the quarterly dividend on Common Shares was
increased by 14% to $.32 per Common Share, up from $.28
per Common Share in 1993. The first-quarter dividend of
$.32 per Common Share was paid on March 15, 1994, to
shareholders of record on February 28, 1994. There were
57,414 holders of record of KeyCorp Common Shares
at March 1, 1994.

FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
As shown in Figure 30, net income for the fourth quarter of
1993 was $122.3 million, or $.49 per Common Share, com-
pared with $143.7 million, or $.58 per Common Share, for the
same period last year. The 1993 period was impacted by merger
and integration charges of $118.7 million ($80.6 million after-
tax $.33 per Common Share) recorded in connection with the
Merger. In the prior year, fourth-quarter results were reduced
by merger and integration charges totaling $42.7 million
($32.4 million after tax, $.14 per Common Share) incurred
in connection with the acquisition of PSB. Excluding the
impact of the merger and integration charges, net income
was $203.0 million in 1993, up $26.8 million, or 15%, from
the prior year. This reflected a $34.8 million, or 5%, increase
in taxable-equivalent net interest income; a $30.8 million,
or 40%, decrease in the provision for loan losses; and an
$11.1 million, or 5%, increase in noninterest income. These
positive factors were partially offset by an increase of
$40.9 million, or 8%, in noninterest expense. On an annual-
ized basis, the return on average total assets for the fourth
quarter of 1993 was .83% compared with 1.05% for the fourth
quarter of 1992. The annualized returns on average common
equity for the fourth quarters of 1993 and 1992 were 11.09%
and 15.04%, respectively. On an annualized basis, adjusting
for the merger and integration charges, the fourth-quarter
return on average total assets and the return on average
common equity were 1.38% and 18.64%, respectively, in
1993 and 1.28% and 18.53%, respectively, in 1992.

The improvement in taxable-equivalent net interest income
in the fourth quarter of 1993, as compared to the fourth
quarter of 1992, reflected a $3.5 billion, or 7%, increase in
the level of average earning assets, offset in part by an 8
basis point decline in the net interest margin to 5.21%. The
higher level of average earning assets reflected the impact
of acquisitions accounted for as purchases completed in 1993
as well as internal growth achieved in loans, mortgage loans
held for sale and investment securities. The growth in aver-
age earning assets in 1993 was mainly due to an increase of
$3.3 billion in average loans; principally those related to real
estate, student loans held for sale and the lease financing
portfolio; an increase of $453.0 million in investment securi-
ties; and an increase of $467.3 million in mortgage loans held
for sale. These increases were partially offset by decreases of
$623.6 million in interest-bearing deposits with banks and
$233.3 million in Federal funds sold and security resale
agreements. The decline in the net interest margin reflected
the narrowing of spreads available on the replacement of
matured and prepaid loans, securities and interest rate swaps,
and the narrower spread contributed by Society First Federal
Savings Bank. The lower provision for loan losses resulted
from the overall improvement in asset quality, including a
$216.6 million, or 39%, decline in nonperforming loans from
December 31, 1992, to December 31, 1993. The increase
in noninterest expense, excluding merger and integration
charges, was primarily due to higher personnel expense, offset
in part by lower costs associated with professional services.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG / INDEPENDENT

Shareholders and Board of Directors
KeyCorp

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of KeyCorp and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial
statements, which give effect to the March 1, 1994, merger of KeyCorp and
Society Corporation, are the responsibility of the Corporation's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, 
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of KeyCorp 
and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results 
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

KeyCorp is a financial services holding company headquartered in Cleveland,
Ohio, and is engaged primarily in the business of commercial and retail
banking. It provides a wide range of banking, fiduciary, mortgage banking,
insurance and other financial services to corporate, institutional and
individual customers. 

The accounting policies of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries (the "Corporation") 
conform with generally accepted accounting principles and prevailing practices 
within the financial services industry. The following is a summary of 
significant accounting and reporting policies. 

KEYCORP-SOCIETY MERGER
On March 1, 1994, KeyCorp ("old KeyCorp") merged into 
and with Society Corporation ("Society"), which was the surviving corporation 
under the name KeyCorp. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
and, accordingly, the financial information for all prior periods has been 
restated to present the combined financial condition and results of operations 
of both companies as if the merger had been in effect for all periods presented.
Further details pertaining to the merger are presented in Note 2, Mergers,
Acquisitions and Divestitures, on page 51 of this report. 

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications,
including adjustments to conform accounting practices, have been made to prior
year amounts to agree to the current year presentation. 

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
In business combinations accounted for as poolings of interests, the assets,
liabilities and shareholders' equity of the respective companies are carried
forward at their historical amounts, the companies' results of operations are
combined and the prior periods' financial statements are restated to give
effect to the merger. 

In business combinations accounted for as purchases, the results of operations 
of the acquired businesses are included from the respective dates of 
acquisition. Net assets of the companies acquired are recorded at their cost 
to the corporation at the date of acquisition and related purchase premiums 
and discounts are amortized over the remaining average lives of the respective 
assets or liabilities. 

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
Cash and due from banks are considered as cash and cash equivalents.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
Securities which the corporation has the ability and positive intent to hold 
to maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and 
accretion of discounts using the level yield method. Gains or losses from the 
sales of investment securities are computed using the specific identification 
method and included in net securities gains. 

SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS 
Securities available for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or 
market value. Gains or losses from the sale of securities available for sale 
are computed using the specific identification method and are included in net 
securities gains. Market value adjustments for trading account assets 
(included in short-term investments) and changes in net unrealized losses on 
securities available for sale are included in noninterest income. 

MORTGAGE LOANS HELD FOR SALE 
Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, 
market value, or contracted sales value when fixed price commitments to sell 
exist.

LOANS
Loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of 
unearned income, including deferred loan fees. certain nonrefundable loan
origination and commitment fees and the direct costs associated with 
originating or acquiring the loans are deferred. The net

<PAGE> 34
KEYCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

deferred amount is amortized as an adjustment to the related loan yield over 
the contractual lives of the related loans. Student loans held for sale
are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value.

Interest income on loans is primarily accrued based on principal amounts 
outstanding. The accrual of interest is discontinued when circumstances 
indicate that collection is questionable, or generally when payment is over 
90 days past due. In such cases, interest accrued but not collected is charged 
against the allowance for loan losses. Thereafter, payments received are first 
applied to the principal. Depending on management's assessment of the 
ultimate collectibility of the loan, interest income may be recognized on a 
cash basis. Loans are returned to accrual status when management determines 
that the circumstances have improved to the extent that both principal and 
interest are deemed collectible and there has been a sustained period of 
repayment performance. 

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
The allowance for loan losses is the amount which, in the opinion of 
management, is necessary to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio. 
Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the 
market area served, local economic conditions, the growth and composition of 
the loan portfolios and their related risk characteristics, and the continual 
review by management of the quality of the loan portfolio. 

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FINANCIAL FUTURES AND OPTIONS 
The Corporation uses interest rate swaps, financial futures and
options to manage the interest rate exposure of certain interest-sensitive
assets and liabilities as part of the corporation's overall strategy to manage
interest rate risk. The net interest received or paid on interest rate swaps is
recognized over the lives of the respective contracts as an adjustment to
interest income or expense. Gains and losses resulting from the termination of
interest rate swaps are deferred and amortized over the remaining lives of the
related financial instruments. Gains and losses on futures and option contracts
are recognized when the related hedged financial instruments are sold.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT 
Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of premises and 
equipment is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated 
useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized 
using the straight-line method over the terms of the leases. Other real 
estate owned other real estate owned includes real estate acquired through 
foreclosure or a similar conveyance of title and real estate considered to be 
in substance foreclosed when specific criteria are met. Other real estate owned 
is carried at the lower of its recorded amount or fair value less estimated 
cost of disposal. Writedowns of the assets at, or prior to, the dates of 
acquisition are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent 
writedowns, income and expenses incurred in connection with holding such 
assets, and gains and losses resulting from the sales of such assets, are 
included in other noninterest expense.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill, representing the excess of the cost of acquisitons over the fair
value of net assets acquired, is amortized using the straight-line method over
the estimated period to be benefited, generally not exceeding 25 years. Core
deposit intangibles represent the net present value of the future economic
benefits related to the use of deposits purchase. They are being amortized
using an accelerated method over periods ranging from 7 to 15 years. Other
intangibles are generally being amortized using the straight-line method over
periods ranging from 4 to 15 years.

PURCHASED MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS
Purchased mortgage servicing rights represent the cost of the right to receive
future servicing income. Purchase mortgage servicing rights are amortized, as a
reduction to service fee income, over the estimated life of the related loans
in proportion to the recognition of estimated net servicing income. An
evaluation of the carrying amount of the purchased mortgage servicing rights is
performed on a disaggregated basis by discounting the expected future cash
flows, taking into consideration the estimated level of prepayments based upon
current industry expectations.

INCOME TAXES
Old KeyCorp and Society each filed consolidated Federal Income tax returns for
the periods presented. Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation prospectively
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," which supersedes SFAS No. 96. The cumulative
effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 was not material.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per Common Share is computed by dividing net income, less preferred
stock dividends, by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding.
These amounts have been adjusted to reflect stock splits.

2. MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

KEYCORP-SOCIETY MERGER
On March 1, 1993, KeyCorp ("old KeyCorp"), a financial services holding company
headquartered in Albany, New York, with approximately $33 billion in assets as
of December 31, 1993, merged into and with Society Corporation ("Society"), a
financial services holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, with
approximately $27 billion in assets at year-end 1993, which was the surviving
corporation and assumed the name KeyCorp. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, 124,351,183 KeyCorp Common Shares were exchanged for all of the
outstanding shares of old KeyCorp common stock (based on an exchange ratio of
1.205 shares for each share of old KeyCorp). The outstanding preferred stock
of old KeyCorp was exchanged for 1,280,000 shares of a comparable, new issue of
10% Cumulative Preferred Stock of KeyCorp. The merger was accounted for as a
pooling of interest and, accordingly, financial results for prior periods
presented have been restated to include the combined financial results of both
companies.

The following table presents net interest income, net income and net income per
Common Share reported by each of the companies and on a combined basis.

Mortgage-backed securities are included in the above maturity schedule based on
their expected average lives. Other securities consist primarily of those
collateralized by credit card and automobile installment loan receivables,
corporate floating-rate notes and venture capital investments. 

The proceeds from sales of investment securities were $142.1 million, $662.2
million and $1.1 billion during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Gross gains
and losses related to securities were $.8 million and $7.8 million,
respectively, in 1993, $13.0 million and $.9 million, respectively, in 1992, and
$26.2 million and $7.3 million, respectively, in 1991. 

At December 31, 1993, investment and available for sale securities with a book
value of approximately $9.6 billion were pledged to secure public and trust
deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and for certain
other purposes required or permitted by law.

In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities." SFAS No. 115 requires that equity securities
having readily determinable fair values and all investments in debt securities
be classified and accounted for in three categories. Debt securities that
management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are to be
classified as "held-to-maturity securities" and reported at amortized cost. Debt
and equity securities that are bought and principally held for the purpose of
selling them in the near term are to be classified as "trading securities" and
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in operating
results. Debt and equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity
securities or trading securities are to be classified as "available for sale
securities" and reported at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses
excluded from operating results and reported as a separate component of
shareholders' equity. Adoption of SFAS No. 115 is required for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1993, with earlier application permitted. The
Corporation will adopt SFAS No. 115 in 1994. Based upon the Corporation's
securities portfolio classified as available for sale as of December 31, 1993,
the estimated impact of the new standard would be an increase to shareholders'
equity of approximately $44 million, with no effect on the results of
operations. With the adoption of SFAS No. 115 in 1994, the Corporation
anticipates that securities with an aggregate book value ranging from $4.5
billion to $5.0 billion will be designated as available for sale. Based upon the
market values of these securities at year-end 1993, the reclassification of
these securities is not expected to have a material effect on shareholders'
equity.

In 1991, Ameritrust recorded an additional $93.9 million provision for loan
losses to conform its approach to determining the level of the allowance to
that used by the Corporation.

In the ordinary course of business, KeyCorp's banking affiliates have made loans
at prevailing interest rates and terms to directors and executive officers of
KeyCorp and its subsidiaries and their associates (as defined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission). Such loans, in management's opinion, did not present
more than the normal risk of collectibility or incorporate other unfavorable
features. The aggregate amount of loans outstanding to qualifying related
parties at January 1, 1993, was $241.3 million. During 1993, activity with
respect to these loans included new loans, repayments and a net decrease (due to
changes in the status of executive officers and directors) of $149.3 million,
$153.9 million and $40.3 million, respectively, resulting in an aggregate
balance of loans outstanding to related parties at December 31, 1993, of $196.4
million.

In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan," which takes effect for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1994. SFAS No. 114 prescribes a valuation methodology for impaired
loans as defined by the standard. Generally, a loan is considered impaired if
management believes that it is probable that all amounts due will not be
collected according to the contractual terms, as scheduled in the loan
agreement. An impaired loan must be valued using the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's
observable market price or the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral.
The Corporation expects to adopt SFAS No. 114 prospectively in the first
quarter of 1995. It is anticipated that the adoption of SFAS No. 114 will not
have a material effect on the Corporation's financial condition or results of
operations.

9. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Short-term borrowings consist primarily of Federal funds purchased and
securities sold under repurchase agreements, which generally represent
overnight borrowing transactions. Other short-term borrowings consist primarily
of Medium-Term Notes with original maturities of one year or less, Treasury,
tax and loan demand notes and commercial paper which is issued principally in
amounts of $100,000 or more with maturities of 270 days or less. 

On November 30, 1992, Society National Bank ("SNB"), KeyCorp's Ohio banking 
affiliate, authorized the issuance of up to $1 billion of Medium-Term Notes to 
be offered on a continuous basis. During 1993, $685 million in debt securities 
were issued under this program. These securities have original maturities of 
less than one year and are included in other short-term borrowings.

During 1993 and 1992, KeyCorp issued $305.1 million and $77.0 million,
respectively, of Medium-Term Notes with original maturities exceeding one year.
In addition to general corporate purposes, the proceeds from the issuance of
these notes were used to redeem and pay principal on notes and debentures; to
fund the purchase of OREO from affiliate banks by NCB Properties, Inc., an OREO
workout subsidiary; and to provide subordinated capital to affiliate banks. At
December 31, 1993, KeyCorp's Medium-Term Notes as presented in the table had a
weighted average interest rate of 6.61% and had varying maturities through 
2003. 

On June 15, 1992, KeyCorp issued $200 million of 8.125% Subordinated Notes 
under a shelf registration. The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. 
The 8.875% Notes, issued under a separate registration statement, and the 
11.125% Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. 

On March 26, 1987, KeyCorp issued $75 million of 8.40% Subordinated Capital 
Notes due 1999 under an indenture dated March 1, 1987, between KeyCorp and 
Chemical Bank, as trustee. The Notes are unsecured obligations of KeyCorp and 
will, at maturity, be exchanged for Capital Securities having a market value 
equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Proceeds of this issue were used 
primarily to fund the acquisition of Seattle Trust & Savings Bank in July 1987.

On June 29, 1992, KeyCorp issued $125 million of 8.00% Subordinated Notes. 
Proceeds from these twelve-year notes were used to redeem without penalty all 
of its 11.25% Senior Notes prior to maturity. Proceeds were also employed to 
provide capital for Key Bank of Washington. This capital infusion was made in 
anticipation of Key Bank of Washington's purchase of 48 former Security Pacific 
Bank branches from BankAmerica on September 3, 1992. 

In 1989, the Ameritrust Corporation Employees' Savings and Investment Plan (the
"Plan") was amended to include a leveraged employee stock ownership plan 
("ESOP"). To fund the ESOP, Ameritrust borrowed $71.7 million from several 
institutional investors through the placement of unsecured notes totaling 
$22.8 million (the "8.33% Notes") and $48.9 million (the "8.48% Notes"). The 
interest on those Notes totaled $6.0 million in each of the years 1993, 1992 
and 1991. The ESOP trustee used the proceeds to purchase 5.8 million shares of 
Ameritrust common stock. These shares, as converted in the merger with Society, 
are held by the ESOP trustee for matching employee contributions to the Plan. 
The net difference between the cost of the treasury shares sold to the ESOP 
trustee and their market value was recorded as a reduction to retained 
earnings. Except for the repayment schedule, the loans to the ESOP trustee are 
on substantially similar terms as the borrowings from the institutional 
investors and, in addition, are secured by the unallocated shares held by the 
ESOP trustee. The ESOP trustee will repay the loans from KeyCorp using 
corporate contributions made by the Plan for that purpose and dividends on the 
Common Shares acquired with the loans. The amount of dividends on the ESOP 
shares used for debt service by the ESOP trustee totaled $3.9 million in 1993, 
$3.1 million in 1992 and $1.8 million in 1991. As contributions and dividends 
are received, a portion of the shares acquired with the loans will be allocated 
to plan participants. Interest income recognized on loans to the ESOP trustee 
is netted against the interest expense incurred on the Notes payable to the 
institutional investors. KeyCorp's receivable from the ESOP trustees, 
representing deferred compensation to the Corporation's employees, has been

SNB issued $200 million of 7.85% Subordinated Notes on November 3, 1992, and
$200 million of 6.75% Subordinated Notes on June 16, 1993. SNB also issued a
10% Note in connection with the sale of branch offices and loans resulting from
the merger with Ameritrust. None of these Notes may be redeemed prior to
maturity. 

The 8.625% Notes due 1996 were redeemed at par plus accrued interest

11. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

COMMON SHARES AND PREFERRED STOCK
In August 1989, KeyCorp's Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan 
("Rights") under which each shareholder received one Right for each Common Share
of KeyCorp. Each Right represents the right to purchase a Common Share of 
KeyCorp at a price of $65. The Rights become exercisable 20 days after a 
person or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding shares or commences a 
tender offer that could result in such an ownership interest. Until the Rights 
become exercisable, they will trade with the Common Shares, and any transfer of 
the Common Shares will also constitute a transfer of associated Rights. When 
the Rights become exercisable, they will begin to trade separate and apart from 
the Common Shares. Twenty days after the occurrence of certain 
"Flip-In Events," each Right will become the right to purchase a Common Share 
of KeyCorp for the then par value per share (now $1 per share) and the Rights
held by a 15% or more shareholder will become void. KeyCorp may redeem these
Rights at its option at $.005 per Right subject to certain limitations. Unless
redeemed earlier, the Rights expire on September 12, 1999. On October 1, 1993,
KeyCorp amended the Rights so that the Merger would not activate the provisions
of the Rights. 

At December 31, 1993, KeyCorp had 10.0 million shares of $5 par value, 
non-voting preferred stock authorized of which 1,280,000 shares of Series B 
were outstanding represented by 6.4 million Depositary Shares. Each Depositary 
Share represents a one-fifth interest in a share of 10% Cumulative Preferred 
Stock, Series B, $125 liquidation preference per share. Preferred stock is 
reported on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at its stated value of 
$125 per share. In the Merger, each Series B share was converted into one share 
of 10% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Class A. 

On August 2, 1993, KeyCorp redeemed the 479,394 outstanding shares of Series 
A Preferred Stock at its stated value ($24 million) plus accumulated but 
unpaid dividends. 

On March 1, 1993, KeyCorp redeemed the 1.2 million outstanding shares of
Fixed/Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock at 103% of its stated value
($60 million), plus accumulated but unpaid dividends. 

KeyCorp effected a two-for-one stock split on March 22, 1993, by means of a 
100% stock dividend. All relevant Common Share amounts, per Common Share 
amounts and related data in this report have been adjusted to reflect this 
split. 

In connection with the Merger, at a special meeting held February 16, 1994, 
shareholders increased the authorized number of shares of KeyCorp to 926.4 
million, of which 1.4 million are shares of 10% Cumulative Preferred Stock, 
Class A, par value $5 per share; 25.0 million are shares of Preferred Stock, 
par value $1 per share; and 900.0 million are Common Shares, par value $1 per 
share. 

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS 
KeyCorp maintains various incentive compensation plans which provide for its 
ability to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, limited stock 
appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance shares to selected 
employees and directors. Generally, the terms of these plans stipulate that 
the exercise price of options may not be less than the fair market value of 
KeyCorp's Common Shares at the date the options are granted. Options granted 
expire not later than ten years and one month from the date of grant. Several 
option plans have been acquired through mergers. These plans have expired or 
were terminated, but unexercised options granted under the plans remain 
outstanding. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, options for Common Shares 
available for future grant totaled 1,237,965 and 1,233,958, respectively. 

The terms of KeyCorp's plans stipulate that stock appreciation rights may only 
be granted in tandem with stock options. The appreciation rights have the same 
terms as do the options, except that, upon exercise, the holder may receive 
either cash or shares for the excess of the current market value of KeyCorp's 
Common Shares over the options exercise price. Upon exercise of a stock 
appreciation right, the related option is surrendered. During 1993, all stock 
appreciation rights for which exercisability was limited to a period following 
a change in control of the Corporation were cancelled. 

The following table presents a summary of pertinent information with respect 
to KeyCorp's stock options and stock appreciation rights.

In 1991, KeyCorp's Board of Directors approved grants to certain officers of 
KeyCorp and its subsidiaries under the Career Equity Program ("Program"). The 
Program is designed to increase equity ownership by the participants, who make 
an initial investment and elect to have options automatically exercised at 
regular intervals when share value appreciation is present. At exercise, 
replacement option grants are made at the current market value. Shares 
received under the Program are restricted as to resale during the five-year 
period of the Program.

12. MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES

Merger and integration charges of $118.7 million ($80.6 million after tax, $.33
per Common Share), $92.7 million ($66.6 million after tax, $.29 per Common
Share) and $93.8 million ($68.2 million after tax, $.29 per Common Share) were
recorded in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The 1993 charges were incurred
in connection with the March 1, 1994, merger of old KeyCorp into and with
Society, while the 1992 charges related to the mergers with PSB and Ameritrust.
The 1991 charges related to the merger with Ameritrust. The merger and
integration charges included accruals for merger expenses, consisting primarily
of investment banking and other professional fees directly related to the
Merger ($20.5 million); severance payments and other employee costs ($49.6
million); systems and facilities costs ($35.7 million); and other costs
incident to the Merger ($12.9 million). These charges were recorded by the
parent company in the fourth quarter of 1993 at which time management
determined that it was probable that a liability for all such charges had been
incurred and could be reasonably estimated. The merger and integration charges
recorded in connection with the PSB and Ameritrust mergers in 1992, and the
Ameritrust merger in 1991, were similar in nature. The above mergers are
described in greater detail in note 2, Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures,
on page 51 of this report.

13. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

PENSION PLANS
KeyCorp and its subsidiaries sponsor noncontributory pension plans covering
substantially all employees. Benefits paid from these plans are based on age,
years of service and compensation prior to retirement and are determined in
accordance with defined formulas. The Corporation's funding policy is to
contribute amounts to the plans which meet the minimum funding requirements set
forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, plus such
additional amounts as the Corporation determines to be appropriate. 

<TABLE>
The following table sets forth the status of the funded plans and the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets:

In 1993, the Corporation recognized curtailment and settlement gains of $2.9
million resulting from the divestiture of ATC. Such amounts were included in
the net gain from that divestiture. In 1992, the Corporation recognized
curtailment gains of $7.2 million resulting from merger-related staff
reductions. A portion of the retirement obligations associated with these
reductions was settled by lump-sum cash distributions which resulted in
settlement gains of $1.4 million and $3.0 million in 1993 and 1992,
respectively. Both the curtailment and settlement gains related to the
merger-related staff reductions are included in other noninterest income.

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 
The Corporation sponsors postretirement health care and life insurance plans 
that cover substantially all employees. The postretirement health care plans 
are nonfunded and contributory, with retirees' contributions adjusted annually 
to reflect certain cost-sharing provisions and benefit limitations. The 
postretirement life insurance plans are noncontributory. The Corporation has 
adopted a funding policy for one of its life insurance plans and annually 
contributes the service cost of benefits earned plus one-thirtieth of the 
unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. 

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." 
This statement requires that employers recognize the cost of providing 
postretirement benefits over the employees' active service periods to
the date they attain full eligibility for such benefits. Postretirement
benefits costs for 1992 and 1991, which were recorded on a cash basis, have not
been restated. Net postretirement benefits cost was $16.9 million in 1993,
including $8.2 million due to adoption of the new standard, $7.7 million in
1992 and $6.6 million in 1991.

The assumed 1994 health care cost trend rate for Medicare-eligible retirees 
was 11.0% while that for non-Medicare-eligible retirees was 13.0%. Both rates 
are assumed to gradually decrease to 5.5% by the year 2009 and remain constant 
thereafter. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one 
percentage point in each future year would have an immaterial impact on 
postretirement benefits cost due to cost-sharing provisions and benefit 
limitations. The weighted average discount rate used in determining the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligations was 7.4% at December 31, 1993.

13. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE AND SAVINGS PLANS
Substantially all of the Corporation's employees are covered under stock
purchase and savings plans that are qualified under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under provisions of these plans, employees may
contribute 1% to 15% of eligible compensation, with up to 6% being eligible for
matching contributions from the Corporation in the form of KeyCorp Common
Shares. Under an annual discretionary profit sharing component, employees can
receive additional matching employer contributions from the Corporation based
on a formula established each year by KeyCorp's Board of Directors. Total
expense associated with these plans was $40.4 million, $30.4 million and $29.0
million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. 

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
The Corporation adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting 
for Postemployment Benefits," during 1993. This standard requires that 
employers who provide benefits to former or inactive employees after employment 
but before retirement recognize a liability for such benefits if specified 
conditions are met. Adoption of this standard increased noninterest expense by 
$4.0 million. Postemployment benefits for 1992 and 1991, which were recorded on 
a cash basis, were not restated.

15. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND OTHER DISCLOSURES

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In the ordinary course of business, KeyCorp and its subsidiaries are subject to
legal actions which involve claims for substantial monetary relief. Based on
information presently available to management and the Corporation's counsel,
management does not believe that any legal actions, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on KeyCorp's consolidated
financial condition. 

RESTRICTIONS ON CASH, DUE FROM BANKS, 
SUBSIDIARY DIVIDENDS AND LENDING ACTIVITIES 
Under the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act, depository institutions are 
required to maintain certain average balances in the form of cash or 
noninterest-bearing balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. Average reserve 
balances aggregating $1.1 billion in 1993 were maintained in fulfillment of 
these requirements. 

The principal source of income for the parent company is dividends from its 
affiliate banks. Such dividends are subject to certain restrictions as set 
forth in the national and state banking laws and regulations. At December 31, 
1993, undistributed earnings of $535.4 million were free of such restrictions 
and available for the payment of dividends to the parent company. Loans and 
advances from banking affiliates to the parent company are also limited by law 
and are required to be collateralized.

16. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
The following disclosures are made in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments," which
requires the disclosure of fair value information about both on- and
off-balance sheet financial instruments where it is practicable to estimate
that value. Fair value is defined in SFAS No. 107 as the amount at which an
instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced or liquidation sale. It is not the Corporation's intent
to enter into such exchanges. 

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 107, the estimated fair values of 
deposits, credit card loans and residential real estate mortgage loans do not 
take into account the fair values of long-term relationships, which are 
integral parts of the related financial instruments. The disclosed estimated 
fair values of such instruments would increase significantly if the fair values 
of the long-term relationships were considered. 

In cases where quoted market prices were not available, fair values were 
estimated using present value or other valuation methods, as described below. 
The use of different assumptions (e.g., discount rates and cash flow estimates) 
and estimation methods could have a significant effect on fair value amounts. 
Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of 
the amounts the Corporation could realize in a current market exchange. 
Because SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments and all 
nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements, any aggregation of 
the fair value amounts presented would not represent the underlying value of 
the Corporation.

</TABLE>

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair values
of financial instruments presented in the preceding table and in the following
paragraphs. For financial instruments with a remaining average life to maturity
of less than six months, carrying amounts were used as an approximation of fair
value. The carrying amounts reported for cash and due from banks, and
short-term investments are their fair values. The carrying value of mortgage
loans held for sale approximates fair value. Securities available for sale and
investment securities were valued based on quoted market prices. Where quoted
market prices were unavailable, fair values were based on quoted market prices
of similar instruments. A discounted cash flow model was used to estimate the
fair values for certain loans. Certain residential real estate loans and
student loans held for sale were valued based on quoted market prices of
similar loans offered or sold in recent securitization transactions. Lease
financing receivables, although excluded from the scope of SFAS No. 107, were
included in the estimated fair value for loans at their carrying amount. In
circumstances in which the fair value of loans was not estimated, the carrying
amount was used as a reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair values of
certificates of deposit and of long-term debt were estimated based on
discounted cash flows. Carrying amounts reported for other deposits and
short-term borrowings were used as a reasonable approximation of their fair
values. Interest rate swaps were valued based on discounted cash flow models
and had a fair value of $57.2 million and $75.8 million at December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively. 

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK 
The Corporation, mainly through its affiliate banks, is party to various 
financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The banks use these financial
instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of
their customers and to manage effectively their exposure to interest rate risk.
The financial instruments used include commitments to extend credit, standby
letters of credit, interest rate
68

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

swap agreements, forward contracts, futures and options on financial futures,
and interest rate cap and floor agreements. 

These instruments involve, to varying degrees, credit and interest rate risks 
in excess of amounts recognized in the Corporation's consolidated balance 
sheet. Credit risk is the possibility that a counterparty to a financial 
instrument will be unable to perform its contractual obligations. Market risk 
is the possibility that, due to changes in economic conditions, the 
Corporation's net interest income will be adversely affected. 

The Corporation mitigates its exposure to credit risk through internal controls 
over the extension of credit. These controls include the process of credit 
approval and review, the establishment of credit limits, and, when deemed 
necessary, securing collateral. The Corporation manages its exposure to market 
risk, in part, by using off-balance sheet instruments to offset existing 
interest rate risk of its assets and liabilities, and by setting variable rates 
of interest on contingent extensions of credit. 

The following is a summary of the contractual or notional amount of each
significant class of off-balance sheet financial instruments outstanding. The
Corporation's maximum possible accounting loss from commitments to extend
credit and from standby letters of credit equals the contractual amount of
these instruments. The notional amount represents the total dollar volume of
transactions and is significantly greater than the amount at risk.

KeyCorp's commitments to extend credit are agreements with customers to provide
financing at predetermined terms as long as the customer continues to meet
specified criteria. Loan commitments serve to meet the financing needs of the
banks' customers, have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and
may require the payment of fees. Since many of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent actual future cash requirements of the Corporation.
KeyCorp evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Corporation
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved
in extending loan facilities to customers.

16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

KeyCorp's mortgage banking affiliates originate and service residential
mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market. In years prior to 1992,
residential mortgages were sold with provisions for recourse by companies
acquired by KeyCorp. At December 31, 1993, the amount of such loans sold with
recourse was $156.1 million. KeyCorp has not and does not sell residential
mortgages with provisions for recourse. 

KeyCorp's mortgage banking affiliates enter into forward sale agreements and 
option contracts to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates on 
mortgage loans held for sale. Forward sale agreements commit the affiliates to 
deliver mortgage loans in future periods; option contracts allow the affiliates 
to sell or purchase mortgage loans at a specified price, in future periods. 

The banks enter into interest rate swap agreements primarily to manage interest 
rate risk and to accommodate the business needs of customers. Under a typical 
swap agreement, one party pays a fixed rate of interest based on a notional 
amount to a second party, which pays to the first party a variable rate of 
interest based on the same notional amount. The swaps have an average maturity 
of 1.8 years, with selected swaps having fixed maturity dates through 2003. The 
following is a summary of the notional amounts of outstanding interest rate 
swap agreements:

The banks enter into interest rate cap and floor agreements in the management
of their interest rate risk and to accommodate the business needs of customers.
These financial instruments transfer interest rate risk at predetermined
levels. The banks receive a fee as compensation for writing interest rate caps
and floors. The interest rate risk from writing interest rate caps and floors
is minimized by the banks through offsetting transactions. 

Financial futures contracts and options on financial futures provide for the
delayed delivery or purchase of securities, interest rate instruments or foreign
currency. The banks enter into forward contracts and options to hedge their
interest rate risk and in connection with customer transactions, as well as to
minimize the interest rate risk exposure of mortgage banking activities.

BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
- --------
On March 1, 1994, KeyCorp ("old KeyCorp"), a financial services
holding company headquartered in Albany, New York, with approximately $33
billion in assets at year end 1993, merged with and into Society Corporation
("Society"), a financial services holding company headquartered in Cleveland,
Ohio, with approximately $27 billion in assets at year end 1993, pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, and a related Supplemental Agreement to Agreement
and Plan of Merger, each dated as of October 1, 1993, and each as amended, with
Society as the surviving corporation under the name KeyCorp (also referred to
herein as the "Corporation").

The merger of old KeyCorp with and into Society created a financial
services holding company which traces its roots back to 1825, when the first
predecessor of a subsidiary of old KeyCorp was organized. The first
predecessor of a subsidiary of Society was organized in 1849, and the Ohio
corporation that now holds the name KeyCorp was first organized in 1958. The
merger of old KeyCorp and Society created the "new" KeyCorp, a financial
services company providing banking and other financial services across the
country's northern tier and in Florida through a network of subsidiaries
operating 1267 full-service banking offices in 13 states, making it the
nation's 5th largest branch network (based on management's calculation derived
from data provided as of December 31, 1993, by the SNL Quarterly Bank Digest). 
At December 31, 1993, KeyCorp was the 11th largest bank holding company in the
United States based on its consolidated asset size of almost $60 billion
(based on management's calculation derived from data provided as of December
31, 1993 by the SNL Quarterly Bank Digest). In addition to the services
provided through its banking offices, KeyCorp provides mortgage banking,
investment management and trust, and other financial services through
subsidiaries which serve its banking markets and an additional nine states in
which KeyCorp does not have bank branches. At year end 1993, through it
subsidiaries, KeyCorp maintained a $27 billion mortgage servicing portfolio,
managed approximately $34 billion in assets (excluding corporate trust assets)
in its investment management and trust operations, and operated the nation's
13th largest mutual fund business (based on management's calculation derived
from data provided as of December 31, 1993, by Strategic Insight Inc.). See
Exhibit 99b hereto for a more complete description of the Corporation, in the
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations," and the "Consolidated Financial Statements" and "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" contained therein.

banking offices that are not so shared.

In addition to the customary banking services of accepting funds for
deposit and making loans, the Corporation's subsidiary banks provide a wide
range of specialized services tailored to specific markets, including mortgage
banking, investment management and investment advisory services, personal and 
corporate trust services, personal financial services including the sale of 
money market and other mutual funds, cash management services, investment 
banking services, and international banking services.

The Corporation's nonbanking subsidiaries provide personal and 
corporate trust services, investment management and investment advisory
services, reinsurance of credit life and accident and health insurance on 
loans made by

-3-
<PAGE> 4
subsidiary banks, venture capital and small business investment financing
services, equipment lease financing, community development financing, stock
transfer agent services and other financial services.

COMPETITION
- -----------
The market for banking and other financial services is highly
competitive. The Corporation and its subsidiaries compete with other providers
of financial services such as other bank holding companies, commercial banks,
savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, money market and
other mutual funds, insurance companies, and a growing list of other local,
regional and national entities which offer financial services. These other
entities include a number of commercial and industrial companies which are not
traditionally thought of as providers of financial services, many of which
operate in a less extensively regulated, and often less costly, environment by
virtue of their nonbanking status.

In recent years, mergers between financial institutions in a number of
the Corporation's principal market areas have added competitive pressure. In
addition, competition is expected to intensify in many of the Corporation's
banking markets as a consequence of state laws now in effect in a substantial
number of states, permitting some form of either regional or
nationwide interstate banking. Also, Congress is currently considering
legislation that would generally authorize nationwide interstate banking for
both national and state chartered banks, subject to certain limitations,
including the ability of states to opt out of certain aspects of coverage. The
management of KeyCorp is unable to predict whether any such legislation will
ultimately be enacted, and, if it is enacted, what the final provisions will
be.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
- --------------------------
GENERAL
-------
As a bank holding company, the Corporation is subject to the
regulation and supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (the "Federal Reserve Board") under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). Under the BHCA, bank holding companies may not,
in general, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more
than 5% of the voting shares or

-4-
<PAGE> 5
substantially all of the assets of any company, including a bank, without the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, bank holding
companies are generally prohibited under the BHCA from engaging in nonbanking
(i.e., commercial or industrial) activities, subject to certain exceptions. As
a result of the 1993 acquisition of the institution that is now known as
Society First Federal Saving Bank ("Society First Federal), the Corporation is
also subject to the regulation and supervision of the Office of Thrift
Supervision (the "OTS") as a savings and loan holding company registered under
the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended (the "HOLA").

The banking and savings association subsidiaries (collectively, the
"banking subsidiaries") of the Corporation are subject to extensive
supervision, examination, and regulation by applicable Federal and state
banking agencies. Society National Bank (Ohio), Society National Bank,
Indiana, and Key Bank USA N.A. are national banking associations with full
banking powers, subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"). Two other national banking
subsidiaries of the Corporation operate under charters that limit their banking
powers to trust-related activities. These entities are also subject to the
regulation, supervision and examination of the OCC, although they are not
regulated as banks for purposes of the BHCA. All of the other banking
subsidiaries of the Corporation, other than Society First Federal, are
state-chartered banks that are subject to supervision, examination, and
regulation by the applicable state banking authority in the state in which each
such institution is chartered. In addition, the company's state-chartered
banks are not members of the Federal Reserve System (and are therefore
so-called "nonmember banks"), and, accordingly, are subject to the regulation,
supervision and examination of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
"FDIC"). Also, because each of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries is
insured by the FDIC, the FDIC also has regulatory and supervisory authority
over the banking subsidiaries in that capacity. The OTS is charged with
regulation of Federal savings associations such as Society First Federal, the
Corporation's only such institution. Depository institutions such as the
banking subsidiaries are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal
Reserve Board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit
availability in order to influence the economy. The regulatory framework
applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries generally is not
intended for the protection of investors and is directed toward protecting the
interests of depositors, the FDIC deposit insurance funds, and the U.S. banking
system as a whole.

A number of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries are
engaged (through subsidiaries) in activities that are subject to supervision
and regulation by other Federal and state authorities. For example, the
Corporation's discount brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are
subject to supervision and regulation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and state
securities regulators.

The Corporation also has nonbanking subsidiaries that are subject to
supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, as well
as other applicable regulatory agencies. For example, the Corporation's
insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory
authorities of the various states, and the Corporation's state chartered trust
company subsidiaries (which are nonbanking companies for purposes of the BHCA),
are subject to regulation by state banking authorities. Other nonbanking
subsidiaries are subject to other laws and regulations of both the Federal
government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business.

The following references to certain statutes and regulations are brief
summaries thereof. The references are not intended to be complete and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations
themselves. In addition there are numerous other statutes and regulations not
summarized below that apply to and regulate the operation of the Corporation
and its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. A change in applicable law or 
regulation may have a material effect on the business of the Corporation.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS
---------------------

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. The principal source of cash flow of the
Corporation, including cash flow to pay dividends on the Corporation's common
and preferred shares and debt service on the Corporation's debt, is dividends
from its banking subsidiaries. Various Federal and state statutory and
regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the
Corporation by its banking subsidiaries without regulatory approval.

The approval of the OCC is required for the payment of any dividend by
a national bank if the total of all dividends declared by the board of
directors of such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of (i) the
bank's net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the current
year plus (ii) the retained net profits (as defined and interpreted by
regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus
or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a national
bank also can pay dividends only to the extent that retained net profits
(including the portion transferred to surplus) exceed bad debts (as defined and
interpreted by regulation). Three of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries,
Society National Bank (Ohio), Society National Bank, Indiana, and Key Bank USA
N.A., and 

-6-
<PAGE> 7
its trust company subsidiaries which are national banks, are subject to
these restrictions.

The Corporation's state nonmember banks are also subject to various
restrictions on the payment of dividends under state laws. A number of the
Corporation's banks, representing approximately 50% of its banking assets
(other than assets under management for customers), are state nonmember banks,
which are restricted as to the payment of dividends by the laws and regulations
of their respective state chartering authority.

In addition, OTS regulations impose limitations upon all capital
distributions by savings associations. These limitations are applicable to
Society First Federal.

In addition, if, in the opinion of the applicable Federal banking
agency, a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is
about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, which, depending on the
financial condition of the institution, could include the payment of dividends,
the agency may require, after notice and hearing, that such institution cease
and desist from such practice. Also, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, the
FDIC and the OTS have issued policy statements which provide that insured
depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay
dividends only out of current operating earnings.

Under all of the laws, regulations, and other restrictions applicable
to the Corporation's banking subsidiaries, management estimates that, as of
December 31, 1993, the Corporation's banking subsidiaries could have declared
dividends of approximately $535 million in the aggregate, without obtaining
prior regulatory approval.

HOLDING CORPORATION STRUCTURE
-----------------------------
TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. Transactions involving
the Corporation's banking subsidiaries are subject to Federal Reserve Act
restrictions which limit the transfer of funds from such subsidiaries to the
Corporation and (with certain exceptions) to the Corporation's nonbanking
subsidiaries (together, "affiliates") in so called "covered transactions," such
as loans and other extensions of credit, investments, or asset purchases.
Unless an exemption applies, each such transaction by a banking subsidiary with
one of its non-banking affiliates is limited in amount to 10% of that banking
subsidiary's capital and surplus and, with respect to all such transfers to
affiliates, in the aggregate, to 20% of that banking

-7-
<PAGE> 8
subsidiary's capital and surplus. Furthermore, loans and extensions of credit
are required to be secured in specified amounts. "Covered transactions" also
include the acceptance of securities issued by the banking subsidiary as
collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of
credit for the benefit of the Corporation or any of its affiliates. In
addition, a bank holding company and its banking subsidiaries are prohibited
from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension
of credit, lease or sale of property, or furnishing of services.

SOURCE OF STRENGTH/COMMONLY CONTROLLED BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. Under
Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to serve as a
source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks
and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such
subsidiary bank. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at
times when the Corporation may not have the resources to provide it or, for
other reasons, would not otherwise be inclined to provide it. Certain loans by
the Corporation to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of
payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, a subsidiary bank.
In addition, the Crime Control Act of 1990 provides that in the event of a bank
holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a
Federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank
will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of
payment.

Under Federal law, a depository institution, the deposits of which are
insured by the FDIC, can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably
expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a
commonly controlled FDIC insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance
provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC insured depository
institution in danger of default (the so called "cross guaranty" provision).
"Default" is defined under the FDIC's regulations generally as the appointment
of a conservator or receiver and "in danger of default" is defined generally as
the existence of certain conditions indicating that a "default" is likely to
occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------
The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the OCC have issued
substantially similar minimum risk-based and leverage capital guidelines for
United States banking organizations. The minimum ratio of total capital to
risk

-8-
<PAGE> 9
- -adjusted assets (including certain off balance sheet items, such as standby
letters of credit) required by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding
companies is currently 8%. At least one half of the total capital must be 
comprised of common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative, 
perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative, 
perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests in the equity accounts of 
consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
("Tier I capital"). The remainder may consist of hybrid capital instruments, 
perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, a limited amount of 
subordinated debt, other preferred stock, and a limited amount of loan and 
lease loss reserves ("Tier II capital"). As of December 31, 1993, the 
Corporation's Tier I and total capital to risk-adjusted assets ratios were 
8.73% and 12.22%, respectively.

In addition, the Corporation is subject to minimum leverage ratio
(Tier I capital to total consolidated quarterly average assets) guidelines.
These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for bank holding
companies that meet certain specified criteria, such as having the highest
supervisory rating. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain
leverage ratios which are at least 100 to 200 basis points higher (I.E., a
leverage ratio of at least 4% to 5%). Neither the Corporation, nor any of its
banking subsidiaries has been advised by its appropriate Federal regulatory
agency of any specific leverage ratio applicable to it. As of December 31,
1993, the Corporation's Tier I leverage ratio was 6.72%. Federal Reserve Board
Policy provides that banking organizations generally, and, in particular, those
that are experiencing internal growth or actively making acquisitions will be
expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum
supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.
Furthermore, the guidelines indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will
continue to consider a "tangible Tier I leverage ratio" in evaluating proposals
for expansion or new activities. The tangible Tier I leverage ratio is the
ratio of a banking organization's Tier I capital less all intangible assets, to 
total consolidated quarterly average assets less all intangible assets. For 
purposes of this calculation, purchase mortgage servicing rights are not 
considered to be intangibles. As of December 31, 1993, the Corporation's 
tangible Tier I leverage ratio was 6.66%.

Each of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries is also subject to
capital requirements adopted by applicable Federal regulatory agencies which
are substantially similar to those imposed by the Federal Reserve Board on bank

-9-
<PAGE> 10
holding companies. These requirements also include minimum Tier I, total
capital and leverage ratios. As of December 31, 1993, each of the
Corporation's banking subsidiaries had capital in excess of all minimum
regulatory requirements.

All of the Federal banking agencies have proposed regulations that
would add an additional capital requirement based upon the amount of an
institution's exposure to interest rate risk. The OTS recently adopted its
final rule adding an interest rate component to its risk based capital rule.
Under the final OTS rule, a savings association with a greater than "normal"
level of interest rate risk exposure will be subject to a deduction from total
capital for purposes of calculating its risk based capital ratio. The new OTS
rule was effective January 1, 1994, except for limited provisions which are
effective July 1, 1994. The other Federal banking agencies have yet to adopt
their final rules on the interest rate risk component of risk based capital.

The OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC have proposed 
amendments to their respective regulatory capital rules to include in Tier I 
capital for purposes of calculating the risk based and leverage ratios, the 
net unrealized changes in the value of securities available for sale. The 
proposed amendments are in response to the provisions outlined in Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which takes effect for fiscal 
years beginning after December 15, 1993. This new accounting standard 
requires, among other things, that net unrealized holding gains and losses on 
securities available for sale be recorded as a new component of shareholders'
equity with no impact on net income. If adopted as proposed, the rule could
cause the amount of an institution's Tier I capital to fluctuate, thereby
causing the institution's Tier I, total capital and leverage ratios to be
subject to greater volatility. Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 115. As a result of this accounting change,
approximately $4.5 billion of securities were classified as available for sale
at March 31, 1994, and shareholders' equity was reduced by $23 million,
representing the net unrealized after-tax loss on these securities.

SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991,
enacted December 19, 1991, amended several Federal banking statutes, including
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDIA"), and among other things,
increased the FDIC's borrowing authority to resolve bank failures, mandated
least cost resolutions and prompt regulatory action with regard to
undercapitalized

-10-
<PAGE> 11
institutions, expanded consumer protection, and mandated increased supervision
of domestic depository institutions and the U.S. operations of foreign
depository institutions. The 1991 amendments to the FDIA required the Federal
banking agencies to promulgate regulations and specify standards in numerous
areas of bank operations, including interest rate exposure, asset growth,
internal controls, credit underwriting, executive officer and director
compensation, real estate construction financing, additional review of capital
standards, interbank liabilities, and other operational and managerial
standards as the agencies determine appropriate. Most of these regulations
have been promulgated in final form by the appropriate Federal bank regulatory
agencies, although several have only been proposed. In general, management
believes that these regulations have increased, and may continue to increase,
the cost of and the regulatory burden associated with the banking business.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION. Effective in December 1992, the OCC, the
Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OTS adopted new regulations to
implement the so-called "prompt corrective action" provisions of the FDIA. The
regulations group FDIC insured depository institutions into five broad
categories based on their capital ratios. The five categories are "well
capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly
undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized," as follows:

An institution is "well capitalized" if it has a total risk based
capital ratio (total capital to risk-adjusted assets) of 10% or greater, a Tier
I risk based capital ratio (Tier I capital to risk-adjusted assets) of 6% or
greater, and a Tier I leverage capital ratio (Tier I capital to average total
assets) of 5% or greater, and it is not subject to a regulatory order,
agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any
capital measure;

An institution is "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk
based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier I risk based capital ratio of 4%
or greater and (generally) a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater,
and the institution does not meet the definition of a "well capitalized"
institution;

An institution is "undercapitalized" if the relevant capital ratios
are less than those specified in the definition of an "adequately capitalized"
institution;

-11-
<PAGE> 12
An institution is "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total
risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier I risk based capital ratio of
less than 3%, or a Tier I leverage capital ratio of less than 3%;

An institution is "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of
tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets of 2% or less.

Each of the Corporation's subsidiary banks qualifies as
well capitalized as of December 31, 1993.

An institution may be downgraded to, or be deemed to be in a capital
category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it
is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an
unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters.

The capital based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA and
their implementing regulations apply to FDIC-insured depository institutions
such as all of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries, but they are not
applicable to holding companies, such as the Corporation which control such
institutions. However, both the Federal Reserve Board and the OTS have
indicated that, in regulating holding companies, they will take appropriate
action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the
effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary depository
institutions pursuant to such provisions and regulations. Although the capital
categories defined under the prompt corrective action regulations are not
directly applicable to the Corporation under existing laws and regulations,
based upon its ratios the Corporation would qualify, and its subsidiary banks
do qualify, as well capitalized as of December 31, 1993. However, an
institution's capital category, as determined by applying the prompt corrective
action provisions of the law, may not constitute an accurate representation of
the overall financial condition or prospects of the Corporation or its banking
subsidiaries, and should be considered in conjunction with other available
information regarding the Corporation's financial condition and results of
operations.

The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any
capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management
fee to its holding company if the institution would thereafter be
undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are also subject to
restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System, increased monitoring
by the appropriate Federal banking agency and limitations on

-12-
<PAGE> 13
growth, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan to their primary
Federal regulatory agency. The Federal banking agencies may not accept a
capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on
realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the institution's
capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the
depository institution's parent holding company must guarantee that the
institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate
liability of the parent holding company with respect to such a guarantee is
limited to the lesser of: (a) an amount equal to 5% of the depository
institution's total assets at the time that it became undercapitalized or (b)
the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the
institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable to it as of
the time it failed to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails
to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it were significantly
undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may
be subject to a number of additional requirements and restrictions, including
orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized and
requirements to reduce total assets, and are prohibited from receiving deposits
from correspondent banks. "Critically undercapitalized" institutions are
subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

FDIC INSURANCE. Under the risk related insurance assessment
system adopted in final form effective beginning with the January 1, 1994,
assessment period, a bank or savings association is required to pay an annual
assessment ranging from $.23 to $.31 per $100 of deposits based on the
institution's risk classification. The risk classification is based on an
annual assignment of the institution by the FDIC to one of three capital 
groups and to one of three supervisory subgroups. The capital groups are 
"well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," and "undercapitalized." The 
three supervisory subgroups are Group "A" (for financially solid institutions 
with only a few minor weaknesses), Group "B" (for those institutions with 
weaknesses which, if uncorrected, could cause substantial deterioration of the 
institution and increase the risk to the deposit insurance fund), and Group "C" 
(for those institutions with a substantial probability of loss to the fund 
absent effective corrective action). For the period commencing on January 1, 
1994 through June 30, 1994, insurance assessments on deposits of all of the
Corporation's banking subsidiaries owned as of December 31, 1993, were paid at
the rate of $.23 per $100 of deposits.

-13-
<PAGE> 14
DEPOSITOR PREFERENCE STATUTE
----------------------------
In August 1993, Federal legislation was enacted providing that insured
and uninsured deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and
employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be
afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an
institution, including Federal funds and letters of credit, in the "liquidation
or other resolution" of such an institution by any receiver. Under this new
legislation, if an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured
depositors along with the FDIC will be placed ahead of all unsecured,
nondeposit creditors in order of priority of payment. Due to its recent
enactment, it is too early to determine what impact this legislation will have
on the ability of financial institutions to attract junior creditors in the
future or otherwise.

IMPLICATIONS OF BEING A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING CORPORATION
------------------------------------------------------------
By reason of its ownership of Society First Federal, the Corporation 
is a savings and loan holding company within the meaning of HOLA. With 
certain exceptions, a savings and loan holding company must obtain prior 
written approval from the OTS (as well as the Federal Reserve Board, or other 
Federal agencies whose approval may be required, depending upon the structure 
of the acquisition transaction) before acquiring control of a savings 
association or savings and loan holding company through the acquisition
of stock or through a merger or some other business combination. HOLA
prohibits the OTS from approving an acquisition by a savings and loan holding
company which would result in the holding company controlling savings
associations in more than one state unless (a) the holding company is
authorized to do so by the FDIC as an emergency acquisition, (b) the holding
company controls a savings association which operated an office in the
additional state or states on March 5, 1987, or (c) the statutes of the state
in which the savings association to be acquired is located specifically permit
a savings association chartered by such state to be acquired by an out-of-
state savings association or savings and loan holding company.

A Federal savings association, however, including one controlled by a
savings and loan holding company, is permitted, subject to certain restrictions,
to branch on a nationwide basis. Thus, a Federal savings association may
generally also acquire the assets and liabilities or the stock of other
Federal savings associations and operate them as branches, whether or not they
are located in a

-14-
<PAGE> 15
state that would otherwise have permitted the acquiring institution's holding
company to operate a savings association in that state.

CONTROL ACQUISITIONS
--------------------
The Change in Bank Control Act (the "CBCA") prohibits a "person" (as
defined in the CBCA, and the regulations thereunder) or group of persons from
acquiring "control" (as defined in the CBCA, and the regulations thereunder) of
a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days'
prior written notice of the proposed acquisition and within that time period
the Federal Reserve Board has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed
acquisition or extending for up to another 30 days the period during which such
a disapproval may be issued. An acquisition may be made prior to the
expiration of the disapproval period if the Federal Reserve Board issues
written notice of its intention not to disapprove the action. Under a
rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve Board, the
acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company
with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act,
such as the Corporation, would, under the circumstances set forth in the
presumption, constitute the acquisition of control.

In addition, any "company" is required to obtain the approval of the
Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an
acquiror that is a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding Common 
Shares of the Corporation, or otherwise obtaining control over the Corporation.

PROPERTIES

The headquarters of the Corporation and of Society National Bank are
located in Society Center at 127 Public Square, Cleveland, Ohio 44114-1306.
The Corporation currently leases approximately 625,000 square feet of the
complex, encompassing the first twenty one floors and the 55th and 56th floors
of the 57 story Society Tower and all ten floors of the adjacent Society for
Savings Building. The Corporation owns a four story office building and the
Summit Center Building, a 16 story office building, both located in downtown
Toledo. In addition, the Corporation has an office center located in a one
story building containing approximately 500,000 square feet on a 55 acre site
in Brooklyn, Ohio which is owned in fee by a subsidiary. At December 31, 1993,
KeyCorp's banking subsidiaries operated 1,267 full-service banking offices of
which 762 were owned and 505 were leased. Certain leases

-15-
<PAGE> 16
expiring at various dates through the year 2017 qualify as capital leases and
contain purchase options for the premises leased thereunder. At December 31,
1993, banking subsidiaries of KeyCorp were obligated under noncancellable
operating leases for land and buildings and for other property consisting
principally of data processing equipment. Many of the realty lease agreements
contain renewal options for varying periods. In many cases, renewal terms,
including annual rentals to be paid, must be negotiated at the renewal date.
The leases generally require payment of maintenance costs and real estate taxes
in excess of specified minimums. There are no significant encumbrances on
properties owned.
