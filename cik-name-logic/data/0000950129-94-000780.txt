ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

In June 1994, Service Corporation International ("SCI") announced an
unsolicited offer to acquire 100% of the outstanding common shares of the Great
Southern Group plc, ("GSG"). As of September 30, 1994, SCI owned or had
commitments to acquire in excess of 98% of GSG's voting shares. SCI 
anticipates that the total acquisition cost will approximate $192,777,000,
including the assumption of approximately $14,751,000 of existing indebtedness
which SCI intends to repay. GSG is a funeral provider in the United Kingdom
("UK") and owns 157 funeral homes, 13 crematories and two cemeteries.

In September 1994, SCI announced its offer to acquire 100% of the
outstanding common shares of Plantsbrook Group plc ("PG") for approximately
$312,690,000, including the assumption of approximately $13,873,000 of existing
debt. PG is a funeral provider in the UK and owns 380 funeral homes. As of
September 30, 1994, SCI owned or had commitments to acquire in excess of 95% of
PG's voting shares.

In addition to the acquisitions of GSG and PG, during the six months
ended June 30, 1994, SCI continued to acquire funeral and cemetery operations
in the United States, Australia and Canada. Excluding GSG and PG during such
period, SCI acquired 64 funeral homes and 13 cemeteries (the "Other Acquired
Companies") in 38 separate transactions for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $175,000,000 in the form of combinations of cash, SCI common
stock, issued and assumed debt, convertible debentures and retired loans
receivable held by SCI's finance subsidiary. None of SCI's acquisitions,
including GSG and PG, individually meet the definition of a significant
subsidiary as defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (the
"Commission") Regulation S-X.

Pursuant to the Commission's Regulation S-X Rule 3-05, SCI is hereby
reporting the individual financial statements in pound sterling of GSG and PG
for the year ended December 31, 1993 and six months ended June 30, 1994 
and 1993, respectively. GSG and PG represent a substantial majority of SCI's 
1994 acquisitions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS
OF GREAT SOUTHERN GROUP PLC

We have audited the financial statements appearing on pages 4 to 27 of
Great Southern Group PLC and its subsidiaries which are expressed in pounds
sterling. These consolidated financial statements and schedules are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and related schedules based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United Kingdom and United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material mis-statement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Great Southern Group and 
its subsidiaries at 31 December 1993 and the results of its operations and its 
cash flows for the year ended 31 December 1993, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom, on the bases described in
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom vary in
certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. The application of the latter would have affected the
determination of consolidated net income expressed in pounds sterling for the
year ended 31 December 1993 and the determination of consolidated shareholders'
equity also expressed in pounds sterling at 31 December 1993 to the extent
summarised in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.

GREAT SOUTHERN GROUP PLC

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER 1993

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of accounting

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
historical cost convention (as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed
assets) and applicable accounting standards. As permitted by section 210 of the
Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the parent company has not
been separately presented in the financial statements.

Consolidation

The group financial statements deal with the state of affairs and earnings
of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings. The only subsidiary
undertakings of the group are subsidiary companies. Where acquisitions are
accounted for on the acquisition basis of accounting, the results are included
from the date of purchase and the difference between the price paid and the fair
value of net assets acquired, after providing for any costs arising as a
consequence of integration, is taken to reserves.

Turnover

The turnover of the Group represents income receivable from the provision
of: cremations and interments; funeral services, monumental masonry and
contracting; and membership fees and other income from the sale of pre-arranged
funeral plans. Turnover is shown exclusive of inter-company trading,
disbursements and value added tax.

Value Added Tax

The provision of funeral services, cremation and burial are exempt supplies
for Value Added Tax and as a consequence related Value Added Tax on expenses and
direct costs may not be recovered and is included in costs and expenses.

Deferred Taxation

Where there is a reasonable probability that a liability may arise in the
future, provision is made for taxation deferred by relief available on fixed
assets in excess of the depreciation charged in the financial statements. This
provision is made at the rate of corporation tax due to be applicable at the
date that the deferred taxation is estimated to become payable. Advance
corporation tax on current dividends which will be offset against future
corporation tax liabilities is deducted from the deferred taxation account.
Where material, provision is also made for short term timing differences.

Tangible fixed assets

(i) All freehold properties including group cemeteries and crematoria and
funeral directing establishments are maintained, as a matter of group policy, by
a programme of repair and refurbishment such that the residual values of these
properties are at least equal to their book values. Having regard to this, it is
the opinion of the Directors that depreciation of any such property as required
by the Companies Act 1985 and standard accounting practice would not be
material.

(ii) Depreciation is calculated to write off all other tangible fixed
assets by equal instalments over their expected useful lives at the following
annual rates:

Computer equipment............................ 25.0 per cent
Vehicles...................................... 12.5 per cent
Others........................................ 10.0 per cent

GREAT SOUTHERN GROUP PLC

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER 1993

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)

Short leasehold property is amortised over the life of the lease.

Stocks

Stocks comprise finished goods being assembled coffins, fittings and
memorials and are valued at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
There is no material difference between replacement value and cost.

Pension Arrangements

The Group operates a Retirement and Death Benefit scheme and an Executive
Pension scheme. It also makes provision for pensions for employees outside those
schemes through the Great Southern Welfare Trust. In each case the assets of the
pension schemes are separate from the assets of the Group. The Executive Pension
Scheme and the Great Southern Welfare Trust are treated as defined contribution
schemes. As such the pension cost charge is the amount of contributions paid in
the year. The Retirement and Death Benefit scheme is a defined benefit pension
scheme. In principle the group contributes to this scheme an amount equal to the
regular cost of pensions as calculated by a qualified actuary based on a
constant percentage of current and expected pensionable payroll. The regular
pension costs so calculated are charged to profit and loss accounts. Triennial
valuations of the Retirement and Death Benefit scheme are performed by the
actuary using the aggregate method. These actuarial valuations may reveal an
experience surplus or deficit.

Any surplus or deficit is amortised through the profit and loss account
evenly over the average remaining service life of current employees.

Leased Assets

Rentals are charged to profit on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are included in the balance sheets and
depreciated in accordance with the Group's normal accounting policies. The
present value of future rentals is shown as a liability. The interest element of
rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of
the lease in proportion to the balance of capital repayments outstanding.

Financial Reporting Standard Number 3

The 1992 profit and loss account has been restated by minor amounts in
accordance with FRS3 which affects the group accounts for the first time.
Interest receivable and investment income is now excluded from operating profit.
Profit on disposal of fixed assets now excludes realised revaluation reserve.

The most recent formal actuarial review of the Retirement and Death Benefit
Scheme was at 6 April 1991 and the results of this show that the market value of
assets was British Pound 6.1 million. At the valuation date the actuarial value
of the assets was sufficient to cover 132% of the accrued liabilities, allowing
for future salary increases. The main actuarial assumptions were:

<TABLE>

Investment returns....................................... 10% p.a.
Salary increases......................................... 7.5% p.a.
Pension increase......................................... 5% p.a.

The Trustees have recommended enhanced benefits which will reduce the
experience surplus. The remainder of the surplus will be addressed by reductions
in the annual contribution calculated by the actuary to spread the reduction in
contributions over the average remaining service lives of members of the scheme.

The preference shares are convertible into ordinary shares between 1st June
1994 and 2009. The basis of conversion is the rate of 37.736 ordinary shares of
10p each for every British Pound 5 in nominal value of preference shares so
converted. Full conversion of the preference shares will increase the current
issued ordinary share capital of the company by 2,572,719 ordinary shares.

On 13th June 1993 the holders of 86,479 cumulative convertible redeemable
preference shares exercised their right to convert such shares to ordinary
shares. 32,633 ordinary shares were issued as a consequence together with
106,050 deferred shares. The deferred shares arise from the consolidation and
subdivision of fractions arising on conversion and carry no voting rights and
may be redeemed by the company for a total value of 1p following conversion of
all preference shares.

On 13th June 1988 a special resolution was passed reducing the share
premium account by British Pound 9,101,000. This was confirmed by the court on

and a separate profit and loss account for the Company is not therefore
presented. The Company's profit after taxation for the financial year was
British Pound 3,904,000.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER 1993

27. ADJUSTMENTS AND DISCLOSURES TO REFLECT UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (U.S. GAAP) -- (CONTINUED)

The following adjustments have been made to the consolidated profit and
loss account for the year then ended and the consolidated balance sheet of Great
Southern Group plc as at 31 December 1993 to determine the figures as would be
reported under US GAAP.

1. Freehold Buildings have been written down to reflect a depreciation charge
that assumes that the asset will be written down to a residual value of 20%
of cost over a fifty year period. It has been assumed that 66% of the
carrying value of "Land and Buildings" as stated in the consolidated
Financial Statements is attributable to the buildings.

2. Goodwill has been capitalised and is being amortised over a period of 40
years.

3. Proposed final ordinary dividends are not recognised, being declared after 31
December 1993. Similarly, ordinary dividends proposed for the year ended 31
December 1992 but declared during 1993 have been accounted for.

The preference dividend for the six months to 31 December 1993 is not
recognised, the entitlement not arising until 1 January 1994. The entitlement
to the preference dividend for the six months ended 31 December 1992 has thus
been recognised.

4. The defined benefit pension scheme has, by the actuarial methods used, a
surplus of projected assets over projected liabilities and any adjustment to
reflect the basis set out in FAS87 is not considered likely to be material.

5. As disclosed in note 26, Great Southern Group recognises profits from its
pre-arranged and pre-paid funeral plans with actuarial surpluses approved by
the Managing Trustees of National Funeral Trust, on the recommendation of the
Trust's independent actuary. The actuarial surplus recognised for 1993
amounted to British Pound 851,000. Approximately 50% of the funeral costs
claimed under these plans relate to funerals conducted by non-Group funeral
homes. This accounting policy is generally acceptable under US GAAP rules and
no material adjustment arises.

No adjustment has been made to consolidate the accounts of National Funeral
Trust which holds the funds received from members (see note 26).

6. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, the company shall, on 31
December 2009, redeem all the convertible preference shares then in issue at
par, together with a premium of 95p per share and any arrears or accruals of
dividend (whether or not such dividend has been declared), by giving not less
than 14 days prior written notice.

7. Operating Leases

The annual payments under non-cancellable operating leases to which the
company is committed are as follows:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS
OF PLANTSBROOK GROUP PLC

We have audited the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 34
to 56 of Plantsbrook Group plc and its subsidiaries which are expressed in
pounds sterling. These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United Kingdom and the United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material mis-statement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Plantsbrook
Group plc and its subsidiaries at 31 December 1993 and the results of its
operations, and its cash flows for the year ended 31 December 1993, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom.

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom vary in
certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. The application of the latter would have affected the
determination of consolidated net income expressed in pounds sterling for the
year ended 31 December 1993 and the determination of consolidated shareholders'
equity and consolidated financial position also expressed in pounds sterling at
31 December 1993 to the extent summarised in Note 21 to the consolidated
financial statements.

PLANTSBROOK GROUP PLC

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 1993
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparation and consolidation

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention as modified by the valuation of trust fund assets at market value and
in accordance with applicable accounting standards. In the balance sheet, trust
fund assets are shown after deduction of the related liability for future
funeral costs. This represents a departure from the requirement of the Companies
Act 1985. In the opinion of the Directors, this departure is necessary for the
accounts to give a true and fair view. An explanation of the departure is given
in the note on trust fund assets below.

The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. In accordance with the concession granted under Section 230 of the
Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of Plantsbrook Group plc has not
been separately presented in the accounts.

Cost of acquisitions and goodwill

In the accounts of the Company, investments in subsidiaries are stated at
cost less provisions for permanent diminution in value.

In the Group accounts goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase
price of subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of the net assets
acquired, is written off to a goodwill write-off reserve in the year of
acquisition.

Where the conditions of Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 are met, the
share premium arising on the issue of shares in consideration for the
acquisition of shares is credited to a merger reserve.

Depreciation

Depreciation of tangible fixed assets other than properties is provided
from the date of acquisition so as to write off assets over the term of their
estimated useful lives. The bases and rates in use for the various classes of
assets are as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Freehold and long leasehold premises Nil
Short leasehold premises Over term of lease
Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings:
Computers 25% on cost
Others 15% reducing balance basis
Motor vehicles:
Limousines 10% on cost
Others 15% to 25% on cost
</TABLE>

No depreciation is provided on freehold and long leasehold properties since
it is the Group's policy to maintain all of its funeral homes and other
properties to a high standard in order to protect their trade. Consequently the
Directors consider the lives of these properties to be so long and the residual
property values so high, based on prices prevailing at the time of acquisition,
that there is no significant annual depreciation.

Hire purchase contracts and operating leases

Assets acquired under hire purchase contracts and finance lease agreements
are capitalised at cost and depreciated in accordance with the note above. The
capital element of future rentals is included under creditors. The interest is
charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease.

Rental costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account
in the period to which they relate.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)

Stocks

Stocks, which comprise funeral supplies and monumental masonry, are stated
at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Pre-need funeral plans

Income from pre-need funeral plans is taken to the profit and loss account
as received. The liability for future funeral costs is determined based on
actuarial principles and charged to cost of sales to match income. A proportion
of the income received sufficient to meet the anticipated future liability to
conduct funerals is deposited with independent trustees. The liability for
future funeral costs and the transfers to the trust fund are determined based on
advice from independent actuaries.

Trust fund assets

Trust fund assets include investments which are stated at market value.
Unrealised surpluses arising on revaluation are credited to a revaluation
reserve. Deficits resulting from the aggregate market value of investments
falling below cost are charged to the profit and loss account.

In the consolidated balance sheet, trust fund assets are shown after
deducting the related liability for future funeral costs. This departure from
the Companies Act 1985, which requires assets and liabilities to be shown
separately, is, in the opinion of the Directors, necessary for the accounts to
show a true and fair view.

Deferred taxation

The Group provides for deferred taxation, using the liability method, to
take account of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for
accounts purposes and the treatment for taxation purposes. Provision is made
only to the extent that there is a reasonable probability that such tax will
become payable in the foreseeable future.

Repairs and renewals

All repairs and renewals are charged against profits as incurred.

Pension costs

The Group operates a contributory defined benefit pension scheme covering
the majority of its permanent employees. The scheme funds are administered by
trustees and are independent of the Group's finances.

Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread
the regular cost over the average service lives of employees in accordance with
the advice of qualified actuaries. Actuarial surpluses and deficits are spread
forward over the average remaining service lives of employees.

Turnover

Turnover comprises the amount receivable from customers for the provision
of funeral and other services, excluding Value Added Tax.

2. SEGMENTAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION

No segmental analysis is relevant since the Group's activities are all
related to the provision of funeral services. The turnover relating to
acquisitions made during the year is British Pound 800,022. It is not feasible 
to separately disclose the impact of these acquisitions on operating profit
since the new businesses have been fully integrated into the Group's existing
branch network and financial reporting structure.

8. EARNINGS PER SHARE

The basic earnings per share calculation for the year ended 31 December
1993 is based on the weighted average of 78,751,619 Ordinary shares in issue
during the year and the profit of British Pound 6,661,000 which is after
taxation, minority interests and preference dividends.

The fully diluted earnings per Ordinary share calculation is based on
106,477,621 Ordinary shares in issue, after allowing for full conversion rights
attaching to convertible securities and the allotment of shares under the option
scheme, with a corresponding adjustment to income for interest. The conversion
of the 1997 Preference shares in October 1993 has been reflected in this
calculation.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS -- (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 1993

20. PENSION COMMITMENTS

The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme for its employees, the
funds of which are administered by Trustees. Actuarial valuations are performed
every three years and contributions made in accordance with the actuaries'
recommendations. The scheme is an Exempt Approved Scheme under the terms of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and members are contracted out of the
State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.

The profit and loss account charge for pension costs is made in accordance
with the accounting policy in note 1.

The Group Pension Scheme had an actuarial valuation undertaken as at 6
April 1993 using the Projected Unit method of valuation, with a five year
control period. The principal assumptions were investment yields of 9% and
increases in pensionable earnings of 7% per annum.

At 6 April 1993, Group scheme assets had a fund value of British Pound 
3,085,000 representing 76% of the liabilities for benefits that had accrued
to members, allowing for expected future increases in pensionable earnings.
Following recommendations from the Actuary, the total contribution was increased
from 13.6% to 16.2% with effect from 1 January 1993, allowing for the
amortisation of the deficit over 15 years, the average remaining service life of
employees.

The net pension cost charged to the profit and loss account in the year
ended 31 December 1993 in respect of the defined benefit scheme amounted to
British Pound 510,000 and no accounting adjustment has been made for the deficit
referred to above on the grounds of immateriality.

(1) Under UK GAAP, in certain circumstances, it is acceptable not to provide for
depreciation on freehold and long leasehold land and buildings. Under US
GAAP buildings must be depreciated. For the purposes of the above
adjustment, depreciation has been provided on freehold and long leasehold
buildings on a straight line basis over 50 years.

21. ADJUSTMENTS AND DISCLOSURES TO REFLECT U.S. GAAP -- (CONTINUED)

(2) Under UK GAAP, goodwill can be eliminated from the accounts immediately on
acquisition against reserves. Under US GAAP, goodwill must be capitalised
and amortised to the income statement over its estimated useful life. For
the purposes of the above adjustment, goodwill has been capitalised and is
being amortised over a 40 year period.

(3) Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is provided under the liability method 
only to the extent that it is probable that an asset or liability will
crystalize. Under US GAAP deferred tax liabilities or assets are provided
on all temporary timing differences existing at the end of a financial
period. For the purposes of the above adjustment, a deferred tax provision
has been recognised in respect of all timing differences.

(4) Under UK GAAP, dividends are recognised in the period to which they relate.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recognised in the period when they are
formally declared. For the purposes of the above adjustment, the 1993
proposed dividend that was recognised in the 1993 Plantsbrook accounts has
not been recognised in the 1993 US GAAP figures. However the 1993 US GAAP
profit and loss account has been adjusted to reflect the 1992 proposed
dividend that was declared during 1993.

(5) Under UK GAAP, income from pre-need funeral plans is taken to the profit 
and loss account as received. This is disclosed in Note 1 to the financial
statements on page 41. Under the US GAAP it is not acceptable to recognise
principal payments pursuant to the sale of pre-need funeral plans until the
funeral has been conducted. No adjustment has been made for this difference
between UK GAAP and US GAAP as the impact on the profit and loss account is
not considered likely to be material.

(6) Operating Lease Commitments

the company is committed are as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Primary.......................................................... 5.67p
Fully Diluted.................................................... --
</TABLE>

The primary earnings per share figure for the year ended 31 December 1993
is based on the weighted average number of 80,071,289 Ordinary shares in issue
during the year, after allowing for the allotment of shares under the share
option scheme and the profit of British Pound 4,543,000 which is stated after
taxation minority interests and preference dividends, and an adjustment to
income for interest on the share options.

The fully diluted earnings per share calculation is based on 106,477,621
Ordinary shares in issue after allowing for full conversion rights attaching to
convertible securities and the allotment of shares under the share option scheme
and a corresponding adjustment to income for interest. The conversion of the
1997 Preference shares in October 1993 has been taken into consideration. The
calculation produced anti-dilutive results.

Notes

1. It is not feasible to separate the impact of acquisitions on operating profit
since the new businesses have been fully integrated into the Group's existing
branch network and financial reporting structure.

2. The basic earnings per share calculation for the six months ended 30th 
June, 1994 has been based on the weighted average of 100,001,364 
(1993: 71,512,061) Ordinary shares in issue during the period and the 
profit after taxation, minority interests and preference dividends.

The fully diluted earnings per Ordinary share calculation has been based upon
107,764,651 (1993: 105,270,093) Ordinary shares in issue, after allowing for 
full conversion rights attaching to convertible securities and the 
allotment of shares under the option scheme, with a corresponding 
adjustment to income for interest.

3. The financial information set out in this announcement which has been
prepared under Accounting Policies consistent with those adopted for the
accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1993 does not constitute full
accounts as referred to in Section 254 of the Companies Act 1985.

(1) Under UK GAAP, in certain circumstances, it is acceptable not to provide 
for depreciation on freehold and long leasehold land and buildings. Under 
US GAAP buildings must be depreciated. For the purposes of the above
adjustment, depreciation has been provided on freehold and long leasehold
buildings on a straight line basis over 50 years.

(2) Under UK GAAP, goodwill can be eliminated from the accounts immediately on
acquisition against reserves. Under US GAAP, goodwill must be capitalised
and amortised to the income statement over its estimated useful life. For
the purposes of the above adjustment, goodwill has been capitalised and is
being amortised over a 40 year period.

(3) Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is provided under the liability method 
only to the extent that it is probable that an asset or liability will
crystallize. Under US GAAP deferred tax liabilities or assets are provided
on all temporary timing differences existing at the end of a financial
period. For the purposes of the above adjustment, a deferred tax provision
has been recognised in respect of all timing differences.

2. ADJUSTMENTS AND DISCLOSURES TO REFLECT U.S. GAAP -- (CONTINUED)

(4) Under UK GAAP, dividends are recognised in the period to which they relate.
Under US GAAP, dividend are recognised in the period when they are formally
declared. For the purposes of the above adjustment, the 1993 proposed
dividend that was recognised in the 1993 Plantsbrook accounts has not been
recognised in the 1993 US GAAP figures. However the 1993 US GAAP profit and
loss account has been adjusted to reflect the 1992 proposed dividend that
was declared during 1993.

(5) Under UK GAAP, income from pre-need funeral plans is taken to the profit 
and loss account as received. This is disclosed in Note 1 to the financial
statements on page 41. Under US GAAP it is not acceptable to recognise
principal payments pursuant to the sale of pre-need funeral plans until 
the funeral has been conducted. No adjustment has been made for this 
difference between UK GAAP and US GAAP as the impact on the profit and 
loss account is not considered likely to be material.

(6) Earnings per share
