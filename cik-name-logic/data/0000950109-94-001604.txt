Item 5. Other Events
------------

On August 19, 1994, a federal trial jury in the U.S. District Court for the
District of New Jersey (the "Court") returned a verdict in favor of Armstrong
World Industries, Inc. (the "Company") in the second trial involving Armstrong
and The Industry Network System, Inc. (TINS). (Fineman and The Industry
------------------------
Network System, Inc. v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., C.A. No. 84-3837 JWB).
- - - --------------------------------------------------------- 
Accordingly, the jury found that Armstrong is not obligated to pay any damages
to TINS.

On June 20, 1991, the Court in the first trial (which had been completed on
April 19, 1991) set aside the jury's verdict against the Company, granting
judgment for the Company notwithstanding the jury's verdict and, in the
alternative, ordering a new trial. The United States Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit, in Fineman v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (No. 91-5613),
------------------------------------------- 
among other things, affirmed the order for a new trial. The second trial began
April 26, 1994.

In another matter, on August 16, 1994, a federal judge in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Eastern Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) issued an opinion
confirming that the future claimants' settlement class action known as Georgine
--------
v. Amchem was "fair to the class as a whole," certifying the class and ruling
- - - --------- 
that procedural due process requirements had been satisfied. The class is
composed of occupationally exposed future asbestos-related personal injury
claimants with claims against members of the Center for Claims Resolution (which
includes the Company) who have not opted out of the class. The class claims
will generally proceed in a non-litigation system in which accelerated
determination of claims will be made, based upon historical values and flow
rates and agreed upon medical criteria. Further court proceedings will be
required before final approval.
