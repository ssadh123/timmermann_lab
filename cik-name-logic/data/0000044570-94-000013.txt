Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

In 1993, proposals were requested from qualified firms of
certified public accountants to perform audit services beginning
in 1994 for Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries (Arkansas
Power & Light Company, Gulf States Utilities Company, Louisiana
Power & Light Company, Mississippi Power & Light Company, New
Orleans Public Service Inc., and System Energy Resources, Inc.).
On March 16, 1994, the firm of Deloitte & Touche was notified
that the firm of Coopers & Lybrand was selected as the new
independent accountants as a result of this process. The
decision to change accountants was approved by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors of Entergy Corporation. The
firm of Deloitte & Touche served as independent auditors for
Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries, excluding Gulf States
Utilities Company for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992.
The firm of Deloitte & Touche had acted for Entergy Corporation
and its subsidiaries, excluding Gulf States Utilities Company, in
this capacity since the Corporation's organization in 1949. It
had also acted in a similar capacity since 1932 for the
Corporation's operating subsidiaries except for System Energy
Resources, Inc. for which it had acted since that corporation's
formation in 1974.

The Independent Auditors' Reports of Deloitte & Touche on
the consolidated financial statements of Entergy Corporation and
subsidiaries and the financial statements of Arkansas Power &
Light Company, Louisiana Power & Light Company, Mississippi Power
& Light Company, New Orleans Public Service Inc., and System
Energy Resources, Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993
each expressed an unqualified opinion, and as to Entergy
Corporation includes explanatory paragraphs as to uncertainties
because of certain regulatory and litigation matters and as to
System Energy Resources, Inc. includes an explanatory paragraph
as to an uncertainty resulting from a regulatory proceeding.
There were no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K,
Item 304(a)(1)(v)) or disagreements with Deloitte & Touche on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure that were not resolved
to the satisfaction of Deloitte & Touche, during the past two
fiscal years and through March 16, 1994.

The firm of Coopers & Lybrand has acted as independent
accountants since 1933 for the Corporation's operating
subsidiary, Gulf States Utilities Company.
