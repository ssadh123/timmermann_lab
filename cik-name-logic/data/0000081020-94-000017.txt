5. Other Events

On December 9, 1994, PSI Energy, Inc. (PSI), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of CINergy Corp. (CINergy), the Office of the Utility Consumer
Counselor, Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc., and the PSI-
Industrial Group entered into a settlement agreement concerning PSI's
petition for a $93 million retail rate increase ($103 million including
ratebase treatment of certain projects while under construction) and
PSI's previously filed plan for the allocation of its portion of merger
savings between PSI's customers and CINergy's shareholders. The
settlement agreement is subject to the approval of the Indiana Utility
Regulatory Commission (IURC) in its entirety without any change or
condition that is unacceptable to any party to the settlement agreement.
No assurance can be given that the IURC will approve the settlement
agreement. Significant provisions of the settlement agreement include:

. A retail rate increase of $33.1 million, excluding reductions for
customer credits for non-fuel, operation and maintenance expense
merger savings (Non-Fuel Merger Savings) and exclusive of increases
for ratemaking related to construction work in progress, both of
which are discussed below. The increase includes the recovery of the
costs of postretirement benefits other than pensions on an accrual
basis and, as further discussed herein, the recovery of demand-side
management (DSM) expenditures and the adoption of lower depreciation
rates. This rate increase reflects an 11.9% return on common equity
with an 8.23% overall rate of return on net original cost plant. The
settling parties have agreed to support an effective date of February
1, 1995, for the rate increase.

. A mechanism to allocate PSI's share of net merger savings through
December 31, 1997, between PSI's customers and CINergy's
shareholders. In essence, the mechanism guarantees PSI's customers
50% of PSI's portion of the projected net, Non-Fuel Merger Savings.
PSI's customers will receive these merger savings via credits to base
rates of $4.4 million in 1995, an additional $2.2 million in 1996,
and an additional $2.4 million in 1997. After 1997, the accumulated
credits shall continue until the effective date of an order in a PSI
merger savings allows PSI to recover its portion of transaction costs
(currently estimated at $27 million) and costs to achieve merger
savings (currently estimated at $21 million) over a 10-year period
commencing October 1, 1994. PSI will have to achieve these levels of
merger savings in order to realize the 11.9% return on equity.

The settlement agreement provides PSI with a financial incentive for
PSI to achieve, or exceed, merger savings projections and enhance
operating efficiencies by allowing PSI to earn up to a 13.25% return
on common equity until the effective date of an order in PSI's next
retail rate proceeding. PSI's next retail rate proceeding is
currently pending before the IURC, and PSI expects an order in this
proceeding by early 1996. Upon the effective date of an order in the
next retail rate proceeding, the settlement agreement provides PSI an
opportunity to earn an additional 100 basis points above the common
equity return to be granted by the IURC in such rate proceeding until
December 31, 1997. In return for the agreed upon sharing mechanism,
PSI will withdraw its previously filed "performance efficiency plan"
which would have provided for the sharing of merger savings with
shareholders. Any mechanism for sharing of merger savings after
December 31, 1997, will be determined in subsequent regulatory
proceedings.

. Recovery of DSM expenditures deferred through July 1993 ($35
million), together with carrying costs, over a five-year period
commencing with the effective date of new rates in the order
approving the settlement. Deferred DSM expenditures as of the
effective date of an IURC order approving the settlement agreement,
which are not included for recovery in the settlement agreement, will
continue to be deferred, with carrying costs, for recovery in
subsequent rate proceedings. In addition, base rates would include
$23 million on an annual basis for DSM expenditures. Future deferral
of DSM expenditures will be the amount by which actual expenditures
exceed the base level of $23 million. If DSM expenditures in any
calendar year are less than the $23 million in base rates, the
unamortized balance of deferred DSM expenditures would be reduced by
such difference.

. Ratemaking and accounting mechanisms to address regulatory lag. The
settlement agreement provides for the inclusion of capital costs
associated with environmental compliance projects and the applicable
portion of PSI's Wabash River Clean Coal project in rate base while
the projects are under construction, thus allowing PSI to earn a cash
return on these costs prior to the projects' in-service dates. In
addition, the agreement includes provisions for the deferral of
certain operating costs associated with the Wabash River Clean Coal
project, together with the debt component of carrying costs, and
continued accrual of the debt component of carrying costs and
deferral of depreciation expense on two major projects for subsequent
recovery in PSI's next retail rate proceeding.

. The adoption of lower depreciation rates, to be effective with the
IURC's orders in this settlement and PSI's next retail rate expense 
by approximately $24 million from the level included in PSI's
initial request.

. The agreement to a procedural schedule in connection with PSI's
request filed in July 1994 for a retail rate increase, primarily to
recover the costs of the Gibson Unit No. 4 scrubber and the Wabash
River Clean Coal project, both of which were previously approved by
the IURC. Final action on this rate request is not expected until
early 1996.

By entering into the settlement, the company was able to:

. resolve a major uncertainty as to the ultimate level and timing of
the rate increase;

. substantially mitigate the risks of not being able to achieve its
allowed return on common equity due to the earnings attrition
resulting from the completion of two major construction projects
within a nine-month period; and

. timely provide a realistic opportunity to retain a portion of the
merger savings for shareholders.

The above description of the settlement agreement does not purport to be
complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of
such settlement agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10-a.

Other Post-Employment Benefits

(1) PSI's proposals in IURC Cause No. 39584
concerning Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions ("PBOP") and Other Post-Employment
Benefits will be approved by the IURC and
implemented as proposed by PSI, except that
PSI's PBOP accruals will be externally funded
on a cost-effective basis; provided that PSI
will seek UCC agreement on such external
funding before PSI so acts. In the event that
an agreement with the UCC cannot be reached,<PAGE>
PSI shall submit its proposal for external
funding to the IURC for hearing and
determination.

(2) In any future retail electric rate proceeding,
the settling parties will not object to the
level of earnings actually achieved on PSI's
PBOP accruals externally funded on the basis
that the return would have been greater if
internal funding had been used.

(1) PSI will withdraw its proposals in IURC Cause
No. 39584 with respect to environmental
compliance incentives.

P. Emission Allowances

(1) PSI's proposed Standard Contract Rider No. 69

PSI will meet with the UCC and attempt to
mutually agree upon the format of, and
information to be included in, such filing.

(4) The UCC reserves the right to request a hearing
on any of PSI's emission allowance 30-day
filings. PSI and the UCC agree to discuss and
attempt to resolve any disagreements concerning
PSI's emission allowance filings.

Q. Depreciation Rates

IURC Cause No. 39584 will be approved by the
IURC and implemented as proposed by the UCC.

(2) Any settling party may propose the same or
different depreciation rates in PSI's future<PAGE>
general retail electric rate proceedings after
PSI's next general retail electric rate
proceeding, currently denominated as IURC Cause
No. 40003; provided, however, that the
depreciation rates proposed by the UCC in IURC
Cause No. 39584 shall be reflected in the
retail electric rates and charges authorized by

their review and comment.

X. Reorganization Benefits

(1) The parties to this Settlement Agreement have
agreed that the significant changes to PSI<PAGE>
associated with the Reorganization of PSI and
The Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company ("CG&E")
justify the following ratemaking provisions. 
PSI's retail electric customers will have
applied against the increase in PSI's general
retail electric rates and charges otherwise
effective under Paragraph B above (or under the
IURC's Order issued as a result of PSI's
general retail electric rate proceeding in IURC
Cause No. 40003, whichever is applicable) the
following applicable amount reflecting a
portion of the projected Reorganization
non-fuel operation and maintenance expense
reductions for the particular period:

(a) An annual credit of $4,429,000 to be
included in basic retail electric rates
and charges under IURC Cause Nos. 39584
and 39584-S2 applicable for the period
beginning on the effective date of the
IURC's Order accepting and approving this
Settlement Agreement in accordance with
its terms and ending on December 31, 1995
("Period I");

(b) An annual credit (incremental to the
credit in Item (a) above) of $2,193,000
($6,622,000 - $4,429,000) to be included
in basic retail electric rates and charges
applicable for the period beginning on
January 1, 1996 and ending on the day
before the effective date of the Order
issued as a result of PSI's general retail
electric rate proceeding in IURC Cause No.
40003 ("Period IIA");

(c) An annual credit (in lieu of the credits
in Items (a) and (b) above but incremental
to the rates and charges otherwise
approved in IURC Cause No. 40003) of
$2,193,000 ($6,622,000 - $4,429,000) to be
included in basic retail electric rates
and charges under IURC Cause No. 40003
applicable for the period beginning on the
effective date of the IURC's Order issued
as a result of PSI's general retail
electric rate proceeding in IURC Cause No.
40003 and ending on December 31, 1996
("Period IIB"); and

<PAGE>
(d) An annual credit (incremental to the
credit in Item (c) above) of $2,444,000
($9,066,000 - 6,622,000) to be included in
basic retail electric rates and charges
applicable for the period beginning on
January 1, 1997 and ending on December 31,
1997 ("Period III"); provided, however,
that such annual credit included in PSI's
basic retail electric rates and charges
shall continue after the end of Period III
until modified or discontinued by an Order
issued by the IURC as a result of a PSI
general retail electric rate proceeding.

(2) Subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth
in Paragraph X(3) below, PSI's net operating
income amount otherwise effective under
Paragraph E above (or under the IURC's Order
issued as a result of PSI's general retail
electric rate proceeding in IURC Cause No.
40003, whichever is applicable) shall, for
purposes of I.C. 8-1-2-42(d)(3) only, be
increased by the following applicable amount in
order to assure realization of the maximum
Reorganization cost reductions for the
particular period, as described in Paragraph
X(1) above:

(a) An annual increase applicable for Periods
I and IIA of $9,985,000, subject to any
applicable adjustment because of the
capitalization "true-up" pursuant to
Paragraph C(2) above;

(b) An annual increase applicable for Periods
IIB and III reflecting a return of an
additional 100 basis points above the
return on common equity capital then
otherwise authorized by the Order issued
as a result of PSI's general retail
electric rate proceeding in IURC Cause No.
40003.

(c) The annual increase in PSI's net operating
income for purposes of I.C. 8-1-2-42(d)(3)
applicable for Period III under Item (b)
of this Paragraph X(2) shall be phased-out
ratably over twelve (12) months after the
end of Period III unless and until
modified by an Order<PAGE>
issued by the IURC as a result of a PSI
general retail electric rate proceeding. 
(See the example set forth in Attachment A
attached hereto and incorporated herein by
this reference.)

(3) The quarterly portion of the applicable
increase in the net operating income amount
otherwise effective under Paragraph X(2) above
for a particular period shall occur only to the
extent that for such quarter:

(a) PSI utilizes a reserve margin of 17
percent or less as its reserve margin
planning criterion for the PSI electric
system for integrated resource planning
purposes;

(b) PSI utilizes the "Reserve Margin
Equalization" concept within the meaning
of the then effective Operating Agreement
between PSI and CG&E;

(c) PSI utilizes the "50/50 split-the-savings"
concept for the allocation of
Reorganization production cost savings
within the meaning of the then effective
Operating Agreement between PSI and CG&E;

(d) PSI has surrendered the Certificate of
Public Convenience and Necessity for the
Cayuga Combustion Turbine Peaking Unit No.
5 as issued by the IURC in IURC Cause No.
39175; and

(e) PSI satisfies the quality of service
provisions of Attachment B attached hereto
and incorporated herein by this reference.

(4) To the extent that an increase is made in the
net operating income amount otherwise effective
for a particular period in accordance with the
provisions of this Paragraph X, an appropriate
decrease shall, solely for purposes of
I.C. 8-1-2-42(d)(2), be made in PSI's total
authorized non-fuel operating expenses amount
then otherwise effective under Paragraph E
above (or under the IURC's Order issued as a
result of PSI's general retail electric rate
proceeding in<PAGE>
IURC Cause No. 40003, whichever is applicable)
for the particular period, which decrease shall
be equal to the amount of the total "annual
credit" for the applicable period in Paragraphs
X(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d), plus 1.611 times the
amount of the applicable net operating income
amount increases in Paragraphs X(2)(a) and (b)
(see the example set forth in Attachment C
attached hereto and incorporated herein by this
reference); provided, however, that such
appropriate decrease in PSI's total authorized
non-fuel operating expenses amount for purposes
of I.C. 8-1-2-42(d)(2) applicable for Period
III shall be phased-out ratably over twelve
(12) months after the end of Period III unless
and until modified by an Order issued by the
IURC as a reslt of a PSI general retail
electric rate proceeding. (See the example set
forth in Attachment A attached hereto and
incorporated herein by this reference.)

(5) Any settling party may advance in subsequent
PSI general retail electric rate proceeding(s)
its proposals concerning the appropriate retail
electric ratemaking treatment of Reorganization
non-fuel operation and maintenance expense
savings after Period III.

(6) PSI shall be authorized to defer the Indiana
jurisdictional portion of reasonable
Reorganization transaction costs incurred prior
to January 1, 1995, by PSI and appropriately
allocated to PSI's retail electric customers,
and to amortize such costs to operating
expenses over a 10-year period beginning on
October 1, 1994; PSI will reflect such
amortization of Reorganization transaction
costs in the rates and charges PSI proposes in
its general retail electric rate proceeding in
IURC Cause No. 40003; provided, however, that
PSI shall not recover through retail electric
rates, or as an offset to
Reorganization-related benefits, any of the
costs incurred by PSI or PSI Resources, Inc. to
defend against the hostile takeover attempt
initiated by IPALCO Enterprises, Inc. In PSI's
subsequent general retail electric rate
proceeding(s), the settling parties may present
evidence supporting or opposing the
reasonableness, prudency, amount or allocation<PAGE>
of PSI's proposed recovery of such transaction
costs.

(7) PSI shall be authorized to defer the Indiana
jurisdictional portion of reasonable costs to
achieve the benefits of the Reorganization,
incurred by PSI prior to October 31, 1996, and
appropriately allocated to PSI's retail
electric customers, and to amortize such costs
as a charge to operating expenses over a
10-year period beginning on October 1, 1994;
PSI will reflect such amortization of costs to
achieve the benefits of the Reorganization in
the rates and charges PSI proposes in its
general retail electric rate proceeding in IURC
Cause No. 40003; provided, however, that PSI
shall not recover through retail electric
rates, or as an offset to Reorganization-
related benefits, any of the costs incurred by
PSI or PSI Resources, Inc. to defend against
the hostile takeover attempt initiated by
IPALCO Enterprises, Inc. In PSI's subsequent
general retail electric rate proceeding(s), the
settling parties may present evidence
supporting or opposing the reasonableness,
prudency, amount or allocation of PSI's
proposed recovery of such costs to achieve.

(8) PSI will withdraw its proposed Standard
Contract No. 71 (Cayuga Unit No. 5 Cancelled
Plant Addition Shared Savings Adjustment) in
IURC Cause No. 39584-S2.

(9) PSI will withdraw its proposed Standard
Contract Rider No. 72 (Non-Fuel Operation And
Maintenance Expense Reorganization Shared
Savings Credit Adjustment) in IURC Cause No.
39584-S2.

(10) In the event that PSI incurs an expense for
which it believes deferral is appropriate and
for which it does not already have deferral
authorization from the IURC, PSI agrees that it
will seek UCC agreement for such deferral
within 14 days of the end of the month in which
any such new deferral of expense occurs. If
PSI and the UCC do not reach an agreement on
the deferral of such expenses within a 14-day
period, then PSI shall petition the IURC for
authorization to defer such expenses, subject
to any opposition from other parties. This
provision shall not apply<PAGE>
to expenses which are deferred in accordance
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
Uniform System of Accounts and Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles. This provision
shall terminate when the phase-out described in
Paragraph X(2) above is completed.

gasification services, shall be included for
ratemaking purposes so long as the Wabash River
Coal Gasification Repowering Project is
in-service and used and useful by November 30,
1995. The cost of capital and capitalization
structure evidence shall be as current as
possible and updated as of the prefiling dates
set forth in the Prehearing Conference Order;
provided, however, that to the extent that such
an update is made by PSI after the date for the
prefiling of the UCC's and intervenors'

Attachment B

The settling parties have previously agreed that
Reorganization benefits should be achieved without causing a
material degradation in the adequacy and reliability of PSI's
retail electric service and PSI hereby reaffirms its commitment. 
[Section 13.3 of the March 2, 1994 Settlement Agreement in IURC
Cause No. 39897.] The settling parties have also agreed that
PSI's performance as measured by the Transmission Line
Performance Index ("TLPI"), the System Average Interruption
Frequency Index ("SAIFI") and the System Average Interruption
Duration Index ("SAIDI") constitute a reasonable way to
demonstrate that no such material degradation of service has
occurred because of reduced non-fuel operation and maintenance
expenses as a result of the Reorganization. The settling
parties also recognize that these Indices may be affected by
events which are not related to the level of operation and
maintenance expense, and which are beyond the reasonable control
of PSI, such as, but not limited to, weather and vandalism. 
Therefore, the quarterly portion of the applicable increase in
the net operating income amount otherwise effective under
Paragraph X(2) of the Settlement Agreement for a particular
period shall occur only to the extent that PSI demonstrates in
the applicable Fuel Adjustment Clause proceeding pursuant to
I.C. 8-1-2-42 ("FAC") that there has been no material
degradation in its TLPI, SAIFI, or SAIDI. Such demonstration
shall be made in accordance with the following provisions of
this Attachment A.
<PAGE>
The three indicators of customer service reliability
shall be calculated as follows:

(i) TLPI shall be calculated as follows:
Transmission Line Performance = TLIF x 100
Index ("TLPI") MTL

(ii) SAIFI shall be calculated as follows:
System Average Interruption = CO
Frequency Index ("SAIFI") CS

(iii) SAIDI shall be calculated as follows:
System Average Interruption = TO E 60
Duration Index ("SAIDI") CS

where:
CO = Total number of customers out of service for
all sustained (excluding momentary)
interruptions during the period according to
PSI's records.
TO = The total number of minutes customers were out
of service for all interruptions during the
period according to PSI's records.
CS = The number of customers at the end of the
period according to PSI's records.
<PAGE>
TLIF = Transmission line insulation failures for the
period according to PSI's records.
MTL = PSI's miles of transmission lines at the end of
the previous calendar year according to PSI's
records.
In each FAC proceeding during Period I, Period IIA,
Period IIB, Period III, and the phase-out period, PSI shall show
the IURC how its actual TLPI, SAIDI and SAIFI for the preceding
twelve months compares to target levels for TLPI, SAIDI and
SAIFI according to the following formula:
SAIDI SAIFI TLPI
Target 3.0 2.0 8.5
PSI shall divide the actual SAIDI, SAIFI and TLPI by
the target for each Index. The results shall be averaged.
In the event that such average is less than or equal to
1.0, the applicable increase in the net operating income shall
remain in effect.
In the event that such average is greater than 1.0, the
applicable increase in the net operating income amount otherwise
effective for the particular period may still occur to the
extent that PSI proves to the IURC that the deterioration in the
Indices for the prior twelve-month period did not occur because
of reductions in operation and maintenance expense.
<PAGE>
For purposes of this ongoing quality of service review,
PSI will calculate the Indices using the same methodologies as
it used as of the date of this Settlement Agreement.
