Item 5. Other Events

Colonial Gas Company (the "Company") announced on
November 15, 1994 two cost saving measures involving an
early retirement program and closing its two retail
appliance stores.

The early retirement program is designed to reduce the
Company's workforce by 5% or 25 positions. To meet this
goal, the Company is offering the optional program to 66
employees -- representing 13% of its current utility
workforce of 522 people. Eligible employees must make their
decision by December 31, 1994 and retire by January 31,
1995.

The Company will record the costs of this program in the
fourth quarter of 1994. These costs will be recovered by
lower payroll and fringe expenses in the future, resulting
in a payback period of less than two years. If all eligible
employees choose to retire early, the program's after-tax
costs are expected not to exceed $2.8 million, while its
after-tax savings are estimated at $1.6 million per year.
The Company projects that about half of all eligible
employees will participate in the program -- resulting in
after-tax costs of $1.4 million and after-tax savings of
$0.8 million per year.

The Company will close its two retail appliance stores
on December 31, 1994. While the Company will no longer sell
appliances such as refrigerators, freezers, and dishwashers,
it will continue to market gas heating and hot water
systems. The store closings are not expected to result in
any layoffs or significant lost sales. The Company will
record the full cost of discontinuing this line of business,
estimated not to exceed $394,000 after tax, during the
fourth quarter of 1994.
