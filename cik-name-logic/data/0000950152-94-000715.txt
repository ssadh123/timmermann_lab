Item. 5 - Other Events

a) Negative Goodwill (Operating loss indemnification)

Under the terms of the agreement between Commercial Intertech Corp.
("TEC") and the Treuhandanstalt ("THA"), to acquire Sachsenhydraulik Chemnitz
GmbH and its wholly owned subsidiary (Hydraulic Rochlitz GmbH), which are known
as ORSTA Hydraulik, Commercial will receive approximately U.S. $31.0 million
(51.5 million Deutsche marks) designed as an indemnification of estimated
operating losses over a period of two years. The amount of operating loss
indemnification available to TEC was adjusted for cash consumed by the ORSTA
operations between January 1, 1994, the measurement date, and April 30, 1994,
the acquisition date. The remaining indemnification will be amortized over a
two year period starting May 1, 1994. The two year indemnification period was
negotiated with the THA as part of the Purchase Agreement and was specified
accordingly in the Agreement. The operating loss indemnification will be
amortized based on estimated operating results of the ORSTA Hydraulik
operations as acquired on April 30, 1994. The quarterly amortization value
will remain unchanged as actual results are reported and will be translated
from Deutsche marks into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the
period.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET
SACHSENHYDRAULIK CHEMNITZ GmbH AND SUBSIDIARY

Note A - Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation
- - ---------------------
The accounts of Sachsenhydraulik Chemnitz GmbH and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Hydraulik Rochlitz GmbH (collectively referred to as the "Company")
are included in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company is a manufacturer
of hydraulic cylinders, piston and gear pumps, and industrial valves and does
business as ORSTA Hydraulik. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated.

Subsequent Event
- - ----------------
Commercial Intertech Corp. acquired the common stock of the Company,
effective May 1, 1994, from the Treuhandanstalt ("THA") the regulatory agency
of the Federal Republic of Germany responsible for the privatization of former
East German state-owned enterprises.

Inventories
- - -----------
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories are
valued using the weighted average cost method which approximates first-in,
first-out.

Inventories as of April 30, 1994 consisted of the following:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
(in thousands)
--------------
<S> <C>
Raw materials $1,655
Work in progress 1,817
Finished goods 572
------
$4,044
======
</TABLE>

Property and Depreciation
- - -------------------------
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Buildings and
equipment are depreciated over their useful lives by use of the straight-line
method.

Sachsenhydraulik Chemnitz GmbH and its wholly owned subsidiary were East
German entities prior to July 1, 1990. On July 1, 1990, the fixed assets of
the Company were revalued based on market value appraisals. These fair value
adjustments represented the establishment of the cost basis for former East
German companies, as the financial records of former East German companies did
not previously reflect Western historical cost accounting principles.
<PAGE> 6
Note A - Accounting Policies (continued)

Revenue Recognition
- - -------------------
Revenue is recognized when the earning process is complete and the risks
and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which is generally
considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product.

Bank and Cash Equivalents
- - -------------------------
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The carrying
amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate
fair value.

Translation of Foreign Currencies
- - ---------------------------------
The financial statements are translated in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52. Under this method, all asset and
liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange
rate.

Note B - Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt obligations consist of capital lease agreements with
payment through the year 1998. The liability equates to the net present value
of the future payments and the anticipated residual value of the assets at the
end of the leases. The value of the capitalized assets included in fixed
assets is $1,717,000.

Note C - Deferred Tax Asset

The tax net operating loss carryforward amounts to $105,200,000. The
resultant deferred tax assets amount to approximately $46,300,000. Net
operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely. However, due to the
uncertainty as to the realization of the asset, a 100 percent valuation
allowance has been provided.

Note D - Other Current Liabilities

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Accrued payroll and related taxes consist of the following:
<S> <C> 
Severance and termination (Social Plan) $ 982

Relocation / rearrangement accruals $4,164
Accrued contract losses 1,659
Other 3,082
------
$8,905
======
</TABLE> 

Note E - Shareholder Equity

The Company may not pay dividends until the retained earnings deficit is
eliminated.

Note F - Receivable From Treuhandanstalt

The receivable from the Treuhandanstalt is primarily attributable to the
pledge of financial aid contained in the purchase agreement. The total amount
pledged was approximately $36.0 million (59.0 million Deutsche marks) less
amounts consumed by the operations during the four month period ended April 30,
1994. The net amount receivable at April 30 is $27.0 million. This balance
will be received in installments over the remainder of 1994 and 1995.

The Board of Directors and Shareholder
Sachsenhydraulik Chemnitz GmbH
Chemnitz
Federal Republic of Germany

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Sachsenhydraulik Chemnitz GmbH and subsidiary, as of April 30, 1994. This
balance sheet is the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on this balance sheet based on our

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the balance sheet is free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the balance sheet. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall balance sheet
presentation. We believe that our audit of the balance sheet provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the balance sheet referred to above presents fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Sachsenhydraulik Chemnitz GmbH and subsidiary at April 30, 1994 in conformity
