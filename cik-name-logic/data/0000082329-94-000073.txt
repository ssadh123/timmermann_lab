August 10, 1994, Houston, Texas........Reading & Bates
Corporation (RB-NYSE) announced today that its wholly owned
subsidiary, Reading & Bates Drilling Co., has entered into a
joint venture with F. J. Brown & Associates, Inc. to offer
turnkey drilling services internationally and in the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico. The new venture, Brown-Reading & Bates Joint
Venture, is owned equally by the two companies. F. J. Brown &
Associates, Inc. was founded in 1987 to offer turnkey
drilling services and drilling management services both
internationally and in the U.S. The company consists of
approximately 50 management and technical personnel and has
executed ten turnkey wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during
the past 18 months. The new venture's first turnkey
operation is currently underway for Santa Fe Minerals in
Matagorda Island Block 634 in the U.S. Gulf utilizing Reading
& Bates' jackup unit George H. Galloway. A second operation
has just started with Ashland Exploration in Vermilion Block
389 utilizing Diamond Offshore's Ocean Ambassador. 

The Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul
B. Loyd, Jr. commented as follows on the venture: "Reading &
Bates is pleased to form this association with one of the
industry's recognized turnkey operators, and we believe our
presence in virtually all of the world's markets will present
a number of opportunities for the new venture in addition to
those in U.S. waters. Turnkey drilling is certainly
complementary to Reading & Bates' primary focus on offshore
drilling with premium jackups and semisubmersibles and
floating production, and this venture will allow us to be even
more responsive to our clients' need worldwide." 

Reading & Bates is a New York Stock Exchange listed
company, engaging in offshore drilling throughout the world.
Its wholly owned subsidiary, Reading & Bates Development Co.,
provides technical, construction and project management
services to the upstream offshore oil and gas industry
worldwide.
