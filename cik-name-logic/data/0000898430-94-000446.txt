a. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED

The financial statements presented herein include all of the pertinent
information available related to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
but do not include all of the financial statements required by Rule 3.05 of
Regulation S-X. It would not be practicable to provide such financial
statements because the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed do not
represent a separate entity but were commingled with other assets and
liabilities of The Titan Corporation.

The Titan Corporation prepared, and its independent accountants audited, a
special report of the assets and liabilities which it intended to sell along
with a statement reflecting the results of operations related to those
specified assets and liabilities. These audited financial statements are
presented herein. A complete set of financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles would also have
included a complete income statement, statement of equity and a statement of
cash flows. It would not be possible to prepare such statements without making
numerous assumptions as to the transactions which might have taken place had
the business involved been a separate entity. Therefore, such statements would
be both time and cost prohibitive to prepare as they would require the re-
creation of past history.

ARTHUR ANDERSEN & CO.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Management
of The Titan Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying statement of certain specified assets and
liabilities of the Titan Applications Group, an operating group of The Titan
Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) as of October 1, 1993, and the statements
of operating income for the nine-month period ended October 1, 1993 and for the
years ended December 31, 1992, 1991 and 1990. These statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits of the Titan
Applications Group.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The financial statements have been prepared in contemplation of a sale through
Banker's Trust of certain specified assets and liabilities of the Titan
Applications Group, described in Note 1, and is not intended to be a complete
presentation of the Titan Applications Group's assets and liabilities.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, certain specified assets and liabilities of the Titan
Applications Group of The Titan Corporation as of October 1, 1993, as defined
by management as referred to in Note 1 of the notes to the financial statements,
and the results of operations for the nine-month period ended October 1, 1993,
and for the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991 and 1990, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

As explained in note 5 to these statements, on March 5, 1994, the Titan
Corporation entered into an agreement to sell the Applications Group.

Washington, D.C.,
November 17, 1993 /s/ Arthur Andersen & Co.

to the matter discussed
in Note 5, as to which
the date is March 5, 1994).

TITAN APPLICATIONS GROUP
------------------------

NOTES TO STATEMENT OF CERTAIN SPECIFIED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------

AND STATEMENTS OF OPERATING INCOME
-----------------------------------

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION:
----------------------

These statements have been prepared in contemplation of the sale of the Titan
Applications Group ("Applications") of The Titan Corporation, a public
corporation. Refer to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for
additional information regarding The Titan Corporation. The statement of
certain specified assets and liabilities and statements of operating income
reflect the assets and liabilities and results of operation of Applications, as
defined by management. The contracts upon which historical results are based
may differ from those which will be transferred upon the sale of Applications.
Applications is an operating group of The Titan Corporation and allocation of
administrative and corporate expenses have been included in the results of
operations. The liability for these services is included in Titan Corporate
Equity in Titan Applications Group. All other significant intergroup
transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Applications is an operating group of The Titan Corporation and is dependent on
administrative support from The Titan Corporation. This presentation is not
intended to and does not portray a stand-alone operating group.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
-------------------------------------------

Revenue Recognition
- - -------------------

Applications' revenues are derived from products manufactured and services
performed under cost-reimbursable contracts (70% of revenues for the nine month
period ended October 1, 1993 and 53%, 65% and 91% for the years ended December
31, 1992, 1991, and 1990 , respectively), fixed-price contracts (29% of revenues
for the nine month period ended December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively)
and time and materials contracts (1% for the nine month period ended October 1,
1993 and 0%, 3%, and 1% for the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990,
respectively). Revenues are generally recognized using the percentage-of-
completion method. Estimated contract losses are fully charged to operations
when identified by operating management.

Property and Equipment
- - ----------------------

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the
straight-line method, with estimated useful lives ranging from three to five
years for office equipment and furniture and fixtures.

8
<PAGE>

Income Taxes
- - ------------

No provision for income taxes has been made in these statements as Applications
is part of The Titan Corporation which has elected not to have a tax sharing
allocation to its groups.

3. OTHER FINANCIAL DATA:
---------------------

Unbilled Accounts Receivable
- - ----------------------------

Unbilled accounts receivable represent work-in-process which will be billed in
accordance with contract terms and delivery schedules. Also included in
unbilled accounts receivable are amounts billable upon final execution of
contracts, contract completion, milestones or completion of rate negotiations.
Substantially all unbilled receivables at October 1, 1993 are expected to be
collected within one year. Revenues have been recorded for performance on
certain U.S. government contracts based on actual rates. These rates are
subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Management does not
anticipate any material variance from these rates upon final settlement.

Amounts included in unbilled accounts receivable are as follows:

<TABLE>

<S> <C>
Billable $2,757,391
Retentions 114,226
Milestones 88,733
Other 15,666
----------

Total unbilled accounts receivable $2,976,016
==========

Accrued Liabilities
- - -------------------

Amounts included in accrued liabilities are as follows:

Accrued salaries $ 244,532
Accrued vacation 449,523
Accrued bonus 187,050
Other payroll liabilities 86,076
Other accrued liabilities 37,191
----------

$1,004,372
==========
</TABLE> 

Intracompany Transactions/Related Parties
- - -----------------------------------------

The Titan Corporation has historically provided a substantial portion of the
general and administrative services for Applications. General and
administrative costs are allocated to Applications from the Titan Corporation.
The general and administrative services provided by the Titan Corporation may
not be available at the same rates upon sale of Applications.

<PAGE>

Applications serves as the prime or the subcontractor on certain contracts with
other divisions of The Titan Corporation. Fees on intracompany contracts were
not material. These contracts may not be available or may not be available
under similar terms in the future. Intracompany contract activity is as
follows.

4. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
------------------------------

The Titan Corporation and Applications are subject to contract award protests,
disputes and litigation in the normal course of business. In management's
opinion, the resolution of existing protests, disputes and litigation will not
result in any material impact on the reported results in the accompanying
statements.

Rental expense for the nine-months ending October 1, 1993, and the years ended
December 31, 1992, 1991 and 1990, under operating lease arrangements,
principally facilities leases, was $89,000, $101,000, $90,000 and $48,000,
respectively. These leases generally include renewal options and require
minimum payments as follows. These future minimum payments do not include
immaterial costs for Titan Corporation space which Applications occupies.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 1994
gives effect to the acquisition of the Titan Applications Group by Cubic

unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended
September 30, 1993 and six months ended March 31, 1994, give effect to the
acquisition as if it had occurred on October 1, 1992. The proforma financial

financial statements of both entities for the six month period ended March 31,
1994.

The Statement of Operating Income of Titan Applications Group for the period
October 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993 is included in both the pro forma

These pro forma financial statements may not be indicative of the results that
actually would have occurred if the acquisition had taken place on the dates
