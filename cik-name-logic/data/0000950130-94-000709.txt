ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS
------- ------------------------------------

Effective April 22, 1994, United Water Resources Inc. ("UWR") and GWC
Corporation ("GWC") merged, with UWR as the surviving corporation. On the
date of the Merger of GWC with and into UWR (the "Merger"), all shares of
GWC Common Stock were converted into the right to receive 1.2 shares of UWR
Common Stock for 70% of such stock and either 1.2 shares of UWR 5%
Preference Stock or cash for the remaining 30% of such stock. The newly
issued UWR Common Stock was valued at $13.25 per share, the price of the
UWR Common Stock at the time of the Merger. The UWR 5% Preference Stock
has a liquidation value of $13.794 per share, which is equal to the average
closing price of the UWR Common Stock over a predetermined 20-day period
ending prior to the date of the Merger. The amount of cash receivable in
the Merger per share of GWC Common Stock was equal to 1.2 times that same
20-day average trading price of the UWR Common Stock. In addition, at the
time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of GWC 7 5/8%
Preferred Stock was converted into the right to receive one fully paid non-
assessable share of UWR 7 5/8% Preferred Stock with equal stated dividends
and substantially similar rights, privileges, qualifications and
restrictions.

Prior to the Merger, Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc. ("LAH"), a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lyonnaise Des Eaux-Dumez, a
French societe anonyme, owned approximately 81.9% of GWC's Common Stock,
and the remaining 18.1% of the GWC Common Stock was publicly traded. On
the date of the Merger, LAH converted 70% of its shares of GWC Common Stock
into UWR Common Stock and the remainder of its shares of GWC Common Stock
into UWR 5% Preference Stock.

Immediately after the Merger, LAH owned approximately 25.4% of the issued
and outstanding UWR Common Stock and approximately 97.7% of the issued and
outstanding UWR 5% Preference Stock.

The Merger was effected pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated September 15, 1993, between UWR and GWC. At special
meetings held on March 10, 1994, the stockholders of UWR and GWC approved
the Merger.

A copy of a press release, dated April 22, 1994, announcing that UWR and
GWC had completed the Merger is filed herewith as Exhibit 5(i) and is
incorporated herein by reference.

policy.

(B) Reflects Goodwill equal to the excess of the purchase price paid over
the fair market value of the net assets of GWC. The purchase price

J).

(N) Reflects reduced income tax expense, using a statutory rate of 35%,
related to incremental operating expenses and interest expense (See

UNITED WATER RESOURCES MERGES WITH GWC CORPORATION

AND BECOMES SECOND LARGEST U.S. WATER UTILITY

General Waterworks Corporation now a United Water subsidiary

HARRINGTON PARK, NJ, April 22, 1994--United Water Resources (NYSE:UWR)
announced that it has completed its merger with GWC Corporation
(NASDAQ:GWCC), parent company of General Waterworks Corporation. United
Water is now the second largest investor-owned water utility in the
country, serving more than two million people in 14 states.

At the closing, GWC merged into United Water and General Waterworks
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Water. The transaction consists
of 9,295,860 new shares of United Water common stock; 3,340,698 new shares
of United Water 5% convertible preference stock; and $8.9 million cash.

Robert A. Gerber, chairman, and Donald L. Correll, president and chief
executive officer of United Water Resources, continue to serve in these
capacities in the merged company. Frank J. Pizzitola, former chairman and
president of GWC Corporation, has become an advisory director of United
Water. Ronald S. Dungan continues as president of General Waterworks.

"United Water is growing--and now we have a national presence," said
Donald L. Correll, president and chief executive officer of United Water
Resources. "By concluding one of the largest single transactions in the
history of the water industry, we've doubled our size and propelled our
company into the fast track for future growth.

"We welcome our new customers and pledge to earn their recognition as
a company that provides premier services and products," Correll said. "And
with more locations in more states we're better positioned to build on our
strengths and pursue our strategy to expand our core utility business and
enhance shareholder value. We are exceptionally well poised to help
municipal and smaller water systems meet the challenges of increasing water
quality regulations through acquisitions, contract services and public-
private partnerships."

Ronald S. Dungan, president of General Waterworks said, "United Water
Resources has a leading reputation in our industry and we look forward to
pursuing growth opportunities as part of the company."

According to the terms of the merger, GWC shareholders converted 70%
of their GWC share ownership into United Water common stock at a ratio of
1.2 shares of United Water to 1 share of GWC. The minority shareholders
elected to take their remaining shares in (i) cash equal to $13.794 (the
specified average trading price of United Water common stock) multiplied by
the product of their GWC shares and 1.2 or (ii) an equivalent value of
United Water 5% convertible preference stock, or (iii) a combination of
cash and 5% convertible preference stock.

Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, a French multi-national corporation and one
of the world's largest water purveyors, converted 70% of its majority
holding in GWC for approximately 25% of United Water's
<PAGE>

common stock and received United Water 5% convertible preference stock for
the remaining 30% of its GWC shares. Lyonnaise also entered into a 12-year
Governance Agreement with United Water which will govern the relationship
of the parties.

The board of United Water Resources increased from 11 members to 15.
At the company's June 2, 1994 annual meeting, shareholders will vote on the
election of four nominees of Lyonnaise--Edward E. Barr, president and chief
executive officer of Sun Chemical Corporation, Fort Lee, New Jersey; Allan
R. Dragone, a self-employed businessman and a director of American Cyanamid
Company, Purina Mills, Inc. and Wellman, Inc.; Philippe Brongniart,
executive vice president of Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez; and Jacques F. Petry,
president of international water operations for Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez.

United Water, headquartered in Harrington Park, New Jersey, is a
holding company engaged in water-related businesses and real estate. Its
principal utility subsidiaries, Hackensack Water Company, Spring Valley
Water Company and the 20 water and wastewater utilities operated by General
Waterworks serve over two million people in 14 states. United Water's real
estate subsidiary, Rivervale Realty Company, owns developable land and
several office buildings in the New York metropolitan area. Other
subsidiaries provide environmental testing and construct and operate small
water and sewer utilities. United Water's combined work force consists of
over 1,400 employees.

United Water has paid continuous cash dividends on common stock since
