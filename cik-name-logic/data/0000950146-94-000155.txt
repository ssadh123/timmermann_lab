RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

August 19, 1994

MGI PROPERTIES ("MGI")
REPORTS $2,700,000 GAIN ON
SALE OF INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS

BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS . . . MGI Properties, ("MGI") (NYSE:MGI),
announced today it has sold its Minneapolis, Minnesota industrial properties
for $14,925,000. MGI acquired the properties in 1987 and for financial
reporting purposes will recognize a gain of $2,700,000, or $.24 per share, in
the quarter ending August 31, 1994. The purchaser was a national pension
advisor. These seven buildings, aggregating 626,000 square feet, secured a
$10,240,000 mortgage loan that was assumed by the buyer.

W. Pearce Coues, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, stated that at the
$14,925,000 sale price, the yield on these properties, based on actual 1993
operations, was less than 10%. MGI intends to reinvest the net proceeds from
the sale in properties that it believes will provide greater income growth and
capital appreciation opportunities. Mr. Coues stated that MGI anticipates
reinvesting these funds through a tax deferred exchange.
