ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On November 1, 1994, Ferrellgas, Inc. ("Ferrellgas"), the General
Partner of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (the "Master Partnership") and Ferrellgas,
L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), consummated its previously announced
purchase of all of the capital stock of Vision Energy Resources, Inc. ("Vision")
from Bell Atlantic Enterprises International, Inc. for a cash purchase price of
$45 million. Ferrellgas borrowed all of the funds for such purchase from Bank
of America National Trust & Savings Association ("BofA" and the "BofA
Acquisition Loan"). Ferrellgas believes that Vision is the sixteenth largest
retail marketer of propane in the United States, based on gallons sold, with 33
retail outlets and other facilities located in the states of Florida, Michigan,
Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

Immediately following the closing of the purchase of Vision,
Ferrellgas (i) caused Vision and each of its subsidiaries to be merged into
Ferrellgas (except for a trucking subsidiary which dividended substantially all
of its assets to Ferrellgas) and (ii) transferred all of the assets of Vision
and its subsidiaries to the Operating Partnership. In exchange, the Operating
Partnership assumed substantially all of the liabilities, whether known or
unknown, associated with Vision and its subsidiaries and their propane business
(excluding income tax liabilities). In consideration of the retention by
Ferrellgas of the Vision income tax liabilities, the Master Partnership issued
138,392 Common Units to Ferrellgas. The liabilities assumed by the Operating
Partnership included the obligations of Ferrellgas under the BofA Acquisition
Loan. Immediately following the transfer of assets and related transactions
described above, the Operating Partnership repaid the BofA Acquisition Loan with
funds borrowed under the Operating Partnership's existing credit facility with
BofA.

purchase the Shares on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing (hereinafter defined)
Seller agrees to sell, transfer, assign,

3
<PAGE>

convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase, acquire and accept
from Seller, all of the Shares.

2.2 Purchase Price. The consideration for the Shares shall be
$45.0 million, subject to adjustment after Closing pursuant to Sections 2.4 and
6.5 hereof ("Purchase Price"). Buyer will pay the amount of $45.0 million to
Seller at the Closing by bank wire transfer in immediately available funds to
one or more accounts, all as designated in writing by Seller to Buyer not less
than three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date (hereinafter defined).

2.3 Closing. The consummation of the purchase and sale of the
Shares ("Closing") shall be held at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on the later to
occur of November 1, 1994 (subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Article 7) or the fifth Business Day after all conditions to the
respective obligations of the parties set forth in Article 7 hereof (other than
those that are intended to be satisfied only at the Closing) have been
satisfied, at the offices of Seller, 1717 Arch Street, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, or at such other time, date and place as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the parties (such date and time being referred to herein as the "Closing
Date"). Each party hereto agrees to use its best efforts promptly to satisfy
the conditions to Closing to be satisfied by it in order to expedite the
Closing.

2.4 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later
than sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Seller an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of VER and the
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, without giving effect to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (other than satisfaction of the
indebtedness of VER and the Subsidiaries to Bell Atlantic Financial Services,
Inc.) and any financing of such transactions arranged by Buyer ("Closing Date
Balance Sheet"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP, consistent with the application thereof in the preparation of the
Balance Sheets (as defined in Section 3.9 hereof).

(b) Subject to the remainder of this subsection (b), within forty (40)
Business Days after delivery to Seller of the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
whichever of the following is applicable shall occur: (i) if Net Working Capital
as shown by the Closing Date Balance Sheet exceeds the Target Amount
(hereinafter defined), Buyer shall pay to Seller in immediately available funds
a sum equal to the amount, if any, by which Net Working Capital as shown by the
Closing Date Balance Sheet exceeds the sum of the Target Amount and the Margin
Amount (hereinafter defined), with interest thereon as hereinafter described, or
(ii) if the Target Amount exceeds Net Working Capital as shown by the Closing
Date Balance Sheet, Seller shall pay to Buyer in immediately available

4
<PAGE>

funds a sum equal to the amount, if any, by which Net Working Capital as shown
by the Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than the difference between the Target
Amount and the Margin Amount, with interest thereon as hereinafter described.
In either case, the amount due shall include interest on such excess or
deficiency for the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment
calculated at the rate per annum, compounded semiannually, equal to the rate of
interest announced by Bank as its prime rate or base rate in effect on the
Closing Date. If Seller in good faith disagrees with any amounts reflected in
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, then Seller shall deliver notice of such
disagreement ("Notice of Disagreement") to Buyer within thirty (30) Business
Days after delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet to Seller, which Notice of
Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for Buyer's
disagreement and Seller's calculation of Net Working Capital. If Seller has not
delivered to Buyer a Notice of Disagreement by the day specified in the next
preceding sentence, then the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be final and
binding upon Seller and Buyer as of the next following day. Upon delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement, payment of any amount payable by Seller or Buyer
pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection (b) shall be delayed, with
interest accruing thereon as stated above, until all disagreements between
Seller and Buyer relating to the Closing Date Balance Sheet have been resolved
as provided in this subsection (b), and upon such resolution such payment shall
be made by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, within five (5) Business Days
thereafter. If Seller delivers a Notice of Disagreement to Buyer, Seller and
Buyer shall attempt to resolve all disagreements between them relating to the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, but if they are not able to do so within thirty (30)
Business Days after the date of delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, then
within five (5) Business Days thereafter Seller and Buyer shall select a
nationally recognized accounting firm with no material relationship with Buyer,
Seller or any of their Affiliates ("Accounting Referee") and mutually acceptable
to Buyer and Seller to determine, as between either Buyer's calculation or
Seller's calculation of Net Working Capital, which is more nearly correct and to
establish such calculation as the calculation for purposes of the Purchase Price
adjustment herein. The Accounting Referee must choose either Seller's
calculation or Buyer's calculation of Net Working Capital. Within sixty (60)
days after Buyer and Seller select the Accounting Referee, the Accounting
Referee shall deliver its written determination to Buyer and Seller, which
determination, absent bad faith or manifest fraud, shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon Seller and Buyer. The scope of the Accounting Referee's
engagement shall not require an audit of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
shall be limited to resolution of those items of disagreement that are set forth
in the Notice of Disagreement and that Seller and Buyer have not previously
resolved, but only as they affect the calculation of Net Working Capital. The
fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee, if any, will be shared
equally by Seller and Buyer.

<PAGE>

(c) As used in this Section 2.4, the following terms shall
have the meanings set forth below.

(i) "Target Amount" shall mean an amount equal to
$4,528,000.

(ii) "Margin Amount" shall mean $450,000.

authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller.

3.2 Validity and Execution of Agreement. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Seller and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Buyer, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
Seller enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the
qualification that enforcement of the rights and remedies created hereby is
subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws

3.3 Governmental Consents. Except (i) for applicable
requirements of the HSR Act, (ii) any consent, action or filing required solely

Agreement to be enforceable against Buyer or to provide for the funding of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Buyer and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Seller,
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer
in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualification that enforcement of
the rights and remedies created hereby is subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting the
rights and remedies of creditors, and (ii) general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law).

Agreement nor the performance of the transactions contemplated herein by Buyer
will (i) violate or conflict with any of the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-Laws of Buyer; (ii) violate or constitute a default, or

<PAGE>

provision of law, statute, rule or regulation, applicable to Buyer, except, with
respect to clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) hereof, for violations, defaults or
breaches which in the aggregate are not material to Buyer and would not
materially impair its ability to perform any of its obligations hereunder.

4.4 Broker's or Finder's Fees. Any fees or expenses incurred by
Buyer or any of its affiliates payable with respect to any person for acting as
broker, finder or in any other similar capacity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of

"Securities Act"), or under any state or foreign securities laws. Buyer is not
an underwriter, as such term is defined under the Securities Act, and Buyer is
purchasing the Shares solely for investment with no present intention to
distribute any of the Shares to any person.

4.6 Litigation. There is no lawsuit or legal, administrative or
regulatory proceeding or investigation pending or, to the best knowledge of
Buyer, threatened against Buyer which challenges the legality of this Agreement

this Agreement are not in any way contingent upon its obtaining financing for
its obligations hereunder. Buyer has sufficient capital resources presently
available to it, and usable for the transactions contemplated hereby, in order

resources available at Closing.

4.8 Solvency of VER. After giving effect to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and any financing of this transaction
arranged by Buyer, VER and the Subsidiaries will be Solvent (hereinafter
defined). For purposes of this Section 4.8 and for purposes of the condition
precedent set forth in Section 7.3(c) hereof, the term "Solvent" means for VER
and the Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) that (i) the fair value (on a
going concern basis) of their assets exceeds the total amount of their
liabilities, including contingent liabilities, (ii) the present fair salable
value of their assets is not less than the amount that will be required to pay
the probable liability on their debts as they become absolute and matured, (iii)
they are able to realize on their assets and pay their debts and other
liabilities, contingent obligations and other commitments as they mature in the
normal course of business, (iv) Buyer does not intend for them to, and does not
believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay
as such debts and liabilities mature, and (v) they are not engaged in a
businesses or

capital after giving due consideration to the prevailing practice in the
industries in which they are engaged. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
in computing the amount of contingent liabilities at any time, such liabilities
shall be computed at the amount which, in light of all the facts and
circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably
be expected to become an actual or matured liability. Seller understands that,
in making this representation and warranty, Buyer has relied and will rely upon
Seller's representations and warranties in Article 3 hereof (including the
Disclosure Schedule and the certificate(s) delivered by Seller pursuant to
Section 7.1 hereof insofar as the Disclosure Schedule and such certificate
relate to such representations and warranties) or elsewhere in this Agreement,

ARTICLE 9
GENERAL SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Survival of Representations.

(a) Except (i) as otherwise provided in Article 10 hereof with respect
to Tax matters; and (ii) for all representations and warranties made pursuant to
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 (which shall never expire), the representations
and warranties made by Seller in Article 3 hereof (including the Disclosure
Schedule and the certificate delivered in accordance with Section 7.1 hereof,
insofar as the Disclosure Schedule and such certificate relate to such
representations and warranties) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall survive
until the second anniversary of the Closing (for purposes of this Article 9,
"Cut-Off Date"). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary (other than the provisions of Section 9.1(a)(ii) above and Article 10
hereof), no claim for incorrect representation or breach of warranty under this
Agreement and no claim for indemnification under Section 9.2(iii) may be
brought, and no arbitration or litigation with respect thereto commenced, with
respect to any representation or warranty, or the portions of the Disclosure
Schedule and any certificate relating to such representation or warranty or with
respect to any failure or deficiency described in Section 9.2(iii), and Seller
shall have no obligation with respect thereto, unless written notice thereof
specifying with particularity the incorrect representation or breach of warranty
claimed shall have been delivered to Seller before the Cut-off Date. Nothing in
the foregoing sentence shall prevent or limit any claims or actions commenced
after the Cut-off Date for matters for which notice was delivered prior to the
Cut-off Date.

(b) Except (i) as otherwise provided in Article 10 hereof with respect
to Tax matters; and (ii) for all representations and warranties made pursuant to
Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5 (which shall never expire), the representations and
warranties made by

31
<PAGE>

Buyer in Article 4 hereof (including the certificates delivered in accordance
with Section 7.1 hereof insofar as such certificates relate to such
representations and warranties) shall survive until the Cut-Off Date.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (other than the
provisions of Section 9.1(b)(ii) above and Article 10 hereof), no claim for
incorrect representation or breach of warranty under this Agreement may be
brought, and no arbitration or litigation with respect thereto commenced, with
respect to any representation or warranty and any certificate relating to such
representation or warranty, and Buyer shall have no obligation with respect
thereto, unless written notice thereof specifying with particularity the
incorrect representation or breach of warranty claimed shall have been delivered
to Buyer before the Cut-Off Date. Nothing in the foregoing sentence shall
prevent or limit any claims or actions commenced after the Cut-off Date for
matters for which notice was delivered prior to the Cut-off Date.

9.2 Indemnification by Seller. Except as otherwise limited by
this Article 9 and except with respect to Tax matters governed by Article 10
hereof, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall assume the defense of, and
indemnify and hold Buyer, Buyer's affiliates and its directors, officers and
employees (collectively, the "Buyer Group") harmless from, any and all losses,
damages, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and
reasonable outside attorneys and accountants fees) (hereinafter individually a
"Loss" and collectively, "Losses") suffered or incurred by any member of the
Buyer Group that arise out of or result from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty by VER or Seller contained in this Agreement, or the
portions of the Disclosure Schedule and any certificate relating to such
representation and warranty; (ii) a breach of any other covenant or agreement by
Seller contained in this Agreement; or (iii) prior to the Closing Date: (A) the
failure of VER or the Subsidiaries to have and be in compliance with any
Registration, (B) the failure by VER or the Subsidiaries to comply with any Laws
relating to the business of VER or the Subsidiaries; or (C) the failure of any
propane tank or installation to be in safe working order and in compliance with
applicable Laws and industry standards, provided that no indemnification shall
be available with respect to any such failure that is continued as a course of
business by Buyer after the Closing Date, and provided further, however, such
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless shall not apply unless Buyer shall
have given timely written notice to Seller of such failure in accordance with
Sections 9.1 and 9.5 hereof.

9.3 Indemnification by Buyer.

(a) Except as otherwise limited by this Article 9 and except with
respect to Tax matters governed by Article 10, Buyer shall assume the defense
of, and indemnify and hold Seller, Seller's affiliates and its directors,
officers and employees (for purposes of this Article 9, collectively, the
"Seller Group")

32
<PAGE>

harmless from, any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any member of the
Seller Group after the Closing Date that relate to, or arise out of or in
connection with (i) the operation of the assets or businesses of, conduct of
employees of (including former employees), or ownership of, VER or the
Subsidiaries; (ii) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
contained in Article 4 hereof; provided, however, such obligation to indemnify
and hold harmless shall not apply unless Seller shall have given timely written
notice to Buyer of such breach of representation or warranty in accordance with
Sections 9.1 and 9.5 hereof; and (iii) the breach of any other covenant or
agreement by Buyer contained in this Agreement.

(b) The Seller Group's rights to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 9.3 shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 9.4, 9.5 and 9.7 as
if they had been restated in this Section 9.3 with references to "Buyer Group"
changed to "Seller Group" and references to "Seller" changed to "Buyer."

9.4 Recoveries. The amount of any payment with respect to a
Loss for which any member of the Buyer Group shall be entitled to
indemnification under this Article 9 shall be limited as follows: (i) the extent
to which the aggregate sum of any payments constituting the Loss which are not
required to be made to a third party for more than twelve (12) months following
the date upon which the amount and Seller's responsibility therefor is
determined, shall be discounted to its present value, with such present value
being computed as of the date of such determination by using a discount rate,
compounded annually, equal to the rate of interest then announced by Bank as its
prime or base rate; provided, however, that the indemnified member of the Buyer
Group may elect instead to have such payments constituting the Loss paid by
Seller as they become due; (ii) there shall be netted from such payment the
amount of any insurance proceeds or other cash receipts paid to the Buyer Group
as an offset against such Loss (and no right of subrogation shall accrue
hereunder to any insurer); and (iii) there shall be netted from such payment the
amount paid to the Buyer Group pursuant to any indemnification from any
unrelated party with respect to such Loss.

9.5 Claims.

(a) Buyer shall promptly give Seller written notice of any matter
which any member of the Buyer Group has determined has given or could give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Article 9 stating the amount of the
Loss, if known, and the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable
particularity and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in
respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed. The obligations and
liabilities of Seller under this Article 9 with respect to Losses arising from
claims of any third party (including, without limitation, claims by any
Governmental Authority) that are subject to the indemnification provided for in

33
<PAGE>

this Article 9 ("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and be contingent
upon the additional terms and conditions set forth in subsection (b) below.

(b) If any member of the Buyer Group shall receive notice of any Third
Party Claim, Buyer shall give Seller prompt written notice thereof and shall
permit Seller, at its option, to participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim by counsel of Seller's own choosing and at Seller's own expense. If
Seller acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the member of the
Buyer Group under this Article 9 against any Loss that may result from such
Third Party Claim (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.6 hereof,
if applicable), then Seller shall be entitled, at its option, to assume and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel
of its choice, if it gives prompt written notice of its intention to do so to
Buyer. However, if the member of the Buyer Group elects not to defend against
such Third Party Claim, then Buyer shall promptly so notify Seller and Seller
shall thereupon again be entitled, at its option, to assume and control the
defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its
choice; provided, however, that in such circumstances Seller shall not be
required to acknowledge its obligation to indemnify the member of the Buyer
Group in respect of such Third Party Claim. If Seller exercises its right to
undertake the defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above,
Buyer shall cooperate with Seller and cause the other members of the Buyer Group
to cooperate with Seller in such defense and make available to Seller, at
Seller's expense, all pertinent records, materials and information in its
possession or under its control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by
Seller. Similarly, if Buyer is conducting the defense against any such Third
Party Claim, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and cause the other members of
the Seller Group to cooperate in such defense and make available to Buyer, at
Buyer's expense, all such records, materials and information in its possession
or under its control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by Buyer.
Seller may not settle any Third Party Claim without the written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(c) Seller shall be subrogated to any and all defenses, claims or set
offs which any member of the Buyer Group asserted or could have asserted against
the third party making a Third Party Claim. Buyer shall execute and deliver and
cause the other members of the Buyer Group to execute and deliver to Seller such
documents as may be necessary to establish by way of subrogation the ability and
right of Seller to assert such defenses, claims or setoffs against any third
party making a Third Party Claim.

(d) In addition to any other remedy, Buyer shall be entitled, but
shall not be obligated, to offset all such claims for Losses against any
obligation of Buyer to Seller now or hereafter existing.

34
<PAGE>

9.6 Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the obligations of Seller to provide
indemnification under this Agreement shall be subject to the following
limitations (in addition to the limitations set forth in Article 10 hereof):

(a) Seller shall have no liability, nor be subject to any claim under
this Agreement, with respect to any inaccuracy in, or incompleteness of, or any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or any failure or deficiency of the type described in Section 9.2(iii)
unless and until the amount of Losses suffered or sustained by the Buyer Group
exceeds $2,000,000 ("Basket Amount") in the aggregate. Seller shall have no
liability, nor be subject to any claim under this Agreement, with respect to any
inaccuracy in or incompleteness of, or any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any failure or
deficiency of the type described in Section 9.2(iii) unless and until the amount
of Losses suffered or sustained by the Buyer Group resulting from such
inaccuracy, incompleteness, breach or failure exceeds $10,000 ("Per Claim
Threshold"). Subject to the Per Claim Threshold, the Buyer Group shall be
entitled to receive indemnity payments (subject, however, to the other
provisions of this Article 9 or Article 10 hereof, as applicable) in the
aggregate amount of all Losses including the Basket Amount. The Per Claim
Threshold and the Basket Amount shall not apply to Seller's obligations pursuant
to Sections 6.4 and 6.5.

(b) In no event shall Seller's direct out-of-pocket expenses and costs
paid in respect of the Losses and amounts paid pursuant to Article 10 exceed
$25,000,000 (the "Indemnification Cap").

(c) If Seller is required to indemnify any member of the Buyer Group
pursuant to this Article 9 or Article 10 hereof, Seller shall be responsible to
indemnify such member only to the extent of actual costs or expenses incurred on
a dollar-for-dollar basis. IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, nor shall there be double counting of any
item of Loss, expense, cost or offset.

9.7 Indemnification as Exclusive Remedy. Except where
indemnification is expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the
indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be the sole and exclusive post-Closing remedy available, under contract,
tort or any other legal theory, to Buyer for any breach of any representation or
warranty by or on behalf of Seller contained in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 10
TAX MATTERS

10.1 Consolidated Returns. Seller covenants that for federal income
Tax purposes, VER and the Subsidiaries have been treated and will be treated as
members of the affiliated group (as defined in Section 1504 of the Code) of
corporations of which Bell Atlantic Corporation is the common parent (the "Bell
Atlantic Group") for all periods beginning on April 30, 1992, and ending on or
before the Closing Date ("Consolidated Return Periods"). The Bell Atlantic
Group has included and will include the income of VER and the Subsidiaries
(including any deferred income triggered into income by Treasury Regulation (S)
1.1502-13 and Treasury Regulation (S) 1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts
taken into income under Treasury Regulation (S) 1.1502-19) on the Bell Atlantic
Group consolidated federal income Tax returns for all Consolidated Return
Periods and has paid or will pay any federal income Taxes attributable to such
income.

10.2 Liability for Taxes.

(a) Seller shall be liable for (1) any Taxes imposed on or incurred
by VER or any of the Subsidiaries for any taxable period (the "Pre-Closing
Period") ending on or before the Closing Date, excluding (i) any Taxes of VER or
any of the Subsidiaries to the extent such Taxes have been appropriately
accrued, reflected or adequately reserved for (other than amounts for deferred
taxes) as a current liability on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, (ii) any Taxes
attributable to events occurring or income recognized after the Closing Date and
(iii) any Taxes caused by, or arising from, an actual or deemed election under
Section 338 of the Code (including, without limitation, an actual or deemed
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code) with respect to the purchase of
the Shares, (2) any federal income Taxes imposed on VER or any of the
Subsidiaries pursuant to Treasury Regulation (S) 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law) with respect to the taxable income of
any member of the Bell Atlantic Group (other than VER or the Subsidiaries) or
any other person for any taxable period, as transferee or successor, by contract
or otherwise, and (3) any capital gains, income, gross receipts, excise,
transfer or similar Tax liabilities arising from the sale of the Shares. The
liability for foreign, state or local income Taxes imposed on or incurred by VER
or the Subsidiaries for any taxable period which begins on or before the Closing
Date and ends after the Closing Date shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer
in the same manner as taxable income is reported for that taxable period for
federal income tax purposes. In the case of ad valorem, franchise (other than
such taxes that are a substitute for income taxes) and similar taxes that are
imposed for a taxable period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date,
the portion attributable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be determined by
prorating such Taxes for the taxable period on a daily basis.

36

<PAGE>

(b) Buyer shall be liable for (1) any Taxes imposed on or incurred by
any member of the Bell Atlantic Group caused by, or arising from, an actual or
deemed election under Section 338 of the Code (including, without limitation, an
actual or deemed election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code) with respect to
the purchase of the Shares, (2) any Taxes imposed on or incurred by VER or the
Subsidiaries for any taxable period (the "Post-Closing Period") beginning after
the Closing Date, and (3) any foreign, state or local Taxes imposed on or
incurred by VER or the Subsidiaries which are not the liability of Seller
pursuant to Section 10.2(a).

(c) Each party shall be entitled to any refunds (whether by payment,
credit, offset or otherwise) in respect to any Taxes for which such party is
liable under this Article 10; provided, however, that any refund (or comparable
benefit resulting from a reduction of Tax liability) arising out of the
carryback of a loss or credit incurred by VER or the Subsidiaries in a Post-
Closing Period which is carried back to a Pre-Closing Period shall be the
property of Buyer. Each party hereto and its affiliates shall cooperate with
the other party and its affiliates in order to permit the party entitled to the
refund to take all necessary steps to claim any such refund. Any such refund
received after the Closing by either party or its affiliates to which the other
party is entitled shall be paid to such other party within thirty days after its
receipt.

(d) Seller and Buyer agree that, for purposes of all required returns
or reports with respect to Taxes, the amount of the unused minimum tax credit,
if any, under Section 53 of the Code attributable to VER and the Subsidiaries
that may be carried forward to taxable periods ending after the Closing Date
shall, unless otherwise required by law or regulations, be determined in
accordance with the principles of Treasury Regulation (S) 1.1502-79, by
comparing the separate unused minimum tax credit carryforward of VER and the
Subsidiaries with the sum of the separate unused minimum tax credit
carryforwards of all members of the Bell Atlantic Group that have unused minimum
tax credits.

(e) The Bell Atlantic Group will not elect to retain any net operating
loss carryovers or capital loss carryovers of VER or any of the Subsidiaries
under Proposed Treasury Regulation (S) 1.1502-20(g) or any similar provision of
Law.

10.3 Indemnification for Taxes.

(a) Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer against and agrees to pay all
Taxes imposed and all costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
litigation costs and attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses incurred (all
herein referred to as "Tax Losses") as a result of:

37
<PAGE>

(1) Any liability for or any claim, notice of deficiency or assessment
by any Government Authority for any Taxes imposed on Buyer and its affiliates,
including VER and the Subsidiaries, that are the responsibility of Seller
pursuant to Section 10.2(a); and

(2) Any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty or obligation of
Seller set forth in Section 3.22 or this Article 10; provided, however, that
Seller's indemnity obligation for any misrepresentation or breach of any
warranty regarding the amount of any Loss Carryovers of VER or any of the
Subsidiaries shall be reduced to the extent of any tax benefits realized by
Buyer and its affiliates, including VER and the Subsidiaries, as a result of any
corresponding increase in the basis of the assets of VER and the Subsidiaries
attributable to any reduction in the amount of such Loss Carryovers.

(b) Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller against all Tax Losses resulting
from:

(1) Any liability for or any claim, notice of deficiency or assessment
by any Government Authority for any Taxes imposed on Seller and its affiliates
that are the responsibility of Buyer under Section 10.2(b); and

(2) Any breach of any obligation of Buyer set forth in this Article
10.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Article 10, any amount to
which a party is entitled under this Article 10 shall be promptly paid to such
party by the party obligated to make such payment following written notice to
the party so obligated that the Taxes to which such amount relates have been
paid or incurred and that provides details supporting the calculation of such
amount; provided, however, that no payment of any such amount is required to be
made by Seller during any period when Seller is exercising its contest rights
under Section 10.6.

(d) Seller's liability for indemnification pursuant to Section
10.3(a)(2) shall be subject to the Per Claim Threshold requirements of Section
9.6(a) and shall be included in and subject to the Indemnification Cap
requirements of Section 9.6(b).

10.4 Tax Returns.

(a) Buyer shall prepare, or cause VER and the Subsidiaries to prepare,
and submit to Seller all returns or reports of VER and the Subsidiaries (and any
partnerships in which VER or any of the Subsidiaries owns an interest and has
responsibility for preparing and filing returns or reports) for Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Period and for which the due date (with regard to waivers or
extensions) of any such return or report is subsequent to the Closing Date. Any
such return or report shall be

38

<PAGE>

prepared on a basis consistent with returns and reports prepared with respect to
VER and the Subsidiaries for prior taxable periods unless otherwise required by
applicable law or regulations and shall be submitted to Seller not later than
(i) in the case of any federal or state income tax return, ninety days after the
Closing Date and (ii) in the case of any other return or report, thirty days
before the due date (with regard to waivers or extensions) of such return or
report. Seller is responsible for filing or causing to be filed with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any such returns or reports and for
preparing and filing with the appropriate Governmental Authorities any other
returns or reports of VER or any of the Subsidiaries (including returns or
reports for any partnership referred to above) for Taxes for Pre-Closing
Periods. Buyer and its affiliates, including VER and the Subsidiaries, shall
cooperate with Seller and its affiliates and shall make available all necessary
records and timely take all action necessary to allow Seller and its affiliates
to file, or prepare and file, as the case may be, the returns and reports
described in this paragraph (including, without limitation, providing or causing
to be provided to Seller or its affiliates any powers of attorney that Seller
shall request for the purpose of filing any such return or reports).

(b) Buyer and its affiliates, including VER and the Subsidiaries, are
responsible for preparing and filing with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities all returns or reports that relate to the Taxes of VER or any of the
Subsidiaries other than those described in paragraph (a) of this Section 10.4.

10.5 Tax Allocation Arrangements. Effective as of the Closing, all
liabilities and obligations between VER and the Subsidiaries on the one hand and
Seller and its affiliates on the other hand under any tax allocation agreement
or arrangement in effect prior to the Closing shall be extinguished in full, and
any liabilities or rights existing under any such agreement or arrangement shall
cease to exist and shall no longer be enforceable. Seller and its affiliates
shall execute any documents necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 10.5.

10.6 Tax Proceedings. In the event Buyer or any of its affiliates,
including VER and the Subsidiaries, receives any written communication regarding
any pending or threatened examination, claim, adjustment or other proceeding
with respect to the liability of VER or any of the Subsidiaries for any Taxes
which Seller is or may be liable under this Article 10, Buyer shall within ten
days notify Seller in writing thereof; provided, however, that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release Seller from of its obligations under this
Article 10 except to the extent Seller or its affiliates are materially
prejudiced by such failure. As to any such Taxes for which Seller is or may be
liable under this Article 10, Seller shall at its expense control, or settle the
contest of, such examination, claim, adjustment or other proceeding, unless it
notifies Buyer in writing within ten days

39

<PAGE>

after receipt of the notice described in the immediately preceding sentence that
it desires not to do so. Buyer and its affiliates, including VER and the
Subsidiaries, shall cooperate fully with Seller in handling any such tax audit,
administrative tax proceeding, or tax litigation. Buyer will provide, or cause
to be provided to Seller or its designee, necessary authorizations, including
powers of attorney, to control any proceedings which Seller is entitled to
control pursuant to this Section 10.6. In addition, regardless of which party
is responsible for the payment of the Tax, no tax audit, administrative tax
proceeding, or tax litigation which may affect a tax return of Seller or its
affiliates for any Pre-Closing Period shall be finally concluded by Buyer or its
affiliates, including VER and the Subsidiaries, without the prior consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Further, regardless
of which party is responsible for the payment of the Tax, no tax audit,
administrative tax proceeding, or tax litigation which may effect a tax return
of Buyer and its affiliates, including VER and the Subsidiaries, for any period
ending after the Closing Date shall be finally concluded by Seller or its
affiliates without the prior consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

10.7 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The parties will
provide each other with such cooperation and information as they may reasonably
request of each other in preparing or filing any return, amended return or claim
for refund, in determining a liability or a right to refund or in conducting any
audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes imposed on the parties or its
respective affiliates. Buyer and its affiliates will preserve and retain all
returns, schedules, work papers and other documents relating to any such
returns, claims, audits or other proceedings until the expiration of the
statutory period of limitations (with regard to waivers and extensions) of the
taxable periods to which such documents relate and until the final determination
of any payments which may be required with respect to such periods under this
Agreement and shall make such documents available to representatives of Seller
and its affiliates upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, it being
understood that such representatives shall be entitled to make copies of any
such books and records as they shall deem necessary. Buyer further agrees to
permit representatives of Seller and its affiliates to meet with employees of
Buyer and its affiliates, including VER and the Subsidiaries, on a mutually
convenient basis in order to enable such representatives to obtain additional
information and explanations of any documents provided pursuant to this Section
10.7. Buyer shall make available, or cause VER or the Subsidiaries to make
available, to the representatives of Seller and its affiliates sufficient work
space and facilities (to the extent available) to perform the activities
described in the two preceding sentences. Any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 10.7 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of returns or claims for refund or in
conducting any audit or other proceeding. Each of the parties

40

<PAGE>

shall provide the cooperation and information required by this Section 10.7 at
its own expense.

10.8 Survival. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties' representations, warranties, covenants, agreements,
rights and obligations with respect to any matter covered by Section 3.22 or
this Article 10 shall survive the Closing and shall not terminate until one day
after the expiration of the statutes of limitations (including all waivers or
extensions) applicable to any liability which could arise as a result of or with
respect to such matter.

10.9 Conflict. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
this Article 10 and any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of
this Article 10 shall control.

10.10 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Solely for all Tax
purposes, any payments to or from Seller from or to Buyer pursuant to this
Article 10 shall be treated by Buyer and Seller as purchase price adjustments.

ARTICLE 11
GENERAL PROVISIONS

11.1 Expenses. Except as provided in Section 8.2(b) hereof, all fees,
commissions and other expenses incurred by Buyer, Seller or VER in connection
with the negotiation of this Agreement and in preparing to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the fees and expenses of its
respective counsel and other advisors, shall be borne by the party incurring
such fee, commission or expense. Buyer agrees that the fees and expenses of
Coopers & Lybrand in connection with the preparation of the Audited Balance
Sheet shall be paid by VER.

11.2 Execution in Counterparts; Binding Effect. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original
copy and all of which together shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become a binding agreement when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each party and delivered to the other parties.

11.3 Disclaimer. In connection with Buyer's investigation of VER and
the Subsidiaries, Buyer has received from Seller and its representatives,
including, without limitation, Colmen Capital Advisors, Inc., the Confidential
Information Memorandum (the "Memorandum") and (ii) certain projections,
forecasts and business plan information. Neither Seller nor VER and the
Subsidiaries, nor its representatives, including without limitation, Colmen
Capital Advisors, Inc., makes any express or implied representation or warranty
as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in the
Memorandum, or such projections, forecasts or plans. Buyer acknowledges that

41

<PAGE>

there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections,
forecasts and plans, that they are familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer
is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all such information so furnished to it, and that Buyer shall not
have any claim against Seller with respect thereto. Each of Seller, VER and the
Subsidiaries expressly disclaims any and all liability which may be based upon
such information, errors therein or omissions therefrom. BUYER IS ENTITLED TO
RELY SOLELY ON THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN, SELLER MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF ANY NATURE, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ALL OF WHICH ARE DISCLAIMED, AND NONE SHALL BE
IMPLIED.

11.4 Confidentiality. All information given by any party hereto to
any other party shall be considered confidential and shall be used only for the
purposes intended. Buyer has previously delivered to Seller a confidentiality
agreement dated as of June 10, 1994, the provisions of which are incorporated
herein by reference and shall continue to apply for the benefit of Seller, VER
and the Subsidiaries as if entirely set forth herein unless and until the
Closing occurs. The provisions of this Section 11.4 and of the confidentiality
agreement referenced in the preceding sentence shall remain in force and effect
notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement under Article 8 hereof.

11.5 Covenant Not To Compete.

(a) Seller acknowledges that an important part of the consideration
which Buyer will receive in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
is the goodwill of VER and the Subsidiaries and the confidential information
thereof. In order that Buyer may enjoy the benefits of such goodwill and such
confidential information, subject to subsection (b) of this Section 11.5, Seller
agrees that, for a period of five (5) from the Closing Date in the geographical
markets in which the businesses of VER and the Subsidiaries are currently
conducted, neither Seller nor any affiliate of Seller will, directly or
indirectly, alone or in association with any other person, firm, corporation or
other business organization, engage in the Vision Business (hereinafter
defined).

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Section 11.5, (i) Seller
and its Affiliates may own up to 5% of a class of equity securities of a
publicly held company engaged in the Vision Business as an investment and (ii)
Seller and its Affiliates may acquire an interest in the securities or assets of
an entity engaged in the Vision Business, and such business may thereafter
continue to operate, if such acquisition is part of a larger acquisition and
either the assets engaged in the Vision Business constitute no more that 15% of

FERRELLGAS COMPLETES PURCHASE OF
VISION ENERGY RESOURCES, INC.

LIBERTY, Mo. (November 1, 1994) - Ferrellgas, Inc., General Partner of
Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (NYSE:FGP), announced that it has completed the
purchase of Vision Energy Resources, Inc., a subsidiary of Bell Atlantic
Corporation (NYSE:BEL), at cash purchase price of approximately $45 million.
Immediately following the acquisition, Ferrellgas contributed the Vision
business to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., making the Partnership the second largest
retail propane marketer in the United States, based on retail gallons sold.

Vision Energy Resources, Inc. was the 16th largest propane retailer in the
United States, operating 33 retail propane outlets in seven states, with sales
of 99.8 million retail and wholesale gallons in 1993. The company served 54,000
residential, industrial/commercial and agricultural customers in Minnesota,
Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Michigan, Montana, Iowa and Florida.
These customers will now be served by Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.

"The acquisition of Vision Energy enhances our presence in the North Central
part of the country and enhances productivity and increases efficiencies in the
rapidly growing propane market in Florida," said James E. Ferrell, Ferrellgas
Partners, L.P. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Vision Energy Resources, Inc. was acquired by Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic
in 1992 as part of that company's acquisition of Metro Mobile CTS, Inc., which
was primarily an owner and operator of cellular systems nationwide.

Prior to this acquisition, Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., through its operating
partnership Ferrellgas, L.P. and General Partner Ferrellgas, Inc., had been the
third largest retail marketer of propane in the United States, with fiscal 1994
sales of 564 million retail gallons of propane to more than 600,000 customers in
45 states and revenues of $526.5 million.
