FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

HANOVER DIRECT REPORTS

THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

WEEHAWKEN, N.J., OCTOBER 26, 1994 - Hanover Direct, Inc. (AMEX: HNV) today
reported net income for the third quarter of 1994 of $.6 million or $.01 per
share compared to $2.5 million or $.02 per share for the same period last year.
Earnings before interest and taxes for the 1994 quarter were $1.0 million
compared to $3.1 million in the same period in 1993.

"We are disappointed in the third quarter results," commented Jack E.
Rosenfeld, President and CEO. "Like other direct marketers, we prospected
heavily to identify new customers prior to the 1995 postal rate increase.
Unfortunately, the prospecting program continued to underperform, especially in
the non-apparel area, and this increased our selling expenses. As a result, we
reduced our prospecting for our fourth quarter catalogs."

"Despite the earnings disappointment, we are well positioned towards achieving
our long term goals," Mr. Rosenfeld said. "The construction of our new
Domestications distribution center in Roanoke, Virginia is almost complete with
some operations scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 1995. Our new
information system has been introduced at two of our catalogs, with the roll
out of the system to the balance of our catalogs scheduled for 1995. In
addition, as previously announced, we recently completed an $80 million
unsecured revolving credit facility, with $20 million set aside for
acquisitions."

For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 1994, the Company reported net
income of $6.6 million, or $.07 per share, compared to net income of $9.3
million, or $.09 per share, in the 1993 period. Net income applicable to
common shareholders increased $0.2 million to $6.5 million from $6.3 million.
The Company eliminated $2.9 million of preferred stock dividends as a result of
the conversion of two preferred stock issues into common stock in the fourth
quarter of 1993. The weighted average number of shares outstanding increased
27% in the 1994 period over the 1993 period.
