Item 5. Other Events

On May 9, 1994, Seafield Capital Corporation (Seafield) issued a news release
announcing that LabOne, Inc. (LabOne), Seafield's 82% owned subsidiary, has 
signed an agreement with PCS Health Systems, a subsidiary of McKesson, Inc., 
to market an integrated and fully managed system of laboratory testing and 
administration services for payors and health plans throughout the U.S.

PCS and LabOne are developing a managed lab program to offer participants, 
both payors and patients, substantial cost savings for clinical laboratory 
testing services. This program, modeled after PCS' managed pharmaceutical 
services, is designed to reduce benefit costs for participating health plans.
The program will utilize a point-of-service card identification system. PCS 
currently manages prescription-drug benefit programs for over 45 million 
people. LabOne currently performs testing on over three million specimens 
annually.

Bert H. Hood, chairman, president and chief executive officer of LabOne, said,
"This new affiliation will give LabOne an outstanding opportunity to join 
forces with PCS in marketing our higher-quality, lower-cost laboratory testing 
program to insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield systems, managed care
organizations, large employers, and other payors of medical benefits."

LabOne markets and operates a centralized laboratory with two divisions
serving the laboratory testing industry -- Center for Laboratory Services
(CLS), the clinical testing division, and Home Office Reference Laboratory
(HORL), the insurance testing division.

On May 10, 1994, Seafield issued a news release announcing that Response
Technologies, Inc. (Response), Seafield's 59% owned subsidiary, has signed a
provider contract with U.S. Healthcare of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania. U.S.
Healthcare is a HMO with over 1.6 million members in eight states and
Washington, D.C. This agreement allows all IMPACT(registered trademark)
Centers to deliver high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell
(PBSC) support and other advanced cancer treatments.

Response owns and operates a network of specialized out-patient treatment 
centers, or IMPACT(registered trademark) Centers, which provide advanced 
cancer treatment services under the direction of practicing oncologists.
