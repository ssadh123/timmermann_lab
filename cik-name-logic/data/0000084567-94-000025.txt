FOR RELEASE: July 1, 1994

SUMMARY: ROCHESTER TEL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING NEW YORK
STATE COURT ROYALTY DECISION

Rochester, New York - July 1, 1994 - Rochester Telephone 
Corporation (NYSE: RTC) today issued a statement in response to 
yesterday's action by a New York State Court upholding the New 
York State Public Service Commission's decision of July 6, 1993 
endorsing royalties for companies that it regulates, including 
Rochester Tel. The Commission sought to exact a royalty based 
on Rochester Tel's investment in deregulated subsidiaries, and 
the company had appealed the decision to the Appellate Division 
of the New York State Supreme Court last year.

Rochester Tel opposes the concept of a royalty and is 
extremely disappointed with the Court's decision. The 
company believes that it is bad public policy and runs 
counter to the regulatory reforms that Rochester Tel has 
consistently worked to initiate in New York State and in 
other states where it has operations. The company 
believes that the imposition of a royalty is not in the 
best interests of any of its various constituencies, 
including customers. Rochester Tel is currently studying 
its options and will decide in the near future whether or 
not to appeal the decision to a higher court.

The overall issue of a royalty was addressed in the company's 
Open Market Plan, which is pending final approval by the New 
York State Public Service Commission. If the plan is approved 
later this year, there would be no royalties imposed on the 
company for the period of the plan, which is anticipated to be 
seven years beginning January 1, 1995.

Rochester Telephone Corporation has operations that serve 1.5 
million customers through 48 telecommunication companies in 21 
states. The company's principal lines of business include long 
distance, network systems, wireless and telephone operations in 
the Northeast, Midwest, and South.
