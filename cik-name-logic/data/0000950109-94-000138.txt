[Letterhead of Erik B. Carlson, Esq.]

Continental Bank N.A., as Agent [closing
under the Credit Agreement date]
referred to below

-and-

Each of the Lenders now or hereafter
parties to the Credit Agreement
referred to below

Re: Associated Natural Gas Corporation Second
Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement,
dated as of December 31, 1993

Gentlemen:

I have acted as counsel to Associated Natural Gas Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (herein called the "Company"), and certain of its subsidiaries in
------- 
connection with the negotiation, execution and delivery of the following
agreements and documents:

(a) Second Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of
December 31, 1993 (herein called the "Amendment"), among the Company, the
--------- 
various financial institutions parties thereto (herein called the

"Lenders") and Continental Bank N.A., as agent (herein called the
------- 
"Agent"), and
----- 

(b) New Promissory Notes, dated December 31, 1993 (herein called the
"Notes"), issued by the Company pursuant to the Amendment and payable to
----- 
the order of the Lenders.

Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have
the meanings assigned to such terms in the Amendment.

I am familiar with the corporate proceedings taken by the Company in
connection with the foregoing agreements and documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby. In addition, I have examined such corporate records,
certificates and other documents and such questions of law as I have considered
necessary or appropriate for the basis of the opinions hereinafter expressed. As
to certain factual matters, I have relied, where I deemed appropriate, upon
information contained in certain certificates of officers of the Company and the
Subsidiaries.
<PAGE>

In making the examination of all documents and agreements in connection
with the opinions expressed herein, I have assumed the genuineness of all
signatures and the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals
and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to me as
copies.

The opinions expressed in paragraph 5 below are qualified to the extent
that the enforceability of the terms and provisions of the documents and
instruments referred to in said paragraphs may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and by general equitable principles which may limit the right to
obtain the remedy of specific performance of executory covenants.

Based upon, and subject to, the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly
qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do
business in each jurisdiction where a failure so to qualify would have a
materially adverse effect on the business or operations of the Company.

2. Each Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the state of its respective
incorporation. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified and in good standing as a
foreign corporation authorized to do business in each jurisdiction where a
failure so to qualify would have a materially adverse effect on the business or
operations of such Subsidiary.

3. The Company has full corporate power and authority to own and operate
its properties and assets, carry on its business as currently conducted, and
enter into and perform its obligations under the Amendment.

4. Each Subsidiary has full corporate power and authority to own and
operate its properties and assets, and carry on its business as currently
conducted.

5. The execution and delivery of the Amendment and the Notes and the
performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and the
Amendment and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the
Company and constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable
in accordance with their respective terms.
<PAGE>

6. There is no provision in the articles of incorporation or the by-laws
of the Company, nor, to the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, any
provision in any indenture, mortgage, contract or agreement to which the Company
is a party or by which it or its properties may be bound, nor any law, statute,
rule or regulation, or any writ, order or decision of any court or governmental
instrumentality binding on the Company which would be contravened by the
execution and delivery of the Amendment or the Notes, nor do any of the
foregoing prohibit performance by the Company of any term, provision, condition,
covenant or any other obligation of the Company contained in the Amendment or
the Notes.

7. Except as described in [reference most recent Form 10-K] there are no
actions, suits or proceedings pending, or to the best of my knowledge after due
inquiry, threatened against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary before
any court or a arbitrator(s) or by or before any administrative agency or
governmental authority, which, if adversely determined, would have a materially
adverse effect on the financial condition or business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

8. Neither the making nor the performance of the Amendment or the Notes
requires the consent or approval of any governmental instrumentality or other
Person.

9. The Company is not a "holding company", a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company" or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company", within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

10. The Company is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled"
by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended.

11. The Company is not engaged in the business of extending credit for
the purpose of buying or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation
U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).

I am licensed to practice law only in the State of Colorado and,
accordingly, the foregoing opinions are limited solely to the laws of the State
of Colorado and applicable Federal law.

<PAGE>

This opinion letter is being furnished to the Agent and the Lenders for
their use and the use of their counsel. No other use or distribution of this
opinion may be made without my prior written consent.

Very truly yours,
