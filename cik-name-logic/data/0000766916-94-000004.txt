INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT

Item 5. Other Events

On April 15, 1994, the Superior Court of the State of California,

County of Los Angeles, entered a new judgment for a total of

$107,609,032.20 in favor of Amoco Chemical Company and Amoco Reinforced

Plastics Company, subsidiaries of Amoco Company and Amoco Corporation,

against certain underwriters at Lloyd's of London and various other

British and European insurance carriers, in AMOCO CHEMICAL COMPANY, et

al, vs. CERTAIN UNDERWRITERS AT LLOYD'S OF LONDON, et al. In that case,

Amoco alleged that the defendant insurers wrongfully refused to pay for

the defense and settlement of product liability lawsuits arising from

Amoco Reinforced Plastics Company's manufacture of irrigation and sewer

pipe in the 1970's. The new judgment reflects a court-ordered reduction

in the punitive damages award included in the prior judgment from

$376,545,097.64 to $71,488,910.00. The compensatory damages award was

unchanged.

The judgment remains subject to appeal by the defendants and the

reduced punitive damages award is subject to appeal by the plaintiffs.

Accordingly, it is impossible at this time to predict the ultimate

outcome of this case or its impact, if any, on the financial position,

results of operations, and cash flows of Amoco Company.
