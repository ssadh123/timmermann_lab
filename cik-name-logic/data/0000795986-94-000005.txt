Item 2.Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On March 16, 1994, Thermo Instrument Systems Inc. ("Thermo Instrument" or the
"Company") acquired substantially all of the assets, subject to certain
liabilities, of the EnviroTech Controls, Noran Instruments, TN Technologies and
Tremetrics businesses of Baker Hughes Incorporated for a cash purchase price of
$87.3 million, subject to a post-closing adjustment. The purchase price was
based on the Company's determination of the fair value of the acquired
businesses and negotiations with Baker Hughes Incorporated. The acquired
businesses, which are part of the EnviroTech Measurements & Controls group of
Baker Hughes Incorporated, collectively design, manufacture and market a variety
of process control, process measurement and laboratory analytical products for
use in a wide range of industrial, energy, environmental and research
applications. The purchase price was funded from cash on hand.

Thermo Electron Corporation ("Thermo Electron"), the parent company of Thermo
Instrument, entered into an acquisition agreement with Baker Hughes Incorporated
in January 1994 with respect to this transaction and a related transaction in
which another Thermo Electron subsidiary, Thermedics Inc., acquired two
companies that are also part of the EnviroTech Measurements & Controls group.
Thermo Electron assigned its rights to acquire the respective businesses to the
Company and Thermedics Inc.

The Company has no present intention to use the equipment or other assets
acquired for purposes materially different from the purposes for which such
assets were used prior to the acquisition. However, the Company will review the
assets, corporate structure, capitalization, operations, properties, policies,
management and personnel of the acquired businesses and, upon completion of this
review, may develop alternative plans or proposals, including mergers, transfers
of a material amount of assets or other transactions or changes relating to the
businesses.

which is not capable of being validly assigned, transferred,
subleased or sublicensed without the consent or waiver of the
issuer thereof or the other party thereto or third person
(including a Governmental Body), or with respect to which such
assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense or attempted
assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense could constitute a
breach thereof or a violation of any law, decree, order,
regulation, rule, ordinance or other governmental edict (each
such license or contract is hereinafter referred to as a
"Restricted Asset"). For purposes of this Section 2.8,
"transfer" or similar words shall include a transfer resulting or
deemed to result under the terms of the Restricted Asset as a
consequence of the transfer of Shares to the Buyer. Part A of

17<PAGE>
Schedule 2.8 sets forth the Restricted Assets for which the
receipt of the necessary consents and waivers for the assignment,
transfer, sublease or sublicense of such Restricted Assets is a 
condition precedent to the Buyer's obligations hereunder. Part B
of Schedule 2.8 sets forth the Restricted Assets as to which, if
the necessary consents and waivers are not received on or before
the Closing Date, this Agreement and the other documents and
instruments executed in connection herewith shall not constitute
an assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense thereof, or an
attempted assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense thereof.
Part C of Schedule 2.8 sets forth the Restricted Assets which
cannot be validly assigned or transferred as a matter of law, and
this Agreement and the other documents and instruments executed
in connection herewith shall not constitute an assignment or
transfer thereof. The Restricted Assets set forth on Parts A and
B of Schedule 2.8 are hereinafter referred to as "Assignable
Restricted Assets", and the Restricted Assets set forth on Part C
of Schedule 2.8 are hereinafter referred to as "Nonassignable
Restricted Assets".

(b) The Seller shall use reasonable efforts, and the Buyer
shall cooperate reasonably with the Seller, (i) to promptly
obtain the consents and waivers necessary to convey or cause to
be conveyed to the Buyer all of the Assignable Restricted
Assets, and (ii) as of and subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, to promptly convey or cause to be conveyed to the Buyer
the Assignable Restricted Assets for which the Seller has
received the necessary consents and waivers; provided, however,
that the Seller shall not, and shall cause the Asset Sellers not
to, amend or change any Assignable Restricted Asset without the
prior written consent of the Buyer unless the Seller reasonably
deems it necessary to preserve the value of the Restricted Asset.
The Seller shall, and shall cause the Asset Sellers to, cooperate
with the Buyer in making applications and filings or taking any
other action necessary for the Buyer to obtain such franchises,
licenses, permits or other instruments or agreements, if any, as
are substantially equivalent to the Nonassignable Restricted
Assets. In no event shall the Buyer's cooperation hereunder
require the Buyer to make any payments or incur any out-of-pocket
expenses, except that the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller on an
equitable basis for any consideration paid, with the prior
approval of the Buyer, to any person from whom a consent or
waiver is requested.

(c) To the extent that the consents and waivers necessary
to assign, transfer, sublease or sublicense the Assignable
Restricted Assets are not obtained, the Seller shall, commencing
on the Closing Date and continuing for the duration of each
Assignable Restricted Asset, use reasonable efforts to (i)
provide to the Buyer the benefits of any Assignable Restricted

18<PAGE>
Asset not assigned, transferred or subleased due to the Seller's
failure or inability to obtain such consent or waiver, (ii)
cooperate with the Buyer to reach a reasonable and lawful
arrangement designed to provide such benefits to the Buyer during
such period and (iii) enforce at the request of the Buyer, or
allow the Buyer to enforce (and, solely for such purpose, the
Seller hereby constitutes and appoints the Buyer as its true and
lawful attorney-in-fact until revoked in writing delivered by
the Seller to the Buyer), any rights of the Seller under any 
Assignable Restricted Asset against the issuer thereof or the
other party or parties thereto (including the right to elect to
terminate such of the foregoing in accordance with the terms
thereof upon the request of the Buyer); provided, however, that
the reasonable costs and expenses of the Seller incurred at the
Buyer's request with respect to any of the actions contemplated
under (iii) above shall be promptly paid or reimbursed by the
Buyer to the Seller. At the end of such period, the Seller shall
have no further duties or obligations under this Section 2.8 with
respect to such Assignable Restricted Asset and the failure or 
inability to obtain any necessary consent or waiver with respect
thereto shall not be a breach of this Agreement so long as the
Seller has carried out its obligations under this Section 2.8.

(d) To the extent that the Buyer is provided the benefits
pursuant to this Section 2.8 of any Assignable Restricted Asset,
the Buyer shall perform for the benefit of the issuer thereof, or
the other party or parties thereto, the obligations of the Seller
thereunder or in connection therewith, but only to the extent
that (i) such action by the Buyer would not result in any default
thereunder or in connection therewith and (ii) such obligation
would have been a liability of the Business but for the
non-assignability or non-transferability thereof; provided,
however, that if the Buyer shall fail to perform to the extent
required herein, the Seller shall thereafter cease to be
obligated under this Section 2.8 to provide the Buyer with any
benefits in respect of the Assignable Restricted Asset which is
the subject of such failure to perform unless and until such
situation is remedied or, at the sole option of the Seller, the
Buyer shall promptly pay or reimburse the Seller all costs
reasonably incurred by the Seller to remedy such failure to
perform during such period of failure of performance.

(e) In furtherance of the foregoing, the Seller has 
informed the Buyer that the Seller cannot enter into a sublease
with the Buyer for the 873 square meter facility currently leased
by Noran Instruments at 25, Rue du Ventoux, Montagne Sud, France
(the "Noran France Premises") under a lease expiring on April 1,
1995 (the "Noran France Lease"). In order to provide the Buyer
with the use and occupancy of the Noran France Premises

19<PAGE>
after the Closing on the same basis as used and occupied by
Noran Instruments prior to the Closing, the Seller hereby agrees
that the Buyer shall be permitted, without cost or expense to
the Buyer, (i) to use and occupy 70% of the Noran France Premises
and (ii) to use all telephone, office and other equipment and
other facilities and amenities associated with the Noran France
Premises on the same basis as used and occupied by Noran 
Instruments prior to the Closing. The Buyer's use and occupancy
of the Noran France Premises shall be in common with the Seller,
the Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate with one another
regarding the shared use of the Noran France Premises, and the
Buyer's use and occupancy of the Noran France Premises shall be
subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Noran France
Lease. The Buyer's use and occupancy of the Noran France
Premises shall commence upon the Closing and shall terminate no
later than April 1, 1995, or on such earlier date as the Buyer
may elect in its discretion. In the event that the Buyer is
prevented from using and occupying the Noran France Premises
through April 1, 1995, the Seller shall promptly make a cash
payment to the Buyer in an amount equal to (x) the number of days
between the Closing Date and April 1, 1995 during which the Buyer
is prevented from using and occupying the Noran France Premises
multiplied by (y) $50,000 divided by the number of days between
the Closing Date and April 1, 1995. The payment required by the
foregoing sentence shall be made by the Seller in immediately
available funds and no later than 30 days following the Seller's
receipt of notice from the Buyer of the amount due. Any payment
not made when due under the foregoing sentence shall bear
interest, compounded monthly on the last day of each calendar
month, from the due date at an interest rate equal to the prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. as announced from time to time. 

2.9 Intercompany Accounts and Cash. Prior to or on the Closing
Date, the Seller shall net, to the extent possible, and settle,
forgive or contribute all intercompany accounts between (a) the Seller
and its subsidiaries and affiliates which are not constituents of the
Business and (b) the Foreign Companies and the Domestic Businesses,
except for trade accounts payable and receivable incurred in the
Ordinary Course of Business, which trade accounts payable and
receivable shall remain obligations or assets of the Business. The
effect of such settling and netting will be to remove as of the
Closing Date any intercompany account not reflected on the Balance
Sheet but which exists between (a) the Seller and its subsidiaries and
affiliates which are not constituents of the Business and (b) the
Business, except for trade accounts payable and receivables incurred
in the Ordinary Course of Business. Prior to the Closing Date, but
subject to the provisions of Section 4.1, all cash or cash equivalents
held by any Foreign Division, Domestic Business or Foreign

20<PAGE>
Company shall be deemed to be an asset of the Seller, and the Seller
may use such cash or cash equivalents to pay advances or make 
dividends or distributions to the Seller or its constituent entities
without affecting the sale of the Business.

3.4 Seller Obligations.

(a) After the Closing, the Buyer shall use such efforts as
it, in its sole discretion, deems reasonable to arrange over
time for the substitution of the Buyer for the Seller and its
subsidiaries and affiliates that are not constituents of the
Business on the agreements, obligations and liabilities in
respect of the Business listed on Schedule 3.4 ("Seller
Obligations") which are obligations of the Seller and its
subsidiaries and affiliates that are not constituents of the

require (i) the Buyer to make any payments or (ii) the Buyer, or
allow the Seller, to amend the terms of any obligation of the

4. PURCHASE PRICE MATTERS.

4.1 Changes in Cash Position. 

(a) The Seller agrees to reimburse the Buyer to the extent
that, at any time or from time to time after the Balance Sheet
Date through the Closing Date, (i) the Seller or its subsidiaries
or affiliates which are not constituents of the Business withdraw
or receive distributions, dividends, advances, repayments or
other payments of cash or cash equivalents from the Business and
(ii) the Business makes any payments of cash or cash equivalents
with respect to Excluded Liabilities, including without
limitation cash used to pay Taxes for which the Seller is liable
under Section 7.9 but excluding (i) payments with respect to 
Plans, Foreign Plans or Seller's Welfare Plans and (ii) payments
of claims for compensation or benefits of any nature whatsoever,
severance pay, termination pay or pay in lieu of notice of any
employees of the Business with respect to services performed or
terminations occurring before the Closing Date, so long (in the
case of both clauses (i) and (ii)) as such payments are in the
Ordinary Course of Business (i.e., unrelated to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other 
extraordinary events).

(b) The Buyer agrees to reimburse the Seller to the extent
that, at any time or from time to time after the Balance Sheet
Date through the Closing Date, (i) the Seller or its subsidiaries
or affiliates which are not constituents of the Business lend or
advance any cash or cash equivalents to or for the benefit of the
Business, including without limitation cash used to pay Taxes for
which the Buyer is liable under Section 7.9, or (ii) the
outstanding balances of any overdraft facility, bank credit line
or third party indebtedness for money borrowed not assumed by
the Buyer is increased and the proceeds of the increase are paid
to and used by the Business.

(c) In order to determine the amount owed, if any, by
either party under Sections 4.1(a) and (b), the Seller shall
prepare and deliver to the Buyer the Final Statement of Cash
Position within 30 days after the Closing Date. The Seller shall
cause DT to follow and implement the procedures set forth in
Schedule 4.1 with respect to the Final Statement of Cash Position
prepared by the Seller and to obtain from DT and deliver to the
Buyer with the Final Statement of Cash Position a certificate of
DT, based on the procedures set forth in Schedule 4.1,
confirming the accuracy of the Final Statement of Cash Position.
If the Final Statement of Cash Position as delivered by the
Seller shows an amount due from the Seller to the Buyer (i.e., if
the aggregate amount referred to in clause (i) of the definition

24<PAGE>
of "Final Statement of Cash Position" exceeds the aggregate
amount referred to in clause (ii) of such definition), the Seller
shall pay, by wire transfer or other delivery of immediately
available funds, such amount to the Buyer simultaneously with the
Seller's delivery to the Buyer of the Final Statement of Cash
Position and the certificate of DT.

(d) The amount set forth in such Final Statement of Cash
Position as required to be paid shall be conclusive unless the
Buyer delivers to the Seller within 30 days after receiving the
Final Statement of Cash Position a statement describing in
reasonable detail its objections thereto. The Buyer and the
Seller shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any such
objections and to agree upon the Final Statement of Cash
Position, but if they do not reach a final resolution within 30
days after the Seller has received the Buyer's statement of
objections, the Buyer and the Seller shall promptly select an
accounting firm mutually acceptable to them (the "Neutral
Auditors") to resolve any remaining objections. If the Buyer and
the Seller are unable to agree on the choice of Neutral Auditors,
they shall select as Neutral Auditors a nationally-recognized
accounting firm by lot (after excluding their respective regular
independent accounting firms). The Neutral Auditors shall
promptly determine whether the objections raised by the Buyer are
appropriate. The Final Statement of Cash Position shall be
adjusted in accordance with the Neutral Auditors' determination
and, as so adjusted, shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Buyer and the Seller.

(e) Commencing with the delivery of the Final Statement of
Cash Position and throughout the period of any dispute referred
to above, the Seller shall provide the Buyer and the Buyer's
independent accountants full access to the books, records,
facilities and employees of the Foreign Divisions, Domestic
Businesses and Foreign Companies and the work papers of DT and
shall cooperate fully with the Buyer and the Buyer's accountants
in order to enable them to analyze the Final Statement of Cash
Position; provided, however, that such access shall be allowed
only during normal business hours, with reasonable advance
notice and in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the normal operations of the business of the Share Sellers and
Asset Sellers. 

(f) The Buyer and the Seller shall share equally the fees
and expenses of the Neutral Auditors and DT under this Section
4.1.

(g) The party owing an amount to the other party based on
the Final Statement of Cash Position (which amount shall
constitute a change in the Purchase Price) shall pay such 
amount, plus interest thereon, compounded monthly on the last 

25<PAGE>
day of each calendar month, from the Closing Date at an interest
rate equal to the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. as announced from
time to time, to the other party, by wire transfer or other
delivery of immediately available funds, within three business
days after the date on which the Final Statement of Cash Position
is finally determined pursuant to this Section 4.1; provided,
however, that in the event the Seller owes an amount to the
Buyer based on the Final Statement of Cash Position, the payment
otherwise required to be made by the Seller to the Buyer
pursuant to this Section 4.1(g) shall be reduced by the amount
previously paid by the Seller to the Buyer pursuant to Section
4.1(c) above. 

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payments between
the Balance Sheet Date and 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing
Date by the Business to the Seller or any of the Seller's
subsidiaries or affiliates which are not constituents of the
Business or by the Seller or any of the Seller's subsidiaries or
affiliates which are not constituents of the Business to the
Business shall be excluded from the Final Statement of Cash
Position if such payments are on account of the sale of products
or the performance of services in the Ordinary Course of
Business.

4.2 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be
allocated among the Assets and the Shares in accordance with Schedule
4.2 hereto. Any increase or decrease in the Purchase Price pursuant
to Section 4.1 shall be allocated among the Assets located in the U.S.
in proportion to the amounts allocated among all Assets located in the
U.S. on Schedule 4.2. Such allocation of any increase or decrease in
the Purchase Price shall be prepared by the Buyer and submitted in
writing to Seller within 30 days after the date on which the Final
Statement of Cash Position is finally determined pursuant to Section
4.1. If the Seller does not object in writing to such proposed
allocation within 30 days after receipt of the Buyer's written
proposal, the proposed allocation shall become final. If the Seller
makes timely objection to the Buyer's proposal, the Buyer and the 
Seller shall have 30 days to reach agreement or the allocation shall
be submitted to the Neutral Auditors, whose determination shall be
final and whose fees and expenses shall be borne equally by the Buyer
and the Seller. 

4.3 Brokers. Except for Lehman Brothers Inc. and Texas 
Commerce Bank National Association, whose fees and expenses shall be
the sole responsibility of the Seller, the Seller represents and
warrants that it has not employed or incurred any liability to any

thereof. 

(d) Neither the Seller, any Asset Seller, any Share 
Seller, any Foreign Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever
maintained an employee benefit plan subject to Section 412 of the

funding deficiency (as defined for purposes of Section 412 of the

partial withdrawal (as defined for purposes of Sections 4203 and
4205 of ERISA, respectively) has occurred with respect to a
multiemployer plan to which any of the Seller, any Share Seller,
any Asset Seller, any Foreign Company or any ERISA Affiliate was
ever obligated to contribute which would subject any Foreign 
Company or the Assets to liability from such complete withdrawal
or partial withdrawal.

coverage and deferred compensation, but excluding continuation of
health coverage required to be continued under Section 4980B of
the Code and insurance conversion privileges under state law. 

(g) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.24, no act or 
omission has occurred and no condition exists with respect to any
employee benefit plan maintained by the Seller, any Asset Seller,
any Share Seller, any Foreign Company or any ERISA Affiliate that
would subject any Foreign Company or the Assets to any material
fine, penalty, tax or liability of any kind imposed under ERISA or
the Code.

vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the
occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be
calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. 

5.25 Foreign Employee Benefit Plans. Schedule 5.25 lists (i)
each non-governmental retirement plan maintained or contributed to by
or on behalf of the Seller, the Asset Sellers, the Share Sellers or
the Foreign Companies applicable to employees of the Business located
outside of the U.S. (a "Foreign Retirement Plan") and (ii) each
non-governmental non-industry welfare benefit plan maintained or
contributed to by or on behalf of the Seller, the Asset Sellers, the
Share Sellers or the Foreign Companies applicable to employees of the
Business located outside of the U.S. and which, in the case of clause
(ii), obligates or may reasonably be expected to obligate the
Business to pay more than $100,000 annually (a "Foreign Welfare
Plan"). Except as set forth in Schedule 5.25, each such Foreign
Retirement Plan and Foreign Welfare Plan (collectively, the "Foreign
Plans") has been administered, in all material respects, in
compliance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
and Regulations, and all required contributions to each Foreign Plan
have been made. The Seller has heretofore delivered to the Buyer 
true and complete copies of all of the written Foreign Plans and 
written summaries of the oral Foreign Plans and, where applicable,
related trusts, including all amendments. There are no inquiries or
investigations by any foreign Governmental Body, no termination
proceedings and no actions, suits or claims (other than claims for
benefits) pending or, to the Seller's Knowledge, threatened against
any Foreign Plan (or the Seller or any Foreign Company, Share Seller
or Asset Seller with respect thereto) or the assets thereof. Except
as set forth in Schedule 5.25, there are no unfunded obligations
under any Foreign Plan providing benefits after termination of
employment to any employee or former employee of the Business (or to
any beneficiary of any such employee or former employee), including
but not limited to retiree health coverage and deferred compensation,
but excluding insurance conversion privileges under applicable
foreign law. No Foreign Plan, plan documentation or agreement,
summary plan description or other written communication distributed
generally to employees of the Business by its terms prohibits the
amendment or termination of any such Foreign Plan. All reports, forms
and other documents required to be filed or advisable to be filed 

48<PAGE>
with any governmental entity with respect to each Foreign Plan have
been timely filed and are accurate. 

5.26 Indebtedness and Guaranties. Schedule 5.26 sets forth a 
true and complete list, including the names of the parties thereto,
of all material debt instruments, loan agreements, indentures,
guaranties or other written obligations which relate to (i)
indebtedness for borrowed money, (ii) money loaned to others or (iii)
the performance of any obligation relating to the Business, provided
that the Seller shall not be required to list any such obligations
which are general corporate obligations of the Seller, which are not
secured by any of the Assets, the assets of the Foreign Companies or
the Shares and which do not constitute an Assumed Liability. All of
the aforesaid items were entered into in the Ordinary Course of
Business, are valid and binding, in full force and effect and are
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms; and there
exists no breach or default, or any event which with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a breach or default by any party 
thereto.

5.27 Product Warranty. The standard terms and conditions of 
sale or lease of each Foreign Division, Domestic Business and Foreign
Company are attached to Schedule 5.27, although the Buyer 
acknowledges that such terms are sometimes negotiated on a case by
case basis. Schedule 5.27 sets forth the aggregate expenses incurred
by the Asset Sellers and Foreign Companies in fulfilling their
obligations under their guaranty, warranty, right of return and
indemnity provisions during the three fiscal years preceding the
Closing and, to the Seller's Knowledge, there is no reason why such
expenses should materially increase as a percentage of sales in the
future. 

5.28 Environmental Matters.

(a) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.28, the Seller, each
Share Seller, each Asset Seller and each Foreign Company has
complied in all material respects with all Environmental Laws
relating to the Business. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.28,
there is no pending or, to the Seller's Knowledge, threatened

Environmental Compensation, Liability and Response Act of 1980
("CERCLA"). 

(b) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.28, there have been
no releases in a reportable quantity of any Materials of 
Environmental Concern into the environment at any parcel of real
property or any facility (i) currently owned or operated by the
Seller, any Share Seller or any Asset Seller relating to the
Business, (ii) currently owned or operated by any Foreign
Company, (iii) formerly owned, operated or controlled by the
Seller, any Share Seller or any Asset Seller relating to the
Business during the period of its ownership, operation or control
or (iv) formerly owned, operated or controlled by any Foreign
Company during the period of its ownership, operation or control.
With respect to any such releases in a reportable quantity of
Materials of Environmental Concern, the Seller, each Share
Seller, each Asset Seller and each Foreign Company has given all
required notices to Governmental Bodies (copies of which have
been provided to the Buyer). Except as set forth in Schedule
5.28, to the Seller's Knowledge there have been no releases of
Materials of Environmental Concern at parcels of real property or
facilities other than those owned, operated or controlled by the
Seller, any Share Seller or any Asset Seller relating to the
Business or by any Foreign Company that could affect the 
Business. For purposes of this Agreement, "Materials of 
Environmental Concern" means any chemicals, pollutants or 
contaminants, hazardous substances (as such term is defined under
CERCLA), solid wastes and hazardous wastes (as such terms are
defined under the federal Resources Conservation and Recovery
Act), radioactive materials, toxic materials, oil or petroleum
and petroleum products.

is a list of all environmental reports, investigations and audits
relating to premises (i) currently owned or operated by the
Seller, any Share Seller or any Asset Seller relating to the
Business or (ii) currently owned or operated by any Foreign

50<PAGE>
Company, in each of the foregoing cases whether conducted by or
on behalf of the Seller, any Share Seller, Asset Seller, any
Foreign Company or a third party, and whether done at the
initiative of the Seller, any Share Seller, any Asset Seller or
any Foreign Company or directed by a Governmental Body or other
third party. Complete and accurate copies of each such report,
or the results of each such report, investigation or audit, have
been provided to the Buyer (except that only summaries of the 
results of statistical information resulting from physical 
monitoring or testing have been provided to the Buyer). 

(d) Set forth in Schedule 5.28 is a list of all of the 
solid and hazardous waste transporters and treatment, storage and
disposal facilities that have been utilized by the Seller, any
Share Seller or any Asset Seller relating to the Business since
May 24, 1990 or by any Foreign Company since May 24, 1990 or, to
the Seller's Knowledge, at any time prior to May 24, 1990.
Neither the Seller, any Share Seller, any Asset Seller nor any
Foreign Company has received written notice of any material
environmental liability of any such transporter or facility.

5.29 Permits. Schedule 5.29 sets forth a list of all Permits 
(including without limitation Permits issued or required under 
Environmental Laws and Permits relating to the occupancy or use of
owned or leased real property) issued to or held by the Seller, any
Share Seller, any Asset Seller or any Foreign Company relating to the
Business. Such listed Permits are the only Permits that are required
for the conduct of the business of each Principal Business Unit.
Each such Permit is in full force and effect and no suspension or
cancellation of such Permit is threatened and there is no basis for
believing that such Permit will not be renewable upon expiration.
Except as set forth in Schedule 5.29, each such Permit held by an
Asset Seller is assignable by the Asset Seller to the Buyer without
the consent or approval of or any payment to any party, all such
Permits (whether held by an Asset Seller or Foreign Company) will 
continue to be in full force and effect immediately following the 
Closing in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein will not conflict with, result in a violation or
breach of or constitute a default under (or would result in a
violation, breach or default with the giving of notice or the passage
of time or both) any such Permit.

5.30 Certain Business Relationships. No affiliate of the Seller
or of any Share Seller or Asset Seller (a) owns any property or
right, tangible or intangible, which is used in the Business, (b) has
any claim or cause of action against the Assets, any Foreign Company

Foreign Company relating to the Business.

5.31 Books and Records. The books, records, accounts, ledgers
and files with respect to the Business of the Seller and each Asset
Seller and Foreign Company are accurate and complete in all material
respects and have been maintained in accordance with good business
and bookkeeping practices in all material respects. The books and
records of each Foreign Division, Domestic Business and Foreign
Company, including without limitation its books of account, stock
certificate books, stock ledgers and/or share registers, are complete
and correct in all material respects and accurately reflect in all
material respects the conduct of the business and affairs of such
Foreign Division, Domestic Business and Foreign Company. The minute
books and other similar records of each Foreign Company contain true
and complete records of all actions taken at any meetings of such 
Foreign Company's stockholders, Board of Directors, Managing Board,
Supervisory Board or any committee thereof and of all written
consents executed in lieu of the holding of any such meeting. 

5.32 Customers and Suppliers. No unfilled customer orders or
commitments obligating any Foreign Division, Domestic Business or
Foreign Company to process, manufacture or deliver products or 
perform services, which orders or commitments are material, 
individually or in the aggregate, to any Principal Business Unit, 
will result in a loss to such Foreign Division, Domestic Business or
Foreign Company upon completion of performance. To the Seller's
Knowledge, no purchase orders or commitments of any Foreign Division,
Domestic Business or Foreign Company, which orders or commitments are
material, individually or in the aggregate, to any Principal Business
Unit, are in excess of normal requirements, nor are prices provided
therein in excess of current market prices for the products or
services to be provided thereunder. No material supplier of any
Foreign Division, Domestic Business or Foreign Company has indicated
within the past year that it will stop, or decrease the rate of,
supplying materials, products, or services to such Foreign Division,
Domestic Business or Foreign Company and no material customer of any
Foreign Division, Domestic Business or Foreign Company has indicated
within the past year that it will stop, or decrease the rate of,
buying materials, products or services from such Foreign Division,
Domestic Business or Foreign Company. Schedule 5.32 sets forth a
list of (a) each customer that accounted for more than 2% of the
combined revenues of the Business during the last full fiscal year
and the amount of revenues accounted for by such customer during each
such period and (b) each supplier that is the sole supplier of any
significant product or component to any Foreign Division, Domestic
Business or Foreign Company. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.32,

52<PAGE>
there are no suppliers to any Foreign Division, Domestic Business or
Foreign Company of significant goods or services with respect to
which practical alternative sources of supply, or comparable
products, are not available on comparable terms and conditions.

5.33 Government Contracts. No Foreign Division, Domestic 
Business or Foreign Company has been suspended or debarred from 
bidding on contracts or subcontracts with any Governmental Body; no
such suspension or debarment has been initiated or, to the Seller's
Knowledge, threatened; and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in any such suspension
or debarment of any Foreign Division, Domestic Business or Foreign
Company (assuming that no such suspension or debarment will result
solely from the identity of the Buyer). Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.33, no Foreign Division, Domestic Business or Foreign
Company has been audited or investigated or is now being audited or,
to the Seller's Knowledge, investigated by the U.S. Government
Accounting Office, the U.S. Department of Defense or any of its
agencies, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the U.S. Department of
Justice, the Inspector General of any U.S. Governmental Body, any
similar agencies or instrumentalities of any foreign Governmental
Body, or any prime contractor with a Governmental Body nor, to the 
Seller's Knowledge, has any such audit or investigation been 
threatened. To the Seller's Knowledge, there is no valid basis for
(a) the suspension or debarment of any Foreign Division, Domestic
Business or Foreign Company from bidding on contracts or subcontracts
with any Governmental Body or (b) any claim pursuant to an audit or
investigation by any of the entities named in the foregoing sentence.
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.33, no Foreign Division, Domestic
Business or Foreign Company has any agreements, contracts or
commitments which require it to obtain or maintain a security
clearance with any Governmental Body.

the Seller's Knowledge, no such proceedings have been threatened.
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.34, since May 24, 1990 no product
or service of the Business has ever been recalled.

5.35 Disclosure. No representation or warranty by the Seller
contained in this Agreement, and no statement contained in the
Disclosure Schedule or any other document, certificate or other
instrument delivered to or to be delivered by or on behalf of the
Seller pursuant to this Agreement, contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary, in light

acts or laws of any or all of the states or other jurisdictions in
which the Assets are situated (or of any state or jurisdiction) which
may be asserted to be applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Buyer and the Seller therefore waive any requirements
for compliance with any or all of such laws. 

7.6 Employment of Business Work Force. Prior to the Closing,
but effective as of and conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing,
the Buyer shall make an offer of employment at will to each employee
of the Asset Sellers employed in the Business who on the Closing Date
is actively at work or absent due to short-term (six months or less)
sick leave, maternity leave, jury duty or similar short-term leave
and, upon acceptance by such employee, enter into an at will
employer-employee relationship with such employee. Except as
otherwise specifically required by applicable law, the Buyer shall
not have any obligation to employ or offer employment to any
employees of the Asset Sellers employed in the Business other than as
provided in the preceding sentence. The terms of said offer of the
Buyer to each such employee shall include the payment of compensation
which is substantially equivalent to the compensation being provided
to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, 
however, that the Buyer shall have complete discretion to change any
of the terms or conditions of employment, compensation or benefits at
any time after the Closing Date. The parties hereto do not intend to
create any third-party beneficiary rights respecting any employee as
a result of the provisions herein and specifically hereby negate any
such intention. The Seller and each Asset Seller hereby consent to
the hiring by the Buyer of employees of the Asset Sellers as
contemplated by this Section 7.6 and waive, with respect to the
employment of such employees, any claims or rights that the Seller or
any Asset Seller may have against the Buyer or any such employee

60<PAGE>
under any non-competition, confidentiality or employment agreement.

7.7 Employee Benefits. Contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing:

(a) Benefits. Except as to employees of the Business to
whom the Buyer is not required to extend an offer of employment
as provided in Section 7.6, the Buyer shall cause each employee
employed in the Business by the Asset Sellers, the Share Sellers
or the Foreign Companies immediately prior to the Closing, as
described in Schedule 7.7, and who accepts employment with Buyer
pursuant to Section 7.6 or who remains employed by a Foreign
Company immediately following the Closing (a "Continuing
Employee"), to be provided with benefits, in the aggregate, on a
basis substantially consistent with the Buyer's normal
practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as required by
Section 7.7(g) with respect to Pre-Closing Periods, the Buyer 
expressly reserves the right to modify or terminate any benefit
plan or program at any time or from time to time. 

(b) Thrift Plan. Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Seller shall cause each of the Continuing Employees to have a
fully nonforfeitable right to the Continuing Employee's account
balance under the Baker Hughes Incorporated Thrift Plan (the
"Seller's Thrift Plan"). The Buyer shall take all action
necessary and appropriate to extend coverage, effective as of
July 1, 1994, under the Thermo Electron Corporation Money Match
Plus 401(k) Plan (the "Buyer's Thrift Plan") to the Continuing
Employees having account balances under the Seller's Thrift Plan
as of the Closing Date. Such Continuing Employees shall be 
credited under the Buyer's Thrift Plan, for eligibility and 
vesting purposes, with the service credited under the terms of
the Seller's Thrift Plan. The Seller shall provide the Buyer
with all such information as is necessary for the Buyer to carry
out its obligations under the foregoing sentence. The Seller
shall cause to be made any matching or regular contributions
that are required under the Seller's Thrift Plan for the period
prior to the Closing Date and the Buyer shall have no
responsibility therefor. Each Continuing Employee shall be
permitted to make a lump sum withdrawal of his or her account
balance under the Seller's Thrift Plan. The Buyer shall cause
the Buyer's Thrift Plan to accept any direct rollovers with
respect to a Continuing Employee from the Seller's Thrift Plan
to the Buyer's Thrift Plan. The Buyer agrees to establish an
arrangement under which any Continuing Employee may provide for
payroll withholding for the purpose of repaying any loan made
prior to the Closing Date to such Continuing Employee by the 
Seller's Thrift Plan. 

61<PAGE>
(c) Foreign Retirement Plans. The following provisions
shall apply to the non-governmental Foreign Retirement Plans
respecting the Business:

Closing Date, the Seller shall cause each of the 
Continuing Employees to have a fully nonforfeitable right
to the Continuing Employee's account balance under the

soon as practicable after, but effective as of, the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall take all action necessary and
appropriate to extend coverage under a new or existing

(the "Buyer's Canadian Plan"), to the Continuing Employees
covered under the Seller's Canadian Plan as of the Closing

service, for eligibility and vesting purposes, with the
service credited under the terms of the Seller's Canadian

and the establishment of the Buyer's Canadian Plan, but no
earlier than 60 days after the Closing Date, the Seller 
shall cause to be transferred from the trustee of the 
Seller's Canadian Plan to the trustee of the Buyer's 
Canadian Plan an amount in cash or in kind (with any 
in-kind transfer to be agreed upon by Seller and Buyer) 
equal to the aggregate account balances of such Continuing
Employees under the Seller's Canadian Plan determined as of
the Closing Date in accordance with the methods of
valuation set forth in the Seller's Canadian Plan. If the
transfer of an account balance is not permitted under the
applicable law or under the terms of Seller's Canadian
Plan, such account balance shall remain in Seller's
Canadian Plan and the Buyer shall have no responsibility
therefor. From and after the date of permissible
transfers, and except as provided in the preceding
sentence, the Buyer shall cause the Buyer's Canadian Plan
to assume the obligations of the Seller's Canadian Plan
with respect to benefits accrued by such Continuing
Employees under the Seller's Canadian Plan, and the

appropriate to extend coverage under a new or existing

62<PAGE>
pension plan, approved by the U.K. Inland Revenue (the
"Buyer's U.K. Plan"), to the Continuing Employees covered
under the Seller's U.K. Plan as of the Closing Date. Such
Continuing Employees shall be credited with service, for
eligibility and vesting purposes, with the service credited
under the terms of the Seller's U.K. Plan. As soon as is 
practicable following the Closing Date and the 
establishment of the Buyer's U.K. Plan, but no earlier than
60 days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause to
be transferred from the trustee of the Seller's U.K. Plan
to the trustee of the Buyer's U.K. Plan an amount in cash
or kind (with any in-kind transfer to be agreed upon by
Seller and Buyer) equal to the aggregate account balances
of such Continuing Employees under the Seller's U.K. Plan,
taking into account any existing final salary guarantees, 
determined in accordance with the methods of valuation set
forth in the Actuary's Letter executed by an actuary
designated by the Buyer and an actuary designated by the
Seller in the form attached hereto as Schedule 7.7(c).
From and after the date of such transfer, the Buyer shall
cause the Buyer's U.K. Plan to assume the obligations of
the Seller's U.K. Plan with respect to benefits accrued by
the Continuing Employees under the Seller's U.K. Plan, and
the Seller's U.K. Plan shall cease to be responsible

to extend coverage under a new defined contribution plan,
qualified under the laws of South Africa (the "Buyer's

under the Seller's Envirotech Pension Fund (the "Seller's
South Africa Plan"). As soon as practicable following the
Closing Date and the establishment of the Buyer's South

the Seller's South Africa Plan an amount in cash or in kind
(with any in-kind transfer to be agreed upon by the Seller
and the Buyer) an amount equal to the aggregate accrued
benefits under the Seller's South Africa Plan of each

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall make such
arrangements as may be necessary for the Continuing
Employees to remain in the Foreign Plans for such period,
as the Buyer shall elect, of up to 180 days after the
Closing Date (the "Foreign Transition Period"), and the
Buyer shall bear the cost of such coverage for the
Continuing Employees during the Foreign Transition Period
at the contribution rate for each such Foreign Plan being

64<PAGE>
paid by the Seller on the date of this Agreement, unless
such rate is changed (upward or downward) by the Buyer
after the date hereof, in which event the Buyer shall bear
the cost of such coverage for the Continuing Employees
during the Foreign Transition Period at the changed
contribution rate. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
if one or both of the agreements between the Buyer's
actuary and the Seller's actuary contemplated under 
Sections 7.7(c)(ii) and 7.7(c)(vii) provides a mechanism
for cost determination, the provisions of such agreement or
agreements shall control.

(d) Welfare Plans. 

(i) Benefits Continuation. Effective as of the 
Closing, (A) the Seller shall cause each Continuing 
Employee to cease to participate in each welfare benefit
plan sponsored by the Asset Sellers, the Share Sellers
and/or their affiliates (the "Seller's Welfare Plans") and
(B) the Buyer shall cause each such Continuing Employee to
be covered by the welfare benefit plans required to be
provided by the Buyer to the Continuing Employees in
accordance with Section 7.7(a) of this Agreement. 

(ii) Long-Term Disability and Certain Other Benefits.
The Seller shall be liable for claims for benefits (other
than for short-term disability, workers' compensation and
medical (including vision care and prescription drugs) and
dental benefits) by employees of the Business (active or
inactive) and by terminated employees previously employed
in the Business under the Seller's Welfare Plans arising
out of occurrences prior to the Closing Date. In this
regard, but not by way of limiting the foregoing, the
Seller shall be liable for the long-term disability
benefits for those employees of the Business receiving or
eligible to receive long- term disability benefits as of the
Closing Date, including without limitation those employees
of the Business in the long-term disability elimination
period (which employees shall receive long-term disability
benefits from the Seller upon the conclusion of the 
applicable elimination period); provided, however that the
Seller's obligation to provide long-term disability 
benefits shall cease with respect to any such employee of
the Business who subsequently becomes employed by the
Buyer. 

(iii) Short-Term Disability and Workers' Compensation
Benefits. The Seller shall be liable for claims for
short-term disability benefits and workers' compensation
benefits under the Seller's Welfare Plans by employees of

65<PAGE>
the Business (active or inactive) and by terminated
employees previously employed in the Business with respect
to payments otherwise due prior to the Closing Date. The
Buyer shall be liable for claims for short-term disability
benefits and workers' compensation benefits under the
Seller's Welfare Plans by Continuing Employees with respect

terminated employees previously employed in the Business
(and their respective covered dependents) under the
Seller's Welfare Plans with respect to services and
treatment rendered prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that the preceding provisions shall not alter any
deadlines for submission of claims set forth in the
Seller's Welfare Plans or increase any benefits, rights or
remedies of the Continuing Employees under the Seller's
Welfare Plans. The Buyer shall cause each of the
Continuing Employees to be granted credit under the Buyer's
medical and dental plans, for the year during which the
Closing Date occurs, with any deductibles already incurred
by such Continuing Employees for such year under the plans
of the Asset Sellers, the Share Sellers and/or their 
affiliates, but only if and to the extent that the amount
of such incurred deductibles has been provided to the Buyer
within 180 days after the Closing Date, and the Buyer shall
cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition
restrictions under the Buyer's medical and dental plans to
the extent necessary to provide immediate coverage under
the Buyer's medical and dental plans. The Buyer shall make
available to the Continuing Employees (and their covered
dependents) a group health plan (or plans) having a level
of benefits such that the actual coverage of a Continuing 
Employee (or any of his or her covered dependents) under
such group health plan (or plans) would, if the Continuing
Employee had made an election under Section 4980 B(f) of
the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA with respect to any
group health plan maintained by the Seller, any Asset
Seller or any Share Seller, constitute an event described
in Section 4980B(f)(2)(B)(iv) of the Code and Section
602(2)(D) of ERISA. The Buyer shall have no obligation to
provide health benefits to any Continuing Employee who
declines to be covered under such group health plan (or
plans) and, if the Buyer complies with the requirements of
the preceding sentence, the Buyer shall have no further 
obligation or responsibility to the Seller, any Asset 

66<PAGE>
Seller, any Share Seller or any Continuing Employee under
Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(v) Transition Period. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Seller shall make such arrangements as may
be necessary for the U.S. Continuing Employees to remain as
participants of the Seller's Welfare Plans for a period of
up to 90 days after the Closing Date (as the Buyer shall
elect) and the Buyer shall bear the cost of such coverage
for the U.S. Continuing Employees during such period as
follows:

(i) The Buyer shall pay the out-of-pocket cost of actual
claims for the U.S. Continuing Employees (and their
covered dependents) incurred and paid after the
Closing Date under the Seller's Group Medical Benefits
Plan and Group Dental Plan plus an administrative fee
of 7.5% of actual claims; and

(ii) The Buyer shall pay the premium cost for participation
of the U.S. Continuing Employees (and their covered
dependents) in any HMO's and in any other of the
Seller's Welfare Plans other than the Seller's Group
Medical Benefits Plan and Group Dental Plan.

(e) Retiree Medical, Dental and Life Benefits. The Seller
shall be liable for medical, dental and life insurance coverage
under the Seller's Welfare Plans after termination of employment
to employees of the Business whose employment terminated prior
to the Closing Date and to those employees of the Business who
are eligible therefor as of the Closing Date. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller agrees to notify all employees of the
Business that such coverage for all employees of the Business
will be terminated upon the Closing Date and that coverage for
the Continuing Employees described in the preceding sentence 
will be provided by the Seller upon retirement from the Buyer
and/or its affiliates. The Buyer agrees to provide notice to
the Seller of such retirements for purposes of the preceding
sentence.

(f) Severance Arrangements. Effective as of the Closing
Date, the Buyer and/or its affiliates shall provide to the U.S.
Continuing Employees severance benefits under the Buyer's
various severance benefit plans and arrangements commensurate
with the severance benefits provided to similarly situated
employees of the Buyer under such severance benefit plans and
arrangements, and shall cause to be recognized under the Buyer's
various severance benefit plans and arrangements all service by

67<PAGE>
the Continuing Employees recognized under the Seller's severance
plans in effect on the Closing Date with respect to the
Continuing Employees as described in Schedule 7.7(f) (the
"Seller's Severance Plans"). 

(g) Incentive Bonus Plan. Effective as of the Closing 
Date, the Buyer or the Foreign Companies shall assume the 
liabilities and obligations under the Baker Hughes Incentive 
Bonus Plan, consisting solely of the letter agreements, as 
amended, with certain executive employees of the Business listed
on Schedule 7.7(g) (which letter agreements provide for bonuses
based solely on the regular operations of the Business through
the Closing Date and not the sale of the Business or any other
event not in the Ordinary Course of Business), to the extent of
the accruals and reserves therefor shown in the financial and
accounting records of the Business at the Closing Date (to the
extent that such accruals and reserves have been determined in a
manner consistent with the Seller's past practices in
establishing the accruals and reserves therefor set forth on the
Balance Sheet).

(h) Multiemployer Plans. The Buyer, the Foreign Companies
and/or their affiliates shall not assume any obligation or
liability imposed under Section 4201 of ERISA. The Buyer, the
Foreign Companies and/or their affiliates shall not be obligated
under any agreement described in Section 4204 of ERISA. 

(i) VEBA. Any assets in the Baker Hughes Incorporated 
Employees Benefit Trust ("VEBA") as of the Closing Date 
attributable to the Business shall inure to the benefit of the
remaining eligible employees (other than the Continuing 
Employees) benefiting under the VEBA.

(j) No Third Party Rights. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Agreement, the parties hereto do not intend to
create any third party beneficiary rights respecting any
Employee or former employee as a result of the provisions herein
and specifically hereby negate any such intention. Without
intending to limit the generality of the preceding sentence,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall, under any
circumstances whatsoever, be construed as, expressly or
impliedly, constituting or creating any employment contract,
offer of employment, promise of continuing employment, promise
of employee benefits or other obligation of any other kind of or
by the Buyer to, or in favor of, any employees of the Business,
and the Buyer, the Foreign Companies, and/or their affiliates 
expressly disclaim any and all liability to any such third party
arising out of this Agreement.

68<PAGE>
(k) Limitation on the Buyer's Liability. The Buyer shall
have no liability with respect to the following:

(i) Any claims for benefits under the Seller's 
Welfare Plans specifically assumed by the Seller, the Asset
Sellers, the Share Sellers or their affiliates or for which
this Agreement provides that the Seller, the Asset Sellers,
the Share Sellers and/or their affiliates shall be liable
or would be liable if such claims were timely submitted.

(ii) The provision of medical, dental, life insurance
or other benefits under Seller's Welfare Plans to any
employee of the Business whose employment terminated prior
to the Closing Date or as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to any Continuing

provided in Section 7.7(d)(iii) or as may be required under
Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or
by applicable state law.

(iii) Any severance benefits arising under any of the
Plans or Foreign Plans, the Seller's Severance Plan, any

sale of the Business or any other event not in the Ordinary
Course of Business.

7.8 Retention of Records and Sharing of Data. 

(a) The Buyer shall and shall cause each Foreign Company,
each Foreign Division and each Domestic Business to retain for a
period of seven years after the Closing Date or longer if
required by any applicable statute of limitations the books and
records relating to the Business transferred pursuant to this
Agreement (unless the Seller requests a longer period, in which
case such books and records shall be stored by the Buyer at the
Seller's expense), and, during normal business hours, with
reasonable advance notice and in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the normal business operations of the Buyer,
to (i) give the Seller and its authorized representatives
reasonable access to the books, records, offices and other
facilities and properties of the Foreign Companies, Foreign
Divisions and Domestic Businesses relating to the operation of
the Business prior to the Closing Date, (ii) permit the Seller
to make such inspections (and copies of any documents at the
Seller's expense) thereof as the Seller may reasonably request,
and (iii) furnish the Seller with such financial and operating 
data and other information relating to the Seller's 
responsibilities with respect to the business, operations and

69<PAGE>
properties of the Business prior to the Closing Date as the
Seller may from time to time reasonably request, including data
and information needed for financial and tax reporting and
statutory filings. 

(b) The Seller shall and shall cause each Share Seller and
Asset Seller to retain for a period of seven years after the
Closing Date (or longer if required by any applicable statute of
limitations) the books and records relating to the Business that
are retained by the Seller, any Share Seller or any Asset Seller
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (unless the Buyer
requests a longer period, in which case such books and records
shall be stored by the Seller at the Buyer's expense), and,
during normal business hours, with reasonable advance notice and
in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal
operations of the business of the Share Sellers and Asset

applicable securities, tax, environmental, employment or other
Laws and Regulations. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Seller shall make available to the Buyer such
financial information and reasonable assistance with respect to
the Business as is reasonably necessary for the Buyer to prepare
on a timely basis the financial statements required by Item 2 of
Form 8-K with respect to the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement (it being understood that the Buyer anticipates 
needing to prepare two sets of financial statements, one for the
combined operations of Ramsey Technologies and Epsilon 
Industrial and one for the combined operations of the Business
excluding Ramsey Technologies and Epsilon Industrial).

(c) Promptly upon request by the Buyer made at any during
the three-year period following the Closing Date, the Seller
shall authorize the release to the Buyer of all files pertaining
to the Business held by any Governmental Body. 

7.9 Tax Matters. Contingent upon the occurrence of the 
Closing: 

70<PAGE>
(a) Liability.

(i) Except as provided in Section 4.4 hereof and
Section 7.9(a)(ii) below, the Seller shall be liable for 
any and all claims, losses, liabilities, obligations, 
damages, impositions, assessments, demands, judgments, 
settlements, costs and expenses (including reasonable 
attorneys', accountants' and experts' fees and expenses and
any applicable assessments of interest and penalties) with
respect to Taxes (other than Interim Period Operating
Taxes) attributable to the Business or for which any
Foreign Company may be liable with respect to any and all
periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the
Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Periods"); provided, however, 
that Seller shall only be liable for any such Taxes to the
extent that the aggregate amount of such Taxes exceeds the
aggregate amount of the reserves and accruals for Taxes set
forth on the Balance Sheet (other than the reserves and 
accruals set forth on the Balance Sheet under the caption
"Deferred Income Taxes"). 

(ii) Except as provided in Section 4.4 hereof, the 
Buyer shall be liable for any and all claims, losses, 
liabilities, obligations, damages, impositions, 
assessments, demands, judgments, settlements, costs and 
expenses (including reasonable attorneys', accountants' and
experts' fees and expenses and any applicable assessments
of interest and penalties) with respect to (A) Taxes
attributable to the Business with respect to any and all
periods, or portions thereof, beginning after the Closing
Date ("Post-Closing Periods"), (B) Interim Period Operating
Taxes and (C) Taxes (other than Interim Period Operating
Taxes) attributable to the Business with respect to any and
all Pre-Closing Periods to the extent that the aggregate
amount of such Taxes is equal to or less than the aggregate
amount of the reserves and accruals for Taxes set forth on
the Balance Sheet other than under the caption "Deferred 
Income Taxes".

(iii) In the case of any Tax that is attributable to a
period which includes two or more of (x) a Pre-Closing
Period exclusive of all or any portion of the Interim
Period included in such Pre-Closing Period, (y) an Interim
Period or applicable portion thereof or (z) a Post-Closing
Period, for purposes of determining the amount of such Tax
that is attributable to a Pre-Closing Period versus a
Post-Closing Period or to the Interim Period versus a
period other than the Interim Period (any of the foregoing
periods being hereinafter referred to as a "Relevant

71<PAGE>
Period"), the following rules shall apply:

(A) In the case of ad valorem Taxes imposed on
the Assets or any Domestic Asset Seller, any Foreign
Division Seller or any Foreign Company and franchise
or similar Taxes imposed on any Foreign Company
based on capital (including net worth or long-term
debt) or number of shares of stock authorized,
issued or outstanding, the portion attributable to
each Relevant Period shall be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the Relevant Period and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire taxable
period.

(B) In the case of any Tax not described in 
Section 7.9(a)(iii)(A) above, the portion 
attributable to each Relevant Period shall be 
determined on the basis of an interim closing of the
books of the Foreign Company, Foreign Division or
Domestic Business as of the end of the last day of
each Relevant Period. For purposes of this Section
7.9(a)(iii)(B), the liability for such Tax with
respect to the Relevant Period shall be the product
of (i) such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the hypothetical Tax for such Relevant
Period (determined on the basis of such interim
closing of the books, without annualization) and the
denominator of which is the sum of such numerator
plus the aggregate amount of the hypothetical Tax
for each other Relevant Period (determined on the
basis of such interim closing of the books, without
annualization) contained in the taxable period. The
hypothetical Tax for any period shall in no case be
less than zero. 

(b) Cooperation.

(i) The Buyer will grant or cause to be granted 
to the Seller or the Seller's representatives reasonable
access to all of the information, books and records
relating to the Business within its possession or control
(including, without limitation, Tax work papers, Tax
Returns and correspondence with taxing authorities),
including the right to take extracts therefrom and make
copies thereof at the Seller's expense, to the extent
reasonably necessary in connection with Taxes of, or
attributable to, the Business attributable to Pre-Closing

72<PAGE>
Periods and shall furnish the cooperation of such personnel
and affiliates of the Buyer as the Seller may reasonably 
request in connection therewith; provided, however, that
such access shall be allowed only during normal business
hours, with reasonable advance notice and in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the normal business
operations of the Buyer. Without limiting the generality
of the preceding sentence, and with respect to any Tax
Return of the Seller, any Asset Seller, any Share Seller,
any Foreign Company or any of their respective affiliates
that includes any Pre- Closing Period of the Business, the
Buyer agrees to make available to the Seller, on a basis
consistent with the information required by the Seller to
be furnished to it by its subsidiaries and other 
affiliates, all information within the Buyer's possession
or control which may be reasonably necessary to prepare any
such Tax Return and such other information relating to the
Business as the Seller shall reasonably request from time
to time. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
sentence, the Buyer agrees to prepare and deliver to the
Seller all of the Tax packages relating to the Business and
furnished by the Seller to the Buyer in connection with 
the Seller's preparation of any such Tax Return that 
includes a Pre-Closing Period of the Business (which Tax 
packages shall be furnished to the Buyer in a manner 
consistent with the Seller's past practices in furnishing
Tax packages to the Business), including without limitation
the international and domestic Tax packages for the short
period beginning on October 1, 1993 and ending on the
Closing Date, which the Buyer shall use its best efforts to
complete and deliver to the Seller no later than September
30, 1994; provided, however, that if the Seller shall have
delivered a written notice or instruction to the Buyer
specifying a later date for completion of such Tax package,
the Buyer shall use its best efforts to complete and 
deliver to the Seller such Tax package no later than such
later date; provided further, however, that notwithstanding
anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this
sentence to the contrary, the Seller shall be entitled to
deliver a written notice or instruction to the Buyer
specifying a date for completion and delivery of such Tax
package, or portion thereof, by the Buyer to the Seller
that is earlier than September 30, 1994 to the extent the
due date for filing the Tax Return to which such Tax
package, or a portion thereof, relates makes it necessary
or advisable that such Tax package, or portion thereof, be
completed by such earlier date, in which case the Buyer 
shall use all reasonable efforts to complete and deliver to

73<PAGE>
the Seller such Tax package no later than such earlier
date. 

(ii) The Seller, the Asset Sellers and the Share 
Sellers will grant or cause to be granted to the Buyer or
the Buyer's representatives reasonable access to all of the
information, books and records relating to the Business
(including, without limitation, Tax work papers, Tax
Returns and correspondence with taxing authorities) within
the possession or control of the Seller, any Share Seller
or any Asset Seller, including the right to take extracts
therefrom and make copies thereof at the expense of the
Buyer, to the extent reasonably necessary in connection
with Post-Closing Period Taxes and Pre-Closing Period Taxes
for which the Buyer may be liable pursuant to Section
7.9(a)(ii) hereof, and shall furnish the assistance and 
cooperation of such personnel of the Seller, the Share 
Sellers and the Asset Sellers as the Buyer may reasonably
request in connection therewith; provided, however, that
such access shall be allowed only during normal business
hours, with reasonable advance notice and in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the normal business
operations of the Seller, the Share Sellers or the Asset
Sellers.

(iii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 7.9(b), the Seller (and each
Share Seller and Asset Seller) and the Buyer shall
cooperate and consult in good faith with each other during
the course of the preparation of foreign, federal, state
and local income Tax Returns which include Pre-Closing
Periods and to the extent appropriate shall use their best
efforts to agree on the inclusion of items of income,
deduction, gain, loss and credit for each Pre-Closing
Period so as to properly reflect such items attributable to
such Pre-Closing Period in a manner consistent with past
practices.

(c)Tax Contests.

(i) If any taxing authority proposes any 
adjustment or questions the treatment of any item, which
adjustment or question could, if pursued successfully,
result in or give rise to solely a claim (a "Seller Tax
Claim") against the Seller by the Buyer under Section
7.9(a), solely a claim (a "Buyer Tax Claim") against the
Buyer by the Seller under Section 7.9(a), or both a Seller
Tax Claim and a Buyer Tax Claim (a "Joint Tax Claim"), then
the party hereto first receiving notice of such adjustment
or question (a "Tax Dispute") shall

74<PAGE>
promptly notify the other party hereto in writing of such
Tax Dispute.

(ii) In the case of either a Seller Tax Claim or a 
Buyer Tax Claim, other than a Joint Tax Claim, that relates
to a taxable period that ended on or before the Closing
Date, the Seller shall have the right, at its sole cost and
expense, to control the defense, prosecution, settlement or
compromise of the Tax Dispute underlying such Seller Tax
Claim or Buyer Tax Claim; provided, however, that in any
event the Seller shall not, without the Buyer's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), enter into any settlement or compromise of such
Tax Dispute that would require a payment of more than 
$5,000. In the case of a Seller Tax Claim that relates to
a Foreign Company with respect to a taxable period that
begins on or before the Closing Date and ends after the
Closing Date, and subject to the provisions of this Section
7.9(c)(ii), the Buyer shall have the right, at its sole
cost and expense, to control the defense, prosecution,
settlement and/or compromise of the Tax Dispute underlying
such Seller Tax Claim; provided, however, that if such Tax
Dispute relates to a Tax Return, or a taxable period of,
any of the Seller, the Asset Sellers, the Share Sellers or
any of their respective affiliates (including, without 
limitation, a Tax Dispute that relates to such a Tax Return
by reason of the inclusion therein of the Business or any
portion thereof), the Seller shall have the right, at any
time and at its election, to exercise full control over the
defense, prosecution, settlement or compromise of such Tax
Dispute if such defense, prosecution, settlement or
compromise would have a material adverse effect on the
defense, prosecution, settlement or compromise of any other
liability for, or issue concerning, Taxes of the Seller,
the Asset Sellers, the Share Sellers or any of their
respective affiliates, but if the Seller elects to exercise
such control, the Seller will not, without the Buyer's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld), enter into any settlement or 
compromise of such Tax Dispute that would have a material
adverse effect on the business, assets, properties,
financial condition or results of operations of any
Principal Business Unit; and provided further, however,
that in any event, the Buyer will not, without the Seller's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), enter into any settlement or
compromise of such Tax Dispute that would require a payment
of more than $5,000.

75<PAGE>
(iii) In the case of any Seller Tax Claim, Buyer Tax
Claim or Joint Tax Claim relating to a Post-Closing Period,
the Buyer shall have the right, at its sole cost and
expense, to control the defense, prosecution, settlement or
compromise of the Tax Dispute underlying such Tax Claim.

(iv) In the case of a Joint Tax Claim not described in
Section 7.9(c)(iii) above, the Buyer and the Seller shall
consult and cooperate with each other in good faith in
order to effectively defend, prosecute, settle or
compromise the Tax Dispute underlying such Joint Tax Claim
and to mutually agree on the handling thereof; provided,
however, that in no event will such Tax Dispute be settled
or compromised in a manner that would have a material
adverse effect on a party hereto without the prior written
consent of such party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). Each of the Seller and the Buyer
shall pay its own costs and expenses relating to the
handling of any Tax Dispute underlying a Joint Tax Claim.

(v) The party hereto that controls a Tax Dispute 
under the provisions of Section 7.9(c)(ii) or 7.9(c)(iii)
shall keep the other party hereto informed of all events
and developments relating to such Tax Dispute and the other
party hereto, or its authorized representatives, shall be
entitled, at its own expense, to attend (but not control)
all conferences, meetings and proceedings relating to such
Tax Dispute.

(d) No Carrybacks. The Buyer agrees that to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, neither the Buyer nor any of
the Buyer's affiliates or subsidiary corporations (including,
with respect to Post-Closing Periods, the Foreign Companies, the
Foreign Divisions and the Domestic Businesses) will carry back
to any taxable period of the Seller or any of its subsidiaries
or affiliates (including, with respect to Pre-Closing Periods, 
the Foreign Companies, the Foreign Divisions and the Domestic
Businesses) any loss, credit, or deduction incurred or generated
in, or attributable to, any Post-Closing Period that would
affect any Tax Return of the Seller or any of its subsidiaries
or affiliates, and the Buyer agrees to make or exercise, or
cause to be made or exercised, any and all necessary or
permitted elections or options available under applicable law to
avoid any such carry back.

(e) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. Except as 
provided in this Agreement, any and all Tax allocation 
agreements, Tax sharing agreements, intercompany agreements, or
other agreements or arrangements to which any of the Foreign

76<PAGE>
Companies, Foreign Divisions or Domestic Businesses are parties
and relating to any Tax matters shall be terminated with respect
to the Foreign Companies, Foreign Divisions and Domestic
Businesses as of the day before the Closing Date, and from and
after the Closing Date will have no further force or effect for
any taxable period (whether current, future, or past taxable
periods).

(f) Post-Closing Events Affecting Section 1248 Amounts and
Foreign Taxes Paid. 

(i) The Buyer agrees not to take, or cause or be
taken, any of the following actions in respect of any of
the Foreign Companies that would have the effect of 
reducing the earnings and profits of any Foreign Company
for its taxable year in which the Closing Date occurs below
the level that would otherwise be attributable to the stock
of such Foreign Company under Section 1248 of the Code if
such taxable year had ended on the Closing Date: (A) the
payment of an actual or constructive dividend; (B) the
triggering of a deemed dividend under Section 956 of the
Code; (C) a sale of stock subject to Section 304 of the
Code; (D) the reorganization of a Foreign Company; and (E)
changes in accounting methods. 

(ii) The Buyer agrees (A) to use reasonable efforts to
avoid any reduction in the amount of foreign Income Taxes
paid by any of the Foreign Companies for Pre-Closing
Periods and (B) if a net operating loss is incurred by a
Foreign Company (or an affiliate of the Buyer), to elect to
forego any carryback of such loss to Pre-Closing Periods of
the Foreign Company if local law provides an election to
use the amount of such loss as a carryforward. If a net
operating loss is incurred by a Foreign Company (or an
affiliate of the Buyer) that is required to be carried back
and results in a reduction in the foreign Taxes paid by a
Foreign Company during a Pre-Closing Period, the Buyer will
pay to the Seller an amount equal to any disallowance of 
the amount of any foreign tax credits (within the meaning
of Subpart A of Part III of Subchapter N of the Code)
previously claimed by the Seller to the extent such
disallowance is attributable to the portion of the 
aggregate reduction in foreign Tax paid equal to the 
excess, if any, of the aggregate reduction over the 
aggregate reduction that would have resulted if (x) the 
deductions, if any, attributable to the acquisition 
financing incurred in acquiring the Business were zero, and
(y) the net operating loss carrybacks, if any, of 
affiliates of the Buyer were zero. 

77<PAGE>
(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
expressed or implied herein, the Buyer shall not make any
election under Section 338 of the Code; provided, however,
that the Buyer may make such election and shall not be
liable to the Seller, any Asset Seller or any Share Seller
for any increases in any Taxes payable by any of them as a
result of such election if such election is necessary in
order for the Buyer to obtain (as of the Closing Date) an
adjusted basis in the Assets for federal income tax
purposes equal to the purchase price of such Assets. 

(g) Disputes. Disputes between the Buyer and the Seller
with respect to any item covered by this Section 7.9 (including
the amount of any payments due to the other party or to a taxing
authority) shall be resolved as promptly as possible. A dispute
shall be deemed to exist to the extent one party does not
affirmatively agree with the position held by the other party.
In the event of a dispute, the party disputing the position
taken by the other party shall notify such other party of the
dispute within 10 days of being notified of such other party's
position. If such dispute is not resolved within 30 days of the
receipt of such notice, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant
to the procedures set forth in Section 4.1(d) hereof. 

(h) Payments. Any payment required under this Section 7.9
shall be made by the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, in
immediately available funds and no later than 10 days following
the receipt of notice from the other party of the amount due.
Any payment not made when due under this Section 7.9 shall bear
interest, compounded monthly on the last day of each calendar
month, from the due date at an interest rate equal to the prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. as announced from time to time. 

(i) Survival of Agreements. All covenants and agreements
set forth in this Section 7.9 shall survive the Closing Date
until 20 calendar days after the expiration of all applicable
statutes of limitation (including any and all extensions
thereof).

(j) Conflict. In the event of a conflict between the 
provisions of this Section 7.9 and other provisions of this 
Agreement, the provisions of this Section 7.9 shall control. 

7.10 Insurance. The parties recognize that the Seller has 
obtained various insurance policies (the "Policies") from carriers
(the "Carriers") providing insurance coverages for businesses
conducted by the Seller, its subsidiaries and companies associated
therewith. The parties also recognize that included in the assets of
the Business are applicable rights (subject to certain obligations)

78<PAGE>
under existing Policies arranged for by the Seller in respect of the
Business (including the insured's right to defense and indemnity by
the Carrier, subject to the insured's duty to give notice and
cooperate and the insured's liability for deductible amounts, defense
costs, premiums and administrative fees) and that, to the extent so 
provided under the terms and conditions of individual Policies, 
certain elements of such insurance coverages for periods prior to the
Closing Date may survive thereafter for the benefit of the Business
and the Buyer. 

7.11 Certain Trademark Matters. 

(a) The Buyer and the Seller shall, at the Closing, enter
into a Trademark License Agreement with respect to the 
"ENVIROTECH", the "ENVIROTECH" logo, "BAKER CAC" and "TRACOR 
EUROPA" marks substantially in the form attached hereto as 
Exhibit E (the "Trademark License Agreement"). 

(b) The Seller agrees, for itself and on behalf of its 
subsidiaries and affiliates, not to use, after the Closing Date,
any trademark (other than "ENVIROTECH", the "ENVIROTECH" logo,
"BAKER CAC" and "TRACOR EUROPA") previously or currently used in
the Business or any trademark or name confusingly similar to any
of the foregoing. The Seller shall promptly amend the
certificate of incorporation and other corporate records of its
subsidiaries and affiliates as necessary to comply with this 
provision.

7.12 Notice of Breaches; Updates. 

(a) The Seller shall promptly deliver to the Buyer written
notice of any event or development that would (i) render any
statement, representation or warranty of the Seller in this
Agreement (including exceptions set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule) inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, or
(ii) constitute or result in a breach by the Seller of, or a
failure by the Seller to comply with, any agreement or covenant
in this Agreement applicable to the Seller. No such disclosure
shall be deemed to avoid or cure any such misrepresentation or
breach.

(b) The Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Seller written
notice of any event or development that would (i) render any
statement, representation or warranty of the Buyer in this
Agreement inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, or
(ii) constitute or result in a breach by the Buyer of, or a
failure by the Buyer to comply with, any agreement or covenant
in this Agreement applicable to the Buyer. No such disclosure
shall be deemed to avoid or cure any such misrepresentation or
breach.

79<PAGE>
(c) The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer, as promptly as
practicable following the end of each calendar month ending
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date,
and in any event at least as soon as made available internally
within the Buyer, an unaudited combined statement of operations
of the Business, and such other internal financial information
as is ordinarily prepared by the Seller with respect to the
Business, for such month, in each case prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except for the absence of footnotes). 

7.13 Proprietary Information. From and after the Closing, the
Seller shall, and shall cause the Asset Sellers, the Share Sellers
and its other affiliates to, hold in confidence all knowledge,
information and documents of a confidential nature or not generally
known to the public with respect to the Business or the Buyer or the
Buyer's business (including without limitation the financial
information, technical information or data relating to the products
of the Business and the names of customers of the Business) and shall
not disclose or make use of the same without the written consent of
the Buyer, except to the extent that such knowledge, information or
documents shall have become public knowledge other than through a
breach of this Agreement by the Seller. 

7.14 Solicitation and Hiring. For a period of two years after
the Closing Date, the Seller shall not, and shall cause its 
affiliates not to, either directly or indirectly as a stockholder,
investor, partner, director, officer, employee or otherwise, (a)
solicit or attempt to induce any Restricted Employee to terminate his

or her employment with the Buyer or any affiliate of the Buyer or (b)
hire or attempt to hire any Restricted Employee; provided, however,
that it shall not be a breach of this Section 7.14 for the Seller to
place employment advertisements in newspapers and other mass media
and to hire Restricted Employees (other than Restricted Employees
whose annual rate of compensation (including for this purpose any
bonus expected to be earned for the current year) exceeds $80,000 as
of the date of this Agreement) who respond to such advertisements. 
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Restricted Employee" shall mean
any person, other than employees terminated by the Buyer, who either
(i) was an employee of the Buyer or any affiliate of the Buyer on
either the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date or (ii) was an
employee of the Seller or any Foreign Division, Domestic Business or
Foreign Company on either the date of this Agreement or the Closing
Date and, if an employee of a Foreign Division or Domestic Business,
received an employment offer from the Buyer within five business days
following the Closing Date. 

80<PAGE>
7.15 Non-Competition.

(a) For a period of five years after the Closing Date, the
Seller shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, either
directly or indirectly as a stockholder, investor, partner,
director, officer, employee, consultant or otherwise, (i)
develop, manufacture, market or sell any product which is
competitive with any product manufactured, sold or developed (or
under development) by the Business on or prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) render or market any service which is competitive
with any service rendered or marketed by the Business on or
prior to the Closing Date, or (iii) engage in any business
competitive with the Business as conducted on the date of this
Agreement or as of the Closing Date, in the U.S. or any other
country in which the Business was conducted during the two years
prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that it shall not
be a breach of this Section 7.15(a) for the Seller to make an
acquisition (whether by purchase of assets, stock or otherwise)
of an interest in, or any investment in, in either case whether
directly or indirectly, any business or entity that derives 20%
or less of its gross revenues from activities described in the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), so long as the portion or
portions of the acquired or investee business or entity that
derives revenues from activities described in the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) is sold or otherwise divested within
18 months after the date of such acquisition or investment. 

(b) The Seller agrees that the duration and geographic 
scope of the non-competition provision set forth in this Section
7.15 are reasonable. In the event that any court determines
that the duration or the geographic scope, or both, are
unreasonable and that such provision is to that extent
unenforceable, the parties agree that the provision shall remain
in full force and effect for the greatest time period and in the
greatest area that would not render it unenforceable. The
parties intend that this non-competition provision shall be
deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one for each and
every county of each and every state of the U.S. and each and
every political subdivision of each and every country outside
the U.S. where this provision is intended to be effective.

7.16 Cooperation in Litigation. From and after the Closing 
Date, each party shall fully cooperate with the other in the defense
or prosecution of any litigation or proceeding already instituted or
which may be instituted hereafter against or by such other party
relating to or arising out of the conduct of the Business by the
Seller or the Buyer or their respective affiliates prior to or after
the Closing Date (other than litigation arising out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). The party requesting such

81<PAGE>
cooperation shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in providing such cooperation (including legal fees and
disbursements) by the party providing such cooperation and by its
officers, directors, employees and agents, but shall not be
responsible for reimbursing such party or its officers, directors,
employees and agents for their time spent in such cooperation.

7.17 Collection of Accounts Receivable. The Seller agrees that
it shall, and shall cause the Share Sellers and the Asset Sellers to,
forward promptly to the Buyer any monies, checks or instruments
received by any of them after the Closing Date with respect to the
accounts receivable purchased by the Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement. The Seller shall, and shall cause the Share Sellers and
the Asset Sellers to, provide to the Buyer such reasonable assistance
as the Buyer may request with respect to the collection of any such
accounts receivable, provided the Buyer pays the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of the Seller and its officers, directors and
employees incurred in providing such assistance. 

7.18 Estoppel Certificates. The Seller shall use its best 
efforts to obtain and deliver to the Buyer, prior to the Closing, an
estoppel certificate in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit F for each of the leases listed on Schedule 7.18 (the 
"Principal Leases"); provided, however, that the Seller shall not be
required to make any payments to any person from whom an estoppel
certificate is requested in consideration of the issuance thereof.
Such estoppel certificates shall disclose no material default by the
landlord or the tenant under such Principal Leases and shall not
contain any information which is inconsistent with the Seller's
representations and warranties with respect to such Principal Leases
set forth in Section 5.11 hereof. 

7.19 Non-Disturbance Agreements. The Seller shall use its best
efforts to obtain and deliver to the Buyer, prior to the Closing, a

of each mortgage, deed of trust, superior security interest and
ground lease in connection with each Principal Lease; provided,
however, that the Seller shall not be required to make any payments
to any person from whom a Subordination, Nondisturbance and
Attornment Agreement is requested in consideration of the issuance
thereof. 

7.20 Master Service Agreements. With respect to products 
actually sold or contracted to be sold by the Business prior to the
Closing under master service agreements to which the Seller is a
party ("Master Service Agreements"), the Seller shall, commencing on
the Closing Date and continuing for the duration of the Master
Service Agreements, use reasonable efforts to (i) provide to the
Buyer the benefits of the Master Service Agreements, (ii)cooperate
with the

82<PAGE>
Buyer to reach a reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to
provide such benefits to the Buyer during such period and (iii)
enforce at the request of the Buyer, or allow the Buyer to enforce
(and, solely for such purpose, the Seller hereby constitutes and
appoints the Buyer as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact until
revoked in writing delivered by the Seller to the Buyer), any rights
of the Seller under the Master Service Agreements against the other
party or parties thereto (including the right to elect to terminate
such of the foregoing in accordance with the terms thereof upon the 
request of the Buyer); provided, however, that the reasonable costs
and expenses of the Seller incurred at the Buyer's request with
respect to any of the actions contemplated under (iii) above shall be
promptly paid or reimbursed by the Buyer to the Seller. 

7.21 Mountain View Premises. The Buyer shall have the right,
exercisable upon written notice to the Seller at any time prior to or
at the Closing, to exclude from the Assets the lease (the "Mountain
View Lease") under which Spectrace Instruments, Inc. leases the
premises at 345 East Middlefield Road, Mountain View, California (the
"Mountain View Premises"). In the event that the Buyer elects to
exclude the Mountain View Lease from the Assets, then, effective as
of the Closing:

(i) the Mountain View Premises shall not constitute Leased Real Estate
and the Mountain View Lease shall be deleted from Schedule
5.11;

(ii) for a period of six months after the Closing, the Buyer shall pay
the Seller $12,500 per month and shall reimburse the
Seller for all real estate taxes, operating expenses and
other similar operating costs arising after the Closing
Date specified to be paid by the tenant in the Mountain
View Lease as it exists on the date hereof; and 

(iii) the Seller shall cooperate reasonably with the Buyer in making
arrangements for the relocation of the operations of the
Business conducted at the Mountain View Premises promptly
after the Closing.

7.22 Termination of Certain Business Relationships. Effective
as the Closing, the Seller shall terminate or cause the termination
of all contracts, understandings, commitments and agreements listed
on Schedule 5.30. 

7.23 Round Rock Property. 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall use its best
efforts to subdivide the 12.5 acre hazardous waste storage
facility located in Round Rock, Texas adjacent to the 
TNTechnologies facility described on Schedule 5.11 (the 

83<PAGE>
"Round Rock Property") from the undivided land of which it is a
part. In the event the Seller is unable to subdivide the Round
Rock Property prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Seller
shall, at the Closing, enter into a lease (the "Round Rock
Lease") of the Round Rock Property (i) having a term of 99 years,
(ii) requiring the Buyer to pay rent of $1.00 per year to the
Seller, and (iii) requiring the Buyer to be responsible for all
real estate taxes, operating expenses and other operating costs
arising after the Closing Date associated with the Round Rock
Property. 

(b) The Seller shall inform the Buyer in writing at least
five business days prior to the Closing whether the Seller will
have subdivided the Round Rock Property prior to the Closing. If
such notice states that the Seller will not be able to subdivide
the Round Rock Property prior to the Closing, such notice shall
be accompanied by the proposed form of Round Rock Lease, which
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, and the Buyer and
the Seller shall use their respective best efforts to agree on
the final form of the Round Rock Lease prior to the Closing.
Upon the execution of the Round Rock Lease at the Closing, (i)
the Round Rock Lease shall be deemed to be a Seller Lease, (ii) 
the Round Rock Property shall be deemed to be part of the 
Seller's Leased Facilities and (iii) the Round Rock Property 
shall no longer be deemed to be part of the Assets or Seller's
Real Estate.

(c) If the Round Rock Property is not subdivided prior to
the Closing, from and after the Closing the Seller shall continue
to use its best efforts to subdivide the Round Rock Property. If
the Seller is able to subdivide the Round Rock Property within 99
years after the Closing, the Seller shall convey the Round Rock
Property to the Buyer without the payment of any further
consideration by the Seller. Upon such conveyance, the Round
Rock Lease shall automatically terminate, and the Round Rock
Property shall thereafter be deemed to be part of the Assets and
the Seller's Real Estate.

judgment, order, decree, stipulation or injunction would (i) cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be rescinded
following consummation, (ii) subject the Buyer to damages in excess
of $2,000,000 or (iii) affect adversely the right of the Buyer to

acquires insurance to provide for such deductible amount. The Buyer
further acknowledges that if the Endorsement is exhausted by the

89<PAGE>
suffered by the Buyer or any affiliate of the Buyer resulting from,
relating to or constituting:

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty of the 
Seller contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that the

to (i) the matters set forth in the memorandum prepared by the
Buyer dated December 1, 1993 and entitled "Financial
Deficiencies/Required Adjustments Ramsey Technology, Inc." or
(ii) overstatement of inventory on the Balance Sheet resulting

incurred or suffered by the Seller or any affiliate thereof resulting

(a) Except as provided in Section 11.3(d)(ii), each 
party's obligation to indemnify the other for Losses arising 
under Section 11.1(a) or Section 11.2(a), as the case may be, 
shall be limited as to amount, as follows:

(i) The Indemnitor shall not be required to 
indemnify the Indemnitee for any Losses except to the

90<PAGE>
extent that the amount of such Losses, when added to the
aggregate amount of all other Losses indemnifiable under
this Section 11, exceeds $2,500,000; 

(ii) To the extent that the amount of any Losses, 
which when added to the aggregate amount of all other 
Losses indemnifiable under this Section 11 exceeds 
$2,500,000, the Indemnitor shall indemnify the Indemnitee
for such Losses in excess of $2,500,000 and less than
$65,000,000; and

(iii) The Indemnitor shall not be required to indemnify
the Indemnitee for any Losses which, when added to the
aggregate amount of all other Losses indemnifiable under
this Section 11, exceed $65,000,000.

(b) Any indemnifiable liability or reimbursement under 
this Section 11 shall be limited to the amount of Losses 
sustained by the Indemnitee net of any applicable insurance 
payment made to or tax benefit received by the Indemnitee.

(c) Except as provided in Section 7.9(i) and Section
11.3(d)(i), neither the Seller nor the Buyer shall be entitled to
make any claim for indemnification arising under Section 11.1(a)
or Section 11.2(a), as the case may be, after the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, unless the Seller or the Buyer,
as the case may be, shall have asserted such claim for
indemnification prior to such date, in which event such claim
shall survive until the resolution thereof. If a claim for
indemnification is asserted prior to the applicable expiration
date, then (notwithstanding the expiration of such time period)
the representation or warranty applicable to such claim shall
survive until the resolution of such claim. 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary:

(i) the representations contained in Section 5.2,
Section 5.3, Section 5.4 (to the extent that any 
misrepresentation or breach of warranty arising under 
Section 5.4 relates to the right of any person or entity,
including without limitation any Governmental Body, to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
rescinded following consummation), Section 5.9 and Section
5.28 shall survive without time limit; and 

(ii) subject to the provisions of Section 11.3(a)(i),
the maximum amount of Losses for which an Indemnitor shall
be liable shall be $134,073,923 with respect to Losses
arising from breaches of the representations contained in
Section 4.3, Section 5.2, Section 5.3 and Section 5.4 

91<PAGE>
(to the extent that any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty arising under Section 5.4 relates to the right of
any person or entity, including without limitation any
Governmental Body, to cause the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be rescinded following consummation).

(e) Except with respect to claims based on fraud, the 
rights of the Buyer and the Seller under this Section 11 shall be
the exclusive remedy of the Buyer and the Seller, respectively,
with respect to claims resulting from or relating to any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement of the Seller or the Buyer, respectively,
contained in this Agreement (provided that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall limit or restrict any right or remedy the
Buyer may have under any Environmental Law). 

11.4 Third-Party Claims.

(a) In the event that any legal proceedings shall be 
instituted or any claim or demand shall be asserted by any Person
(a "Third-Party Claim") in respect of which indemnification may
be sought by any party or parties from any other party or parties
under the provisions of this Section 11, the party or parties
seeking indemnification (collectively, the "Indemnitee") shall
cause written notice of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim of
which it has knowledge that is covered by this indemnity to be
forwarded promptly to the party or parties from which
indemnification is sought (collectively, the "Indemnitor");
provided that the failure of an Indemnitee to give timely notice
shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder except to
the extent that the Indemnitor has been damaged by such failure.
The Indemnitor shall have the right, at its option and at its 
own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to
participate in the defense, negotiation and/or settlement of any
Third-Party Claim.

(b) In connection with any Third-Party Claim, the 
Indemnitor, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, may,
upon written notice to the Indemnitee, assume the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim if (x) the Indemnitor acknowledges in
writing the obligation of the Indemnitor to indemnify in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement the Indemnitee with
respect to such Third-Party Claim, (y) the Third-Party Claim
seeks monetary damages solely and (z) an adverse resolution of
the Third-Party Claim would not have a material adverse effect on
the goodwill or reputation of any Principal Business Unit, on the
future conduct of the business of any Principal Business Unit by
the Buyer or its affiliates; provided, however, that the
Indemnitee may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of

92<PAGE>
its choice and at its own expense; and provided further, however,
that if the Indemnitor assumes control of such defense and the 
Indemnitee reasonably concludes that the Indemnitor and the 
Indemnitee have conflicting interests or different defenses 
available with respect to such action, suit or proceeding, the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnitee shall
be considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement. The party
controlling such defense shall keep the other party advised of
the status of such action, suit or proceeding and the defense
thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by
the other party with respect thereto.

(c) The Indemnitee shall not agree to any settlement of
such action, suit or proceeding without the prior written consent
of the Indemnitor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
unless the Indemnitee waives any right to indemnity therefor by
the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a customer or
a supplier of the Business asserts that the Buyer is liable to
such customer or supplier for a monetary or other obligation
which may constitute or result in Losses for which the Buyer may
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 11 and
the Buyer reasonably determines that it has a valid business
reason to fulfill such obligations, then (x) the Buyer shall be
entitled to satisfy such obligation without prior notice to or
consent from the Seller, (y) the Buyer may make a claim for 
indemnification pursuant to this Section 11 and (z) the Buyer 
shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 11, for any such Losses for which is entitled to 
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Section 11; 
provided, however, that if the Buyer makes a claim for 
indemnification in accordance with this sentence the Seller shall
not be deemed to have waived any defense to such claim by the
Buyer, notwithstanding the Buyer's prior satisfaction of the
obligation for which indemnification is sought, and it shall not
be a defense to the Buyer's claim for indemnification that the
Buyer has satisfied the obligation for which indemnification is
sought.

(d) After final judgment or award shall have been rendered
by a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of
competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to
appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall have arrived at a
mutually binding agreement with respect to each separate matter
indemnified by the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall forward to
the Indemnitor notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnitor
with respect to such matter and the Indemnitor shall pay all of
the sums so owing to the Indemnitee by check within 10 days after
the date of such notice.

93<PAGE>
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 11
to the contrary, with respect to the Export Control 
Investigation: (i) the Seller shall retain sole control of the
defense of the Export Control Investigation, unless it fails to
proceed with such defense, in which event such defense may be
assumed by the Buyer at the Seller's sole expense upon written
notice to the Seller; (ii) the Seller shall provide the Buyer
with copies of all correspondence, requests for information,
responses, notices and other written materials sent by or
received by Seller or its counsel promptly after such materials
are sent or received by the Seller or its counsel; (iii) the
Buyer shall be entitled to participate in the Export Control
Investigation, including without limitation through attendance at
all meetings relating to the Export Control Investigation or
negotiations for its settlement or resolution, and the right to
discuss with the Seller's counsel matters relating to the Export
Control Investigation; (iv) to the extent practicable, the Buyer
shall have the right to review and comment on all correspondence
and other written materials to be sent by the Seller or its
counsel with respect to the Export Control Investigation prior to
the time of sending; (v) the Seller shall not agree to any
settlement or other disposition of the Export Control
Investigation without the prior written consent of the Buyer,
unless such settlement or other disposition does not impose any
costs, obligations or restrictions on the Buyer or any of its
affiliates and could not have a material adverse effect on the
future conduct of the business of any Principal Business Unit or
the conduct of the business of the Buyer by the Buyer or its
affiliates; and (vi) if the Seller fails to proceed with the
defense of the Export Control Investigation and the Buyer assumes
such defense upon written notice to the Seller, the Seller shall
thereafter reimburse the Buyer for the reasonable fees and 
expenses of its counsel in connection with such defense.

12. TERMINATION.

this Section 12, this Agreement may, by written notice given at or

and 5 or 6, as the case may be, and such default has not been

if all of the conditions set forth in Section 9 shall not have

parties hereunder shall terminate; provided, however, that if this
Agreement is so terminated by one party pursuant to Section 12.1(a)
or 12.1(b)(i) or (ii) because one or more of the conditions to such
party's obligations hereunder is not satisfied as a result of the
other party's failure to comply with its obligations under any
provision of this Agreement, it is expressly agreed and understood
that such party's right to pursue all legal remedies for breach of
contract or otherwise, including, without limitation, damages
relating thereto, shall also survive such termination unimpaired. No
termination of this Agreement shall act to terminate or otherwise
impair the obligations set forth in Sections 13.3, 13.12 and 13.13.

WHEREAS, TMO has entered into the Agreement ; and

WHEREAS, TMO desires to assign all of its rights and obligations under the

obligations; 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as

1.1 To THI. TMO hereby assigns to THI all of TMO's rights under the
Agreement to purchase the Assets that relate primarily to the Business other
than the business of Ramsey Technologies and Epsilon Industrial, and all other
rights, claims and defenses of TMO incident thereto.

1.2 To TMD. TMO hereby assigns to TMD all of TMO's rights under the
Agreement to purchase the Assets and the Shares that relate primarily to the
business of Ramsey Technologies and Epsilon Industrial, and all other rights,
claims and defenses of TMO incident thereto.

1.3 Mixed Assets. The parties acknowledge that certain Assets to be
purchased under the Agreement may not fall clearly within the obligations
described in either Section 1.1 or 1.2 above. However, THI and TMD acknowledge
that the intent of this Agreement is for them to obtain all Assets to be
purchased by TMO under the Agreement. In order to give effect to this intent,
with respect to any Assets that do not fall clearly under either Section 1.1 or
Section 1.2 ("Mixed Assets"), THI and TMD agree that each shall reasonably
cooperate with the other toward the end that each party shall realize relative a
benefit from any Mixed Asset proportionate to such party's proportionate
obligation to pay the Purchase Price as provided in Section 2.5.

-1-<PAGE>
2. Assumption.

2.1 By THI. THI hereby assumes all of TMO's obligations under the
Agreement that relate to the acquisition of the Business other than the business
of Ramsey Technologies and Epsilon Industrial (collectively, the "THI
Obligations"), including, without limitation, all of TMO's obligations with
respect to any Assumed Liabilities that relate primarily to the Business other
than the business of Ramsey Technologies and Epsilon Industrial.

2.2 By TMD. TMD hereby assumes all of TMO's obligations under the
Agreement that relate to the acquisition of the business of Ramsey Technologies
and Epsilon Industrial (collectively, the "TMD Obligations"), including, without
limitation, all of TMO's obligations with respect to any Assumed Liabilities
that relate primarily to the business of Ramsey Technologies and Epsilon
Industrial.

2.3. Mixed Obligations. The parties acknowledge that certain
obligations of TMO under the Agreement, including its obligations with respect
to certain Assumed Liabilities, may not fall clearly within the obligations
described in either Section 2.1 or Section 2.2 above. However, THI and TMD
acknowledge that the intent of this Agreement is for them to obtain all rights
and assume all obligations of TMO under the Agreement. In order to give effect
to this intent, with respect to all obligations of TMO under the Agreement that
do not fall clearly under either Section 2.1 or Section 2.2 ("Mixed
Obligations"), THI and TMD agree as follows:

(a) with respect to monetary obligations, THI and TMD shall each
bear a percentage of such obligations equal to (i) the amount of the Purchase
Price to be paid by such party pursuant to Section 2.5, divided by (ii) the
Purchase Price; 

(b) with respect to non-monetary obligations, THI and TMD shall
each reasonably cooperate with the other to perform such obligations; and

(c) with respect to any category of Assumed Liabilities that have
been assumed only to the extent of applicable book reserves (e.g., certain tax
liabilities) and which do not fall clearly within either Section 2.1 or Section
2.2, paragraph (a) of this Section 2.3 shall apply.

2.4. Changes in Cash Position. The rights and obligations of THI and
TMD under Section 4.1 of the Agreement shall be divided as follows:

(a) A net amount owed to Baker or due from Baker, as the case may
be, will be calculated with respect to each of THI and TMD as if each was the
only Buyer for purposes of Section 4.1. Each calculation shall take into
account, for each party only such amounts loaned by Baker to, or withdrawn by
Baker from the portion of the Business to be acquired by such party. The amount
calculated for each of THI and TMD pursuant to this paragraph (a) is referred to
as the "Cash Adjustment Amount." The Cash Adjustment Amount shall be a positive
number to the extent Baker owes money to THI or TMD and negative to the extent
THI or TMD owes money to Baker; and 

(b) In the event that an amount is owed by TMO to Baker under
Section 4.1 of the Agreement, then THI and TMD each shall pay such amount up to
the amount of such party's negative Cash Adjustment Amount. In addition, to the
extent that the amount paid by either THI or TMD to Baker pursuant to the
preceding sentence is less than such party's negative Cash Adjustment Amount
because the other party has a positive Cash Adjustment Amount, the difference
-2-<PAGE>
between the amount paid to Baker and such party's negative Cash Adjustment
Amount shall be paid to the other party; and 

(c) In the event that an amount is owed by Baker to TMO under
Section 4.1 of the Agreement, then THI and TMD shall each be entitled to receive
a portion of such amount equal to such party's positive Cash Adjustment Amount.
To the extent that either THI or TMD does not ;receive all of its positive Cash
Adjustment Amount pursuant to the preceding sentence because the other party has
a negative Cash Adjustment Amount, the other party shall pay such negative Cash
Adjustment Amount to such party.

2.5 Payment of Purchase Price. TMD shall be obligated to pay Baker
$41,100,000 of the Purchase Price and THI shall be obligated to pay Baker the
balance of the Purchase Price.

2.6. Allocation of Purchase Price. THI and TMD each agrees to allocate
the portion of the Purchase Price paid by it for the Assets and/or Shares
acquired by it in a manner consistent with the allocation contained in Schedule
4.2 to the Agreement.

3. Allocation of Certain Rights Under Section 11 of Agreement. Under
Section 11.3(a)(i) of the Agreement, TMO is not entitled to indemnification from
Baker until the total amount of certain Losses incurred by TMO exceeds $2.5
million (the "Basket") and, except under certain circumstances, TMO is not
entitled to indemnification from Baker for Losses in excess of $65 million (the
"Cap"). The parties agree that THI and TMD each should bear only a
proportionate amount of the Basket and a proportionate amount of the risk that
aggregate indemnified Losses exceed the Cap. Therefore, the parties agree as
follows: 

(a) Until the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by THI and TMD equals
or exceeds the Basket: (i) TMD will bear the first $755,000 of Losses incurred
by it; (ii) THI will bear the first $1,735,000 of Losses incurred by it; and
(iii) TMO will indemnify THI and TMD for any Losses incurred by them in excess
of the amounts specified in (i) and (ii) above. After the aggregate amount of
Losses incurred by THI and TMD equals or exceeds the Basket, each of such
parties shall be entitled to exercise its right to indemnification from Baker
pursuant to Section 11 of the Agreement; provided, however, that TMO shall be
subrogated to the rights of each of such parties, but only to the extent that
(A) such party has not incurred the amount of Losses to be borne by such party
under (i) or (ii), as the case may be, of the preceding sentence, and (B) TMO
has indemnified the other party pursuant to (iii) of the preceding sentence.

(b) After the aggregate amount of Losses for which THI and TMD are
indemnified by Baker equals the Cap, THI and TMD shall each indemnify the other
for the Losses incurred by the other for which the other would be entitled to
indemnification from Baker in the absence of the Cap, but only to the extent
that the indemnifying party has been indemnified by Baker for Losses in excess
of $45,110,000, if THI is the indemnifying party, or $19,890,000, if TMD is the
indemnifying party.

4. Allocation of Certain Obligations under Section 11 of the Agreement.
Under Section 11.3(a)(i) of the Agreement, Baker is not entitled to
indemnification from TMO until the total amount of Losses incurred by Baker
exceeds the Basket. THI and TMD agree that, after the total Losses incurred by
Baker exceeds the Basket, each party should indemnify Baker only for the amount
by which the Losses caused by such party exceed such party's proportionate share
of the Basket ($1,735,000 for THI and $765,000 for TMD). Therefore, THI and TMD
agree that, after Baker's Losses equal or exceed the Basket, if either party has
caused Baker Losses in excess of such party's proportionate share of the Basket,
-3-<PAGE>
then such party shall reimburse the other party for amounts paid by the other
party to indemnify Baker for Losses caused by such other party, but only to the
extent that the total amount of Baker Losses caused by the other party is less
than such other party's proportionate share of the Basket.
