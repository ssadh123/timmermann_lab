Item 5. Other Events.

On November 4, 1994, a Registration Statement (Registration No.
33-54043) filed by Registrant on Form S-3 (as amended, the "Registration
Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in
respect of a shelf offering of $250,000,000 of Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates, Issuable in Series (collectively "Certificates") was declared
effective by the Commission.

On November 8, 1994, $5,491,000 principal amount of such Certificates
(Series 1994A-1 and 1994A-2, respectively) were sold to Sutro & Co.
Incorporated ("Sutro") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated November 4,
1994, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this Report. On the same day,
Sutro resold all of the Certificates Series 1994A-1 and 1994A-2 to a single
purchaser.

On November 21, 1994 an additional $63,988,000 principal amount of such
Certificates (Series 1994A-3, 1994A-4 and 1994A-5, respectively) were sold to
Sutro pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated November 16, 1994, a copy of
which is filed as an exhibit to this Report. On the same day, Sutro resold all
of the Certificates Series 1994A-3, 1994A-4 and 1994A-5 to a single purchaser
(the "Purchaser"). The disclosure documents used in connection with the
November 21, 1994 sale and resale included a Basic Prospectus dated November 4,
1994 and a Prospectus Supplement dated November 16, 1994, which, together, are
hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus." Included among the $63,988,000 of
Certificates sold on November 21, 1994 were $39,687,000 Certificates Series
1994A-5, which bear interest at a stated rate of 10.05% per annum and have a
final scheduled remittance date of November 1, 2019. These Certificates were
issued by Pass-Through Trust Series 1994A-5, the property of which consists of
eight mortgage notes in the aggregate principal amount of $39,687,000,
including three mortgage notes in the aggregate principal amount of $21,186,000
secured by mortgages on three projects in the State of California. The mortgage
notes have a stated interest rate of 10.05% but provide that if the stated
interest rate exceeds the maximum rate permitted by law the latter rate shall
apply. By their terms, the mortgage notes are governed by the laws of the State
of New York, where the Pass-Through Trustee (payee of the notes) has its
principal office. The maximum legal rate of interest in California (subject to
exceptions which may or may not be applicable) is 10% per annum. In New York
there is no ceiling on the rate of interest applicable to the mortgage notes
held by Pass-Through Trust 1994A-5; and if the parties' choice of governing law
is respected by the courts, the 10.05% stated rate is clearly lawful. No
assurances can be given, however, that a California Court, if called upon to
consider whether the 10.05% stated rate, or the 10.00% California maximum rate,
should apply to the mortgage notes given with

<PAGE> 3
respect to the three California properties would respect the parties' choice
of New York as the jurisdiction, whose laws govern the mortgage notes --
including the interest rate provisions.

Neither the fact that the maximum permissible rate of interest in
California is lower than the stated rate of the mortgage notes (and the stated
rate of the Certificates Series 1994A-5), nor the fact that no assurances can
be given that a California court would respect the parties' choice of law, was
disclosed in the Prospectus. These facts were, however, disclosed by Sutro to
the Purchaser, which acknowledged such disclosure in writing and agreed not to
make any resales of the Certificates until such facts had been publicly
disclosed. The purpose of this filing is to make public disclosure of such
facts and thereby remedy any disclosure deficiency that may exist by reason of
the failure to do so in the Prospectus.

UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT

November 4, 1994

Sutro & Co. Incorporated
555 South Flower Street, 46th Floor
Los Angeles, CA 90071

Dear Sirs:

National Tenant Finance Corporation ("Depositor") proposes to
cause United States Trust Company of New York, as trustee ("Trustee") under the
several trust agreements (collectively, "Trust Agreements," and each a "Trust
Agreement") identified in the Schedule of Trust Agreements annexed hereto as
Exhibit A to issue, and Depositor proposes to sell to you, as underwriter,
$5,491,000 aggregate principal amount of Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, in
series, as more particularly described in the Schedule of Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates annexed hereto as Exhibit B (the "Certificates") for which you, as
underwriter, shall pay the aggregate amount of $5,381,180, less the amounts to
be distributed pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this Underwriting Agreement.
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the registration statement, dated June 8, 1994, filed by or
on behalf of Kmart Corporation ("Kmart") (Registration No. 33-54043) as from
time to time amended and supplemented.

The Certificates of each series will represent fractional
undivided beneficial ownership interests in a single separate trust (a "Trust")
established for the benefit of the Certificateholders of such series. Each
Certificate will represent a fractional undivided beneficial ownership interest
in the assets of one Trust and will have no rights, benefits or interests in
respect of any other Trust or the assets held in any other trust. Each Trust
will hold two (2) Mortgage Notes evidencing two (2) Mortgage Loans. Each
Mortgage Loan will be made by the Depositor to a separate borrower (each a
"Borrower") pursuant to a separate Loan Agreement to finance the acquisition of
a separate Facility or to provide permanent financing for a Facility and to pay
the Borrowers' proportionate shares of the costs of issuance of the
Certificates, including the underwriting discount and the expenses provided for
in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this Underwriting Agreement. Each

<PAGE> 6
Loan Agreement provides that the Mortgage Loan will be evidenced by two 
Mortgage Notes having different maturities. Because Mortgage Notes of
different maturities are being issued pursuant to the two Loan Agreements, (i)
all of such Mortgage Notes having the same maturity will be held by a separate
Pass-Through Trust, and all Mortgage Notes held by each separate Pass-Through
Trust will have the same maturity, (ii) each Certificate will evidence a
fractional undivided beneficial ownership interest in the assets of the related
Pass-Through Trust and will have no rights, benefits or interests in respect of
any other Pass-Through Trust Property held in any other Pass-Through Trust, and
(iii) the Collateral securing such Mortgage Notes will be held by a Collateral
Trustee for the benefit, pari passu, of all Pass-Through Trusts holding any of
the Mortgage Notes secured by such Collateral. The assets held by the
Collateral Trust will include with respect to each Facility the following
collateral for the Mortgage Notes relating to such Facility: (i) a Mortgage on
such Facility; (ii) all of the Depositor's rights under the Loan Agreement
pursuant to which the related Mortgage Notes were issued; (iii) an assignment
of the related Lease, Lease Payments and, because the Tenant (OfficeMax, Inc.)
under each lease is a subsidiary of Kmart (the "Subsidiary"), a Lease Guaranty
by Kmart of the lease obligations of such Tenant; (iv) a pledge of certain
moneys held in certain funds established pursuant to the Collateral Trust
Agreement; (v) a Note Put Agreement requiring the Tenant and Kmart to purchase
the related Mortgage Note(s) upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event; (vi) a
pledge of certain investments of fund balances held in the Collateral Trust and
income earned thereon; and (viii) any other Loan Documents. The Trust
Agreement, the Loan Agreement, the Mortgage, the Mortgage Note, the Lease, the
Lease Guaranty, the Note Put Agreement, the Pledge Agreement and any other Loan
Documents are referred to herein as the "Transaction Documents."

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth or incorporated
by reference herein, Kmart agrees to cause the Depositor to sell and the
Depositor agrees to sell, and you agree to purchase, the principal amounts of
Certificates of each series set forth opposite your name in the Schedule of
Underwriters annexed hereto as Exhibit C at the purchase price (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount of each series of Certificates) set forth in
such schedule.

You will pay for the Certificates in immediately available
funds upon delivery thereof in book entry form, and payment for the
Certificates will be made, at New York, New York no later than 5:00 p.m. (New
York time) on November 7, 1994, through the Same Day Funds Settlement System of
The Depository Trust Company. The time and date

2
<PAGE> 7
of such payment and delivery are hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."

The Certificates shall have the terms set forth in the
Prospectus dated November 4, 1994, as modified by the Definitive Prospectus
Supplement dated November 4, 1994.

1. Representations and Warranties of Kmart. Kmart
represents and warrants to, and agrees with, you as follows:

(a) Kmart meets the requirements for the use of
Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and
has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") a registration statement (Registration No. 33-54043) on
such Form (as amended and supplemented, the "Registration Statement"),
including a basic prospectus (the "Basic Prospectus"), for
registration under the Act of the offering and sale of mortgage pass
through certificates, including the Certificates. Kmart has filed
four (4) amendments and one (1) supplement thereto and has used
Preliminary Prospectuses and Preliminary Prospectus Supplements, each
of which has previously been furnished to you. The Registration
Statement has become effective. No stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in effect, and no
proceedings for such purpose are pending before, or, to Kmart's
knowledge, are threatened by, the Commission. Although the Basic
Prospectus does not include all the information with respect to the
Certificates and the offering thereof required by the Act and the
rules thereunder, the Basic Prospectus includes all such information
required by the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to be
included therein as of the Effective Date. Kmart will next file with
the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) or (5) a definitive
prospectus supplement (the "Definitive Prospectus Supplement") to the
form of Basic Prospectus included in such registration statement
relating to the Certificates and the offering thereof. As filed, such
Definitive Prospectus Supplement, together with the Basic Prospectus,
shall include all such required information with respect to the
Certificates and the offering thereof and, except to the extent you

respects in the form furnished to you prior to the Execution Time or,

therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on
or before the Effective Date or the issue date of the Basic
Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case
may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or

5. Covenants of Kmart and the Depositor. In further
consideration of your agreements contained herein, Kmart and the Depositor
severally covenant as follows:

(a) To furnish you, without charge, a copy of the
Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein) as originally filed electronically
in compliance with Regulation S-T of the Act, and, during the period
mentioned in paragraph (c) below, as many copies of the Prospectus,
any documents incorporated by reference therein and any supplements
and amendments thereto or to the Registration Statement as you may
reasonably request.

(b) Before amending or supplementing the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus with respect to the
Certificates, to furnish to you, a reasonable amount of time prior to
filing such amendment or supplement, a copy of each such proposed
amendment or supplement; provided, however, that the foregoing
requirement shall not apply to any of Kmart's periodic filings with
the Commission required to be filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c),
14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, all of which required filings Kmart
hereby agrees timely to make during the period when the Prospectus
relating to the Certificates is required to be delivered under the
Act, and copies of which filings Kmart will upon request cause to be
delivered to you promptly after being filed with the Commission.

(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 5(b),
if, during such period after the first date of the public offering of
the Certificates that the Prospectus is required by law to be
delivered in connection with sales by you or a dealer, any event shall
occur or condition exist as a result of which it would be necessary to
amend or supplement the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so
amended or supplemented will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supple-

10
<PAGE> 15
ment the Prospectus, Kmart shall forthwith prepare, file with the
Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to you, such amendments or
supplements to the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or
supplemented will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading or so that the Prospectus, as so amended or
supplemented, will comply with law.

(d) To endeavor to qualify the Certificates for
offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such
jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request, to endeavor to maintain
such qualification for so long as the laws of such jurisdictions so
require and to notify you of any termination of such qualifications;
provided, however, that neither Kmart nor the Depositor shall be
obligated so to qualify the Certificates if such qualification requires
it to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as
a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so
qualified.

(e) Kmart will promptly advise you (i) when,
prior to the termination of the offering of the Certificates, any

Prospectus or for additional information, (iii) the issuance by the
Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any
proceedings for that purpose and (iv) of the receipt by Kmart of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of

to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.

6. Expenses.

6.1 Sutro & Co. Incorporated ("Sutro") has
advanced or incurred, or shall advance or incur, expenses incident to the shelf
registration by Kmart of $250,000,000 of securities (of which the specific
Certificates covered by this Underwriting Agreement are a part), including (i)
those incurred in connection with preparation and filing of the Registration
Statement and amendments thereto, the Basic Prospectus (and preliminary
versions thereof), and all exhibits thereto (including the basic forms of
underwriting

11
<PAGE> 16
agreement and Transaction Documents), (ii) the filing fee paid to the
Commission in respect of such registration, (iii) the related fees,
disbursements and other charges of Kmart's counsel, (iv) the related fees,
disbursements and other charges of special counsel to the Depositor, (v) the
related fees, disbursements and other charges of special counsel to Sutro, and
(vi) the printing and delivery to you in quantities as hereinabove stated of
copies of the Registration Statement, the amendments thereto and the Basic
Prospectus. Sutro shall be reimbursed for the expenses advanced or incurred by
it by the allowance to Sutro of a shelf filing expense recovery fee of 0.25% of
the principal amount of all securities included in the shelf registration.
Such allowance shall be deducted from the purchase price of all such securities
and be retained by, and/or paid to, Sutro. The amount so to be retained in
respect of the specific securities covered by this Underwriting Agreement is
$13,727.50.

6.2 In addition to the expenses to be deducted
pursuant to Section 6.1, the sum of the following expenses incident to the
proposed sale of Certificates contemplated by this Underwriting Agreement,
including (i) expenses in connection with the preparation of any amendments to
the Registration Statement that relate specifically to the sale of such
Certificates, the Definitive Prospectus Supplement (and any preliminary
versions thereof) and any exhibits to any thereof (including, without
limitation, this Underwriting Agreement), (ii) the preparation, issuance and
delivery of such Certificates, (iii) the fees, disbursements and other charges
of Kmart's counsel, (iv) the fees, disbursements and other charges of special
counsel to the Depositor, (v) the fees, disbursements and other charges of
local counsel, (vi) the first year's fees of the Trustee(s), (vii) any fees
charged by rating agencies for the rating of such Certificates, (viii) the

the relevant amendments to the Registration Statement and of the Definitive
Prospectus Supplement (and any preliminary versions thereof) and any amendments
or supplements thereto, and (ix) the printing and delivery to you of copies of
each of the Trust Agreements and any Blue Sky Memorandum, shall be deducted and
paid from the proceeds of sale of the Certificates; provided, however, that the
maximum amount of expenses so to be deducted and paid pursuant to this Section
6.2 shall be $50,000 multiplied by the number of projects to be financed by the
sale of such Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.2, you have agreed to deduct only $12,733.50 from the proceeds of the
specific securities that are covered by this Underwriting Agreement and to
accept such sum in full

12
<PAGE> 17
satisfaction of your reimbursement rights under this Section 6.2 with respect
to such securities.
6.3 The Depositor shall cause each Borrower to
whom a Mortgage Loan is made to bear its proportionate share of the costs of
issuance of the Certificates (i.e., the underwriting discount, the shelf
expense recovery fee provided for in Section 6.1 and the expenses to be
deducted pursuant to Section 6.2). Each Borrower as a condition to receiving a
Mortgage Loan shall authorize the Depositor to apply a portion of the related
Mortgage Loan amount to payment of the Borrower's proportionate share of such
costs of issuance by agreeing that you may withhold from the proceeds of sale
of the Certificates, such Borrower's proportionate share of the underwriting
discount and the amount provided for in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.

and provided, further, that the indemnity agreement described in this
subsection shall not inure to the benefit of you or of any person controlling
you on account of any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or
actions arising from the sale of Certificates to any person in respect of the
Prospectus, as supplemented or amended (excluding, however, any document then
incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of
Form S-3) furnished by you to a person to whom any of the Certificates were
sold, insofar as such indemnity relates to any untrue or misleading statement
or omission made in a Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus but eliminated
or remedied prior to the consummation of such sale in the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto furnished pursuant to Section 5 hereof,
respectively, unless a copy of such amendment or supplement is furnished by you
to such person (i) with or prior to the written confirmation of the sale
involved or (ii) as soon as available after such written confirmation.

26
<PAGE> 31
(b) You agree, to indemnify and hold harmless
Kmart, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and
each person, if any, who controls Kmart within the meaning of either Section 15
of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from Kmart to you, but only with reference to the
respective information relating to you, as the case may be, furnished in
writing by or on behalf of you expressly for use in the Registration Statement,
the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.

(c) If any proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which
indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such
person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom
such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing of the
institution of such proceeding and the indemnifying party, upon request of the
indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the
indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and
disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such
proceeding any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the
parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both
the indemnifying party (or any other person represented by such counsel) and
the indemnified party, and representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, it is understood that the
indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for
all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses as are
reimbursable hereunder shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case
of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) above, such separate firm
shall be designated in writing by you, and by Kmart in the case of parties
indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) above. The indemnifying party shall not
be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for
the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party
from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or
judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent

27
<PAGE> 32
of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a
party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party,
unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified
party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such
proceeding.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party
or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu
of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by Kmart and/or the Subsidiary (and/or
the Trusts) on the one hand and you on the other from the offering of the
Certificates or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not
permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the
relative fault of Kmart on the one hand and of you on the other in connection
with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative benefits received by Kmart (and/or the Subsidiary and the Trusts) on
the one hand and you on the other in connection with the offering of the
Certificates shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net
proceeds from the offering of the Certificates (before deducting expenses)
received by Kmart (and/or the Subsidiary and the Trusts) bears to the total
commissions received by you in respect thereof. The relative fault of Kmart on
the one hand and of you on the other, shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by or on behalf of Kmart or by or on behalf of
you and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. For purposes of
this Section 8, each person who controls you within the meaning of the Act
shall have the same rights to contribution as you, and each person who controls
Kmart within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of
Kmart who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of
Kmart shall have the same rights to contribution as Kmart, subject in each case
to the provisions of this paragraph (d) and paragraph (e). Any party entitled
to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any

28
<PAGE> 33
action, suit or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) against
such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against
another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties
from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party
or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be
sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise
than under this paragraph (d), except and only to the extent that the party or
parties is materially prejudiced thereby.

(e) Kmart and you agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account
of the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The
amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 8, you shall not be required to contribute any
amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the
Certificates underwritten by you and distributed to the public were offered to
the public exceeds the amount of any damages that you have otherwise been
required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not
exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be
available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this
Section 8 and the representations and warranties and covenants and agreements
of Kmart and the Depositor contained herein shall remain operative and in full
force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any
investigation made by or on your behalf, or on behalf of any person controlling
you or by or on behalf of Kmart, its directors or officers or any person
controlling Kmart and (iii) acceptance and payment for any of the Certificates.

9. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to
termination, by notice given by you to Kmart, if after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and prior to

29
<PAGE> 34
the Closing Date (i) there has been any material adverse change in the
condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations
of Kmart and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) there has occurred any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis the effect of
which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in
your judgment, impracticable to market the Certificates, or (iii) trading in
securities, either generally or of Kmart, on the New York Stock Exchange has
been suspended or materially limited or if a general moratorium on commercial
banking activities has been declared by either Federal or New York State
authorities, or (iv) except as disclosed in the Prospectus, there has been any
downgrading, or any notice given of any intended or potential downgrading, in
the rating accorded any of Kmart's securities by any "nationally recognized
statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
436(g)(2) under the Act, or (v) all of the conditions of Section 7 shall not
have been fulfilled.

10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT

November 16, 1994

Sutro & Co. Incorporated
555 South Flower Street, 46th Floor
Los Angeles, CA 90071

Dear Sirs:

National Tenant Finance Corporation ("Depositor") proposes to 
cause United States Trust Company of New York, as trustee ("Trustee") under the
several trust agreements (collectively, "Trust Agreements," and each a "Trust
Agreement") identified in the Schedule of Trust Agreements annexed hereto as
Exhibit A to issue, and Depositor proposes to sell to you, as underwriter,
$63,988,000 aggregate principal amount of Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates,
in series, as more particularly described in the Schedule of Mortgage
Pass-Through Certificates annexed hereto as Exhibit B (the "Certificates") for
which you, as underwriter, shall pay the aggregate amount of $63,028,180, less
the amounts to be distributed pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this
Underwriting Agreement. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the registration statement,
dated June 8, 1994, filed by or on behalf of Kmart Corporation ("Kmart")
(Registration No. 33-54043) as from time to time amended and supplemented.

The Certificates of each series will represent fractional 
undivided beneficial ownership interests in a single separate trust (a "Trust")
established for the benefit of the Certificateholders of such series. Each
Certificate will represent a fractional undivided beneficial ownership interest
in the assets of one Trust and will have no rights, benefits or interests in
respect of any other Trust or the assets held in any other trust. Each Trust
(other than the Trust created by Pass-Through Trust Agreement dated November
10, 1994 in respect of Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 1994 A-4) will
hold two or more Mortgage Notes evidencing two or more Mortgage Loans. Each
Mortgage Loan will be made by the Depositor to a separate borrower (each a
"Borrower") pursuant to a separate Loan Agreement to finance the acquisition of
a separate Facility or to provide permanent financing for a Facility and to pay
the Borrowers' proportionate shares of the costs of issuance of the
Certificates, including the underwriting discount 

<PAGE> 37
and the expenses provided for in Sections 6.1 and

2
<PAGE> 38
6.2 of this Underwriting Agreement. Each Loan Agreement provides that the
Mortgage Loan will be evidenced by two Mortgage Notes having different
maturities. Because Mortgage Notes of different maturities are being issued
pursuant to the two Loan Agreements, (i) all of such Mortgage Notes having the
same maturity will be held by a separate Pass-Through Trust, and all Mortgage
Notes held by each separate Pass-Through Trust will have the same maturity,
(ii) each Certificate will evidence a fractional undivided beneficial ownership
interest in the assets of the related Pass-Through Trust and will have no
rights, benefits or interests in respect of any other Pass-Through Trust
Property held in any other Pass-Through Trust, and (iii) the Collateral
securing such Mortgage Notes will be held by a Collateral Trustee for the
benefit, pari passu, of all Pass-Through Trusts holding any of the Mortgage
Notes secured by such Collateral. The assets held by the Collateral Trust will
include with respect to each Facility the following collateral for the Mortgage
Notes relating to such Facility: (i) a Mortgage on such Facility; (ii) all of
the Depositor's rights under the Loan Agreement pursuant to which the related
Mortgage Notes were issued; (iii) an assignment of the related Lease, Lease
Payments and, because the Tenant under each lease is a subsidiary of Kmart (a
"Subsidiary"), a Lease Guaranty by Kmart of the lease obligations of such
Tenant; (iv) a pledge of certain moneys held in certain funds established
pursuant to the Collateral Trust Agreement; (v) a Note Put Agreement requiring
the Tenant and Kmart to purchase the related Mortgage Note(s) upon the
occurrence of a Triggering Event; (vi) a pledge of certain investments of fund
balances held in the Collateral Trust and income earned thereon; and (viii) any
other Loan Documents. The Trust Agreement, the Loan Agreement, the Mortgage,
the Mortgage Note, the Lease, the Lease Guaranty, the Note Put Agreement, the
Pledge Agreement and any other Loan Documents are referred to herein as the
"Transaction Documents."

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth or incorporated 
by reference herein, Kmart agrees to cause the Depositor to sell and the
Depositor agrees to sell, and you agree to purchase, the principal amounts of
Certificates of each series set forth opposite your name in the Schedule of
Underwriters annexed hereto as Exhibit C at the purchase price (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount of each series of Certificates) set forth in
such schedule.

You will pay for the Certificates in immediately available 
funds upon delivery thereof in book entry form, and payment for the 
Certificates will be made, at New York, New York no later than 5:00 p.m. (New 
York time) on November 21, 1994, through the Same Day Funds Settlement System 
of The Depository Trust Company. The time and date

3
<PAGE> 39
of such payment and delivery are hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."

The Certificates shall have the terms set forth in the
Prospectus dated November 4, 1994, as modified by the Definitive Prospectus
Supplement dated November , 1994.

1. Representations and Warranties of Kmart. Kmart
represents and warrants to, and agrees with, you as follows:

(a) Kmart meets the requirements for the use of
Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and has
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a
registration statement (Registration No. 33-54043) on such Form (as amended
and supplemented, the "Registration Statement"), including a basic prospectus
(the "Basic Prospectus"), for registration under the Act of the offering and
sale of mortgage pass through certificates, including the Certificates. Kmart
has filed four (4) amendments and one (1) supplement thereto and has used
Preliminary Prospectuses and Preliminary Prospectus Supplements, each of which
has previously been furnished to you. The Registration Statement has become
effective. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement is in effect, and no proceedings for such purpose are pending before,
or, to Kmart's knowledge, are threatened by, the Commission. Although the
Basic Prospectus does not include all the information with respect to the
Certificates and the offering thereof required by the Act and the rules
thereunder, the Basic Prospectus includes all such information required by the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to be included therein as of the
Effective Date. Kmart will next file with the Commission pursuant to Rule
424(b)(2) or (5) a definitive prospectus supplement (the "Definitive Prospectus
Supplement") to the form of Basic Prospectus included in such registration
statement relating to the Certificates and the offering thereof. As filed,
such Definitive Prospectus Supplement, together with the Basic Prospectus,
shall include all such required information with respect to the Certificates
and the offering thereof and, except to the extent you shall agree in writing
to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished
to you prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the
Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and
other changes (beyond those contained in the Basic Prospectus and any
Preliminary Prospectus) as Kmart has advised you, prior to the Execution Time,
will be included or made herein.

(b) The terms which follow, when used in this
Agreement, shall have the meanings indicated. The term "Effective Date" shall
mean each date that the Registration

become effective. "Execution Time" shall mean the date and time that this
Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto. "Basic Prospectus"
shall mean the prospectus referred to in paragraph (a) above contained in the
Registration Statement at the Effective Date. "Preliminary Prospectus" shall
mean any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Basic Prospectus, which
describes the Certificates and the offering thereof and which was or is used
prior to filing of the Definitive Prospectus Supplement. "Prospectus" shall
mean the Definitive Prospectus Supplement relating to the Certificates that is
first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the Execution Time, together with the
Basic Prospectus. "Registration Statement" shall mean the registration
statement referred to in paragraph (a) above, including incorporated documents,
exhibits and financial statements, as amended at the Execution Time (or, if not
effective at the Execution Time, in the form in which it shall become
effective) and, in the event any post-effective amendment thereto becomes
effective prior to the Closing Date (as defined above), shall also mean such
registration statement as so amended. Such term shall include any Rule 430A
Information deemed to be included therein at the Effective Date as provided by
Rule 430A. "Rule 415," "Rule 424," "Rule 430A" and "Regulation S-K" refer to
such rules or regulations under the Act. "Rule 430A Information" means
information with respect to the Certificates and the offering thereof permitted
to be omitted from the Registration Statement when it becomes effective
pursuant to Rule 430A. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the
Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed
to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein
pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on or before the Effective Date
or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the
Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend,"
"amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the
Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed
to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after
the Effective Date or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary
Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated
therein by reference.

(c) (i) Each document, if any, filed or to be
filed by Kmart pursuant to the Exchange Act prior to the termination of the
offering of the Certificates complied or will comply when so filed in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and
regulations

5
<PAGE> 41
thereunder; (ii) each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became
effective, did not contain, and each such part, as amended or supplemented, if

state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that the representations and warranties set forth in
this Section 1(c) do not apply to statements or omissions in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus based upon information furnished to Kmart in
writing by you or on your behalf expressly for use therein or to that part of

furnish to you, a reasonable amount of time prior to filing such amendment or
supplement, a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement; provided,
however, that the foregoing requirement shall not apply to any of Kmart's
periodic filings with the Commission required to be filed pursuant to Section

Kmart hereby agrees timely to make during the period when the Prospectus

10
<PAGE> 46
under the Act, and copies of which filings Kmart will upon request cause to be
delivered to you promptly after being filed with the Commission.

(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 5(b),
if, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the
Certificates that the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in
connection with sales by you or a dealer, any event shall occur or condition
exist as a result of which it would be necessary to amend or supplement the
Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary
to amend or supplement the Prospectus, Kmart shall forthwith prepare, file with
the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to you, such amendments or
supplements to the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or
supplemented will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or so that the
Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented, will comply with law.

(d) To endeavor to qualify the Certificates for
offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as
you shall reasonably request, to endeavor to maintain such qualification for so
long as the laws of such jurisdictions so require and to notify you of any
termination of such qualifications; provided, however, that neither Kmart nor
the Depositor shall be obligated so to qualify the Certificates if such
qualification requires it to file any general consent to service of process or
to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so
qualified.

(e) Kmart will promptly advise you (i) when,
prior to the termination of the offering of the Certificates, any amendment to
the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (ii) of
any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement
or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, (iii) the
issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceedings
for that purpose and (iv) of the receipt by Kmart of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Certificates for sale in
any jurisdiction with the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
purpose. Kmart will use its best efforts to pre-

11

vent the issuance of any stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as
possible the withdrawal thereof.

6. Expenses.

6.1 Sutro & Co. Incorporated ("Sutro") has
advanced or incurred, or shall advance or incur, expenses incident to the shelf
registration by Kmart of $250,000,000 of securities (of which the specific
Certificates covered by this Underwriting Agreement are a part), including (i)
those incurred in connection with preparation and filing of the Registration
Statement and amendments thereto, the Basic Prospectus (and preliminary
versions thereof), and all exhibits thereto (including the basic forms of
underwriting agreement and Transaction Documents), (ii) the filing fee paid to
the Commission in respect of such registration, (iii) the related fees,
disbursements and other charges of Kmart's counsel, (iv) the related fees,
disbursements and other charges of special counsel to the Depositor, (v) the
related fees, disbursements and other charges of special counsel to Sutro, and
(vi) the printing and delivery to you in quantities as hereinabove stated of
copies of the Registration Statement, the amendments thereto and the Basic
Prospectus. Sutro shall be reimbursed for the expenses advanced or incurred by
it by the allowance to Sutro of a shelf filing expense recovery fee of 0.25% of
the principal amount of all securities included in the shelf registration.
Such allowance shall be deducted from the purchase price of all such securities
and be retained by, and/or paid to, Sutro. The amount so to be retained in
respect of the specific securities covered by this Underwriting Agreement is
$159,970.

6.2 In addition to the expenses to be deducted
pursuant to Section 6.1, the sum of the following expenses incident to the
proposed sale of Certificates contemplated by this Underwriting Agreement,
including (i) expenses in connection with the preparation of any amendments to
the Registration Statement that relate specifically to the sale of such
Certificates, the Definitive Prospectus Supplement (and any preliminary
versions thereof) and any exhibits to any thereof (including, without
limitation, this Underwriting Agreement), (ii) the preparation, issuance and
delivery of such Certificates, (iii) the fees, disbursements and other charges
of Kmart's counsel, (iv) the fees, disbursements and other charges of special
counsel to the Depositor, (v) the fees, disbursements and other charges of
local counsel, (vi) the first year's fees of the Trustee, (vii) any fees
charged by rating agencies for the rating of such Certificates, (viii) the
printing and delivery to you in quantities as hereinabove stated of copies of

12
<PAGE> 48
Definitive Prospectus Supplement (and any preliminary versions thereof) and any
amendments or supplements thereto, and (ix) the printing and delivery to you of
copies of each of the Trust Agreements and any Blue Sky Memorandum, shall be
deducted and paid from the proceeds of sale of the Certificates; provided,
however, that the maximum amount of expenses so to be deducted and paid
pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be $50,000 multiplied by the number of
projects to be financed by the sale of such Certificates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2, you have agreed to deduct only
$159,697 from the proceeds of the specific securities that are covered by this
Underwriting Agreement and to accept such sum in full satisfaction of your
reimbursement rights under this Section 6.2 with respect to such securities.

6.3 The Depositor shall cause each Borrower to
whom a Mortgage Loan is made to bear its proportionate share of the costs of
issuance of the Certificates (i.e., the underwriting discount, the shelf
expense recovery fee provided for in Section 6.1 and the expenses to be
deducted pursuant to Section 6.2). Each Borrower as a condition to receiving a
Mortgage Loan shall authorize the Depositor to apply a portion of the related
Mortgage Loan amount to payment of the Borrower's proportionate share of such
costs of issuance by agreeing that you may withhold from the proceeds of sale
of the Certificates, such Borrower's proportionate share of the underwriting
discount and the amount provided for in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.

7. Conditions to Closing. Your several obligations will
be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of
Kmart and the Depositor herein on the date hereof and on the Closing Date, to

letter or letters, dated as of the Closing Date, addressed to both you and
Kmart, in form and substance satisfactory to you confirming that they are
independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and
the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder, and
containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in

<PAGE> 59
accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial
statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by
reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

(f) The Depositor shall have received a letter
from Standard & Poor's rating the Certificates "BBB-" or better and true copies

(i) Each of the transactions contemplated herein
or in the Prospectus as occurring on or before the Closing Date shall have

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 7 shall not
have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this
Underwriting Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned
above or elsewhere in this Underwriting Agreement shall not be in all material
respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to you and to your
counsel, this Agreement and all of your obligations hereunder may be canceled
at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by you. Notice of such
cancellation shall be given to Kmart and the Depositor in writing or by
telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.

8. Indemnification and Contribution.

(a) Kmart agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
you and each person, if any, who controls you within the meaning of either
Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in connection with any
investigation or proceeding), whether or not arising from third party claims,
arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as
originally filed or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or the Prospectus
as originally filed or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out
of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material

24
<PAGE> 60
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, or (ii) any breach of a representation or warranty or covenant
or agreement herein of Kmart; provided, however, that Kmart will not be liable
in any such case to the extent that such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
are caused by any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission made therein based upon and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to Kmart by or on behalf of you expressly for use therein;
and provided, further, that the indemnity agreement described in this
subsection shall not inure to the benefit of you or of any person controlling
you on account of any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or
actions arising from the sale of Certificates to any person in respect of the
Prospectus, as supplemented or amended (excluding, however, any document then
incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of
Form S-3) furnished by you to a person to whom any of the Certificates were
sold, insofar as such indemnity relates to any untrue or misleading statement
or omission made in a Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus but eliminated
or remedied prior to the consummation of such sale in the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto furnished pursuant to Section 5 hereof,
respectively, unless a copy of such amendment or supplement is furnished by you
to such person (i) with or prior to the written confirmation of the sale
involved or (ii) as soon as available after such written confirmation.

(b) You agree, to indemnify and hold harmless
Kmart, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and
each person, if any, who controls Kmart within the meaning of either Section 15
of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from Kmart to you, but only with reference to the
respective information relating to you, furnished in writing by you or on your
behalf expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto.

(c) If any proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which
indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such
person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom
such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing of the
institution of such proceeding and the indemnifying party, upon request of the
indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the
indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and
disbursements of such counsel

25
<PAGE> 61
related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding any indemnified party shall
have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the
retention of such counsel or (ii) the parties to any such proceeding (including
any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party (or any other person
represented by such counsel) and the indemnified party, and representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them. Except as provided in the
preceding sentence, it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction,
be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
(in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that
all such fees and expenses as are reimbursable hereunder shall be reimbursed as
they are incurred. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph
(a) above, such separate firm shall be designated in writing by you, and by
Kmart in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) above. The
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to
indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without
the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of
any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party
is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by
such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional
release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the
subject matter of such proceeding.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party
or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu
of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by Kmart and/or any Subsidiary (and/or
the Trusts) on the one hand and you on the other from the offering of the
Certificates or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not
permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
not only the relative benefits referred to in

26
<PAGE> 62
clause (i) above but also the relative fault of Kmart on the one hand and of
you or any Subsidiary on the other in connection with the statements or
omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits
received by Kmart (and/or any Subsidiary and the Trusts) on the one hand and
you on the other in connection with the offering of the Certificates shall be
deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering
of the Certificates (before deducting expenses) received by Kmart (and/or the
Subsidiary and the Trusts) bears to the total commissions received by you in
respect thereof. The relative fault of Kmart and any Subsidiary on the one
hand and of you on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by or on behalf of Kmart or a Subsidiary or by or on
behalf of you and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls you within the meaning
of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as you, and each person
who controls Kmart within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act,
each officer of Kmart who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each
director of Kmart shall have the same rights to contribution as Kmart, subject
in each case to the provisions of this paragraph (d) and paragraph (e). Any
party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution
may be made against another party or parties under this para-graph (d), notify
such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to
so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from
whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have
hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d), except and only to the
extent that the party or parties is materially prejudiced thereby.

(e) Kmart and you agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account
the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The
amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending

27
<PAGE> 63
any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8,
you shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the total price at which the Certificates underwritten by you and
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any
damages that you have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue
or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8
are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may
otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this
Section 8 and the representations and warranties and covenants and agreements
of Kmart and the Depositor contained herein shall remain operative and in full
force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any
investigation made by or on your behalf, or on behalf of any person controlling
you or by or on behalf of Kmart, its directors or officers or any person
controlling Kmart and (iii) acceptance and payment for any of the Certificates.

9. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to
termination, by notice given by you to Kmart, if after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) there has been any
material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the
earnings, business or operations of Kmart and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (ii) there has occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or
other calamity or crisis the effect of which on the financial markets of the
United States is such as to make it, in your judgment, impracticable to market
the Certificates, or (iii) trading in securities, either generally or of Kmart,
on the New York Stock Exchange has been suspended or materially limited or if a
general moratorium on commercial banking activities has been declared by either
Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) except as disclosed in the
Prospectus, there has been any downgrading, or any notice given of any intended
or potential downgrading, in the rating accorded any of Kmart's securities by
any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, or (v) all of the
conditions of Section 7 shall not have been fulfilled.

10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement may be signed in any 
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an

28

original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
