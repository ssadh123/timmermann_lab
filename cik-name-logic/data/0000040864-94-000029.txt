ITEM OF INFORMATION

Item 5. Other Events

GTE California Incorporated today announced that
its results for the fourth quarter of 1993 will
include a one-time pre-tax restructuring charge of
$445.2 million related primarily to the
implementation of its re-engineering plan over the
next three years. The restructuring charge will
reduce fourth quarter and full year net income by
$274.2 million.

The re-engineering plan will redesign and
streamline processes in order to improve customer-
responsiveness and product quality, reduce the time
necessary to introduce new products and services
and further reduce costs. The re-engineering plan
includes $171.6 million to upgrade or replace
existing customer service and administrative
systems and enhance network software, $193.4
million for employee separation benefits associated
with workforce reductions and $52.5 million
primarily for the consolidation of facilities and
operations and other related costs. The charge for
employee separation benefits includes $97.9 million
related to the recognition of previously deferred
postretirement health and life insurance costs for
separating employees.
