INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT

Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

a. Effective July 12, 1994, First Commonwealth Financial
Corporation ("the Corporation") dismissed its prior certifying
accounts, Jarrett*Stokes & Company ("JS&C") and retained as its
new certifying accountants, Grant Thornton ("Grant"). JS&C's
report on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements
during the two most recent fiscal years and all subsequent
interim periods preceding the date hereof contained no adverse
opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or
modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 
The decision to change accountants was recommended by the
Management and approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

During the last two fiscal years and the subsequent interim
periods to the date hereof, there were no disagreements between
the Corporation and JS&C on any matters of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope
or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of JS&C, would have caused it to make a reference to
the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its
report.

None of the "reportable events" described in Item 304(a)(1)(v)
occurred with respect to the Corporation within the last two
fiscal years and the subsequent interim period to the date
hereof.

b. Effective July 12, 1994, the Corporation's Board of Directors
approved the engagement of Grant as its principal accountants. 
During the last two fiscal years and the subsequent interim
period to the date hereof, the Corporation did not consult Grant
regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item
304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
