PMSC COMPLETES AUDIT OF ITS
JUNE 30, 1993 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Columbia, South Carolina, February 22, 1994 -- Policy Management
Systems Corporation (NYSE: PMS) today reported that, as a result of
a special audit of its balance sheet as of December 31, 1992, it was
restating its previously reported retained earnings at that date from
$267.7 million to $272.8 million, an increase of $5.1 million
bringing total Stockholders' Equity to $579.1 million as of December
31, 1992. For the six-month period ended June 30, 1993, PMSC
reported revenues of $235.9 million and a net loss, after giving
effect to the charges described below, of $60.4 million ($2.62 per
share). PMSC generated positive cash flow from operations of $38.3
million for the first half of 1993.
The net loss for the six-month period was impacted by various
large special and other unusual charges. PMSC established special
pre-tax impairment and restructuring charges during the six-month
period of $80.7 million (after taxes, $65.0 million or $2.81 per
share) principally related to its health insurance systems business. 
Additionally, as previously reported, the Company recorded charges
related to early project terminations, the deductible under the
Company's Directors' and Officers' liability insurance policy in 

5
<PAGE> 2

response to shareholder litigation, cost overruns on certain projects
and other charges arising from the Company's previously disclosed
internal investigation of its accounting practices. These additional
pre-tax charges aggregate approximately $18.1 million (after taxes
$11.2 million, or $.48 per share).
PMSC stated that it is reporting these results following
completion of a previously announced special audit of PMSC's
financial statements by Coopers & Lybrand. Based on the results of
the audit, PMSC increased its retained earnings as of December 31,
1992 to reflect the prior period, after-tax adjustments summarized
below:
(In Thousands)
- Elimination of revenue related
to a contingent contract that
was cancelled $( 820)

- Deferral of revenues due to changes
in timing of revenue recognition ( 8,408)

- Reduction of expenses due to
capitalization of certain software
costs 18,863

- Recognition of expenses due to
changes in timing of expense
accrual ( 1,622)

- Reserve for losses on certain 
services contracts ( 5,536)

- Reduction of current income tax
liability due to previously
unrecorded tax credits 2,580 

TOTAL after-tax adjustments $ 5,057 

The current uncertainty surrounding the issue of national health
care reform has caused PMSC's health insurance customers to postpone

<PAGE> 3

their investment in information systems until the ultimate outcome of
reform is clear. As a result, PMSC recorded a pre-tax charge,
principally non-cash, of $80.1 million to reduce the carrying value
of PMSC's health insurance assets and to reserve for the costs of
restructuring this business. The Company also recorded other pre-tax
restructuring charges of $.6 million.
G. Larry Wilson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of PMSC, stated, "We are pleased that the exhaustive special
audit process covering December 31, 1992 and the first six months of
1993 is now complete. At February 18, 1994, PMSC had over $160
million in cash and marketable securities and approximately $9
million in debt. With our strong balance sheet and the recently
announced changes in our senior management team, we believe PMSC is
well positioned to meet the challenges and opportunities of the
future."
Commenting on current operations, Mr. Wilson said, "The Property
and Casualty Group is performing well and its customer base continues
to expand. We have continued to invest in the development of Series
III systems to meet the growing needs of our customers for client-
server technology. Our Total Policy Management Outsourcing area has
added several important contracts recently. While the changes and
uncertainty created by health care reform proposals continue to
adversely affect the health insurance systems business, we believe
that the restructuring of this group will better enable it to
redirect its strategic focus to a post-reform environment."

"The Company is pleased with the rapid integration of the
recently acquired CYBERTEK business into our life group. PMSC has
implemented a strategy designed to accelerate the integration of the
CYBERTEK product line with PMSC's Series III platform and
applications," Mr. Wilson added.
Coopers & Lybrand has been engaged to perform 1992 and 1993
audits, and Ernst & Young has agreed to perform procedures to
determine whether it can reissue its audit reports on the 1990 and
1991 financial statements. Previous audit reports covering 1990 and
1991 issued by Ernst & Young and the audit report covering 1992
issued by Arthur Andersen have been withdrawn. These audits and the
audit for the remainder of 1993 will be completed as soon as
possible. When these audits are complete, PMSC intends to file
amended 10-Q's, as necessary, and bring its remaining SEC filings up-
to-date, which will permit the resumption of period-to-period
comparisons of its results of operations.
Mr. Wilson said, "The Company is grateful for the continued
strong support of our customers and long-term investors and for the
dedication of our employees. We are encouraged about the future."
PMSC, headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina, has more than
4,400 employees worldwide and is a leading provider of application
software, related automation support and information services
designed to meet the needs of the global insurance industry.

Financial statements are attached.
