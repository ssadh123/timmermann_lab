For Immediate Release December 16, 1994

United Merchants and Manufacturers, Inc. ("UM&M" or the "Company") 
announced that it will close its Buffalo Mill Division on or about 
February 17, 1995. Buffalo Mill is a vertical manufacturer of 
textile goods, located at 110 Mill Street, Buffalo, South Carolina.

The industry has experienced difficult times over the last couple 
of years and Buffalo Mill has had net operating losses for the last 
two fiscal years ended June 30, 1992 and 1993. In addition, 
projections indicate that for the six (6) months ended December 31, 
1994, the Mill will also post a net operating loss.

As reported earlier this year, UM&M had entered into a new borrowing 
arrangement with Foothill Capital Corporation ("Foothill"). 
Recently, Foothill has required UM&M to reduce the amount of its borrowing 
and accordingly, UM&M is no longer able to fund the daily cash requirements 
of the Mill. UM&M plans to continue its other operations depending on 
continued availability of financing.

UM&M is a diversified company engaged principally in the manufacture and 
distribution of textiles and related products and the design, 
manufacture and distribution of accessories. The Company also 
operates discount outlet stores that sell the Company's and other 
manufacturers' products.
