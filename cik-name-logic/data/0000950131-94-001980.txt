UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

- - ------------------------------------ 

In re: Case No. 94 B 44812 (JHG)

Fany Seventh Avenue Associates, Chapter 11

Debtor.

- - ------------------------------------

ORDER CONFIRMING PLAN OF REORGANIZATION
UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY
CODE FOR FANY SEVENTH AVENUE ASSOCIATES

This matter came before this Court on November 22, 1994, pursuant to this
Court's Order Scheduling Hearing to Consider (1) Approval of Disclosure Material
and Solicitation Procedures and (2) Confirmation of Prepackaged Plan of
Reorganization dated October 14, 1994 (the "Scheduling Order") with respect to
the pre-petition Disclosure Material (the "Disclosure Material") and the pre-
petition Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") filed with the Clerk of this Court
on October 14, 1994./1/ The Court, having reviewed the Plan, Disclosure
Material, the report submitted by Fany Seventh Avenue Associates (the "Debtor")
with respect to results of the solicitation respecting the acceptance of the
Plan (the "Voting Report"), the memorandum of law submitted by The Fuji Bank
Limited, Chicago Branch ("Fuji") in support of the Plan (the "Confirmation
Memorandum") and all other filed motions, applications, statements and comments
regarding approval of the Disclosure Material, the solicitation procedures and
confirmation; the Court having considered all testimony presented and evidence
admitted at the November 22, 1994 hearing (the

meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. The rules of interpretation set
forth in section 1.2 of the Plan shall apply to these Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order.
<PAGE>

"Confirmation Hearing"); the Court having taken judicial notice of the papers
and pleadings on file in the reorganization case, and the Court finding that the
legal and factual bases set forth in the Voting Report and Confirmation
Memorandum and presented at the Confirmation Hearing establish just cause for
the relief granted herein, the Court hereby makes the following Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order/2/:

FINDINGS OF FACT

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
----------------------

(1) On October 14, 1994 (the "Petition Date"), the Debtor filed a 
voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11. The Debtor continues in
possession of its properties and continues to operate its business as debtor-in-
possession pursuant to sections 1107 and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code.

(2) This Court has jurisdiction over the Debtor, its reorganization case
and this proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. (S)(S) 1334 and 157. This is a core
proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. (S) 157(b)(2)(L). The Debtor was and is
qualified to be a debtor under section 109(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The
primary asset of the Debtor is and was, for the one-hundred and eighty day
period immediately preceding the commencement of this reorganization case,
located in the Southern District of New York. Accordingly, venue in the Southern
District of New York for the reorganization case of the Debtor was and continues
to be proper under 28 U.S.C. (S) 1408(1).

- - ---------------
/2/ This Confirmation Order constitutes the Court's findings of fact and
conclusions of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52, as made applicable by Bankruptcy
Rules 7052 and 9014. Any and all findings of fact shall constitute findings
of fact even if they are stated as conclusions of law, and any and all
conclusions of law shall constitute conclusions of law even if they are
stated as findings of fact.

-2-
<PAGE>

(3) The Debtor and Fuji (collectively, the "Plan Proponents") are proper 
proponents of the Plan under section 1121(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.

NOTICE
------

(4) In accordance with the terms of the Scheduling Order, the Debtor 
served the notice attached to the Scheduling Order as Exhibit B (the
"Confirmation Hearing Notice") via U.S. mail, postage prepaid, or by hand, to
the office of the United States Trustee, all creditors and interest holders of
the Debtor, and all other interested parties. Further, the Confirmation Hearing
Notice was published in the local edition of the New York Times on October 24,
1994 and in the Real Estate Weekly on October 26, 1994. The Notice advised all
interested parties of the November 22, 1994 hearing (the "Confirmation Hearing")
and further advised all interested parties that, pursuant to the terms of the
Scheduling Order, November 18, 1994 had been fixed as the last day for filing
objections (a) to approval of the Disclosure Material and the procedures for
solicitation of votes to accept or reject the Plan, and (b) to confirmation of
the Plan.

(5) The Debtor's service of the Confirmation Hearing Notice upon all
holders of Claims against and Interests in the Debtor, by individual service and
by publication as set forth above, is hereby approved as sufficient notice to
all interested parties of the Confirmation Hearing. Accordingly, proper and
adequate notice of, and an opportunity to appear at, the Confirmation Hearing
was given to all persons with any Claim against or Interest in the Debtor.

<PAGE>

THE PLAN SATISFIES ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CONFIRMATION
--------------------------------------------------------
CONTAINED IN SECTION 1129 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE
------------------------------------------------

The Plan Satisfies Section 1129(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code
------------------------------------------------------------

(6) The Court finds and concludes that the Plan satisfies all applicable
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code as required by section 1129(a)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

The Plan Properly Designates Classes of Claims and Interests and the
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Classification Scheme is Reasonable
-----------------------------------

(7) Section 1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a plan must
designate classes of claims and interests. The Plan adequately classifies all
Claims and Interests. Administrative and Priority Tax Claims are not classified
because section 1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code does not require the
classification of such Claims, and because they must receive the treatment
specified in section 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code and cannot otherwise be
impaired. The Plan therefore satisfies the requirements of section 1123(a)(1) of
the Bankruptcy Code.

The Plan's Classification Scheme is Reasonable and Satisfies Section
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1122(a) of the Bankruptcy Code
------------------------------

(8) Section 1122(a) of the Bankruptcy Code states that a plan may place a
claim or interest in a particular class only if such claim or interest is
substantially similar to the other claims or interests of such class. A
classification scheme satisfies 1122(a) of the Bankruptcy Code when a reasonable
basis exists for the choices made and all claims within a particular class are
substantially similar. The Plan's classification scheme of Claims and Interests
is reasonable and necessary to implement the Plan and satisfies the requirements
of section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code.

-4-
<PAGE>

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1123(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code
----

(9) In accordance with section 1123(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, Article
IV of the Plan specifies the impaired and unimpaired classes of Claims and
Interests.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1123(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code
----

(10) In accordance with section 1123(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, Article
III of the Plan specifies the treatment of each impaired class of Claims and
Interests.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code
----

(11) Section 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code requires a plan to provide 
the same treatment for each claim or interest of a particular class, unless the
holder of a claim or interest agrees to less favorable treatment of such
particular claim or interest. The Plan provides for the uniform and identical
treatment for each Claim or Interest in each class that contains more than one
Claim or Interest unless the holder of a particular Claim or Interest agrees to
less favorable treatment of such particular Claim or Interest as required by
section 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1123(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code
----

(12) In accordance with section 1123(a)(5), the Plan provides adequate
means for the Plan's implementation. Article VIII of the Plan specifies in
detail the terms for implementing the Plan.

Section 1123(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code is Not Applicable to the Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(13) Because the Debtor, a joint venture, will not issue any voting
securities under the Plan, the provisions of section 1123(a)(6) of the
Bankruptcy Code concerning the equitable distribution of voting power among
equity securities are inapplicable.

-5-
<PAGE>

Section 1123(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code is Not Applicable to the Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(14) Section 1123(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code requires a plan to provide
for the selection of any director, officer, or trustee under the plan in a
manner consistent with the interests of creditors and equity security holders
and with public policy. Because the Debtor has no officers or directors, the
provisions of section 1123(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code are inapplicable to the
Plan and the Reorganized Debtor. The Disclosure Material nonetheless identified
the individuals who will serve as the executive officers and directors of the
general partner of the Co-Venturers. The manner of selection of such officers
and directors is consistent with existing law, the interests of creditors and
the holders of Interests, and public policy.

The Assumption and Assignment of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pursuant to Section 1123(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code is Proper
---------------------------------------------------------------

(15) In accordance with section 1123(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Plan
constitutes a motion by the Debtor to assume and assign to Newco the pre-
petition executory contracts and unexpired leases identified on Exhibits C and E
to the Plan, as amended and filed with the Court, as of the Effective Date of
the Plan. In addition, the Debtor has asked for authority to amend Exhibits C
and E to the Plan (which request is hereby granted) to add (a) a lease with
Seasonproof Garment and Down, Inc. executed on August 26, 1994, and (b) a
Federal Express Corporation Customer Convenience Network Placement Agreement
executed on July 18, 1991, (c) a lease executed on March 1, 1976 between Apparel
Center Building Corp. (the predecessor in interest to the Debtor) as landlord
and MAM Parking, Ltd. (the predecessor in interest to M.A.M. Properties, Inc.)
as tenant, and (d) a letter agreement dated April 15, 1991 between Equity Asset
Management, Inc. and Atrium Parking Corp. (collectively, the "Other Contracts").
The Other Contracts were inadvertently omitted from Exhibits C and E when the
Plan was filed. Section 10.5 of the Plan also provides for the 

-6-
<PAGE>

assignment to Newco of all executory contracts and unexpired leases entered into
by the Debtor after the Petition Date (collectively, the "Post-Petition
Contracts"). The assumption of each executory contract and unexpired lease by
Newco shall be specifically subject to the assignment to Newco of any and all
rights, claims, defenses and setoffs of the Debtor, including without
limitation, the right to (i) terminate any such executory contract or unexpired
lease as a result of any breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease by
any party other than the Debtor, and (ii) declare and pursue appropriate
remedies relating to any previously undeclared default or event of default
thereunder. The Debtor's decisions regarding the assumption and assignment of
executory contracts and unexpired leases, as reflected in the Plan, are based on
and are within the sound business judgment of the Debtor, and are in the best
interests of the Debtor and its estate. The Plan provides for the appropriate
prompt cure of defaults, if any, under executory contracts and unexpired leases
to be assumed and assigned under the Plan and otherwise complies with all
requirements of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code for the assumption and
assignment of such executory contracts and unexpired leases. Newco has provided
adequate assurance of future performance under all affected unexpired leases.

All Settlements and Compromises Incorporated in the Plan Pursuant to
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 1123(b)(3)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code are Reasonable, Fair, and
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Equitable and in the Best Interests of the Debtor's Estate
----------------------------------------------------------

(16) The Court is required to make an independent determination of the
fairness to the Debtor and its estate of the settlements embodied in the Plan.
Such settlements include, but are not limited to, the economic terms of the Plan
as agreed by the Debtor and Fuji and the agreement of the holders of
Intercompany Claims to subordinate their Claims to the payment in full of all
other Claims. The Court determines that such settlements are reasonable, fair,

-7-
<PAGE>

and equitable, and in the best interests of the Debtor and the Debtor's estate.
In approving the compromise and settlement of potential claims, this Court has
considered:

a. The balance of the likelihood of success of claims asserted by the
claimants against the likelihood of success of the defenses or
counterclaims possessed by the Debtor;

b. The balance of the likelihood of success of claims asserted by the
Debtor against the likelihood of success of the defenses or counterclaims
possessed by the claimants;

c The complexity, cost, and delay of litigation that would result in
the absence of settlements;

d. The lack of objection to the settlements by any creditor or party
in interest and the acceptance of the Plan by all holders of impaired
Claims and Interests; and

e. The fact that the Plan, which gives effect to the settlements, is
the product of extensive arms'-length negotiations among the Debtor, Fuji
and other interested parties.

(17) The Plan also provides that except as expressly provided in this
Confirmation Order, (a) each holder of a Claim who is entitled to receive a
distribution under the Plan, including Fuji, and their respective present and
former directors, officers, employees, agents, counsel and representatives, in
consideration of such entitlement and for the benefit of the Plan Proponents,
will be deemed to have forever released and discharged each of the Plan
Proponents, and their respective present and former directors, officers,
employees, agents, counsel, affiliates, holders of Interests and representatives
and their respective heirs, successors, personal representatives and assigns
from any and all claims and liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever
relating to or against any of them that is based upon or that arises out of any
alleged act or omission by any of them which is related to the Debtor, the
Chapter 11 Case, the Fuji Claim, or any of the Claims in the Chapter 11 Case,
(b) the Debtor and its Affiliates and their respective present and former
directors, officers, employees, agents 

-8-
<PAGE>

and representatives, will be deemed to have forever released and discharged the
holders of Interests, Fuji, Newco and any other nominee or assignee of Fuji
under the Plan, and their respective present and former directors, officers,
employees, agents, counsel, affiliates and representatives and their respective
heirs, successors, personal representatives and assigns from any and all claims
and liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever relating to or against any of
them that is based upon or that arises out of any alleged act or omission by any
of them which is related to the Debtor or the Chapter 11 Case, including any
claims, rights, liens or other actions relating to the Property, and (c) the
Debtor and its Affiliates and their respective present and former directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives, have covenanted not to sue any
tenant under any unexpired lease assumed by Newco under and pursuant to section
10.3 of the Plan without the express prior authorization of Newco or any other
nominee, assignee or other successor-in-interest to Fuji. The release contained
in section 8.12 of the Plan shall not affect the representations, warranties and
agreements of the Debtor and the holders of Interests under and pursuant to
section 8.4 of the Cash Collateral Agreement, which representations, warranties
and agreements shall survive the Chapter 11 Case and remain unaffected thereby.
This settlement, covenant not to sue and release of claims is an integral part
of the Plan and the Court finds and concludes that these mutual releases and
settlements are fair and equitable and in the best interests of the Debtor and
its estate.

(18) The Debtor's waiver and release of any and all claims or causes of
actions which may be asserted by or on behalf of the Debtor against the holders
of Interests and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents, for any act, omission or other event or occurrence taking
place on or prior to the Effective Date, is approved as being fair and equitable
and in the best interests of the Debtor's estate and its creditors.

The Plan Proponents have Satisfied the Requirements of Section 1129(a)(2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
of the Bankruptcy Code
----------------------

(19) Section 1129(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that the proponent
of a plan comply with all applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The
Debtor and Fuji, as proponents of the Plan, have in good faith complied with all
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code as required by section 1129(a)(2)
of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtor has in good faith complied with all the
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules and applicable
nonbankruptcy laws, rules and regulations governing notice, disclosure, and
solicitation in connection with the Plan, the Disclosure Material, and all other
matters considered by this Court in connection with this Chapter 11 Case.
Proper, sufficient, and adequate notice of the Confirmation Hearing has been
given to all holders of Claims and Interests and all other parties in interest
required to receive notice. The solicitation of votes from holders of Claims
and Interests was in good faith and in compliance with section 1126(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rule 3018(b), and not otherwise. The
solicitation and tabulation of ballots were proper and adequate. The record in
this case discloses that the Debtor has attempted in good faith to comply with
all orders of this Court and that the Debtor has not violated any such orders.
The Debtor has fulfilled all of the obligations and duties owed to its estate as
required and set forth in sections 1107 and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Therefore, the requirements of section 1129(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code have
been satisfied.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1129(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code
----

(20) The Plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means
forbidden by law as required by section 1129(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code. In
determining that the Plan has been proposed in good faith, the Court has
examined the totality of the circumstances surrounding the formulation of the
Plan. Based on the uncontroverted evidence proffered or presented at the
Confirmation Hearing, the Court finds and concludes that the Plan has been

-10-
<PAGE>

proposed with the legitimate and honest purpose of reorganizing the Debtor's
business affairs and to maximize the returns available to creditors. There is
no evidence of lack of good faith in the proposal of the Plan or that the Plan
was proposed for any improper purpose, including but not limited to the
avoidance of taxes.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1129(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code
----

(21) Any payments made or to be made by the Debtor or by a person issuing
securities or acquiring property under the Plan for services, or for costs and
expenses in connection with the case, or in connection with the Plan and
incident to the case, have been disclosed to and are subject to the approval of
this Court as reasonable as required by section 1129(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy
Code; provided, however, that this Court finds and concludes that the attorneys
retained by the Debtor are not required to file applications for the allowance
of compensation and the reimbursement of expenses inasmuch as the Cash
Collateral Agreement provided that such attorneys shall receive compensation for
services rendered in this case pursuant to application of a pre-petition
retainer received by such attorneys from the Co-Venturers and the payment of
such other amounts, if any, as the Co-Venturers may agree; provided, further,
that this Court finds and concludes that the professionals retained by Fuji are
not required to file applications for the allowance of compensation or
reimbursement of expenses. Because the professionals retained by Fuji are, and
will continue to be, compensated by Fuji from funds on hand from time-to-time in
the Safekeeping Account (as defined in, and in accordance with the terms of, the
Cash Collateral Agreement), which funds are the property of Fuji and not
property of the estate, such compensation is not being paid from estate assets
within the meaning of section 1129(a)(4). Rather, Fuji is compensating its
professionals from its own funds. Accordingly, Fuji shall be, and hereby is,
authorized to compensate its professionals for services rendered and expenses
incurred in connection with this Chapter 11 Case from 

-11-
<PAGE>

funds on hand from time-to-time in the Safekeeping Account without application
to or further order of this Court.

Section 1129(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code is Not Applicable to the Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(22) Section 1125(a)(5)(A)(i) of the Bankruptcy Code requires a debtor to
disclose the identity of the individuals who will hold positions with the debtor
after confirmation of the plan. Section 1125(a)(5)(A)(ii) of the Bankruptcy
Code requires that the service of such individuals be consistent with the
interests of creditors and interest holders and with public policy. Section
1129(a)(5)(B) requires the Debtor to disclose the identity of any insider that
will be employed or retained by the Reorganized Debtor and the nature of any
compensation for such insider. Because the Debtor has no officers or directors,
the provisions of section 1129(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code are inapplicable to
the Plan and the Reorganized Debtor. Nonetheless, the identities and
affiliations of the individuals proposed to serve, after consummation of the
Plan, as directors or officers of the general partner of the Co-Venturers have
been, to the extent known, fully disclosed. The Reorganized Debtor will not
employ or retain any insiders and therefore no further disclosure is necessary
or warranted.

Section 1129(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code is not Applicable to the Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(23) There are no rate changes provided in the Plan which require the
approval of any governmental regulatory commission with jurisdiction over rates
charged by the Debtor. Section 1129(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code therefore does
not apply to this case.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code
----

(24) Section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code requires each creditor or
interest holder in an impaired class to accept the plan under section
1129(a)(7)(A)(i) of the Bankruptcy Code or receive or retain under the plan on
account of such claim or interest property of a value, as of the effective date
of the plan, that is not less than the amount that 

-12-
<PAGE>

such holder would so receive or retain if the debtor were liquidated under
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in accordance with section 1129(a)(7)(A)(ii) of
the Bankruptcy Code. With respect to each impaired class, each holder of a Claim
or Interest of such class has accepted the Plan as required by section
1129(a)(7)(A)(i) of the Bankruptcy Code. Section 1111(b)(2) and section
1129(a)(7)(B) do not apply to any Claims of any Class.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1129(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code
----

(25) Section 1129(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that with respect
to each class of claims or interests under the Plan such class has accepted the
plan or such class be unimpaired under the Plan. Classes 1, 3, 4 and 5 are
unimpaired under the Plan. Classes 2, 6 and 7, which comprise the impaired
Classes of Claims and Interests, have each voted unanimously to accept the Plan
in accordance with section 1129(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code
----

(26) The Plan satisfies the requirements of all three subsections of
section 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code. As required by section 1129(a)(9)(A)
of the Bankruptcy Code, except as otherwise agreed by the holder of a particular
Administrative Expense,/3/ such Claims shall be paid in cash on the later of the
Effective Date or such date that the Administrative Expense becomes Allowed, in
the ordinary course of business, or, with respect to cure payments arising from
the assumption and assignment of executory contracts and leases, as otherwise
required by section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. As required by section
1129(a)(9)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, except as otherwise agreed by the holder
of a particular Other Priority Claim, such Claims will be paid in cash on the
Effective Date. As required by 

- - ---------------
/3/ For example, pursuant to the terms of the Cash Collateral Agreement, the
Debtor has agreed that its attorneys may not seek compensation from the
Debtor's estate. The attorneys for the Debtor shall receive compensation
pursuant to the application of a retainer received prior to the Petition
Date from the Co-Venturers and the payment of such other amounts, if any,
as the Co-Venturers may agree.

-13-
<PAGE>

section 1129(a)(9)(C) of the Bankruptcy Code, Priority Tax Claims will receive
payment in cash on the Effective Date or, at the option of the Plan Proponents,
deferred cash payments over a period not to exceed six years from the date of
assessment of such Claims, having a value, as of the Effective Date of the Plan,
equal to the allowed amount of such Claims.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1129(a)(10) of the
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Bankruptcy Code
---------------

(27) Pursuant to section 1129(a)(10) of the Bankruptcy Code, at least one
impaired class of claims must accept the plan, determined without incurring any
acceptance of the plan by any insider. The Plan satisfies section 1129(a)(10)
because at least one impaired class of Claims has accepted the Plan, which
acceptance has been determined without including any acceptance of the Plan by
any insider.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1129(a)(11) of the
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Bankruptcy Code
---------------

(28) Section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that a plan must
be "feasible," that is, the Court must determine that the debtor, or its
successor under the plan, is not likely to require liquidation or further
financial reorganization. The uncontroverted evidence introduced at the
Confirmation Hearing demonstrates that all funds required by the Plan for the
Effective Date to occur will be available for distribution on the Effective
Date. Accordingly, there is a reasonable likelihood that the Debtor will be
able to meet its financial obligations under the Plan and continue its business
in the ordinary course. The Court finds and concludes that confirmation and
consummation of the Plan are not likely to be followed by liquidation, or a need
for further financial reorganization, of the Debtor and that the Debtor has met
the requirements of section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code.

-14-
<PAGE>

(29) The Plan provides for four conditions to confirmation of the Plan as
set forth in section 11.1 thereof: (i) the aggregate allowed amount of all
Administrative Expenses (other than any amounts awarded and paid to Fuji or its
Professionals for making a substantial contribution to the Chapter 11 Case),
Priority Tax Claims and Unsecured Claims shall have been estimated or finally
determined to the satisfaction of the Plan Proponents to be less than $200,000;
(ii) the Disclosure Material shall have been approved by this Court as
containing adequate information; (iii) this Confirmation Order is to be
acceptable in form and substance to the Plan Proponents; and (iv) the Debtor
shall have performed in accordance with its duties and obligations under and
pursuant to the Cash Collateral Agreement. The Court finds and concludes that
all conditions to confirmation have been met or duly waived.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1129(a)(12) of the
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Bankruptcy Code
---------------

(30) In accordance with section 1129(a)(12) of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Plan provides for the payment, on the Effective Date of the Plan, of all fees
payable under section 1930 of title 28 of the United States Code.

Section 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code is not Applicable to the Plan
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(31) The Debtor did not maintain or establish any plan, fund, or program
for "retiree benefits" as such term is defined in section 1114 of the Bankruptcy
Code prior to the Petition Date and section 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code
does not apply to this case.

The Plan Satisfies the Requirements of Section 1129(d) of the Bankruptcy
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code
----

(32) Section 1129(d) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that, on the request
of a party in interest that is a governmental unit, the Court may not confirm a
plan if the principal purpose of the plan is the avoidance of taxes or the
avoidance of any application of section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15
U.S.C. (S)77e). The Court finds and determines that the 

-15-
<PAGE>

principal purpose of the Plan is not the avoidance of taxes and there has been
no objection filed by any governmental unit asserting such avoidance.

(33) The uncontroverted evidence introduced at the Confirmation Hearing
demonstrates that the objectives of the Plan Proponents in proposing the Plan
were:

(i) to enable all creditors to realize the maximum value of their
Claims; and

(ii) to emerge from chapter 11 on an expedited basis and thereby to
minimize any delay in recoveries by holders of Claims by achieving a fair
settlement of possible disputes without litigation.

The Plan Complies with Bankruptcy Rule 3016(c)
----------------------------------------------

(34) The Plan is dated and identifies the entities submitting the Plan in
accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 3016(b).

ORDER

Based upon the record of the Confirmation Hearing and upon the foregoing
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it is hereby ordered, adjudged, and
decreed that:

1. The Plan and each of its provisions shall be, and hereby are,
confirmed pursuant to section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code; provided, however,
that if there is any direct conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms
of this Confirmation Order, the terms of this Confirmation Order shall control.

-17-
<PAGE>

2. Immediately upon the entry of this Confirmation Order, in accordance
with section 1141(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Plan and its provisions shall
be now, and forever afterwards, binding upon the Debtor, the Reorganized Debtor,
any entity acquiring property under the Plan, and upon any creditor, claimant,
interest holder, and any other party in interest in this case, whether or not
the Claim or Interest of such entity, creditor, claimant, or other party in
interest is impaired under the Plan and whether or not such entity, creditor,
claimant, or other party in interest has accepted the Plan or received a
distribution thereunder including, without limitation, any and all parties to
executory contracts and unexpired leases with the Debtor and the respective
heirs, executors, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, employees,
beneficiaries, successors or assigns, if any, of any of the foregoing.

3. On the Effective Date, in accordance with sections 1141(b) and (c) of
the Bankruptcy Code, each of the following assets shall be and hereby are,
vested in the Reorganized Debtor free and clear of all liens, encumbrances,
charges and Claims of the Debtor's creditors, including without limitation, the
liens, claims and encumbrances of Fuji: (i) the Fany Property Tax Refunds; (ii)
$52,175 in Cash; and (iii) all causes of action of the Debtor relating to the
Fany Property Tax Refunds and all causes of action of the Debtor relating to or
against the holders of the Interests and their Affiliates. The Reorganized
Debtor may pursue all actions relating to the Fany Property Tax Refunds for its
benefit and operate its business on and after the Effective Date free of any
restrictions imposed by the Bankruptcy Code or this Court.

4. The Reorganized Debtor shall continue to exist as of the Effective
Date as a separate legal entity, with all the powers of a joint venture under
applicable law and without prejudice to any right to alter or terminate such
existence under applicable state law. The Plan does not provide for liquidation
of all or substantially all of the property of the estate; the 

-18-
<PAGE>

Debtor will engage in business after the consummation of the Plan; and the
Debtor would not be denied a discharge under section 727(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code if this case were a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

5. As of or following the time at which the conditions to the occurrence
of the Effective Date set forth in section 11.2 of the Plan are satisfied or
duly waived, the Plan Proponents and the Reorganized Debtor shall be, and hereby
are, authorized to effectuate the restructuring transactions contemplated by
sections 8.1 and 8.3 of the Plan, in each case in accordance with the applicable
terms of the Plan. In particular, Fuji is authorized to incorporate, designate
or otherwise assign all or any part of its rights (but not any of its
obligations under the Plan or the Cash Collateral Agreement, nor its rights with
respect to releases to be given or received by Fuji) under the Plan to Newco and
the Debtor is authorized and directed to assign, convey and transfer to Newco,
in accordance with the Plan and the Cash Collateral Agreement, title to the fee
estate comprising the Property and the real estate upon which it is erected and
all rights appurtenant thereto and all other property of any nature whatsoever
(tangible or intangible, and whether or not inchoate) owned by the Debtor and
held, acquired, used or usable in connection with the ownership, operation,
maintenance, leasing and use of such Property, including, without limitation,
all Cash (including Cash in all accounts established pursuant to the Cash
Collateral Agreement except as otherwise provided in, or necessary to satisfy
the provisions of, the Plan), Other Property Tax Refunds, books and records,
goodwill, contract and other rights, claims, causes of action, demands against
any Person (other than those Persons released pursuant to the Plan or this
Confirmation Order), all the Debtor's right, title and interest in trade names,
trademarks, telephone numbers, brochures, advertising materials, personal
property, furniture, equipment and supplies and all assignable permits, licenses
and/or authorizations issued by any Governmental Body relating to the

-19-
<PAGE>

development, construction, ownership, operation, maintenance, leasing and/or use
of Property and/or the fee estate, but excluding (i) the Fany Property Tax
Refunds; (ii) $52,175 in Cash; (iii) all causes of action of the Debtor relating
to the Fany Property Tax Refunds and all causes of action of the Debtor relating
to or against the holders of the Interests and their Affiliates; and (iv) the
items set forth on Exhibit H to the Cash Collateral Agreement. The property
transferred to Newco, Fuji, and any other nominee or assignee of Fuji shall be
conveyed free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances except that the
property transferred to Newco shall be conveyed subject to a portion of the Fuji
Claim. On or before the Effective Date, Newco or any other nominee or assignee
of Newco, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall designate the amount of the
Fuji Claim subject to which the property shall be conveyed to Newco or a nominee
or assignee of Newco, provided that, in the event that Newco is the Designee (as
defined below) or such other entity as the Designee shall designate, the amount
of the Fuji Claim subject to which the property shall be conveyed shall not
exceed $6 million. The foregoing liens, claims and encumbrances subject to
which the Property is transferred to Fuji or its nominee or assignee (including
Newco) in partial satisfaction of the Fuji Claim shall (i) be deemed to be
continuing liens and shall preclude any possibility of intervening creditors
prior to or on the Effective Date, (ii) to the extent such property is
transferred under or in connection with the Plan, be deemed to have been
transferred without violating any fraudulent transfer or conveyance law of the
United States, any State, territory, possession or the District of Columbia, and
(iii) constitute legal, valid and duly perfected first priority liens superior
to all other liens held by any other person or entity. For purposes of the Plan
and this Confirmation Order, Newco shall be any entity designated by Fuji on or
before the Effective Date provided that if Fuji is then obligated to assign
certain of its rights with respect to the Fuji Claim to 485 Fashion, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company 

-20-
<PAGE>

("Designee") or an affiliate thereof, then Newco shall be the Designee or such
other entity as the Designee may designate on or before the Effective Date. If
485 Fashion, L.L.C. is not designated by Fuji, then Newco shall be the Person or
entity so designated by Fuji.

6. To the fullest extent permitted by section 1146 of the Bankruptcy
Code, the issuance, transfer, or exchange of a security, or the making or
delivery of an instrument of transfer under the Plan shall not be taxed under
any law imposing a stamp tax or similiar tax. This Court specifically retains
jurisdiction to enforce the foregoing direction, by contempt or otherwise.

7. The Debtor's transfer of the Property to Newco or other assignee or
nominee of Fuji on the Effective Date, as provided in the Plan, is a legal,
valid and effective transfer of the Debtor's right, title and interest in and to
the Property and vests in Newco or other assignee or nominee of Fuji, all of the
Debtor's right, title and interest in and to the Property free and clear of all
Claims (other than liabilities expressly assumed by Newco under the Plan,
including all applicable real estate taxes, and other than as provided in
decretal paragraph 5 of this Confirmation Order), liens and interests
whatsoever, including without limitation any liabilities of the Debtor that may
be asserted against the Newco or the Property on the basis of any theory of
successor or transferee liability which may exist under applicable non-
bankruptcy law, except as otherwise provided in decretal paragraph 26 hereof.

8. The Debtor shall be, and hereby is, authorized and directed, pursuant
to sections 365 and 1123(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, to assume and assign to
Newco all of the Post-Petition Contracts and all of the executory contracts and
unexpired leases (including the Other Contracts) identified on amended Exhibits
C and E to the Plan except for an executory contract or unexpired lease
identified on amended Exhibits C and E to the Plan that: (a) has been assumed
or rejected pursuant to Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court; or (b) is the
subject 

-21-
<PAGE>

of a motion to reject that is pending before the Court on the Effective Date.
This Confirmation Order shall be, and hereby is, deemed to constitute this
Court's express approval and authorization, pursuant to section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, of all such assumptions and assignments as of the Effective
Date. Each assumption and assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease
shall be legal, valid and binding upon the Debtor, the Reorganized Debtor, Newco
and all non-debtor parties to such executory contracts and unexpired leases, all
to the same extent as if such assumption or rejection had been effectuated
pursuant to a separate order of this Court entered before the Confirmation Date
under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. The assumption of each executory
contract and unexpired lease by Newco shall be, and hereby is, specifically
subject to and inclusive of the assignment to Newco of any and all rights,
claims, defenses and setoffs of the Debtor, including without limitation, the
right to (i) terminate any such executory contract or unexpired lease as a
result of any breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease by any party
other than the Debtor, and (ii) declare and pursue appropriate remedies relating
to any previously undeclared default or event of default thereunder.

9. The approvals and authorizations specifically set forth in this
Confirmation Order are non-exclusive and are not intended to limit the authority
of the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor to take any and all actions necessary or
appropriate to implement, effectuate and consummate the Plan, this Confirmation
Order and the respective transactions contemplated thereby and hereby including,
without limitation, the filing of the Amended and Restated Joint Venture
Agreement. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision of
this Confirmation Order, pursuant to section 1142(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor shall be, and hereby are, specifically
authorized and empowered to take any and all such actions as any of their
respective agents may determine are necessary or 

-22-
<PAGE>

appropriate to implement, effectuate and consummate the Plan, this Confirmation
Order and the respective transactions contemplated thereby and hereby. Each
agent of the Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor shall be, and hereby is,
authorized to execute, deliver, file or record all documents designated by the
Plan Proponents as necessary to implement, effectuate and further evidence the
terms and conditions of the Plan, this Confirmation Order and the transactions
respectively contemplated thereby and hereby, all without further action by or
order of this Court and whether or not such actions or documents are
specifically referred to in the Plan, this Confirmation Order, the Disclosure
Material or the exhibits to any of the foregoing. To the extent that, under
applicable nonbankruptcy law, any of the foregoing actions would otherwise
require the consent or approval of the Co-Venturers of the Debtor or Reorganized
Debtor, this Confirmation Order shall constitute such consent or approval, and
such actions shall be, and hereby are, deemed to have been taken by the
unanimous consent of the Co-Venturers of the Debtor and the Reorganized Debtor.

10. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or this Confirmation Order,
on the Effective Date the Debtor is discharged and released from any and all
debts that arose before the date of this Order, including any and all Claims
held by Fuji (other than Claims, if any, arising from or relating to the
representations, warranties and agreements of the Debtor and the holders of
Interests under and pursuant to Section 8.4 of the Cash Collateral Agreement)
and from any and all debts of a kind specified in sections 502(g), 502(h) or
502(i) of the Bankruptcy Code, whether or not (a) a proof of claim based on such
debt is filed or deemed filed under section 501 of the Bankruptcy Code; (b) such
claim is allowed under section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code; or (c) the holder of
such claim has accepted the Plan; provided, however, that notwithstanding any
other provision of this Confirmation Order to the contrary, the legal, equitable
and contractual rights attendant to the Claim asserted by William 

-23-
<PAGE>

McCandless in the amount of $5,250,000 and the Claim asserted by Joan Curcio
Ucci and Nicholas Ucci in the amount of $1,100,000 shall be unaltered and such

this Order, such remaining funds shall be distributed as soon as practicable to
Fuji on account of the Fuji Claim.
