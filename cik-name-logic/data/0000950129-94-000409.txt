EXHIBIT A

PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING PURCHASE PRICE OF INVENTORIES

The Transferor shall, at the time of the audit, physically gauge the
level of motor fuels contained in each fuel storage tank at each Store to be
conveyed to the Transferee and determine the number of inches of motor fuel
contained therein. The Transferee may have representatives present.
Thereafter, the number of inches shall be converted to gallons of motor fuel
less water by use of the appropriate manufacturer's tank chart. To determine
the purchase price of the Motor Fuel Inventory to be paid by the Transferee to
the Transferor, the result shall be multiplied by the price the Transferor paid
for the motor fuel at its last documented delivery for each Store, plus
applicable freight charges and taxes. Immediately after the conclusion of such
measurements and calculations, the results thereof shall be memorialized in
writing and signed by representatives of the Transferor and the Transferee, and
shall be binding on the Transferor and the Transferee.

The purchase price of the Merchandise Inventory to be paid by the
Transferee to the Transferor for the Stores shall equal the actual retail price
of such Merchandise Inventory established in accordance with the Transferor's
inventory pricing practices multiplied by the average cost of such Merchandise
Inventory as calculated by the retail method of inventory valuation utilized by
Transferor for the operating area where each Store is located, expressed as a
percentage on the operating statement for such Store for the three (3) calendar
months immediately preceding the Closing Date. The Transferor shall, on the
Closing Date or within 48 hours before, conduct an audit of the inventory at
each Store along with a representative from the Transferee who shall have a
right to participate in the taking of the inventory. The Transferee will take
control of the inventory at each location effective as of the initiation of the
physical audit taken at each location. Damaged, spoiled and outdated
merchandise will not be included in the count. Branded items, such as hard
plastic coffee cups/fountain mugs and ice chests will not be included in the
count. Hot cups, cold cups, Icee cups, popcorn bags and nacho bowls will be
limited to a maximum inventory of 200 containers per size. None of the
smallest size of the Transferor's hot cups and none of the smallest size of the
Transferor's cold cups will be counted. The Transferee will only be obligated
to buy filled ice bags. Those products used to fill hot/cold containers (i.e.,
coffee beans/packets, fountain drink bag in the box, etc.) will be assigned a
zero value. Immediately after the calculation of the amount of the Merchandise
Inventory, the results

-vi-
<PAGE> 8

thereof shall be memorialized in writing and signed by representatives of the
Transferor and the Transferee and shall be binding on the Transferor and the
Transferee.

Within fifteen (15) Days after the Closing Date, the Parties shall
calculate the total purchase price payable by NCS to Circle K for the Circle K
Inventories and the total purchase price payable by Circle K to NCS for the NCS
Inventories. The net amount payable by NCS to Circle K or by Circle K to NCS,
as the case may be, shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
federal funds not later than fifteen (15) Days after the Closing Date.

Title Commitments as it desires covering the Land and the buildings at Fee

Commitments shall describe the state of the title to the Land and buildings at
said Fee Stores, together with all exceptions and conditions, including without
limitation, all easements,

-9-
<PAGE> 18

descriptions, rights-of-way, covenants, reservations and all other liens or
encumbrances affecting the Land and buildings at the Fee Stores which would
appear in an owner's Title Policy, if issued. The Title Commitments shall
contain the express commitment of the Title Company to issue a Title Policy to
the Transferee of each Fee Property, in the amount specified by each
Transferee, insuring such title to the Land and buildings comprising each Fee
Store as is specified in the Title Commitments. The Transferor shall
simultaneously cause to be furnished to the Transferee, at the Transferor's
sole cost and expense, copies of all instruments reasonably requested by the
Transferee which are referred to in the Title Commitments as conditions or
exceptions to title to the Land and buildings comprising the Fee Stores,
including liens.

SECTION 3.2. TITLE POLICIES.

At the Closing, each Party, at its sole cost and expense, may
purchase Title Policies covering the Land and buildings at each Fee Store to be
acquired by said Party insuring indefeasible fee simple title free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances other than the Permitted Exceptions, which are (i)
those to which the Transferee does not object pursuant to Section 3.3, (ii)
exceptions which do not materially and adversely affect or impair the use of
the Land and Improvements as currently used, and (iii) the standard exceptions
contained in the standard ALTA Form Title Policy (ALTEX for the State of Texas
or such other comparable form required in a state where the Land is located)
(the "Standard Exceptions").

SECTION 3.3. REVIEW OF TITLE COMMITMENTS BY TRANSFEREE.

The Transferee shall have ten (10) days after receipt of each Title
Commitment to review and to deliver to Transferor (such that the objections are
received by Transferor within said time period) in writing any objections the
Transferee may have to anything (other than Permitted Exceptions) contained or
set forth in a Title Commitment. Transferee agrees that it shall not object to
normal utility, ingress, egress, access or similar easements or other matters
affecting the Land and buildings comprising the Fee Stores which do not
materially interfere with the current use of the Land. Any such items to which
Transferee does not so object within such period shall be deemed to be
Permitted Exceptions.

SECTION 3.4. TRANSFEROR'S RIGHT TO CURE.

If exceptions (other than Permitted Exceptions) to the title to a
particular Fee Store have been identified in a Title Commitment and if the
Transferee delivers objections to such exceptions to the Transferor in
accordance with Section 3.3, then the Transferor shall, prior to the Closing
Date, use its reasonable efforts to satisfy such objections and shall be
obligated to cure, at the Closing, any matter that can be cured solely by the
payment of money ("Monetary Exceptions") in an amount not to exceed $25,000 per
Fee Store. Transferor shall be obligated to release all Deed of Trust liens at
its sole expense, which shall not be considered Monetary Exceptions.
Transferor shall have the option, but not the obligation, to cure any Monetary
Exception involving the payment of money in an amount in excess of $25,000 per
Fee Store

-10-
<PAGE> 19

("Optional Monetary Exception"). If Transferor gives written notice to
Transferee within ten (10) Days after receipt from Transferee of such
objections that Transferor is unable by the use of reasonable efforts to cure
any exception that is not a Monetary Exception or is unwilling to cure any
Optional Monetary Exception as to any Fee Store, then such Fee Store shall be
excluded from the transaction in accordance with Section 2.4 unless Transferee,
by written notice to Transferor within ten (10) Days after receipt of notice of
Transferor's inability or unwillingness to cure such exception, elects to waive
such exception and not to treat such Fee Store in accordance with Section 2.4.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the
exclusion of a particular Fee Store in accordance with Section 2.4 shall be
Transferee's sole remedy in the event that Transferor is unable or unwilling to
cure Transferee's objections to exceptions to the title to the real property at
such Fee Store.

SECTION 3.5. INABILITY TO DELIVER ANY OF THE STORES.

Notwithstanding any terms herein to the contrary, if after the use of
reasonable efforts (which reasonable efforts need not include the expenditure
of money) the Transferor is unable to secure the consent or attornment
agreement of any third party (including the landlord of a Sale Leaseback
Agreement or an individual lease) required for the assignment or Sublease or
conveyance of any Asset to the Transferee, the Parties will endeavor in good
faith to structure a transaction (by Sublease, license, or other reasonably
satisfactory arrangement) that gives the Parties the economic equivalents of
their respective bargains without requiring the consent of such third party.
In the event a reasonably satisfactory arrangement cannot be made with respect
to a Store or in the event of a condemnation as described in Section 2.4(b) or
in any other event in which the Transferor is unable to deliver any particular
Store on the Closing Date, such Store shall not be transferred and shall be
treated as provided in Section 2.4.

In the event of a partial condemnation of the Assets that would not
render a Store's continued operation as a convenience store impracticable in
accordance with generally accepted operating procedures in the convenience
store industry, the Transferor shall assign to the Transferee at Closing any
claim arising out of the partial condemnation and the Transferee shall take
title to the affected Asset. Said assignment of claim shall be the
Transferee's sole remedy if the Transferor is unable to deliver any portion of
the Assets due to a partial condemnation.

SECTION 3.6. SURVEYS.

As soon after the Effective Date as is reasonably possible, the
Transferor shall furnish to the Transferee all Surveys which Transferor has in
its possession covering the Fee Stores. The Transferee may order Surveys for
Fee Stores for which the Transferor has not been able to provide a Survey. All
Surveys will be ordered at the Transferee's sole cost and expense and shall be
conducted in accordance with ALTA or equivalent requirements. If any Survey
reveals any discrepancies, conflicts or shortages in area or boundary lines, or
any encroachments, or any overlapping of Improvements, or other matters not in
accordance with the Title Commitment to which the Transferee would be entitled
to object under Section 3.3, then the Transferor, upon

-11-
<PAGE> 20

written request from the Transferee received no later than ten (10) Days after
receipt by the Transferee of the applicable Survey, shall be obligated to cure,
at the Closing, any discrepancy, conflict or shortage in area or boundary
lines, or any encroachment or any overlapping of Improvements ("Survey Defect")
that may be cured by the payment of an amount not to exceed $25,000 per Fee
Store. Transferor shall have the option, but not the obligation, to cure any
Survey Defect involving the payment of money in excess of $25,000 per Fee
Store. If Transferor is unable or unwilling to effect a cure prior to the
Closing Date, the affected Fee Store shall be excluded from the transaction in
accordance with Section 2.4 unless Transferee, by written notice to Transferor
within ten (10) Days after receipt of notice of Transferor's inability or
unwillingness to cure such defect, elects not to treat such Fee Store in
accordance with Section 2.4 and Transferee shall be deemed to have waived its
objection previously made to such defect. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the exclusion of a particular Fee Store
in accordance with Section 2.4 shall be Transferee's sole remedy in the event
Transferor is unable by the use of reasonable efforts to effect a cure of any
such matters revealed by a Survey.

allocate the responsibility for any such environmental remediation between them
as set forth in this Article 5. However, nothing in this Article 5 is
intended, or shall be interpreted or construed, to require either Party to

other Person) against, either (i) any Third Party Liability (as defined herein)
or (ii) any responsibility or liability for remediation of any nature other
than Environmental Remediation (as defined herein).

PERFORMANCE, OR (I) QUALITY, OR (J) OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE ASSETS ARE BEING
ACQUIRED ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as and to the extent set forth in this
Agreement, neither party (i) makes any representations or warranties
whatsoever, express, implied or statutory, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) shall be liable to the Other Party for any
liability, claim, loss, damage (direct or indirect or incidental or

other Property arising from or relating to, in whole or in part, the
maintenance, repair, condition or design of the Assets.

SECTION 7.3. SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS, 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITY.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth

investigation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, ("Damages") known or
unknown, absolute, contingent or otherwise, arising from or relating to the
breach, known or unknown, absolute, contingent or otherwise, of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, unless notice of such breach or the
intent to enforce the indemnification provisions below was given as described
above. The rights of the Parties to sue to enforce the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in the Assignments and
Assumptions of Lease and the Assignments and Assumptions of Contracts, in each
case, shall not require the giving of such notice, shall not be deemed to be
released, and shall continue in full force and effect until barred by the
applicable statute of limitation.

(a) INDEMNIFICATION BY TRANSFEROR. Subject to
subparagraph (c) below, the Transferor, from and after the Closing
Date, shall defend, indemnify and hold the Transferee harmless from
and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by the
Transferee on account of or arising from or related to the
Transferor's operation of the Stores and ownership of the Assets
prior to the Closing Date (including without limitation product
liability, labor, employment and personal injury claims).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, this
indemnification shall not include (i) any costs and expenses
specifically to be borne by the Transferee pursuant to this
Agreement, (ii) any losses, liabilities, or obligations arising out
of or constituting a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement of the Transferee under this Agreement, (iii)
any claim for lost profits relating to the Stores and/or the Assets,

Transferor's warranty under Section 6.1(m) hereof). The Transferee
shall promptly notify the Transferor of the existence of any claim,
demand or other matter to which the Transferor's indemnification
obligation would apply and shall give the Transferor a reasonable
opportunity to defend the same at the Transferor's own expense and
with counsel of Transferor's own selection reasonably satisfactory to
the Transferee; provided that the Transferee also has the right to
fully participate in the defense at its own expense. If the
Transferor, within a reasonable time after this notice, but no later
than fifteen (15) Days, fails to defend, the Transferee shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to undertake the defense thereof,
and to compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment)
the claim or other matter on behalf, for the account, and at the risk
of the Transferor.

(b) INDEMNIFICATION BY TRANSFEREE. In addition to
the indemnification obligation assumed pursuant to Section 5.3, the
Transferee, from and after the Closing Date, shall defend, indemnify

suffered or incurred by the Transferor on account of or arising from
or related to the Transferee's operation of the Stores and ownership
of the Assets on and after the Closing Date (including without
limitation product liability, labor, employment and personal injury
claims). The Transferor shall promptly notify the Transferee of the

-23-
<PAGE> 32

existence of any claim, demand or other matter to which the
Transferee's indemnification obligation would apply and shall give
the Transferee a reasonable opportunity to defend the same at the
Transferee's own expense and with counsel of its own selection
reasonably satisfactory to the Transferor; provided that the
Transferor shall at all times also have the right to participate
fully in the defense at its own expense. If the Transferee shall,
within a reasonable time after such notice, but no later than fifteen
(15) Days, fail to defend the claim, the Transferor shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to undertake the defense of, and to
compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment) the
claim or other matter on behalf, for the account, and at the risk of
the Transferee.

(c) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, (i) the liability of each Party
for the breach of any representation or warranty or the failure to
perform or satisfy any covenant or agreement hereunder and the
indemnification obligations of the Parties shall be limited to actual
Damages and shall not include incidental, consequential or indirect
Damages, and (ii) neither Party shall have any liability for any
Damages arising from or relating to one or more breaches of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement or for any indemnification responsibilities hereunder,
unless and until and only to the extent that the aggregate Damages to
the Other Party and indemnification responsibilities shall exceed the

advisors. Information provided is for the sole purpose of evaluating the
transaction described herein. The Parties agree to inform their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors that the information must
be treated confidentially. Although both Parties agree in good faith to
provide accurate and complete information, neither Party represents or warrants
the accuracy and completeness of such information that it gives to the Other

must rely on independent evaluation of the Assets and not on information
provided to it by the Other Party. The Parties agree that, if any governmental
authority requests or requires disclosure of any information that a Party has
received from the Other Party, or if the Party receives a subpoena duces tecum

Transferee. The Employees will retain their last hire date as
provided for in the Transferee's policies and procedures.
Transferee's offers of employment pursuant to this Section 10.1(c)
shall not constitute any commitment, contract or understanding
(express or implied) of any obligation on the part of Transferee to a
post-Closing Date employment relationship of any fixed term or
duration or any terms or conditions other than as Transferee may
establish. Any employment accepted with Transferee shall be "at
will" subject to such conditions and terms as may be established by
Transferee and may be terminated by Transferee at any time for any
reason. Transferor shall not be obligated under the terms hereof to
distribute sums pursuant to its separation pay policy to Employees
offered employment with Transferee. Any Employee who (i) elects to
remain in the employ of Transferor, (ii) rejects such offer of
employment by Transferee, or (iii) is not offered employment by
Transferee, shall not, after the date of such election, rejection or
non-offer, be considered an "Employee" for purposes of the remaining

EXHIBIT A

PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING PURCHASE PRICE OF INVENTORIES

NCS shall, at the time of the audit, physically gauge the level of motor
fuels contained in each fuel storage tank at each Store to be conveyed to
Circle K and determine the number of inches of motor fuel contained therein.
Circle K may have representatives present. Thereafter, the number of inches
shall be converted to gallons of motor fuel less water by use of the
appropriate manufacturer's tank chart. To determine the purchase price of the
Motor Fuel Inventory to be paid by Circle K to NCS, the result shall be
multiplied by the price NCS paid for the motor fuel at its last documented
delivery for each Store, plus applicable freight charges and taxes.
Immediately after the conclusion of such measurements and calculations, the
results thereof shall be memorialized in writing and signed by representatives
of NCS and Circle K, and shall be binding on NCS and Circle K.

The purchase price of the Merchandise Inventory to be paid by Circle K
to NCS for the Stores shall equal the actual retail price of such Merchandise
Inventory established in accordance with the NCS's inventory pricing practices
multiplied by the average cost of such Merchandise Inventory as calculated by
the retail method of inventory valuation utilized by NCS for the operating area
where each Store is located, expressed as a percentage on the operating
statement for such Store for the three (3) calendar months immediately
preceding the Closing Date. NCS shall, on the Closing Date or within 48 hours
before, conduct an audit of the inventory at each Store along with a
representative from Circle K who shall have a right to participate in the
taking of the inventory. Circle K will take control of the inventory at each
location effective as of the initiation of the physical audit taken at each
location. Damaged, spoiled and outdated merchandise will not be included in
the count. Branded items, such as hard plastic coffee cups/fountain mugs and
ice chests will be included in the count. Hot cups, cold cups, Icee cups,
popcorn bags and nacho bowls will be limited to a maximum inventory of 200
containers per size. None of the smallest size of NCS's hot cups and none of
the smallest size of the NCS's cold cups will be counted. Circle K will only
be obligated to buy filled ice bags. Those products used to fill hot/cold
containers (i.e., coffee beans/packets, fountain drink bag in the box, etc.)
will be assigned a zero value. Immediately after the calculation of the amount
of the Merchandise Inventory, the results thereof shall be memorialized in
writing and signed by representatives of NCS and Circle K and shall be binding
on NCS and Circle K.

<PAGE> 9
Within fifteen (15) Days after the Closing Date, the Parties shall
calculate the total purchase price payable by Circle K to NCS for the
Inventories. The amount payable by Circle K to NCS shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available federal funds not later than fifteen (15)
Days after the Closing Date.

ARTICLE 3. TITLE

SECTION 3.1. TITLE COMMITMENTS.

As soon after the Effective Date as is reasonably possible, Circle K
shall, at its sole cost and expense, order from the Title Company such Title
Commitments as it desires covering the Land and the buildings at the Fee
Stores. The Title Commitments shall describe the state of the title to the
Land and buildings at the Fee Stores, together with all exceptions and
conditions, including without limitation, all easements, descriptions,
rights-of-way, covenants, reservations and all other liens or encumbrances
affecting the Land and buildings at the Fee Stores which would appear in an
owner's Title Policy, if issued. The Title Commitments shall contain the
express commitment of the Title Company to issue a Title Policy to Circle K, in
the amount specified by Circle K, insuring such title to the Land and buildings
comprising each Fee Store as is specified in the Title Commitments. NCS shall
simultaneously cause to be furnished to Circle K, at NCS's sole cost and
expense, copies of all instruments reasonably requested by Circle K which are
referred to in the Title Commitments as conditions or exceptions to title to
the Land and buildings comprising the Fee Stores, including liens.

SECTION 3.2. TITLE POLICIES.

At the Closing, Circle K, at its sole cost and expense, may purchase
Title Policies covering the Land and buildings at each Fee Store insuring
indefeasible fee simple title free and clear of all liens and encumbrances
other than the Permitted Exceptions, which are (i) those to which Circle K does
not object pursuant to Section 3.3, (ii) exceptions which do not materially and
adversely affect or impair the use of the Land and Improvements as currently
used, and (iii) the standard exceptions contained in the standard ALTA Form
Title Policy (or the comparable form required in the State of Georgia) (the
"Standard Exceptions").

SECTION 3.3. REVIEW OF TITLE COMMITMENTS BY CIRCLE K.

Circle K shall have ten (10) Days after receipt of each Title
Commitment to review and to deliver to NCS (such that the objections are
received by NCS within said time period) in writing any objections that Circle
K may have to anything (other than Permitted Exceptions) contained or set forth
in a Title Commitment. Circle K agrees that it shall not object to normal
utility, ingress, egress, access or similar easements or other matters
affecting the Land and buildings comprising the Fee Stores which do not
materially interfere with the current use of the Land. Any such items to which
Circle K does not so object within such period shall be deemed to be Permitted
Exceptions.

SECTION 3.4. NCS'S RIGHT TO CURE.

If exceptions (other than Permitted Exceptions) to the title to a
particular Fee Store have been identified in a Title Commitment and if Circle K
delivers objections to such exceptions to

-8-
<PAGE> 18
NCS in accordance with Section 3.3, then NCS shall, prior to the Closing Date,
use its reasonable efforts to satisfy such objections and shall be obligated to
cure, at the Closing, any matter that can be cured solely by the payment of
money ("Monetary Exceptions") in an amount not to exceed $25,000 per Fee Store.
NCS shall be obligated to release all Deed of Trust liens at its sole expense,
which shall not be considered Monetary Exceptions. NCS shall have the option,
but not the obligation, to cure any Monetary Exception involving the payment of
money in an amount in excess of $25,000 per Fee Store ("Optional Monetary
Exception"). If NCS gives written notice to Circle K within ten (10) Days
after receipt from Circle K of such objections that NCS is unable by the use of
reasonable efforts to cure any exception that is not a Monetary Exception or is
unwilling to cure any Optional Monetary Exception as to any Fee Store, then
such Fee Store shall be excluded from the transaction in accordance with
Section 2.4 unless Circle K, by written notice to NCS within ten (10) Days
after receipt of notice of NCS's inability or unwillingness to cure such
exception, elects to waive such exception and not to treat such Fee Store in
accordance with Section 2.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, the exclusion of a particular Fee Store in
accordance with Section 2.4 shall be Circle K's sole remedy in the event that
NCS is unable or unwilling to cure Circle K's objections to exceptions to the
title to the real property at such Fee Store.

SECTION 3.5. INABILITY TO DELIVER ANY OF THE STORES.

Notwithstanding any terms herein to the contrary, if after the use of
reasonable efforts (which reasonable efforts need not include the expenditure
of money) NCS is unable to secure the consent of any third party (including the
landlord of a Sale Leaseback Agreement or an individual lease) required for the
assignment or Sublease or conveyance of any Asset to Circle K, the Parties will
endeavor in good faith to structure a transaction (by Sublease, license, or
other reasonably satisfactory arrangement) that gives the Parties the economic
equivalents of their respective bargains without requiring the consent of such
third party. In the event a reasonably satisfactory arrangement cannot be made
with respect to a Store or in the event of a condemnation as described in
Section 2.4(b) or in any other event in which NCS is unable to deliver any
particular Store on the Closing Date, such Store shall not be transferred and
shall be treated as provided in Section 2.4.

In the event of a partial condemnation of the Assets that would not
render a Store's continued operation as a convenience store impracticable in
accordance with generally accepted operating procedures in the convenience
store industry, NCS shall assign to Circle K at Closing any claim arising out
of the partial condemnation and Circle K shall take title to the affected
Asset. Said assignment of claim shall be Circle K's sole remedy if NCS is
unable to deliver any portion of the Assets due to a partial condemnation.

SECTION 3.6. SURVEYS.

As soon after the Effective Date as is reasonably possible, NCS shall
furnish to Circle K all Surveys which NCS has in its possession covering the
Fee Stores. Circle K may order

-9-
<PAGE> 19
Surveys for Fee Stores for which NCS has not been able to provide a Survey.
All Surveys will be ordered at Circle K's sole cost and expense and shall be
conducted in accordance with ALTA or equivalent requirements. If any Survey
reveals any discrepancies, conflicts or shortages in area or boundary lines, or
any encroachments, or any overlapping of Improvements, or other matters not in
accordance with the Title Commitment to which Circle K would be entitled to
object under Section 3.3, then NCS, upon written request from Circle K received
no later than ten (10) Days after receipt by Circle K of the applicable Survey,
shall be obligated to cure, at the Closing, any discrepancy, conflict or
shortage in area or boundary lines, or any encroachment or any overlapping of
Improvements ("Survey Defect") that may be cured by the payment of an amount
not to exceed $25,000 per Fee Store. NCS shall have the option, but not the
obligation, to cure any Survey Defect involving the payment of money in excess
of $25,000 per Fee Store. If NCS is unable or unwilling to effect a cure prior
to the Closing Date, the affected Fee Store shall be excluded from the
transaction in accordance with Section 2.4 unless Circle K, by written notice
to NCS within ten (10) Days after receipt of notice of NCS's inability or
unwillingness to cure such defect, elects not to treat such Fee Store in
accordance with Section 2.4 and Circle K shall be deemed to have waived its
objection previously made to such defect. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the exclusion of a particular Fee Store
in accordance with Section 2.4 shall be Circle K's sole remedy in the event NCS
is unable by the use of reasonable efforts to effect a cure of any such matters
revealed by the Survey.

ARTICLE 4. CLOSING

SECTION 4.1. CLOSING.

The Closing shall be held at 10:00 A.M. at the principal place of

(h) There shall not be any actual or threatened action

ARTICLE 5. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

SECTION 5.1. BACKGROUND.

In order to (i) minimize the likelihood of future disputes between the
Parties regarding their potential responsibilities for any environmental
remediation that may be required as a result of any Petroleum Contamination at
any of the Stores, and (ii) help promote certainty and thereby expedite the
performance of any such environmental remediation, the Parties desire to
allocate the responsibility for any such environmental remediation between them
as set forth in this Article 5. However, nothing in this Article 5 is
intended, or shall be interpreted or construed, to require either Party to
assume responsibility for, or to indemnify or defend the Other Party (or any
other Person) against, either (i) any Third Party Liability (as defined herein)
or (ii) any

-13-
<PAGE> 23
responsibility or liability for remediation of any nature other than
Environmental Remediation (as defined herein).

SECTION 5.2. DEFINED TERMS.

In addition to the terms defined elsewhere in this Agreement, the
terms set forth below shall have the following meanings:

(a) "ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION" shall mean (i) such
actions as may be required by applicable law and applicable rules and
regulations relating to the environment that now or in the future
require the remediation of any of the Store Sites as the result of
Petroleum Contamination, as such law, rules and regulations may be in
effect from time to time, and (ii) such further actions, if any, as
may be required at any of the Store Sites by any final and
nonappealable order of any court or governmental authority requiring
remediation at any of the Store Sites. The term "Environmental
Remediation" shall not include any actions of any nature that may be
required at any of the Store Sites as a result of anything other than
Petroleum Contamination.

(b) "THIRD PARTY LIABILITY" shall mean any liability,
responsibility or obligation of any nature whatsoever other than
responsibility for Environmental Remediation. Without limiting the
foregoing in any way, the term "Third Party Liability" shall include
any and all liability to any Person for monetary damages, whether
arising in an action sounding in tort or contract, as civil or
criminal penalties, or otherwise.

(c) "STORE SITE" shall mean any tract of land in which
Circle K acquires a fee estate or a leasehold estate from NCS pursuant
to this Agreement, as well as any property that suffers or has
suffered Petroleum Contamination that originates or originated from
the tract acquired pursuant to this Agreement. The term "Store Site"
shall not include any property except to the extent that such property
suffers or has suffered Petroleum Contamination that originates or
originated from the property acquired by Circle K pursuant to this
Agreement.

(d) "PERSON" shall mean any individual or entity of
any nature whatsoever, and shall include governmental authorities and
quasi-governmental authorities and entities.

SECTION 5.3. ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION.

(a) Assumption of Liability. Subject to Section
5.3(b), Circle K hereby assumes all responsibility of NCS to effect
and pay for any and all Environmental Remediation required to be

the Closing Date or required in the future) at any and all of the
Store Sites acquired by Circle K pursuant to this Agreement ("Assumed
Liabilities").

(b) Limitation. The Assumed Liabilities shall not
include (i) any Third Party Liability, (ii) any liability to pay for
any Environmental Remediation performed prior to the Closing Date, or

any material respect.

(c) Indemnification. Circle K hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless NCS from and against the Assumed
Liabilities and any attorneys' fees related thereto. In addition,
Circle K hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless NCS from
and against any and all Damages (as defined elsewhere herein)
resulting directly from Circle K's failure to effect and pay for any
Environmental Remediation on a timely basis. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Circle K shall not be responsible for any Damages that
arise from NCS's breach of its warranty under Section 6.1(m) hereof.

SECTION 5.4. CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS.

(a) NCS will promptly provide to Circle K the following items:

list by Store of underground storage tank system information
including composition descriptions, installation dates, all

relied and will rely solely on its own independent investigation of the Assets

OBLIGATIONS OF BRINGING THE ASSETS INTO COMPLIANCE WITH ANY AND ALL APPLICABLE
LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LAWS AND REGULATIONS
PERTAINING TO PETROLEUM CONTAMINATION. In connection with the transactions

QUALITY, OR (J) OTHERWISE. CIRCLE K ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE ASSETS ARE BEING ACQUIRED ON AN "AS

foregoing, except as and to the extent set forth in this Agreement, NCS (i)
makes no representation or warranty whatsoever, express, implied or statutory,
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) shall
not be liable to Circle K for any liability, claim, loss, damage (direct or

SECTION 7.3. SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITY.

of Contracts, in each case, shall not require the giving of such notice, shall

(a) INDEMNIFICATION BY NCS. Subject to subparagraph (c)
below, NCS, from and after the Closing Date, shall defend,

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, this
indemnification shall not include (i) any costs and expenses

notify NCS of the existence of any claim, demand or other matter to
which NCS's indemnification obligation would apply and shall give
NCS a reasonable opportunity to defend the same at NCS's own
expense and with counsel of NCS's own selection reasonably
satisfactory to Circle K; provided that Circle K also has the right
to fully participate in the defense at its own expense. If NCS,
within a reasonable time after this notice, but no later than
fifteen (15) Days, fails to defend, Circle K shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to undertake the defense thereof, and to
compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment) the

shall promptly notify Circle K of the existence of any claim,
demand or other matter to which Circle K's indemnification
obligation would apply and shall give Circle K a reasonable
opportunity to defend the same at Circle K's own expense and with
counsel of its own selection reasonably satisfactory to NCS;
provided that NCS shall at all times also have the right to
participate fully in the defense at its own expense. If Circle K

the right, but not the obligation, to undertake the defense of, and
to compromise

or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment) the claim or
other matter on behalf, for the account, and at the risk, of Circle
K.

(c) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, (i) the liability of each Party for
the breach of any representation or warranty or the failure to
perform or satisfy any covenant or agreement hereunder and the
indemnification obligations of the Parties shall be limited to
actual Damages and shall not include incidental, consequential or
indirect Damages, and (ii) neither Party shall have any liability
for any Damages arising from or relating to one or more breaches of
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement or for any indemnification responsibilities
hereunder, unless and until and only to the extent that the

ARTICLE 8. ACCESS TO INFORMATION; DUE DILIGENCE

SECTION 8.1. INSPECTIONS; ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

NCS agrees to allow Circle K to inspect the Assets after reasonable
notice, provided such inspection does not interfere with the operation of the
Stores. NCS agrees to furnish Circle K with such information related to the
Assets as is reasonably requested and Circle K agrees to keep such information
highly confidential and not to reveal it to any person other than its officers,
directors, employees, agents and legal and accounting advisors. Information
provided is for the sole purpose of evaluating the transaction described
herein. Circle K agrees to inform its officers, directors, employees, agents
and advisors that the information must be treated confidentially. Although NCS
agrees in good faith to provide accurate and complete information, it does not
represent or warrant the accuracy and completeness of such information except
as is provided in this Agreement. Circle K acknowledges that it must rely on
independent evaluation of the Assets and not on information provided to it by
NCS. Circle K agrees that, if any governmental authority requests or requires
disclosure of any information that it has received from NCS, or if Circle K
receives a subpoena duces tecum or other order mandating disclosure of the
information, it will immediately notify NCS to permit NCS an opportunity to
seek a protective order with respect to disclosure of the information.

ARTICLE 9. TERMINATION

Parties;

(b) Circle K will endeavor to interview substantially
all of the remaining Employees who work in the Stores. After the
interviews, Circle K will consider employing such persons who meet

retain

-24-
<PAGE> 34
their last hire date as provided for in Circle K's policies and
procedures. Circle K's offers of employment pursuant to this
Section 10.1(c) shall not constitute any commitment, contract or
understanding (express or implied) of any obligation on the part of
Circle K to a post-Closing Date employment relationship of any
fixed term or duration or any terms or conditions other than as
Circle K may establish. Any employment accepted with Circle K
shall be "at will" subject to such conditions and terms as may be
established by Circle K and may be terminated by Circle K at any
time for any reason. NCS shall not be obligated under the terms
hereof to distribute sums pursuant to its separation pay policy to
Employees offered employment with Circle K. Any Employee who (i)
elects to remain in the employ of NCS, (ii) rejects such offer of
employment by Circle K, or (iii) is not offered employment by
Circle K, shall not, after the date of such election, rejection or
non-offer, be considered an "Employee" for purposes of the

Act, Workers' Compensation, or Medical or Military leave on the
Closing Date (an "Affected Employee"), shall remain in the employ
of NCS until released from the appropriate medical practitioner or
governmental agency. The Affected Employee may be terminated by
NCS and any causes of action or claims brought pursuant to that
termination will be the sole responsibility of NCS.

401(k) plan will be allowed to immediately enroll in Circle K's
401(k) plan on the next entry date of Circle K if they have been
employed with NCS for one year or more and are over twenty-one (21)
years of age.

(g) As of the Effective Time, Employees shall
participate in Circle K's existing employee benefit plans and
programs according to Circle K's policies as applicable to
