Item 5. Other Information

The Company reported earnings of $2.15 per common share on
revenues of $2,880,995,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993. In the
comparable 1992 period, earnings per common share were $2.14 on revenues of
$2,621,839,000. The average number of common shares outstanding in the two
periods were 112,057,000 and 111,439,000, respectively.

Overall earnings remained stable in 1993 while the Company's cash
flow position continued to improve, consistent with the 1989 Settlement. The
earnings in the electric business were lower in 1993 when compared to 1992 due
primarily to the expensing of certain costs related to the 100-year storm,
lower interest rates associated with the short-term investments, and regulatory
adjustments. The lower level of earnings in the electric business was offset
by a significant increase in the gas business earnings. The Company saw
continued expansion in the gas business in 1993.
