REPORTS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN EARNINGS

FOR THE THIRD QUARTER

PHOENIX, Arizona, October 18, 1994 -- GFC Financial Corporation (NYSE:GFC)
today reported strong results for the third quarter ended September 30, 1994
resulting from the addition of an acquisition for a full quarter, quality
portfolio growth and sustained net interest margins.
Net income was $22.3 million ($0.78 per common share) for the third
quarter of 1994 compared to $6.8 million ($0.32 per common share) for the third
quarter of 1993, a 228% increase in income from continuing operations and a
144% increase in earnings per share on a significantly increased number of
shares for the 1994 period. The results for the third quarter of 1994 include
income for a full quarter from TriCon Capital ("TriCon") acquired on April 30,
1994. Net income for the third quarter of 1993 included a $4.9 million ($0.24
per common share) adjustment for tax rate increases applicable to deferred
income taxes generated by the Company's leveraged lease portfolio. Excluding
this adjustment, net income for the third quarter of 1993 was $11.6 million
($0.56 per common share). The improvement in net income and earnings per
share over the third quarter of 1993, before including the adjustment for
deferred income taxes, was 92% and 39%, respectively.

Sam Eichenfield, President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
GFC, indicated that he was pleased with the strong performance for the third
quarter of 1994, which is the first full quarter with both Ambassador Factors
("Ambassador), the factoring and asset based lending company acquired in
February 1994, and TriCon. Eichenfield stated that "along with GFC's core
operations, the addition of Ambassador and TriCon has formed a solid foundation
for the Company's continued growth." He added that new business volume
continues strong, exceeding $1.1 billion for the nine months of 1994 and
portfolio quality continues to improve.

Nonearning assets as a percent of funds employed was 3.5% at September
30, 1994, an improvement from 3.7% at the end of the second quarter of 1994,
and as measured as a percent of funds employed and securitizations declined
further to 3.3% at September 30, 1994.

Interest margins earned continue to hold at 6.0% of average earning
assets. This measurement compares to 5.5% for the 1993 period and reflects the
contributions of the acquisitions made in 1994 as well as the continuing strong
returns of the core financial operations. The interest margins more than
offset the higher provisions for possible credit losses and the higher selling,
administrative and other operating expenses ("operating expenses").

The higher loss provisions are attributable to the operations of the
businesses acquired in 1994 and are consistent with the dynamics and expected
loss experience of those businesses.

The higher operating expenses are primarily attributable to the
acquisitions of TriCon and Ambassador in 1994. The running rate of these
expenses (measured as a percent of interest margins earned) was 46.6% (for the
combined entities) in 1994 an increase from 46.1% for GFC (which excluded
TriCon and Ambassador) in 1993, but an improvement over 47.2% for the second
quarter of 1994.

Earnings also benefited from strong portfolio growth. New business
volume was up by 90% to $1.1 billion for the first nine months of 1994, from
$591 million for the 1993 period.

Income taxes were higher in the third quarter of 1994 due to an
increase in income before income taxes and to a higher tax rate in effect
during the third quarter of 1994 (primarily attributable to foreign income
taxes provided).
