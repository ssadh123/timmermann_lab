MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The following discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in
understanding BB&T's results of operations and changes in financial position for
the past three years. This review should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements, and accompanying footnotes beginning on page
25 of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in tables
1 to 13 found on pages 11 to 24 of this report.

During the period 1990-93, BB&T consummated the acquisitions of 14 thrift
institutions with total assets of approximately $3.1 billion. At the end of
1993, BB&T had pending the acquisitions of two additional thrift institutions,
as well as L.S.B Bancshares, Inc., of South Carolina, a multi-bank holding
company. The assets of these three institutions totalled approximately $1.2
billion at the end of 1993. The acquisition of L.S.B. was subsequently 
consummated on June 30, 1994. The audited consolidated financial statements, 
notes thereto and supplementary financial information contained herein, as well 
as the discussion and analysis, have been restated to reflect the results of 
L.S.B. for all periods presented.

Ten of the completed acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting. The other four acquisitions were accounted for using the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting, and all financial data has been
restated to include the results of the pooled companies. Period to period
comparisons of financial positions and results of operations (and the components
thereof) are not necessarily indicative of the results that might have been
obtained had all acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of the reporting
periods. Selected pro forma financial data is contained in Footnote 2 of the
consolidated financial statements.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

BB&T reported record earnings for the eleventh consecutive year in 1993.
Net income totalled $105.0 million in 1993, an increase of $22.4 million or
27.1% over 1992. Net income for 1992 was $82.6 million and was $14.3 million or
20.9% over the earnings of $68.3 million recorded in 1991. 

Primary net income per share rose 16.6% from 1992 to $2.95 in 1993, and
fully diluted net earnings per share grew 19.8% to $2.91. Primary net income
per share was $2.53 in 1992 and $2.30 in 1991, while fully diluted per share
earnings for those two years were $2.43 and $2.21, respectively. The following
highlights underscore the key elements of performance for 1993.

. Average earning assets increased 13.0% for 1993 and 12.9%
for 1992. Taxable equivalent net interest income rose $38.6
million or 11.6% in 1993. This followed an increase in taxable
equivalent net interest income of $53.7 million or 19.2% in
1992.

. The provision for loan losses was reduced by $13.9 million
or 42.2% in 1993, following a reduction of $9.3 million or 22.1%
in 1992. The provision totalled $19.0 million in 1993, less
than half the provision of $42.3 million recorded two years
earlier. Large provisions were recorded in 1991 because of
unusually high levels of both nonperforming assets and actual
loan losses. Improved asset quality has allowed BB&T to reduce
its provision for loan losses during the past two years.

. Noninterest income for 1993 increased $24.0 million or 25.1% to
a total of $119.5 million. This followed an increase of $4.7
million or 5.1% in 1992. Noninterest income included gains on
sales of securities of $1.7 million in 1993, $6.3 million in 1992
and $10.9 million in 1991.
<PAGE>

PAGE

. Noninterest expense totalled $301.6 million in 1993. This
represented an increase of $47.4 million or 18.7% from the
$254.1 million in 1992, which was an increase of 18.2% over 1991.

The return on average assets for 1993 was 1.21%, compared with 1.08% in
1992 and 1.01% in 1991. The returns on average shareholders' equity for each of
the last three years were 14.21%, 13.36% and 13.32%, respectively.

At the end of 1993, the ratio of equity to assets was 8.08%, compared with
8.25% a year earlier and 7.79% at the end of 1991. The risk-adjusted total
capital ratio was 13.73% at the end of the year, compared with 15.37% twelve
months earlier. The equity and capital ratios of BB&T declined marginally in
1993 because of the acquisition of Old Stone Bank of North Carolina (total
assets of approximately $537 million) in a cash purchase. Table 2 provides
highlights of key profitability measures for each of the past five years.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income represents the principal source of earnings for BB&T.
Net interest income equals the amount by which interest income exceeds interest
expense. For 1993 net interest income represented 74.9% of net revenues (net
interest income plus noninterest income), compared with 76.8% in 1992 and 74.2%
in 1991. This ratio was unusually low in 1991 because of gains on sales of
securities included in noninterest income, and, more importantly, was
substantially lower in 1993 because of substantial increases in noninterest
revenues from BB&T's mortgage banking, insurance agency, trust and investment 
sales activities.

The taxable equivalent net yield on average earning assets is a primary
measure used in evaluating the effectiveness of the management of earning assets
and funding liabilities. The net yield on average earning assets was 4.57% in
1993, 4.63% in 1992 and 4.39% in 1991. Although the margin was slightly lower in
1993, BB&T has generated higher net interest margins during the past four years,
reversing a trend of declining margins through much of the 1980s. However,
margins are expected to stabilize or decline in coming quarters.

Several factors have contributed to the improved net interest margins in
recent years. A slower rate of growth in earning assets, particularly loans
(excluding the effect of acquisitions), has enabled BB&T to improve the rate
structure of its funding liabilities. Also, as interest rates have declined in
recent years, market factors have resulted in increased spreads between the
rates earned on earning assets and rates paid for interest-bearing liabilities.
This has been particularly beneficial to BB&T as rates paid for deposits and
other funds used to finance investments in fixed rate mortgages acquired with
the thrifts have been declining. The refinancing boom in home mortgage lending
eliminated much of this advantage by the end of 1993.

Another factor in the improved net interest margins has been the benefits
realized from hedging instruments, particularly interest rate swaps, used as
tools in managing net interest income and margins. BB&T realized benefits of
$17.6 million in 1993 and $18.2 million in 1992 from its hedges. Finally,
growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and increased levels of shareholders'
equity have provided additional funding with no related interest cost. This has
resulted in greater amounts of net interest income and improved margins.
Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased by approximately $121 million in
1993 and $110 million in 1992, while average shareholders' equity increased $121
million in 1993 and $105 million in 1992.
<PAGE>

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES

An annual provision for loan losses is charged against earnings in order to
maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate by
management to absorb existing and potential losses in the loan portfolio. As a
result of improved asset quality, the provision recorded by BB&T in 1993 was
$19.0 million, compared with $33.0 million in 1992 and $42.3 million in 1991.
The greater provision recorded in 1991 reflected increased levels of net charge-
offs and nonperforming assets resulting from a persistent economic slowdown and
a deterioration in real estate markets and values during the period 1990-91.
For a more detailed discussion of loan credit qualities, see "RISK MANAGEMENT",
particularly, the section "Nonperforming Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses".

NONINTEREST INCOME

Noninterest income for BB&T primarily consists of service charges on
deposit accounts, trust revenues, mortgage origination and servicing revenues,
insurance commissions, gains and losses on investment securities sales, and
other commissions and fees derived from various banking and bank-related
activities. Noninterest income for 1993 totalled $119.5 million, compared with
$95.5 million in 1992 and $90.9 million in 1991. 

Historically, service charges on deposit accounts have represented the
largest single source of noninterest income. This continued to be the case in
1993, as such revenues totalled $40.8 million, an increase from $33.6 million in
1992 and $30.4 million in 1991. Deposit services are repriced annually to
reflect current costs and competitive factors. The ability to generate
significant additional amounts of noninterest revenues will be increasingly
important in the future. In addition to service charges on deposit accounts,
BB&T will focus on four primary areas for growth--mortgage banking, trust
operations, insurance agency, and investment sales and brokerage activities.
BB&T is making significant investments in each of these areas to assure future
success.

Mortgage banking income (which includes servicing fees and profits from the
origination and sale of loans) increased $6.6 million or 57.1% to a 1993 total
of $18.1 million. Mortgage banking income totalled $11.5 million in 1992 and
$11.1 million in 1991. Home mortgage interest rates declined substantially in
both 1992 and 1993. As a result, there was a heavy volume of prepayments by
homeowners in both of those years and the simultaneous originations of
replacement mortgage loans. BB&T realized gains from the origination and sale
of mortgages totalling approximately $14.8 million in 1993, an increase of $6.1
million or 69.8% over 1992. This followed an increase of $5.7 million in 1992.
The increased gains from mortgage originations and sales were partially offset
by a write-off of approximately $5.0 million in excess servicing receivable in
1993, resulting from accelerated prepayments. BB&T originated approximately
$1.5 billion in home mortgage loans in 1993 and $1.1 billion in 1992. At the
end of 1993 BB&T was servicing mortgage loans with principal balances of
approximately $3.9 billion.

General insurance commissions increased approximately $4.0 million or 60.0%
in 1993 to a total of $10.6 million. Insurance commissions totalled $6.7
million in 1992 and $6.2 million in 1991. BB&T's insurance agencies have become
an increasingly important source of noninterest revenue, and this trend is
expected to accelerate in the future. BB&T has expanded its network of
insurance agencies through acquisitions in recent years, and acquired four
agencies in 1993 and two in 1992.

The offering of trust services has been a traditional service of many
banks. BB&T has had a trust department for over 80 years. Trust revenues from
corporate and personal trust services totalled $11.4 million in 1993. This was
an increase of $1.7 million or 17.7% over the revenues of $9.7 million in 1992,
which in turn was an increase of $1.3 million or 14.9% over the $8.4 million
earned in 1991. Managed assets totalled $2.1 billion 
<PAGE>

at the end of 1993. BB&T is placing an emphasis on its corporate trust 
activities, particularly the management of employee benefit plans. In 1992 the
trust division established its own family of proprietary mutual funds. BB&T 
now manages six mutual funds, which will provide investment alternatives both 
for its trust clients and for other customers of BB&T.

As a state bank, BB&T has been a registered dealer in securities for many
years. Historically, BB&T served a passive role, with activities limited to 
sales of securities of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies and state and
municipal governments to customers. In the mid 1980s BB&T added its first
salesperson devoted exclusively to the sale of securities. Still, its only role
was to provide a service to customers as requested. In 1993 BB&T Investment
Services, Inc. was incorporated as a subsidiary of BB&T-N.C. BB&T began to take
a more active role in selling various securities to its customers, with an
emphasis being placed on the sale of fixed rate debt securities and shares of
BB&T's proprietary mutual funds. At the end of 1993 the broker/dealer
subsidiary had 23 employees. Investment sales commissions totalled $1.7 million
in 1993, compared with only $609,000 in 1992.

Finally, noninterest income included approximately $4.5 million in negative
goodwill amortization in 1993, $4.0 million in 1992 and $1.5 million in 1991.
Negative goodwill (excess of net assets acquired over cost) totalling
approximately $52 million was recorded in the purchase acquisitions of thrift
institutions in the years 1991-93.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Noninterest expense for 1993 increased $47.4 million or 18.7% to a total of
$301.6 million. This followed an increase of 18.2% in 1992. The acquisitions
of six savings associations in 1993, one in 1992 and three in 1991 were
accounted for as purchases, and, accordingly, prior period history was not
restated. The growth in expenses for 1993 and 1992 includes the incremental
cost of operations related to these acquisitions and the cost of standardizing
their operating systems and procedures to those of BB&T.

Salaries and wages increased 17.8% in 1993 and 16.1% in 1992 including
approximately 5% annual merit pay increases in each year and the compensation of
additional employees who joined BB&T with the consummation of the aforementioned
thrift acquisitions. The financial performance of 1993 and 1992 also resulted
in increased amounts of incentive compensation. Other personnel expense
increased 25.8% from $22.0 million in 1992 to $27.7 million in 1993. Other
personnel expense increased 17.1% in 1992. Categories contributing to the
increases in other personnel expense include the cost of providing employee
health insurance, pension plan expense and additional social security taxes
created by higher levels of employee salaries and wages. Also, in 1993 BB&T
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". BB&T
has historically provided hospitalization insurance coverage to its retirees.
BB&T incurred an increase in expense of approximately $1.2 million in adopting
the provisions of Statement No. 106. In order to manage the cost of providing
postretirement benefits, BB&T changed its policy to provide a fixed benefit for
employees who retire subsequent to 1992. For those employees who retired prior
to 1993, BB&T will continue to provide the full hospitalization insurance
benefit.

BB&T has made a major commitment to employee training and education in
recent years. As a result of this emphasis, the total cost of training
increased approximately $658,000 to a total of $2.7 million for 1993, in part
due to training provided employees of acquired savings institutions. This
followed an increase of $545,000 in 1992.

Premiums paid to the FDIC for deposit insurance increased $1.9 million or
13.9% to a total of $15.3 million for 1993. For 1992 the increase was $1.9
million or 16.2%. Growth in insured deposits was the primary reason for the
increases. Deposit insurance premiums were increased dramatically in the years
1989-91, as the FDIC looked to premiums received
<PAGE>

from healthy banks to cover the costs of actual or pending failures of 
unhealthy institutions. The rate increased from an annual rate of $.12 per $100
of deposits in 1990 to $.23 per $100 of deposits for the period beginning July
1, 1991. BB&T has not experienced any additional rate increases since that
date, and does not anticipate increases in its deposit insurance premium rates
for 1994.

Net occupancy expense totalled $22.8 million in 1993. This represented an
increase of $3.2 million or 16.1% over the expense of $19.6 million in 1992,
which in turn was 10.4% greater than the expense of $17.8 million in 1991.
During 1993, BB&T added 65 new offices (including 63 through acquisitions),
closed 11 offices and relocated three. Each of the new offices involved a 
relocation and/or consolidation of existing offices. During 1993 BB&T 
increased the number of locations from 210 to 264.

Furniture and equipment expense totalled $26.6 million in 1993, compared
with $20.6 million in 1992 and $18.0 million in 1991. Much of the increase in
furniture and equipment expense provided improved technological capabilities.
During the year, loan platform automation for the retail lending function was
completed and advances were made in implementing platform automation for the
commercial lending function. A new mainframe was added, 720 personal computers
were added (most of which are terminals to the mainframe), and 50 automated
teller machines were purchased.

Capital expenditures totalled approximately $40 million in 1993. Capital
expenditures for 1994 are planned at $50 million, including $22 million for
furniture and equipment and $28 million for facilities. The plan includes a
continuation of the expansion and replacement of terminals with microcomputers,
and the addition of 33 automated teller machines and replacement of 29 automated
teller machines.

INCOME TAXES

The combined incremental federal and state statutory tax rate for BB&T,
after giving effect to the 1% increase in the federal tax rate to 35% in 1993,
was 40.14%. Because of its investments in tax exempt loans and investment
securities, the effective tax rate for BB&T was 32.6% in 1993, 33.6% in 1992 and
27.9% in 1991. The effective rate was higher in 1992 because of a change in the
tax status of a merged thrift institution prior to acquisition by BB&T and the
resultant recording of a tax liability of approximately $3.8 million due to the
recapture of its statutory bad debt reserve.

BB&T adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement Number 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" in 1993. The adoption of
the provisions of this statement resulted in BB&T changing from the deferral
method of accounting for income taxes to the asset and liability method. The
objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting
basis and the tax basis of pretax income at enacted tax rates expected to be in
effect when such amounts are realized or settled. The change in accounting
method had no material impact on either the financial position or reported
results of operations for BB&T. The increase in the federal tax rate from
34% to 35% also had no material impact on the results of operations of BB&T.

FINANCIAL POSITION

Average assets totalled approximately $8.7 billion in 1993, an increase of
approximately 13.3% over the average of $7.7 billion in 1992. Average assets
grew 13.1% in 1992 and 10.4% in 1991. At the end of 1993 assets totalled
approximately $9.9 billion. Excluding the effects of thrift acquisitions,
average assets have increased at an average rate of approximately 5% over the
past three years.
<PAGE>

Loans totalled approximately $6.7 billion at the end of 1993. This
represented an increase of approximately $1.4 billion in 1993, following
increases of approximately $337 million in 1992 and $858 million in 1991. The
six thrifts acquired in 1993 and accounted for as purchases had approximately
$860 million of loans at the respective dates of acquisition, while the thrift
added in 1992 had approximately $80 million in loans at acquisition. Thus, the
internally generated loan growth was only $503 million in 1993 and $257 million
in 1992. While the economy has expanded at a moderate rate over the past two
years, loan demand has not been as strong as might be expected in a growing
economy. The long-range objective of BB&T is to maintain a rate of internal
growth which approximates that of its markets in the Carolinas. BB&T believes
that this will result in a rate of increase which will be sustainable and
profitable.

Investment securities increased 20.6% to a total of $2.4 billion at the end
of 1993. This followed an increase of 7.7% in 1992. BB&T historically has
maintained an investment portfolio of 21-25% of total assets. At the end of
1993, investment securities represented 24.6% of assets. BB&T expects the
investment portfolio to continue to represent 21-25% of total assets over the
long-term.

Average deposits increased 8.0% in 1993, following an increase of
approximately 9.5% in 1992. Interest-bearing deposits increased approximately
$379 million in 1993, while noninterest-bearing deposits rose approximately $121
million. BB&T has experienced a renewed growth in noninterest-bearing deposits
over the past two years following several years of little or no growth.
Substantially all of the growth in interest-bearing deposits was in lower cost
core deposits. The acquired thrifts accounted for as purchases had
approximately $1.8 billion in deposits (principally interest-checking, savings
and retail certificates of deposits) at the respective dates of acquisitions.
The slower overall growth rate experienced in recent years has been an enabling
factor to improving the funding mix and, thereby, net interest margins and
income.

Shareholders' equity grew 21.9% in 1993 and 13.7% in 1992. Through stock
offerings undertaken to acquire mutual thrift institutions, BB&T generated $27.3
million in equity in 1993, $9.7 million in 1992 and $50.2 million in 1991.
Additionally equity has come from the retention of earnings and from new shares
of stock issued under employee benefit and stock option plans and the dividend
reinvestment plan. Also, BB&T issued common stock with a value of approximately
$22.8 million in consummating the acquisition of a savings bank in 1993 and
added approximately $33.3 million through the conversion of convertible
debentures to common stock. In recent years the return on average equity has
been in the 13-14% range and the dividend payout ratio has been 31-33%. The 
dividend payout ratio was 33.6%, 32.3% and 33.5% in 1993, 1992 and 1991, 
respectively. Thus, the retention of earnings has resulted in an annual
contribution of approximately 9-10% to the growth in equity.

BB&T has traditionally been considered to be strongly capitalized. The
ratio of shareholders' equity to year-end assets was 8.08% at the end of 1993,
compared with 8.25% a year earlier. While management views the equity-to-assets
ratio as the principal indicator of capital strength, additional measures are
used by regulators. Bank holding companies, and their subsidiaries, are subject
to risk-based capital measures. The risk-based capital ratios measure the
relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet
credit risk. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are
adjusted to reflect credit risk.

Tier 1 capital is required to be at least 4% of risk-weighted assets, and
the total capital must be at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. The 
<PAGE>

Tier 1 capital ratio for BB&T at the end of 1993 was 11.94%, and the total 
capital ratio was 13.73%. At the end of 1992, those ratios were 12.43% and 
15.37%, respectively. BB&T leveraged its equity and capital in 1993 through the
acquisition of Old Stone Bank of North Carolina in a cash transaction. BB&T
added approximately $537 million in assets through the acquisition of Old Stone,
which was acquired for a cash price of $58.25 million.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The business of banking is basically one of managing risks. In managing 
the portfolios of assets and liabilities, the primary objective is to manage the
inherent credit risk and interest rate risk, in a context which also provides
ongoing profitability and meets customer needs. Prudent balance sheet
management also requires the maintenance of liquidity and a strong capital
position.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

A key component of balance sheet management is the management of credit 
risk. In recent years, this represented a particular risk for lenders, 
requiring a most concerted effort to minimize loss exposure. Credit risk is 
inherent in the portfolios of both investment securities and loans. However, 
the majority of credit risk at BB&T is in the loan portfolio.

The Loan Policy Committee, which establishes loan policy and reviews and
approves larger credits, provides overall direction to the administration of
BB&T's loan portfolios. The Loan Administration Division is responsible for the
ongoing loan operations and oversees larger credits and problem credits.

The loan review process is intended to ensure that sound and consistent 
credit decisions are made. The loan function is administered by personnel who 
have depth of experience and are provided with continuous training. Over the 
years the methods for analyzing business financial performance and the ability 
to repay loans has been refined. A detailed financial analysis is prepared 
prior to the funding of larger business credits and the analyses are updated on
a regular basis.

A key element in minimizing the risk of loss in a business loan portfolio 
is the diversification of such risk. While the legal lending limit of the North
Carolina chartered bank is in excess of $100 million, BB&T operates with in-
house limits of $37.5 million or less. Additional lower limits are established
based on risk grades, the business or industry of the borrower, type of
collateral (non-real estate versus real estate) and other considerations,
including the ability of the borrower to meet obligations with funds generated
from normal operations. Currently, no borrower has loans and/or commitments
equal to the in-house limit. Although the ability of the borrower to repay is
the critical element in any lending decision, substantially all loans at BB&T,
other than those of the very highest quality, are, in BB&T's view, well
collateralized. Independent appraisals are required for properties securing
loans in excess of $100,000.

A vast majority of loans made by BB&T-N.C. and BB&T-S.C. are to businesses
with operations headquartered in the two Carolinas; however, a limited number of
loans have been made to businesses which are domiciled in other states but have
operations in North and/or South Carolina. BB&T has not provided credit for
highly leveraged transactions, the energy sector or loans to lesser developed
countries, has not been a purchaser of loan participations and does not have
a high concentration of loans in any industry.

NONPERFORMING LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when collection of interest and
principal is doubtful. There are three negative implications for earnings 
<PAGE>

when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status. All interest accrued but unpaid at
the date the loan goes on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest 
income or written off as a loss. Secondly, future accruals of interest are not
made until it becomes certain that both loan principal and interest can be paid.
Finally, there may be actual losses which necessitate additional provisions for
loan losses charged against earnings.

BB&T experienced increases in both nonperforming assets and actual losses 
in 1991 and 1990. Accordingly, the provisions and allowances for loan losses 
were increased in those years. BB&T intensified its loan review processes in 
order to minimize credit problems in that difficult environment, and there were
considerable improvements in both nonperforming assets and actual losses in 1993
and 1992.

For BB&T, nonperforming loans totalled $33.8 million on December 31, 1993,
compared with $30.7 million at the end of 1992 and $60.7 million at the end of
1991. Nonperforming loans equaled .50% of loans at the end of 1993, down from
.58% a year earlier and 1.22% at the end of 1991. Net charge-offs were .24% of
average loans outstanding in 1993, compared with .45% in 1992 and .63% in 1991.
For the same three years, the provisions charged against earnings as a percent
of average loans outstanding were .32%, .64% and .93%, respectively. In 1993
and 1992, both the amount of actual charge-offs and the provision for loan
losses declined significantly from 1991 levels, which were the highest in the
history of BB&T.

BB&T maintains a watch list for credits with balances of $250,000 or 
greater and which are categorized in the highest risk grades. The amount of 
loans on the watch list totalled $94.9 million, 1.42% of loans outstanding at 
December 31, 1993, and $165.7 million, 3.11% of loans outstanding, a year 
earlier. The $94.9 million includes $20.7 million in nonaccruing status and 
$74.2 million which are currently performing, but in the opinion of management,
represent other potential problem loans.

As a result of increased provisions for loan losses in recent years, the
allowance for loan losses increased to $93.3 million or 1.40% of loans
outstanding at the end of 1993. At the end of 1992 the allowance for loan
losses was $77.9 million or 1.46% of outstanding loans. The allowance for loan
losses was 2.76 times nonperforming loans at the end of 1993, up from 2.53 times
nonperforming loans as of December 31, 1992, 1.11 times nonperforming loans as
of December 31, 1991 and 1.15 times at the end of 1990. The allowance plus
equity was 18.62 times nonperforming assets at the end of 1993, compared with
13.65 a year earlier.

Management continually reviews the loan portfolio for signs of 
deterioration. In making their evaluation of the portfolio, factors considered
include the individual strength of borrowers, the strength of the individual
industries, the value and marketability of collateral, specific market strengths
and weaknesses, and general economic conditions. Management believes that the
allowance for loan losses at December 31, 1993 is adequate to cover potential
loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

The primary assets of banks are portfolios of investment securities and 
loans, while liabilities are primarily composed of interest-bearing deposits and
borrowed funds. Assets and liabilities have varying maturities from one day to
several years and the associated interest rates may be fixed or variable. The
objective in managing maturities and rates is to optimize net interest income to
the extent possible, while minimizing the risk associated with significant,
often unforeseen shifts in interest rates.

Sensitivity to interest rate changes is one of the manageable risks assumed
by banks. When assets and liabilities reprice at different intervals, earnings
become sensitive to changes in market interest rates. BB&T uses hedging
instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity and net interest income. These
instruments, commonly referred to as derivatives, primarily consist of interest
rate swaps, collars, floors and cellings. BB&T does not trade or speculate in
derivatives, but uses them only as part of its asset/liability management
strategy. 

Derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional
amounts. Notional amounts do not represent amounts to be exchanged between
parties and are not a measure of financial risk, but only provide the basis for
calculating interest payments between the counterparties. On December 31, 1993,
BB&T had outstanding derivative contracts with notional amounts totalling
approximately $2 billion.

The derivatives used at BB&T provide for the exchange of interest payments
between counterparties--either variable for fixed or fixed for variable. Thus,
the credit risk arises when amounts receivable from a counterparty exceed those
payable. The risk of loss with any counterparty is limited to a small fraction
of the notional amount. BB&T deals only with national market makers with strong
credit ratings in its derivative activities. BB&T further controls the risk of
loss by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to
those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. This risk management
strategy contributed $17.6 million to pre-tax earnings in 1993 and $18.2 million
in 1992.

<PAGE>

LIQUIDITY

For BB&T the principal source of asset liquidity is marketable investment
securities, particularly those maturing within one year. The objective in the
management of the investment securities portfolio is to maximize yields within a
framework which emphasizes shorter maturities and a managed assets/liabilities
interest rate sensitivity position. Such a strategy minimizes the possibility
of earnings losses associated with sharp swings in market rates of interest.

Through a strategy of securitizing internally originated residential 
mortgage loans, the average maturity in the investment portfolio was lengthened
in 1989-1991. The securitized mortgages were sold in the latter part of 1991 
and early 1992 in anticipation of large scale refinancing, which, in fact, did 
occur in 1992-93. The average maturities of the portfolios at the end of both 
1993 and 1992 were approximately one and one-half years. At the end of 1993,
approximately 33% of the portfolio matured within one year and approximately 90%
matured within a five-year period.

The portfolio includes investments in obligations of the U.S. Treasury, and
Government agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities and higher grade
municipal securities. In addition to the liquidity provided by normal
maturities, liquidity is also provided by the marketability of securities
available for sale, which had a market value of approximately $738 million at
the end of 1993.

Asset liquidity is also provided by scheduling maturities within the loan
portfolio, although the probability of conversion is not so certain as with
investment securities. At the end of 1993 approximately 69% or $4.4 billion of
loans would mature or reprice within a one-year period.

Liquidity is provided by sizable core deposits and other sources of funds
generated from the normal customer base. Liquidity is also provided by the
capacity to borrow additional funds when the need arises. BB&T has a strong
credit rating. In 1993 BB&T-NC had federal funds lines with many major banks
totalling approximately $1 billion and BB&T issues commercial paper under a
master agreement backed by bank lines of credit in the amount of $55 million.

The retention of earnings also is a major source of liquidity. For the 
years 1993-91, funds provided from operations were $132.6 million, $120.9 
million and $99.2 million, respectively.

OTHER ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY MATTERS

The FASB has issued Statement No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits", which requires accrual of a liability for all types of
benefits paid to former or inactive employees after employment but before
retirement. The periodic effect on net income, if any, will not be material for
BB&T. Adoption of the Statement is required for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1993.

The FASB has issued Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities", that requires a change in the method of 
accounting and reporting for debt and equity securities. Securities that are 
held to maturity would be classified as such and reported at amortized cost. 
Securities for current resale would be classified as trading securities and 
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in current
earnings. Securities that are to be held for indefinite periods would be
classified as securities available for sale and reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses excluded from current earnings and reported as a
separate component of shareholders' equity. It is to be adopted for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1993. Adoption of the provisions of this Statement
by BB&T in 1994 will 
<PAGE>

have no material impact on the financial position or results of operation of 
BB&T.

The FASB also has issued Statement No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan", which proposes that creditors value all loans for which
it is probable that the creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due
according to the terms of the loan agreement based on the discounted expected
future cash flows. This discounting would be at the loan's effective interest
rate. This Statement would apply for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1994. Adoption of the provisions of this Statement is not expected to have a
material impact on either the financial position or results of operations of
BB&T.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On July 29, 1994, BB&T and Southern National Corporation (SNC) of 
Winston-Salem, North Carolina agreed to merge the two companies. The merger 
will be effected through the issuance of 1.45 shares of common stock of the 
surviving corporation for each outstanding share of BB&T common stock and 1.00 
shares of common stock of the surviving corporation for each outstanding share 
of SNC common stock. The merger will be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
At the end of June, SNC had total assets of approximately $8.2 billion and total
shareholders' equity of approximately $594 million.

The combined corporation will be named Southern National Corporation, while
the combined subsidiary banks will be named Branch Banking and Trust Company and
operate using the BB&T logo. The new corporation would become the 35th largest
bank holding company in the United States and the sixth largest bank holding
company in the Southeastern United States. Based on the FDIC Deposit Survey of
June 30, 1993, (the latest date for which information is available), the
combined bank would have the largest deposit share in North Carolina and the
third largest deposit share in South Carolina.

On June 24, 1994, BB&T announced plans to acquire Commerce Bank of 
Virginia Beach, Virgina a $692 million commercial bank. BB&T will effect 
that merger by issuing approximately 4,000,000 shares of its common stock 
for all of the outstanding shares of Commerce. The transaction will be accounted
for as a pooling-of-interests. Upon consummation, Commerce will become BB&T's 
first banking subsidiary in Virginia.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
BB&T Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries
At or for the years ended December 1993, 1992 and 1991
($ in thousands, except per share)

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of BB&T Financial Corporation ("BB&T") and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Branch Banking and Trust Company ("BB&T-N.C."); BB&T Financial
Corporation of South Carolina and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Branch Banking
and Trust Company of South Carolina ("BB&T-S.C."); L.S.B. Bancshares, Inc. of
South Carolina ("L.S.B.") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, The Lexington State
Bank and The Community Bank of South Carolina; and four savings institutions. 
L.S.B. and its subsidiaries were acquired on June 30, 1994 and their results are
included for all periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Prior years consolidated financial statements have been restated to include
the accounts of companies acquired and accounted for as poolings-of-interests.
Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with statement
presentations for 1993. These reclassifications had no impact on either the
financial position or results of operations previously reported.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS: For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and 
cash equivalents include cash on hand, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing
amounts due from banks, and federal funds sold.

SECURITIES: Debt securities acquired with both the intent and ability to 
hold to maturity are classified as investment securities. Investment 
securities are carried at cost less amortization of premiums plus accretion of
discounts. Securities, which may be used to meet liquidity needs arising from
unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations, changes in regulatory capital and
investment requirements, or unforeseen changes in market conditions, including
interest rates, market values or inflation rates, are classified as available
for sale. Securities available for sale are carried at the lower of cost or
market. The cost of securities sold is determined by the identified certificate
method.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE: Residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried
at the lower of cost or market.

BANK PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT: Bank premises, equipment and leasehold
improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization are computed using primarily the straight-line
method. Buildings and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful
lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the terms of
the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

FORECLOSED PROPERTY: Foreclosed property consists of real estate and other
assets acquired through customers' loan defaults. Foreclosed property is
carried at the lower of fair value, less the estimated cost to sell, or cost.
Routine maintenance costs, declines in market value and net losses on disposal
are included in other operating expense.

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES: The annual provision for loan losses charged
against earnings is based on management's continuing review and evaluation of a
number of factors, including overall portfolio quality and size, loan loss
experience, potential losses on known problem loans, as well as prevailing and
anticipated economic conditions. While management uses the best information
available in establishing the allowance for losses, future adjustments to the
allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the
assumptions used in making the evaluations or if required by regulators.
<PAGE>

PAGE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS-OFF-BALANCE SHEET: BB&T enters into interest rate 
swap, floor and cap agreements to manage the overall interest rate risk 
exposure of identified assets and liabilities. Income or expense associated 
with interest rate swap, floor or cap agreements is recognized as a component of
net interest income based upon anticipated settlement payments.

INCOME TAXES: Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, 
"Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109") was effective for years beginning
after December 15, 1992. BB&T adopted SFAS 109 as of January 1, 1993 with no
impact on the financial statements. Under the asset and liability method of 
SFAS 109, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. Prior to 1993, BB&T used the deferral method of
accounting for income taxes.

INCOME AND EXPENSE: BB&T and its subsidiaries utilize the accrual method 
of accounting. Fees and costs associated with originating loans are deferred 
and recognized as an adjustment of yield over the lives of the loans. Loans 
generally earn interest on the level yield method based on the daily 
outstanding balance. The accrual of interest is discontinued when, in the
opinion of management, the collection of all or a portion of interest becomes
doubtful.

INCOME PER SHARE: Primary net income per common share is based upon the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and common stock
equivalents of dilutive stock options. Fully diluted net income per common
share reflects the maximum dilutive effect of common stock issuable upon
conversion of convertible debt and exercise of stock options.

EXCESS OF COST OVER NET ASSETS ACQUIRED AND EXCESS OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED 
OVER COST: The excess of cost over net assets acquired (goodwill) and the 
excess of net assets acquired over cost (negative goodwill) of purchased 
companies is amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated periods to
be benefited, normally ten years.

NOTE 2. MERGERS

During the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, BB&T was a party 
to several business combinations.

On February 24, 1993, BB&T completed the acquisition of First Fincorp, Inc.
(Fincorp), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Financial Savings Bank, Inc.
of Kinston, North Carolina. The merger was consummated through the issuance of
673,148 shares of BB&T common stock for all of the outstanding common stock of
Fincorp for a total purchase price of $22,300, which was approximately the same
as the fair value of the net assets acquired. The merger was accounted for as a
purchase, and, accordingly, the results of Fincorp are included in the
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. At the date of
acquisition, Fincorp had assets of approximately $322,000.

On February 25, 1993, BB&T completed the acquisition of Security Financial
Holding Company, (Security), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Security Federal
Savings Bank of Durham, North Carolina. The merger was consummated through the
issuance of 1,408,178 shares of BB&T common stock for all of the outstanding
common stock of Security. The merger was accounted for as a pooling-of-
interests, and, accordingly, the consolidated financial statements include the
results of Security for all periods presented. At the date of acquisition,
Security had assets of approximately $316,000.

On May 18, 1993, BB&T completed the acquisitions of Carolina Savings Bank
(Carolina) of Wilmington, North Carolina and Edenton Savings and Loan
Association (Edenton) of Edenton, North Carolina. The transactions involved
simultaneous conversions from mutual to stock associations and acquisition by
BB&T. BB&T sold 507,182 shares of its common stock to eligible members of the
institutions, natural persons in the communities in which they operated and the
public. The net proceeds of approximately $15,300 were used to purchase all of
the stock of Carolina and Edenton. Negative goodwill of approximately $5,700
resulted from the transactions. The mergers were accounted for as purchases,
and, accordingly, the results of Carolina and Edenton are included in the
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisitions. At the date
of acquisition, Carolina and Edenton had assets of approximately $142,000 and
$40,000, respectively.

On October 25, 1993, BB&T completed the acquisition of Citizens Savings 
Bank, SSB, Inc., (Citizens of Newton) of Newton, North Carolina. The merger was
consummated through the issuance of 1,168,311 shares of BB&T common stock for
all of the outstanding common stock of Citizens of Newton. The merger was
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests, and, accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements include the results of Citizens of Newton for all periods
presented. At the date of acquisition, Citizens of Newton had assets of
approximately $263,000.

On October 29, 1993, BB&T completed the acquisition of Mutual Savings Bank
of Rockingham County, SSB (Mutual) of Reidsville, North Carolina. The 
transaction involved simultaneous conversion from a mutual to a stock 
association and acquisition by BB&T. BB&T sold 216,539 shares of its common 
stock to eligible members of the institution and natural persons in the 
community in which they operated. The net proceeds of approximately $6,200 were
used to purchase all of the stock of Mutual. Negative goodwill of approximately
$2,900 resulted from the transaction. The merger was accounted for as a
purchase, and, accordingly, the results of Mutual are included in the
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. At the date of
acquisition, Mutual had assets of approximately $87,000.

On November 24, 1993, BB&T completed the acquisition of Old Stone Bank of
North Carolina (Old Stone) of High Point, North Carolina. The merger

was consummated for a cash payment of $58,250 for all of the outstanding common
stock of Old Stone. Goodwill of approximately $27,700 resulted from the 
transaction. The merger was accounted for as a purchase, and, accordingly, the
results of Old Stone are included in the consolidated financial statements 
since the date of acquisition. At the date of acquisition, Old Stone had assets
of approximately $537,000.

On December 23, 1993, BB&T completed the acquisition of Citizens Savings 
Bank, SSB (Citizens Savings) of Mooresville, North Carolina. The transaction 
involved a simultaneous conversion from a mutual to a stock association and 
acquisition by BB&T. BB&T sold 216,471 shares of its common stock to eligible 
members of the institution and natural persons in the community in which they 
operated. The net proceeds of approximately $5,800 were used to purchase all 
of the stock of Citizens Savings. Negative goodwill of approximately $1,900 
resulted from the transaction. The merger was accounted for as a purchase, 
and, accordingly, the results of Citizens Savings are included in the 
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. At the date 
of acquisition, Citizens Savings had assets of approximately $63,000.

During 1992, BB&T acquired one savings institution through the issuance of
382,395 shares of its common stock. Assets of approximately $107,000 were
acquired and the merger was accounted for as a purchase. Negative goodwill of
approximately $6,600 resulted from the transaction. During 1991, BB&T acquired
three savings institutions through the issuance of 3,343,800 shares of its
common stock and cash payment of $13,800. Assets acquired in such acquisitions
totalled approximately $798,000 and all were accounted for as purchases.
Negative goodwill of approximately $33,400 resulted from these acquisitions.
The results of the companies acquired in 1992 and 1991 are included in the
consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of acquisition.

During 1993, 1992 and 1991, BB&T acquired several small insurance agencies.
BB&T issued 156,196 shares in 1993 to acquire four agencies, 34,297 shares in
1992 to acquire two agencies and 19,121 shares in 1991 to acquire one agency.
All of the acquisitions were accounted for as poolings-of-interests. In the
aggregate they were not material, and, accordingly, prior period financial
statements have not been restated.

On June 30, 1994, BB&T completed the acquisition of L.S.B. Bancshares, 
Inc., ("L.S.B.") of Lexington, South Carolina and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
the Lexington State Bank and the Community Bank of South Carolina. The merger 
was consummated through the issuance of 3,936,341 shares of BB&T common stock 
for all of the common stock of L.S.B. The merger was accounted for as a 
pooling-of-interests, and, accordingly, the consolidated financial statements 
include the results of L.S.B. for all periods presented. At the date of 
acquisition, L.S.B. had assets of approximately $707,000.

The following presents the contributions of BB&T, and the pooled entities 
Security, Citizens of Newton, and L.S.B. to the restated and reported results 
of BB&T and certain pro forma financial data pertaining to BB&T and the
acquisition of the institution purchased in 1992 as if it had been acquired at
the beginning of each of the years 1992 and 1991, and the acquisitions of the
six savings institutions purchased in 1993 as if each had been acquired at the
beginning of each of the years 1993 and 1992. The unaudited pro forma summary
does not necessarily reflect the results of operations as they would have been
if the acquisitions had been consummated at the beginning of the periods
presented.

NOTE 3. PENDING ACQUISITIONS

At December 31, 1993, BB&T had pending agreements to acquire Home Savings 
Bank of Albemarle, SSB, ("Home"), Albemarle, North Carolina with assets of
approximately $157,000 and Asheville Savings Bank, SSB ("Asheville), Asheville,
North Carolina with assets of approximately $321,000. Home and Asheville are
both mutual savings banks, and their acquisitions require their conversions from
mutual to stock corporations with simultaneous acquisition by BB&T. BB&T will
sell shares of its $2.50 par value common stock in offerings in order to effect
the acquisitions. The total estimated value of Home and Asheville and the
market value of the stock to be offered by BB&T are both approximately $54,000.
It is anticipated that the acquisitions of Home and Asheville will be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.

On June 20, 1994, BB&T announced the mutual agreements to terminate merger
plans between BB&T and Home and Asheville.

========================
</TABLE> 

Loans classified as real estate--mortgage include loans secured by 
residential properties of $3,173,658 in 1993 and $2,197,582 in 1992, including 
$353,122 and $238,912 held for sale in 1993 and 1992, respectively. The market
values of the loans held for sale were $353,122 and $239,284 at December 31, 
1993 and 1992, respectively.

Interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual and 
restructured loans for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 had 
they performed in accordance with the original terms throughout each of the 
periods amounted to approximately $1,860, $2,305 and $5,834, respectively. 
Interest income on such loans included in the results of operations for each of
the years amounted to approximately $731, $847 and $1,770, respectively.

The Banks make loans to executive officers and directors of BB&T and the 
Banks and to their associates. Such loans are made on substantially the same 
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time
for comparable transactions with unrelated persons and do not involve more than
normal risk of collectibility. The aggregate dollar amount of these loans was
$87,165 and $70,718 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. During 1993,
$39,578 of new loans were made and repayments totalled $23,131.

date was May 17, 1993 and the debentures were converted into 1,916,084 shares 
of common stock.

The interest rate on the floating rate subordinated notes is adjusted 
quarterly to 1/4% above the London interbank offered quotations. At 
December 31, 1993, the interest rate was 5.25%. The notes are redeemable, at
par plus accrued interest, at the option of BB&T, in whole or in part.

allow it to issue $500,000 of medium-term notes as needed to meet ongoing
funding and operational needs. At December 31, 1993, BB&T had outstanding
$231,868 of the notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.76% and

NOTE 10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Banks sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all of their employees. The benefits are based on years of
service, age at retirement and the employee's compensation during the last five
years of employment. Contributions to the plan are based upon the Frozen
Initial Liability actuarial funding method and comply with the funding
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

The following table sets forth the funded status of the pension plan and
amounts recognized in BB&T's consolidated financial statements at
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991:

</TABLE>

Plan assets included 100,000 shares of BB&T's common stock at December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991. The weighted-average discount rate and rate of increase in
future compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of
the projected benefit obligation were 7% and 5.5%, respectively for 1993 and 8%
and 6%, respectively for 1992 and 1991. The expected long-term rate of return
on pension plan assets was 9% for each of the years reported.

Effective January 1, 1993, BB&T adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions" ("SFAS 106"), which requires the accrual of nonpension benefits over
the employees' active service period, defined as the date of employment up to
the date of the employees' eligibility for such benefits. Prior to 1993, BB&T
provided health care benefits to retirees and expensed those costs as incurred.
Retiree health care costs totalling approximately $430 were paid during 1992.
Effective January 1, 1993, BB&T revised the retiree health care plan to provide
a flexible benefit amount which retirees can use to purchase health care and
life insurance benefits. BB&T has elected to amortize the accumulated
postretirement benefit
<PAGE>

PAGE

obligation of approximately $11,744 over a period of 21 years as a component of
the postretirement benefit cost. The weighted-average discount rate used in
determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was
7%. The assumed initial rate of increase in medical costs was 15%, declining to
6%, with a general inflation rate of 4%. A 1% increase in assumed health cost
would have no effect on the service and interest cost, but would increase the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 3%. Prior to its affiliation
with BB&T, L.S.B. did not provide postretirement benefits other than pension
benefits to its employees. It is anticipated that the cost of providing health
care and life insurance benefits to employees of L.S.B. will have no material
effects on either the financial position or future results of operations of
BB&T.

The following table sets forth the components of the retiree benefit plan 
and the amount recognized in BB&T's consolidated financial statements at 
December 31, 1993.

NOTE 11. INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, BB&T adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). BB&T applied the
provisions of SFAS 109 prospectively and did not restate previously reported
results of operations. For years prior to 1993, BB&T used the deferral method
of accounting for income taxes. The cumulative effect of the change in the
method of accounting for income taxes was immaterial to both the financial
position and results of operations for BB&T.

The components of income tax expense (benefit), were as follows:

NOTE 12. COMMON STOCK

Pursuant to provisions of the Long Term Incentive Plan, options to 
purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of BB&T's common stock may be granted to key 
personnel. The current plan is a successor to the plans of 1983 and 1988. As 
of December 31, 1993, 483,791 shares have been issued for options granted and 
exercised under the plans. In August 1991, BB&T adopted the Special Purpose 
Option and Restricted Stock Plan. Pursuant to the provisions of the plan, up 
to 1,000,000 shares of BB&T's common stock may be granted to selected employees
and directors of thrifts acquired through purchase conversions. As of December
31, 1993, 38,518 shares have been issued for options granted and exercised 
under this Plan. Under all option plans, the option price is the fair market 
value of the stock at the date of grant. Options normally vest over a 
five-year period, beginning one year from the date granted. All options 
expire not more than 10 years from the date of the grant, if not previously 
exercised.

Activity in the stock option plans for the past three years was as follows:

The Special Purpose Option and Restricted Stock Plan also provides for 
shares of BB&T's common stock to be awarded to selected employees and directors
of thrifts acquired through purchase conversions. The awarded shares are 
subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions of the Plan, which prohibit 
the sale or assignment of the shares during the restricted period. In the 
event, the Grantee's employment with BB&T terminates, other than by death,
disability or retirement, prior to the lapse of the restriction period, such
awarded shares shall be forfeited by the Grantee. During 1991 through 1993,
173,938 shares of BB&T's common stock were awarded to employees of acquired
companies.

BB&T also has a Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan. Pursuant to the
provisions of the Plan, Directors of BB&T Financial Corporation may elect to
receive stock options in lieu of cash for annual retainers. Options to purchase
up to 250,000 shares of BB&T's common stock may be granted under this Plan. Six
months after each election date, options are granted at an exercise price of 75%
of the fair market value of a share on
<PAGE>

the date of grant. An option may be exercised six months from the date of
grant. Each option share expires ten years from its date of grant. At December
31, 1993, options have been granted for 32,211 shares under this Plan and
217,789 shares were reserved for future use.

BB&T has reserved shares of its common stock for issuance under the 
Dividend Reinvestment and Shareholder Savings Service. As of December 31, 
1993, 11,836 shares of BB&T's common stock were reserved and unissued under the
Plan. During the years 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, 263,090, 250,866 and
238,885 shares were issued through the dividend reinvestment program.

BB&T has reserved shares of its common stock to be issued under the Savings
and Thrift Plan. During the years 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, 375,583,
303,088 and 232,306 shares were issued under this Plan. As of December 31,
1993, 183,760 shares of BB&T's common stock were reserved and unissued for use
under the Savings and Thrift Plan.

In August, 1991, BB&T established an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).
The ESOP borrowed $3,041 in 1991, $664 in 1992 and $2,314 in 1993 from BB&T to
purchase 150,613, 26,000 and 79,285 shares, respectively of BB&T common stock
for the benefit of employees of acquired thrifts. The loans were guaranteed by
BB&T-N.C. Eligible employees of the thrifts acquired through purchase
conversions, are allocated shares based upon years of service and level of
compensation. Shares vest equally over a period of five years. Participants have
full voting rights and dividends on shares held in the ESOP are paid directly to
participants.

NOTE 13. REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS

Subject to restrictions imposed by state laws and federal regulations, the
Boards of Directors of the subsidiary Banks and savings Banks may declare
dividends from their retained earnings up to $422,057 at December 31, 1993. 
The subsidiaries are prohibited by law from paying dividends from their capital
stock and paid-in capital accounts which totalled $449,324 at December 31, 
1993, and are required by regulatory authorities to maintain minimum capital 
levels.

The subsidiary Banks and savings Banks are required to maintain reserve
balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. The amounts of these reserve balances
at December 31, 1993 were $106,090.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Banks have entered into leases for bank premises and equipment which 
are accounted for as operating leases. Leases for equipment generally have 1 
to 5 year terms. Leases for real property vary in terms from 3 to 25 years with
additional options for renewal of the leases generally from 5 to 20 years. Real
estate taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses are obligations of the Banks.
The Banks expect to renew leases or replace leases as they expire with leases on
other property.

In the normal course of business, commitments are outstanding that are not
reflected in the financial statements. A summary of these commitments at 
December 31, 1993 and 1992 follows:

<TABLE>

Interest rate contracts:
Forward commitments to sell loans 185,000 --
Swaps 1,410,000 1,025,000
</TABLE>

BB&T's exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of
the commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial 
letters of credit. The notional amounts of interest rate swap and option 
agreements express only the extent of involvement of BB&T and, amounts subject 
to risk (cash flows from gains at settlement) are significantly smaller than the
notional or contractual values.

BB&T makes contractual commitments to extend credit so long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the
commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total
commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. In making
the commitments, BB&T applies the same credit standards used in the lending
process, and periodically reassesses the customers' creditworthiness through
ongoing credit reviews. The majority of the outstanding lines of credit have
stated interest rates that are directly related to the prime rate of interest.

BB&T provides standby letters of credit and guarantees, which are issued on
behalf of customers in connection with contracts between the customers and third
parties. The majority of the standby letters of credit consist of performance
assurances made on behalf of customers who have a contractual commitment to
produce or deliver goods or services. The business ventures for which these
credits are employed vary widely and frequently require long periods of time for
completion. BB&T applies the same credit standards used in the lending process,
and, once issued, the commitment is irrevocable and remains valid until its
expiration. Credit risk arises from the obligation of BB&T to make payment in
the event of the customers' contractual default.

BB&T issues commercial letters of credit to facilitate foreign and domestic
trade transactions. The instruments are short-term commitments to pay a third
party beneficiary under certain contractual conditions for the
<PAGE>

PAGE

shipment of goods. The contracts are subject to the same credit standards used
in the lending process and are generally collateralized by the merchandise being
shipped.

BB&T extends credit to customers through its subsidiary Banks in North and
South Carolina. A vast majority of loans are to businesses with operations
headquartered in the two Carolinas, although a limited number of loans have been
made to businesses which are domiciled in other states but have operations in
the Carolinas. The loan portfolios are well diversified within industry
segments and secured loans are well collateralized.

BB&T utilizes interest rate contracts, primarily swaps and collars, in the
management of the interest rate sensitivity of BB&T's net interest income.
Interest rate contracts generally have terms of one year or longer. The risks
associated with such contracts are exposure to movements in interest rates and
the ability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts. Credit risk
exposure is managed through BB&T's standard credit approval and review process.

Various legal proceedings against BB&T and its subsidiaries have arisen 
from time to time in the normal course of business. Management believes 
liabilities arising from these proceedings, if any, will have no material 
adverse effect on the financial position of BB&T or its subsidiaries.

16. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Statement Number 107 of the Financial Accounting Standard Board requires 
all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets 
and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the statement of financial
position, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. The fair value
estimates are made at a discreet point and time based on relevant market
information and information about the financial instruments. Because no market
exists for a significant portion of BB&T's financial instruments, fair value
estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience,
current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial
instruments, and such other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature
and involve uncertainties in matters of significant judgment and therefore
cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly
affect the estimates.

The estimated fair values of BB&T's financial instruments follow, together
with descriptions of methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instrument for which it is practical to estimate such
value.

The carrying amount of cash and short-term investments is a reasonable
estimate of fair value. The fair values of such instruments at December 31, 
1993, and 1992 were $470,532 and $399,752, respectively.

For investment securities and securities available for sale, fair values 
are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. At December 31, 1993 and 
1992 the fair values of investment securities were $1,722,284 and $1,583,899,
respectively, and the fair values of investments available for sale were
$737,611 and $464,482, respectively.

For floating rate loans, credit card receivables, home equity lines and 
other consumer lines of credit, the carrying amount less an estimate of credit 
losses inherent in the portfolio is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The 
fair value of other types of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash 
flows using the current rates at which similar loans of similar maturities 
would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings, reduced by an estimate 
of credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Fair value does not include the 
value of customer relationships or unused consumer lines of credits. The 
estimated fair values of loans at December 31, 1993 and 1992 were $6,764,562 
and $5,309,663, respectively.

For demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits
payable on demand the carrying amounts are the fair values. The fair values of
fixed-maturity certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts are
estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining
maturities. For variable rate individual retirement accounts, the carrying
amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair values of deposit
liabilities at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are estimated to be $7,590,584 and
$6,424,496, respectively.

The carrying amount of short-term borrowed funds, including federal funds
purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and master notes, is a
reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair values of short-term borrowed funds
at December 31, 1993 and 1992 were $1,046,789 and $642,811, respectively.

Long-term debt included convertible subordinated debentures, floating rate
subordinated notes, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and medium-term
bank notes. The convertible subordinated debentures were callable at 102.65 at
December 31, 1992, which was considered a reasonable estimate of fair value.
The convertible subordinated debentures were redeemed in 1993. The floating
rate subordinated notes reprice quarterly and the carrying amount is a
reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair
<PAGE>

PAGE

values of the advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank are based on the
discounted value of contractual cash flows, using the rates currently offered
for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. The fair values of the medium-
term bank notes are based on the market price of the notes on December 31, 1993.
The fair values of long-term debt at December 31, 1993 and 1992 were $353,472
and $124,902, respectively.

The fair value of interest rate contracts (used for hedging purposes) is 
the estimated amount that BB&T would receive or pay to terminate the contract
agreements at the reported date, taking into account current interest rates and
the current credit-worthiness of the contract counterparties. The fair values
of interest rate contract agreements at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are estimated
to be $16,383 and $20,263, respectively.

The fair value of letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for
similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise
settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date. The fair
values of letters of credit at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are estimated to be
$1,919 and $1,710, respectively.

NOTE 17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (Unaudited)

At June 24, 1994, BB&T entered into an agreement to merge with Commerce
Bank of Virginia Beach, Virginia. The merger of Commerce will be accounted for
as a pooling-of-interests and approximately 4,000,000 shares of BB&T common
stock will be issued for all of the outstanding stock of Commerce. At the end of
June, Commerce had total assets of approximately $692 million and shareholders'
equity of approximately $47 million.

On July 29, 1994, BB&T and Southern National Corporation (SNC) of Winston-
Salem, North Carolina entered a definitive agreement of merger providing for the
merger of the two companies. The merger will be accounted for as a pooling-of-
interests. To effect the merger, BB&T shareholders will receive 1.45 shares of
common stock of the surviving company for each outstanding share of BB&T common
stock and SNC shareholders will receive 1.00 shares for each outstanding share
of SNC common stock. At June 30, SNC had total assets of approximately $8.2
billion and total shareholders' equity of approximately $594 million.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS
BB&T FINANCIAL CORPORATION

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BB&T 
Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and 
the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash 
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993. 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. The consolidated financial statements
have been restated to give retroactive effect to the merger of BB&T Financial 
Corporation and L.S.B. Bancshares, Inc. ("LSB") on June 30, 1994, which has been
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests as described in Note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements. We did not audit the financial statements of 
LSB for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, which statements
reflect total assets constituting 7.1 percent and 8.2 percent as of December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively, and total interest income constituting 7.7 percent,
8.1 percent, and 8.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively, of the related consolidated totals. Those statements were
audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our
opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for LSB is based solely
on the report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors,
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of BB&T Financial Corporation and
subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of L.S.B. Bancshares, Inc. of
South Carolina and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of L.S.B. Bancshares, Inc. of
South Carolina and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed, effective December 31, 1993, its method of accounting for certain
investments in debt securities and equity securities that have a readily
determinable market value.
