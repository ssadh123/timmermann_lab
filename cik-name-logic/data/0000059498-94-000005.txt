Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements

Note 1-LCH Transaction

On June 24, 1994, the Company's subsidiary, LCH
Communications, Inc., redeemed all of its outstanding Redeemable
Preferred Stock held by Comcast Cellular Communications Inc., a
subsidiary of Comcast Corp., in exchange for all of the capital
stock of a subsidiary of LCH, whose assets consist primarily of a
49.99 percent interest in the Philadelphia "A Block" cellular
system and GuestInformant. As a result, the pro forma balance
sheet reflects the redemption of the Redeemable Preferred Stock
and the disposition of the unconsolidated investment in the
Philadelphia cellular system and the various GuestInformant asset
and liability accounts. The stockholders' deficit account
includes a $466.4 million gain on the redemption of the Preferred
Stock as well as the reversal of the dividends accrued during the
three months ended March 31, 1994. The gain represents the
excess of the fair values of the assets exchanged over their book
values. The majority of the difference between the book value of
the Preferred Stock and the fair values of the assets exchanged
is credited to Additional Paid In Capital. The pro forma income
statements reflect the removal of GuestInformant's operating
results and the removal of equity in unconsolidated affiliates
related to the Philadelphia cellular system. The pro forma
income statements do not reflect the gain on the redemption of
the Preferred Stock because such gain is considered a non-
recurring credit.

Note 2-New York Acquisition

On May 31, 1994, the Company completed the acquisition of an
additional 5.2% indirect interest in the New York City cellular
licensee for approximately $145 million in cash, bringing the
Company's total interests in the New York City licensee to 98.3%. 
The pro forma financial statements reflect the additional
intangible assets recorded as a result of the purchase, as well
as the decrease in the minority interest accounts. In addition,
pursuant to SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", the
Company is required to provide an additional deferred tax
liability of $55.4 million as a result of the difference between
the book and the tax bases of the purchased intangible
assets. 

Note 3-LIN Television Transaction

In the LIN Television transaction, the Company intends to
distribute the common stock of its subsidiary LIN Television to
the Company's stockholders on a tax-free basis. LIN Television
owns six network affiliated television stations. The Company <PAGE>
<PAGE> 13

would continue to own one network affiliated television station
(WOOD-TV) in addition to its cellular businesses. The pro forma
financial statements reflect the removal of LIN Television's
results of operations and its financial position for the periods
presented. The LIN Television transaction is subject to approval
by the Federal Communications Commission, obtaining a private
letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that neither the
Company nor any of its stockholders will be required to recognize
gain or loss or include any amount in income as a result of the
distribution and certain other conditions. The LIN Television
transaction is expected to close by year-end.<PAGE>
