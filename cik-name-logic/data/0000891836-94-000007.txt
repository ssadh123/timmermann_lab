FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (Wednesday, February 2, 1994)

TAMBRANDS ANNOUNCES 1993 FOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS

White Plains, New York--February 2, 1994--Tambrands Inc. (NYSE:TMB) today
reported sales and earnings in line with expectations for the fourth
quarter and the year ended December 31, 1993.

Howard B. Wentz, Jr., Chairman of the Board, announced that net sales for
the quarter were $146,659,000, compared to $165,312,000 in the fourth
quarter of 1992. Sales were lower due to lower volumes, caused primarily
by fluctuations in trade customers' inventories in the United States. Net
earnings were $21,074,000, or $.55 per share, compared to $31,099,000, or
$.80 per share, in the comparable period of 1992.

Wentz said, "The positive trends that began in the third quarter of 1993
continued in the fourth quarter. I believe we have resolved the
difficulties of the first half of last year and put a solid foundation in
place for 1994 and beyond." He pointed out that U.S. market share for the
second half of 1993, the period when the Company began executing its new
marketing strategy, was more than a full point ahead of the first half. As
the result of strong tampon category growth, U.S. Tampax tampon consumer
purchases in units increased by more than 7% in the second half over the
first half, and were slightly higher for the full-year 1993 than in 1992.

Marketing, selling and distribution expenses in the quarter were above last
year's levels, as the Company continued its increased advertising and
promotional spending worldwide. This increased spending was largely offset
by reductions in administrative and general expenses, driven principally by
the Company's previously announced restructuring.

For the full-year 1993, net sales were $611,465,000, compared to
$684,113,000 for 1992. Sales were lower for the year due to several
factors: lower volumes, caused primarily by the reduction of trade
customers' inventories; the weakening of European currencies; and the
divestitures in 1992 of the Maxithins sanitary pad business in North
America and the pad and diaper businesses in Brazil and Mexico.

The results of the Company's operations in Ukraine, Russia and China are
now included in the consolidated results.

The Company reported a one-time charge of $10,252,000 after tax, or $.27
per share, retroactive to the first quarter of 1993, representing the
effect of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112. 
SFAS 112 requires changes in the accounting for postemployment benefits.

Net earnings for 1993 after the SFAS 112 charge were $63,450,000, or $1.64
per share, compared to $121,400,000, or $3.06 per share, in 1992. 
Excluding the cumulative effects of accounting changes, earnings in 1993
were $73,702,000, or $1.91 per share, compared to $122,409,000, or $3.09
per share, in 1992. Also, the 1993 results were adversely affected by the
previously announced second-quarter charge of $20,273,000 after tax for
restructuring and other costs.

Tambrands manufactures Tampax(r) tampons and markets them around the world. 
A summary of consolidated operating results for the three months and year
ended December 31, 1993 is attached.
