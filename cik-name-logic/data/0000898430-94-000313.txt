Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. This report is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the documents described herein and attached as
exhibits hereto, which are incorporated herein by this reference.

The registrant did not acquire assets. On April 3, 1994, Northrop
Corporation ("Northrop"), a Delaware Corporation, Northrop Acquisition, Inc.,
a Delaware Corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Northrop Corporation,
and Grumman Corporation ("Grumman" or "the Company"), a New York Corporation,
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("the Merger") providing for a
merger of Northrop Acquisition, Inc. into Grumman. As a result of the Merger,
Grumman would be the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Northrop. A copy of the Agreement and Plan of Merger is attached hereto as
Exhibit A. In connection with the Merger, Northrop Acquisition, Inc. offered
to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Grumman common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, and associated rights (the "Shares") pursuant to a tender
offer (the "Offer") for all outstanding Shares at $62.00 per Share in cash
(the "Offer Consideration"). In connection with the Merger, untendered Shares
other than Shares held in treasury by Grumman or by any of Grumman's
subsidiaries, Shares owned by Northrop or its susidiaries and Shares held by
shareholders who properly exercise their dissenters' rights under New York
law, would be converted into the right to receive the Offer Consideration.

On April 16, 1994, Northrop Acquisition, Inc., accepted for purchase all
Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer made pursuant to the Offer to
Purchase dated March 14, 1994 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and the Supplement
thereto dated April 5, 1994 (the "Supplement"), copies of which are Exhibits
(B) and (C), respectively, as a result of which Northrop Acquisition, Inc.
holds at least 93.4% of the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis. A
Special Meeting of Shareholders of Grumman is scheduled for May 18, 1994, at
which the stockholders (including Northrop Acquisition, Inc.) will consider
and vote on the Agreement and Plan of Merger. It is expected that the Merger
will be consummated on or about May 18, 1994.

The total amount of funds required by Northrop Acquisition, Inc. to
purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer and to complete the Merger is
approximately $2.17 billion. Such amount represents $62 per Common Share paid
in the Offer and to be paid in the Merger for the outstanding Shares.

The Offer and the Merger are being financed with approximately $2.8
billion of borrowings, (i) $2.2 billion under a term loan credit facility (the
"Term Loan") and (ii) an additional amount under a $600 million revolving
credit facility for the purpose of replacing Northrop's current line of
credit, pursuant to the Credit Agreement between Northrop and The Chase
Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank, as co-agents, and a syndicate of commercial
banks. The financing for the Offer and the Merger is more fully described in
Section 12, "Source and Amount of Funds" of the Offer to Purchase and in
Section 3, "Source and Amount of Funds" of the Supplement.

Grumman Corporation was organized in 1929 under the name Grumman Aircraft
Engineering Corporation. The activities of Grumman Corporation and its
subsidiaries include: (a) the design and production of military aircraft,
space systems and commercial aircraft components and subassemblies, as well as
the modernization or conversion of previously completed aircraft; (b) the
design, manufacture and

1
<PAGE>

integration of sophisticated electronics for aircraft, computerized test
equipment and other defense related products, such as airborne surveillance
systems; and (c) electronic data processing services for affiliates and other
customers as well as real estate and leasing services. Grumman's activities
also include technical services that help ready the space shuttle for
flight, providing space station program support, servicing and maintaining
flight simulators and trainers, providing support for Grumman aircraft; and
the fabrication of vehicles for the U.S. Postal Service. Northrop does not 
currently intend to use Grumman property and assets for other purposes. 

Production contracts with the U.S. Government relating to the aerospace
industry have included the F-14 "Tomcat" fighter, the A-6 "Intruder" attack
aircraft, the EA-6B "Prowler" tactical jamming system, the E-2C "Hawkeye"
early warning aircraft, and the C-2A "Greyhound" carrier on-board delivery
system, of which, only the E-2C is currently in production.

Grumman is teamed with Gruppo Agusta of Italy to compete for a
program to replace the U.S. Air Force/U.S. Navy primary training aircraft
called JPATS - the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System. Seven teams are
competing for the work. A winner is to be selected in 1995.

Grumman is under contract to provide aircraft components and major
subassemblies to other manufacturers. These contracts include the center wing
section for the Boeing 767 jetliner, nacelles and thrust reversers for the
Gulfstream IV and Fokker aircraft, transcowls for General Electric CF6-80C2
engines, C-17 control surfaces, and composite spoilers and inboard flaps for
the new Boeing 777 airliner.

In 1985, the U.S. Air Force awarded Grumman a $657 million contract for
development of the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, known as
"Joint STARS". This developmental phase concluded in 1993 with the delivery of
the first two Joint STARS prototype E-8A aircraft to the Air Force. In
November 1990, Grumman received a $523 million follow-on contract for further
full-scale development; this included the acquisition of a third Joint STARS
aircraft, product improvement and logistics support. This follow-on contract,
currently worth $684 million, is scheduled for completion in 1995. Following
government approval for five low rate initial production aircraft, the U.S.
Air Force has authorized full funding of $415 million for two initial
aircraft. The E-8C is the production configuration of Joint STARS and
incorporates additional work stations and other system improvements. Grumman
is pursuing opportunities with NATO. According to present plans, a total of 19
production E-8C aircraft will be delivered to the Air Force beginning in 1995.

Grumman's data systems business designs, develops, operates and supports
computer systems for scientific and management information. Its services
include systems

integration, systems service, technical and professional services, information
conversion services and training; its customers and potential customers
include agencies of federal, state and local governments including among
others: the U,S. Navy and Marine Corps, the Air Force, NASA, the Defense
Logistics Agency and the Internal Revenue Service.

The Company is a subcontractor, under Lockheed's Shuttle Processing
Contract with NASA for management and support to the space Shuttle launch
processing operation, in such areas as instrumentation, measurement and
calibration. The current contract, which began in October 1983, was extended
to September 1995. There is one remaining three year option period which ends
in September 1998. The Company is a prime contractor on the Information
Systems Contract which was awarded in October 1992. This is a five year
contract which extends through December 1997. This contract requires
contractor support for all institutional computing capability at Johnson Space
Center, Houston, Texas.

In 1986, the Company was awarded a contract to build 99,150 Long Life
Vehicles for the U.S. Postal Service over a six year period; deliveries
commenced in April 1987. In September 1991, the Company negotiated an
agreement for a follow-on contract with the U.S. Postal Service to produce an
additional 43,505 Long Life Vehicles of which 4,723 and 19,881 were delivered
in 1992 and 1993, respectively. The combination of the original contract and
the follow-on contract will result in unit deliveries to the U.S. Postal
Service totalling 142,655 at the conclusion of the program.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Grumman Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Grumman
Corporation (a New York corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993
and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, common
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Grumman Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 6 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1992, the company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes and for postretirement benefits other than pensions.

GRUMMAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and
all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.

Inventories

Inventoried costs relating to both long-term government and commercial
contracts and programs are stated at the actual production cost. General and
administrative expenses allocable to aerospace fixed-price type contracts are
included in inventory, whereas such expenses for non-aerospace activities are
expensed as incurred. The costs attributed to units delivered under both long-
term government and commercial contracts and programs are based on the
estimated average costs of all units expected to be produced in a lot or
contract. In accordance with industry practice, inventories include amounts
relating to contracts and programs having long production cycles, portions of
which are not expected to be realized within one year.

Inventories of raw materials, purchased parts and supplies are carried at the
lower of cost or realizable values. Inventories are based on average cost
and/or first-in, first-out methods.

Revenue recognition

Sales under fixed-price production contracts are recorded at the time of
delivery. Sales, including fees earned, under cost-reimbursement and research,
development, test and evaluation contracts are recorded as costs are incurred.

Certain contracts contain cost and/or performance incentives. Such incentives
are included in sales at the time actual performance can be related to the
target and the earned amount can be reasonably determined. Accordingly,
earnings recorded in one period may include adjustments related to sales
recorded in a prior period. Losses on contracts are recorded when they become
known.

Depreciation and amortization

The company uses a declining-balance method of depreciation for substantially
all of its plant and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
terms of the leases or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter.

Upon sale or retirement of plant and equipment, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is
reflected currently. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.

Intangibles

The excess of cost over the net assets of acquired companies at December 31,
1993 and 1992, was $3.6 and $3.7 million, respectively. These amounts are
included in Non-Current Assets--Other, and are being amortized over 40 years.

Cash equivalents

It is the company's policy to treat securities which are readily convertible
to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less as
cash equivalents. The carrying value of such items, which is at cost,
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.

GRUMMAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

Financial instruments

During 1993, the company initiated a Common Stock Repurchase Program to
purchase up to $100 million of the company's outstanding common stock. As a
hedge of the company's cost, the company entered
into a series of equity put warrants whereby the company may be obligated to
repurchase 750,000 shares, if put to the company, at expiration date. These
equity put warrants will expire during the period August through October 1994.

Also during 1993, the company invested approximately $25 million in a 
limited partnership which invests in repurchase and reverse repurchase 
agreements backed by highly rated securities. At December 31, 1993, the value 
of the partnership's underlying net assets approximated the company's 
investment which is being accounted for using the equity method.

Research and development

Research and development costs associated with government programs up to a
negotiated ceiling are charged to inventory and are recorded in cost of sales
when products are delivered or services performed. Costs in excess of ceiling
and expenditures for commercial projects are charged against income in the 
year incurred. Total expenditures for research and development, bid and 
proposal efforts were, in millions, $122.5 in 1993, $132.8 in 1992 and $127.5 
in 1991.

Earnings per common share

Primary earnings per share are determined after deducting preferred stock
dividends and are based on the weighted average number of outstanding common
shares and common stock equivalents.

Reclassification

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to 1993
classifications.

NOTE 2--RESTRUCTURING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:

In order to become more competitive in the changing defense market, the
company recorded in the fourth quarter of 1993 an $85 million restructuring
provision. In connection with the consolidation of its facilities, the company
anticipates reducing its total floor space approximately 30 percent by 1997.
The restructuring charge provides for equipment and inventory write-offs of
approximately $60 million and plant closing costs of approximately $25 
million.

During 1993, the company settled a lawsuit relating to its previously
discontinued solar panel business and recorded a loss of $9.9 million before 
an income tax benefit of $3.2 million.

Operating results for Paumanock Insurance Company Ltd. for the years ended
December 31, 1992 and 1991, were reported in the income statement under the
caption "Income (loss) from discontinued operations" and are summarized as
follows:

At December 31, 1992, the net book value of the insurance company's assets
and liabilities was $11.1 million and is included in other non-current assets.
This business was sold in the first quarter of 1993 at an amount that
approximated the company's carrying value.

Unbilled costs and accrued profits represent revenue earned but not billed to
the customer at year-end. At December 31, 1993, approximately $166.7 million of
claims and accruals, a portion of which is subject to negotiation, is not
expected to be realized before December 31, 1994.

In June of 1991, the company submitted a request to the U. S. Air Force for
an equitable adjustment of the price of a contract involving the F-111A/E & EF-
111A Avionics Modernization Program, based on late and inadequate government-
furnished software and other property and other failures to comply with
contract requirements by the government. The request, as amended in May of
1993, was in the amount of $62.5 million. On August 26, 1993, the Contracting
Officer issued what purports to be a decision under the Contract Disputes Act
denying the preponderance of the price increase requested and concluding that
the Air Force is entitled to recover a net amount of $5.5 million on the basis
of alleged company failures to comply with the terms of the contract. The
company believes there is little or no support for the Contracting Officer's
decision and that the amounts of revenue recognized pursuant to this contract
are appropriate as of December 31, 1993.

The current liability for income taxes shown in the accompanying financial

========= =========
</TABLE>

The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was a
decrease of $9.4 million as a result of the utilization of the loss incurred on
the sale of the reinsurance business.

Effective January 1, 1992, the company began using the liability method as
prescribed in Financial Accounting Standard No. 109 which was issued in
February 1992. Under FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
at the tax rate that, under existing law, will be in effect when temporary
differences between financial and tax reporting turn around.

State taxes on income are included in general and administrative expenses,
and amounted to, in millions, $29.6 in 1993, $16.7 in 1992 and $11.3 in 1991.

NOTE 7--STOCK OPTIONS AND INCENTIVE PLANS:

The 1981 Stock Option Plan provided for the granting, at any time before
April 30, 1991, of options to purchase not more than 2,500,000 shares of the
company's stock. The 1990 Stock Option Plan provides for the granting, at any
time before April 30, 2000, of options to purchase not more than 1,500,000
shares of the company's stock. The 1992 Long Term Incentive Plan provides for
grants of awards not to exceed 1,750,000 shares. The stock option purchase
prices in these three plans are not less than the fair market value at dates of
grant.

The plans include an option surrender provision which allows the holders to
surrender some or all of their options and receive the value of the
appreciation of the shares in common stock.

In exchange for the options surrendered in 1993 and 1992, 514,358 and 103,040
shares were issued, having an aggregate market value of $17.6 and $2.3 million,
respectively.

Restricted Stock Award Plans provide for granting to employees, at any time
before January 1, 1998, not more than 3,750,000 shares of common stock. At
December 31, 1993, 1,063,130 shares were still available for future awards. The
cost of shares awarded under these plans is being amortized over 10 years for
awards made prior to April 1989 and seven years thereafter, the periods after
which all restrictions will have lapsed. In 1993, 1992 and 1991, $3.2, $4.1 and
$4.8 million, respectively, have been charged against income for these awards.

The 1992 Long Term Incentive Plan provides for granting up to 1,750,000
shares in the form of stock options, performance shares and restricted stock.
To date three awards have been made totalling 428,650 performance shares, which
are earned over a three-year period; and, $4.4 million and $1.4 million of
compensation expense has been recorded for 1993 and 1992, respectively. Options
for 495,500 shares have been granted under this plan. Both the performance
shares and the options granted under this plan are included in the above table.

In addition, officers and key employees of the company and its subsidiaries
have received awards under a Management Incentive Plan totalling, in millions,
$7.0 in 1993, $6.8 in 1992 and $5.8 in 1991.

NOTE 8--LONG-TERM DEBT:

Long-term debt, net of current maturities, at December 31 is as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

Long-term debt maturing in each of the next five years is as follows, in
millions: 1994, $6.6; 1995, $7.3; 1996, $8.1; 1997, $8.3; 1998, $9.5.

The company is party to a Restated Credit Agreement with various banks under
which it may borrow up to $200 million. Additionally, the banks have provided a
short-term credit facility which provides an additional $100 million through
March 31, 1994. On February 25, 1996, the Restated Credit Agreement will
terminate and any outstanding advances must be repaid to the banks. Any
outstanding advances under the short-term credit facility must be repaid at
termination. Interest on borrowings under this agreement will be based on a
three level scale related to the company's current credit rating ranging from
either Citibank's Base Rate up to .25 percent over that rate or .50 to 1.25
percent over the applicable Eurodollar Rate. There is a commitment fee
associated with both agreements that is also based on the company's credit
rating ranging from .25 to .50 percent on the Restated Credit Agreement and
from .20 to .50 percent on the short term agreement.

Repayment of borrowings under all of the loan agreements is guaranteed by the
company's major subsidiaries. The agreements contain, among other things,
provisions regarding maintenance of working capital, net worth and the payment
of cash dividends on common stock. The company's working capital and net worth
are substantially in excess of the minimum requirements, and the amount
available for the payment of cash dividends at December 31, 1993, was $36
million.

The $75 million 9.50 percent notes which were due February 15, 1996, were
included in short-term debt at December 31, 1992, and were redeemed on February
17, 1993, at 100 percent of face value, together with accrued interest.

The 9.25 percent convertible subordinated debentures due August 15, 2009,
were convertible at any time prior to maturity into common stock at $34.75 per
share. This issue of debentures was called by the company July 7, 1993, at a
price of 101.85 percent of face value plus accrued interest. The 10.50 percent
sinking fund debentures due February 15, 2011, were called by the company on
April 20, 1993, at a price of 107 percent of face value plus accrued interest.

The 10.375 percent notes due January 1, 1999, will be redeemable at any time
on or after January 1, 1996, after written notice, as a whole or in part at 100
percent of principal amount thereof, together with accrued interest. Upon the
occurrence of a designated event (primarily a change in equity ownership, a
merger with another company or a two- thirds turnover of the board of
directors), the holders of the notes may require the company to repurchase
their notes at 100 percent of the principal amount.

NOTE 9--PREFERRED STOCK:

The company is authorized to issue 10 million shares of $1.00 par value
preferred stock, none of which is issued and outstanding at December 31, 1993.
In July 1992, the remaining outstanding 1,192,249 shares of $2.80 cumulative
preferred stock were redeemed at $25.867 per share.

Each share of the $.80 convertible preferred stock was convertible into 2.2
shares of the company's common stock. In November 1992 the company exercised
its right to call this issue of stock. Those holders who did not convert their
holdings to common stock by November 25, 1992, received a cash payment of
$14.43 per share plus accrued dividends to that date. Preferred stock converted
into common stock during 1992 and 1991 were 2,888 shares and 454 shares,
respectively.

Grumman has noncontributory defined benefit plans covering approximately 85

Benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on employees' years of
service and career average compensation.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) No. 87, Employers'
Accounting for Pensions, effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1986, established a methodology for calculating periodic pension costs for

*Since government procurement regulations permit the recovery of pension
expense only to the extent contributions are made to the pension plans and the
company's business is predominantly with the government, the difference between
plan contributions and the calculated amount per FAS No. 87 is recorded in a
deferred asset account, as this difference will be expensed in the future as
costs are funded. The company's consolidated statement of income therefore
includes the total FAS No. 87 pension cost and a comparable amount of revenue.
Costs and liabilities associated with the pension enhancement program where
1,900 employees accepted enhanced pensions as an incentive to retire during the
period April 2 through October 31, 1990, are included above and are being
funded over a ten-year period which began in 1991.

Assumptions used in determining the actuarial present value of benefit
obligations as of December 31 were:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
1993 1992
---- ----
<S> <C> <C>
Discount rate................................................. 7.50% 8.50%
Rate of increase in compensation levels....................... 3.50% 5.00%
Expected long-term rate of return on assets................... 8.50% 8.75%
</TABLE>

The discount rate was reduced from 8.50 percent to 7.50 percent and the
expected rate of return from 8.75 percent to 8.50 percent in recognition of
declining interest rates. These are the primary reasons that plan assets
shifted from being greater than the projected benefit obligations at December
31, 1992 to being $120.6 million less than the projected benefit obligation at
December 31, 1993.

For the years 1992 and 1991, the assumptions used in determining the net
periodic pension expense and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations
were a discount rate of 8.75 percent, a compensation increase rate of 6.00
percent, and an expected long-term rate of return on assets of 8.75 percent.

Approximately 37 percent of the retirement plans' assets are invested in
diversified corporate stock, 32 percent in U.S. government securities, 10
percent in corporate fixed income securities, 4 percent in real estate
investments and 17 percent in short-term investments. In the event the company
terminates its major plan, the U.S. government may claim a share of the
remaining excess assets after the accumulated benefits have been satisfied. The
company's objectives are to make contributions to the plan that satisfy the
ERISA funding requirements and to utilize realistic actuarial assumptions based
on long-term trends.

NOTE 11--POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS:

Approximately 75 percent of the company's employees employed at year-end may
become eligible for certain retiree health care benefits. The length of time
the benefit is available is directly related to years of service. Retiree
contributions depend on length of service and Medicare status.

Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," requires accrual accounting for
retiree medical benefits. The company adopted FAS No. 106 effective January 1,
1992, and elected to immediately expense the $300 million transition obligation
upon adoption. To date the company has not prefunded this liability but has
taken steps to establish an acceptable funding vehicle with funding to commence
in 1994.

The 1993 and 1992 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by component is as
follows:

The health care trend rates used by the company as of December 31, 1993,
were: 1993, 14 percent; 1994 and 1995, 12.50 percent; 1996-1998, inclusive,
9.50 percent; as of December 31, 1992, they were: 1992, 12 percent; 1993-1995,
inclusive, 14 percent; 1996-1998, inclusive, 12 percent. The trend thereafter
is zero due to the company's announcement that these costs will be capped at
1998 levels and all increases thereafter will be borne by the retirees.

The combination of fewer employees, lower health care claim cost experience,
and changes in actuarial assumptions has had the effect of reducing the
accumulated benefit obligation by approximately $54.7 million.

The 1993 valuation used a 7.50 percent discount rate. The effect of a one
percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates on the
accumulated benefit obligation would be an increase of $6.7 million at December
31, 1993. The net periodic postretirement cost for 1993 would increase by $1.3
million.

Prior to adoption of this standard, postretirement medical benefits were
accounted for on a pay-as-you-go basis. The cost of providing these benefits
net of retiree contributions amounted to $21.3 million in 1991.

In 1994, FAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits,"
becomes mandatory. It requires postemployment benefits to be accounted for on
an accrual basis. The company's present accounting policies provide for the
accrual of the major components of these costs and adoption of this standard
will not have a material impact on the company's financial statements.

NOTE 12--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

Rental expense for all operating leases amounted to, in millions, $67.1,
$72.8 and $75.8 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Minimum rental
commitments under long-term noncancellable operating leases total $234.2
million which is payable as follows: 1994, $39.9; 1995, $34.6; 1996, $28.6;
1997, $23.8; 1998, $21.4; and $85.9 million in later years.

On January 28, 1993, a jury sitting in the United States District Court for
the District of Massachusetts returned a verdict against Grumman Systems
Support Corporation (GSSC), a subsidiary of Grumman Data Systems Corporation
(GDSC), which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, in an action
brought against GSSC by Data General Corporation (DG) for copyright
infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets. Judgment against GSSC was
entered in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts
in the amount of $52.4 million. Immediately after the entry of judgment DG
brought a post-trial motion seeking to join GDSC as a party defendant on a
theory of vicarious liability. The motion was denied and DG then commenced a
separate action in the Federal District Court for the District of
Massachusetts, Wooster Div. to enforce the judgment obtained against GDSC,
which action is still pending. GSSC has filed an appeal with the Federal Court
of Appeals for the First Circuit which was heard on

December 8, 1993. While GSSC's ultimate liability in the disposition of this
matter continues to be difficult to estimate, it is management's belief that
the outcome is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company's
financial position.

Three shareholder derivative actions, which are described as brought on
behalf of the company, have been filed in the New York State Supreme Court for
New York County. The actions name certain of the company's current and former
directors as defendants, and name the company as "nominal defendant." The
actions ask that damages and other unspecified relief be awarded to the company
for the individual defendants' alleged breach of their fiduciary obligations
primarily in relation to the subject matter of a long-running federal
investigation known as "Operation Upwind." The matters referred to in these
actions have been and continue to be acted upon by the company's Board as part
of its own ongoing investigation. Motions for summary judgment which seek to
dismiss the complaints have been filed on behalf of the defendant directors and
the company in two of the three actions. No response to the complaint in the
third action has been filed.

Currently, there are five waste disposal sites where the company has been
named either as a potentially responsible party or an owner/operator of the
site by a cognizant governmental agency for the cleanup of hazardous materials
previously placed there either directly or through an agent and where the cost
of remediation or settlement could reasonably exceed $100 thousand in amount.
It is unknown at this time what the company's share of these remediation
efforts may be but it is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
company's financial position.

Other pending litigation relating to matters that are in the ordinary course
of the company's business activities, including environmental matters, is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position.
