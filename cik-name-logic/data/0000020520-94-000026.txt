CITIZENS UTILITIES TO ACQUIRE ALLTEL TELEPHONE PROPERTIES

Stamford, Connecticut, November 29, 1994 -- Citizens Utilities
announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement
with ALLTEL Corporation to acquire approximately 109,000
telephone access lines, and cable television systems serving
7,000 subscribers, in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, New
Mexico, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia. 

Consideration for the transaction will be cash, assumed debt of
approximately $32 million, and the transfer of 3,600 Citizens
telephone access lines, for an aggregate transaction value of
approximately $290 million. Citizens currently provides
telecommunications service in six of the eight states in which
the properties are located. The transfer of ownership will occur
on a state-by-state basis, as necessary regulatory approvals are
received.

Leonard Tow, Citizens' chairman and chief executive officer,
said, "This acquisition fits Citizens' strategy of acquiring and
operating telecommunications, natural gas, electric, water and
wastewater businesses in small and medium-size communities that
are experiencing above-average population and job growth.

"Our commitment to providing these communities with the most
advanced technology, products and services is the key to superior

growth in the telecommunications business. As more people
migrate from urban America in search of a better quality of life
for their families, they are moving to areas like those we
serve," Mr. Tow said.

Mr. Tow added, "From the outset, this transaction will produce
increases in earnings, earnings per share and cash flow for our
shareholders and will further Citizens' unparalleled financial
performance." 

ALLTEL (NYSE: AT) is a telecommunications and information
services company. Its subsidiaries provide local telephone
service, cellular telephone service, information services and
other related services.

Citizens Utilities (NYSE: CZNA, CZNB) is a growing diversified
company providing telecommunications, natural gas, electric,
water and wastewater treatment services to customers in 17
states. Citizens also has a significant investment in Centennial
Cellular Corp., a cellular telephone company, and owns and
operates Electric Lightwave, Inc., a competitive telephone access
provider.
