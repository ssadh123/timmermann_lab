HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL REPORTS:

FOURTH QUARTER INCOME UP 56%, EPS UP 46%; QUARTERLY RECORDS SET

FULL YEAR INCOME ALSO A RECORD, UP 56%

PROSPECT HEIGHTS, IL., February 1, 1994 -- Household
International today reported that net income increased 56 percent
to $93 million for the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with
$59.8 million for the fourth quarter of 1992. Fully diluted
earnings per share (adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split in October
1993) were 89 cents, compared with 61 cents a year earlier, an
increase of 46 percent. It was the company's eighth consecutive
quarter of net income improvement, and represented a record level
of quarterly income and earnings per share. 

Household said, as a result of the strong fourth quarter,
full-year net income also increased to a record level, 56 percent
above the prior year.

Compared to the prior year, earnings for the quarter were
reduced by 5 cents per share because of the issuance of 4 million
shares of common stock in the first quarter of 1993, 3 cents per
share as a result of adopting the new accounting standard for
post-retirement benefits, and 4 cents per share because of a
higher corporate tax rate from new tax legislation.

Donald C. Clark, chairman and chief executive officer of
Household, said, "We finished the year with a very strong quarter
which slightly exceeded our expectations. The quarter saw
improved performance at most of our businesses and an
increasingly positive consumer market. The fourth quarter
benefited from seasonal factors including strong growth in
interchange income from our credit card business. Domestic
managed consumer receivables grew 5 percent in the quarter and 14
percent for all of 1993, largely due to the continuing success of
the GM Card. Credit quality improved throughout the company with
consumer delinquency declining for the seventh consecutive
quarter to the lowest level since 1989."

Household said that despite declining delinquency, credit
loss reserves for the managed finance and banking portfolio were
increased by $61 million, or 10 percent, in the quarter, largely
to recognize the rapid growth of the GM card portfolio and that
credit losses will naturally rise as the portfolio ages.

Finance and Banking Segment Results
- -----------------------------------
Household said income from its finance and banking segment
was $91 million in the fourth quarter, up 40 percent from $64.8
million in the fourth quarter of 1992 and up 15 percent from the
third quarter of 1993. The improvement was due to increased
profitability in the bankcard and domestic consumer finance
operations and improved results in the United Kingdom.

Net interest spreads on a managed basis were stable to
slightly higher versus both the previous quarter and year ago
quarter, due to the relatively stronger growth in higher margin
unsecured products. 

The company said that overall improved foreign results were
achieved despite an increased loss in its Canadian operation due
to higher loss provisions and expenses relating to the company's
plans for restructuring that operation. Household said its
United Kingdom unit posted a profit of $6.5 million in the
quarter, compared with a loss of nearly $8 million in the prior
year quarter.

For the quarter, overall two-months-and-over consumer
delinquency was 3.58 percent of managed consumer receivables,
compared with 3.85 percent at the previous quarter-end and 4.48
percent a year ago. Credit loss reserves for the managed finance
and banking portfolio at December 31 were higher than a year ago
by $140 million, or 28 percent, despite a $128 million, or 11
percent, decline in delinquency.

Total annualized consumer net chargeoffs as a percent of
average consumer receivables managed were 2.96 percent for the
quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter due to higher,
nonrecurring Canadian chargeoffs and the maturing GM Card
portfolio. Excluding the Canadian impacts, chargeoffs would have
been 2.87 percent, flat with the prior quarter. The GM Card
portfolio contributed 10 basis points of the increase in net
chargeoffs in the quarter. Reductions in other parts of the
portfolio partially offset the Canadian and GM Card increases. 
Chargeoffs in 1993 represented a substantial decline from 3.38
percent for the fourth quarter of 1992.

Operating expenses for the finance and banking segment
totaled $370 million in the quarter, flat with the prior quarter
and compared with $317 million in the year ago quarter. 
Contributing to the year-over-year increase were expenses related
to a 54 percent increase in the size of the managed credit card
portfolio. Operating expenses as a percent of average
receivables owned or serviced were at an annual rate of 3.40
percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 3.56 percent in the
prior quarter and 3.49 percent in the year ago quarter.

Individual Life Insurance Segment Results
- -----------------------------------------
Net income in the individual life insurance segment was
$10.2 million, compared with $15.4 million for the fourth quarter
of 1992. The decline, which was expected, was due to a lower
level of capital gains in the investment portfolio.

Liquidating Commercial Lines Segment Results
- --------------------------------------------
The fourth quarter loss of $2.5 million for the liquidating
commercial lines segment was consistent with the company's
expectations and represented a sharp reduction from the $10.5
million loss in the prior quarter. Total nonperforming assets in
the segment of $514 million (including nonaccrual loans,
renegotiated loans and real estate owned) were $192 million, or
27 percent, below the year ago level and were down $9 million in
the quarter. Reserves for credit losses stood at $173 million at
year end, compared with $203 million a year ago. Reserves as a
percent of nonperforming loans increased to 67 percent at
December 31, compared with 45 percent a year ago.

Net chargeoffs for the segment were $31 million for the
quarter, compared with $47 million in the prior quarter and $18
million in the prior year quarter. Operating expenses were $10.5
million, up slightly from $8.3 million in the 1992 fourth
quarter. The company said its real estate owned portfolio
generated net operating income of about 8 percent of the carrying
value of the portfolio in the fourth quarter on an annualized
basis.

Liquidating commercial assets at December 31 totaled $1.56
billion, $295 million below the level of a year ago. 

Corporate
- ---------
Corporate expenses, net of tax benefits, were $5.7 million,
compared with $16.6 million for the fourth quarter of 1992. The
1992 fourth quarter included a $15 million provision for credit
losses to establish an unallocated corporate credit loss reserve.

Full Year Results
- -----------------
For the full year 1993, Household's net income totaled a
record $298.7 million, an increase of 56 percent over 1992. 
Fully diluted earnings per share (adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock
split in October 1993) were $2.85 compared with $1.93 in the
prior year, an increase of 48 percent.

Compared to the prior year, earnings for 1993 were reduced
by 16 cents per share because of the 4 million share common stock
issuance, 11 cents per share related to post-retirement benefits
and 9 cents per share because of the new tax law.

Finance and banking segment earnings totaled $303.2 million,
51 percent higher than 1992 earnings of $200.6 million. The
higher earnings were due to higher profits from bankcard,
domestic consumer finance and the company's United Kingdom
business.

Income for the individual life insurance segment was $45.2
million, an 8 percent increase over 1992.

The full year loss at the liquidating commercial lines
segment was $21.2 million, compared with $14 million in the prior
year. The higher loss was primarily attributable to a higher
level of chargeoffs taken in the third quarter of 1993 related to
the resolution of the company's largest problem credit in a cash
settlement.

Household International, Inc. is a major provider of

Finance and Banking Segment
- ---------------------------
Since 1989, securitizations and sales of consumer receivables have been an
important source of liquidity for the company. The company continues to
service the securitized receivables after such receivables are sold, and
retain a limited recourse obligation. Securitizations impact the
classification of revenues and expenses in the income statement. Net
interest margin, non-interest income such as interchange fee income and 
provision for loan losses related to receivables sold are reported net
non-interest income.

Managed Income Statement
- ------------------------
To aid in analysis, the following table shows the pro forma impact on
income statement classifications assuming the receivables securitized and
sold were instead held in portfolio. This pro forma analysis does not 
adjust the results to reflect the differences between the company's
accounting policies for receivables held in portfolio and receivables
sold and serviced with limited recourse. Accordingly, net income on the 
pro forma managed basis equals net income on a historical owned basis.

Income Statement on a Managed Basis
- -----------------------------------
As receivables are securitized and sold rather than held in portfolio,
net interest income is shifted to securitization and servicing fee income.
Due to the growing level of securitized assets, the comparability of net 
interest margin between periods may be distorted. To aid in analysis, net 
interest margin is presented below on a pro forma basis as if receivables
securitized and sold were held in portfolio.
