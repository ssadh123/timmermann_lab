FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE RISE 50%

SCHAUMBURG, ILLINOIS, JANUARY 19, 1994 -- Santa Fe Pacific

Corporation (SFP) reported fourth quarter net income of $67.0

million, or $0.36 per share compared to adjusted net income of

$43.9 million, or $0.24 per share last year. Including a pre-tax

gain of $204.9 million related to the sale of rail lines in

southern California and an after tax extraordinary charge of $5.0

million for early retirement of debt, 1992 net income was $168.9

million or $0.91 per share.

"Our fourth quarter performance was a great finish for the

company in 1993," said Robert D. Krebs, chairman, president and

chief executive officer. "The railroad achieved the highest

quarterly operating income in its history and our gold company

more than doubled its 1992 fourth quarter earnings."

RAILWAY RESULTS

Santa Fe Railway reported fourth quarter operating income of

$114.8 million, a 25% increase over 1992. The quarterly

operating ratio improved to 81.8% from 84.1% last year.

Revenues of $631.1 million increased 9% resulting from an 8%

increase in loadings and

a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Intermodal shipments

increased 8% reflecting continued strength in direct marketing

and international business. Carload shipments also increased 8%

due to growth in automotive and coal business.

Quarterly operating expenses of $516.3 million increased 6%

compared to 1992, primarily due to increased traffic.

Compensation and benefits expense of $199.8 million rose 3% from

1992 as increases in traffic were partially offset by operating

efficiencies. Fuel expense of $66.9 million increased $9.5

million due to a 10% increase in consumption and a 6% increase in

price. Fuel expense includes a 4.3 cents per gallon fuel tax

increase that went into effect on October 1. Equipment rents of

$59.3 million increased $7.9 million due to volume increases and

additional equipment leased for new business. Other expenses of

$112.7 million increased $5.0 million and include higher

intermodal drayage and other contract service costs, which were

partially offset by the recovery of approximately $8 million for

certain flood costs incurred during the third quarter.

GOLD RESULTS

Santa Fe Pacific Gold's (SFPG) quarterly operating income of

$21.2 million rose $11.5 million compared to the same quarter

last year. Gold sales increased 178,000 ounces to 241,000 ounces

due to increased sales at all operations including mines acquired

as part of the asset exchange completed in the second quarter

with Hanson Natural Resources Company. Fourth quarter 1992 

results included income from coal and aggregate assets which were

exchanged with Hanson.

For the quarter, average sales price per ounce of $382 was

$8 below 1992, but $9 per ounce higher than the average spot

price for the quarter. Average cash production cost was $165 per

ounce, compared to $201 in 1992. Total cost per ounce decreased

$26 to $239. Both cash and total production cost per ounce

benefitted from increased production and other efficiencies.

Yesterday, SFPG announced a 26% increase in proven and

probable contained gold reserves from 11.2 million ounces

announced as of June 30, 1993 to 14.1 million ounces as of

December 31, 1993. SFPG has more than doubled its reserves since

the end of 1992. 

PIPELINE RESULTS

SFP's equity investment in Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline

Partners, L.P., produced operating income of $7.5 million in the

fourth quarter, compared to $6.9 million last year because of an

increase in revenues from commercial shipments.

OTHER INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE

Other income-net of $1.2 million decreased $6.1 million due

principally to reduced land sales by the railroad. Interest

expense of $32.8 million declined $10.3 million from 1992

reflecting lower outstanding debt levels.

1993 ANNUAL RESULTS

Excluding special items, SFP reported adjusted net income of

$167.6 million, or $0.90 per share for the year compared to

$138.8 million, or $0.75 per share in 1992. The improved 1993

performance is due to higher Railway and Gold operating income 

and lower interest expense, offset by lower other income-net

related to reduced land sales and interest income. The higher

operating income at Santa Fe Railway reflects growth in traffic

and continued operating

efficiencies, and occurred despite depressed third quarter income

due to the flood. The increase in Gold operating income includes

the benefits of increased production at all operations including

mines acquired as part of the asset exchange completed in the

second quarter with Hanson.

Including special items, SFP reported net income of $338.8

million, or $1.81 per share for the year compared to a loss of

$104.5 million, or $0.57 per share in 1992. Annual 1993 results

include a $32.0 million increase in tax expense for the

retroactive effect of the increase in the maximum corporate

federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%, $12.2 million in pre-tax

expense for SFP's portion of environmental and litigation charges

at Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline Partners, L.P., and $21.6 million in

pre-tax gains related to the favorable outcome of arbitration and

litigation settlements, all reflected in the third quarter. In

addition, 1993 includes a second quarter non-cash pre-tax gain of

$217.5 million on the asset exchange with Hanson and a first

quarter pre-tax gain of $145.4 million from the sale of rail

lines in southern California to various transit agencies.

The 1992 results include the previously described fourth

quarter gain on the sale of rail lines and the extraordinary

charge, as well as third quarter pre-tax charges totalling $324.9

million related to Railway's crew consist agreement and

operations centralization and increased environmental accruals at

Railway and Pipeline. Results in 1992 also include a net charge

of $163.0 million taken in the first quarter for the adoption of 

a new accounting method for health and life insurance and

disability benefits for retired and inactive employees.
