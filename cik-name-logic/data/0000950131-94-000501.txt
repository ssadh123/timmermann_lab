Attachment A

CHICAGO, April 8, 1994 -- During First Chicago Corporation's annual meeting
of stockholders, Chairman Richard L. Thomas made the following observations
regarding first quarter results:
"First, we will report a good quarter with earnings above the fourth 
quarter of last year and at or somewhat above the strong first quarter a year 
ago -- although the mix will be different than we had anticipated.
"Second, most of our major businesses performed well during the quarter, 
continuing the trends that we established in 1993.
"Third, credit quality improved further. Fourth, the previously reported 
$45 million gain in our venture capital portfolio involving NEXTEL 
Communications, combined with gains from the sale of other equities, was more 
than sufficient to offset very negative trading results. Our trading 
difficulties were concentrated in the emerging markets sector in March, and we 
believe that most other firms active in this arena had similar problems given 
the recent turbulence in global markets."
First Chicago Corporation will release its first quarter earnings on 
Wednesday, April 13.
