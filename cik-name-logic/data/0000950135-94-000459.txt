million, for the assets of IFTC's holding company, consisting of the equity of

addition, completion of the acquisition will be subject to regulatory approvals
and other usual conditions.

Commenting on the proposed acquisition, Marshall N. Carter, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of State Street, said, "The acquisition of IFTC will
strengthen State Street's leadership position in servicing financial assets
worldwide. IFTC will bring additional customers and different systems
solutions to the servicing market. The acquisition will position State Street
well for long term earnings growth, and we expect no material effect on
earnings per share in the early years. We plan to operate IFTC as an
independent trust company based in Kansas City with the current management
team. We look forward to a new servicing relationship with Kemper and to
developing further our long-standing relationship with DST."

IFTC will operate as a separate subsidiary, reporting to Ronald E. Logue,
Executive Vice President of U.S. Mutual Fund Services for State Street. 
Commenting on the proposed acquisition, Gerard Lavin, President and CEO of IFTC
said, "We are delighted with the prospects for IFTC, our customers and
employees. We are pleased to become associated with the premier company in the
industry, which will add to IFTC's capabilities. We look forward to continuing
to provide excellent service and, with State Street's assistance, providing a
broader array of services to our customers."

With $1.6 trillion in assets under custody and $139 billion in assets under
management, State Street is a leading servicer of financial assets worldwide. 
State Street's assets under custody include $669 billion of mutual fund assets. 
As of June 30, 1994, State Street had total assets of $21.8 billion and
