Item 2. Disposition of Assets

On December 19, 1994, the shareholders of Jones Spacelink, Ltd. (the
"Company") approved an Exchange Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and
Liquidation dated May 31, 1994, as amended, between the Company and Jones
Intercable, Inc. ("Intercable") providing for the acquisition by Intercable of
substantially all of the assets of the Company and the assumption by Intercable
of all of the liabilities of the Company.

On December 20, 1994, Intercable acquired all of the assets of the
Company (except for the 2,859,240 shares of Intercable's Common Stock owned by
the Company) and assumed all of the liabilities of the Company (except for
liabilities with respect to shareholders exercising dissenters' rights) in
exchange for 3,900,000 shares of Intercable's Class A Common Stock. The
Company will effect its complete liquidation and distribute the aforesaid
shares of Intercable Class A Common Stock and Common Stock to its shareholders,
other than to any dissenting shareholders. As adjusted at closing to give
effect to the exercise of dissenters' rights and to the exercise or
non-exercise of outstanding stock options, the exchange ratios will result in
shareholders of the Company receiving, for each share of Company Class A Common
Stock, .03571 shares of Intercable Common Stock and .09696 shares of Intercable
Class A Common Stock. The Intercable shares to be distributed to the Company's
shareholders will be freely transferable, except for shares acquired by
affiliates of Intercable.
