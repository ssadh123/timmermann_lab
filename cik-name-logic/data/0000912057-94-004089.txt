Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
- - ------- -------------------------------------

(a) JMB Institutional Realty Corporation and JMB Properties Company.

On October 18, 1994, United Asset Management Corporation ("UAM") and its
wholly owned subsidiary Heitman Financial Ltd. ("HFL") entered into an
acquisition agreement in which they agreed to acquire and incorporate into HFL
and its subsidiaries the institutional real estate advisory and property
management assets and business of JMB Institutional Realty Corporation, JMB
Properties Company and their affiliates (the "Sellers"), other than the Seller's
retail property management business and certain other excluded assets (the
acquired assets and business are hereafter referred to as "JMB Institutional
Realty"). The closing of the acquisition is scheduled to take place in two
parts. The First Closing is scheduled to occur on December 2, 1994 at which
time all of the assets and business to be acquired will be transferred with the
exception of those assets relating to PRA Securities Advisors, LP ("PRA"). The
assets and business of PRA will be conveyed at a second closing early in 1995
after a mutual fund, advised by PRA, has held a meeting of stockholders called
to approve a new investment advisory agreement with a newly organized subsidiary
of HFL, as required by the Investment Company Act of 1940.

The institutional real estate advisory business of JMB Institutional Realty
currently manages approximately $5 billion in gross real estate assets. The
property management business to be acquired provides non-retail property
management services for the real estate holdings of the institutional real
estate advisory business to be acquired and for others. The transaction does
not affect or involve a number of the Seller's affiliates. The unaffected
affiliates include the Sellers' individual investor, private client, partnership
and development operations. Also unaffected are JMB Insurance Agency, JMB's
interest in Urban Shopping Centers, Inc., and its retail property management
subsidiary, JMB Retail Properties Company, land development activities at Amfac
and Arvida, and the investment advisory responsibilities in connection with
certain contracts including those related to Las Colinas, Catellus and Cadillac
Fairview.

Subject to certain adjustments and subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions to the closing, the purchase price to be paid by UAM to the Sellers
will be $150,000,000 of short-term (three-day) notes, $70,000,000 in principal
amount of UAM Non-Negotiable 6-1/2% Subordinated Notes payable on the seventh
anniversary of their issuance and warrants, which expire on the seventh
anniversary of their issuance, to purchase an aggregate of 1,515,179 shares of
UAM Common Stock, 760,869 of which are exercisable at $46.00 per share and
754,310 of which are exercisable at $46.40 per share (subject to adjustment in
case of stock splits, etc.).

-2-

<PAGE>

In negotiating the amount of consideration to be paid for the business, UAM
considered, among other things, the following factors with respect to JMB
Institutional Realty: the financial results, the value of assets under
management, the client history, the investment performance and quality of
management, and the prospects for growth.

There is no material relationship between UAM and the Sellers or any of
their respective officers, directors, or stockholders, other than the
Acquisition Agreement pursuant to which the acquisition will be made and the
other agreements relating thereto.

(b) Provident Investment Counsel

On November 10, 1994, UAM entered into an acquisition agreement in which
UAM agreed to purchase all of the assets of Provident Investment Counsel
("PIC"). The closing is presently scheduled for January 27, 1995. PIC, a
California corporation, is an investment management firm which had assets under
management as of September 30, 1994 of approximately $14.5 billion. At the
closing, UAM's wholly-owned subsidiary, PIC Newco, Inc., newly formed for
purposes of the acquisition, will assume PIC's name and continue its business.

Subject to certain adjustments and subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions to the closing, the initial purchase price which UAM will pay to PIC
will be $264,554,550 in cash, $20,814,776 in principal amount of UAM Non-
Negotiable 6-1/2% Subordinated Notes payable on the seventh anniversary of
issuance, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 459,385 shares of UAM Common
Stock exercisable at $45.31 per share (subject to adjustment in case of stock
splits, etc.) and expiring on the seventh anniversary of their issuance, and
$67,370,074 in shares of UAM Common Stock. The number of shares of UAM Common
Stock to be issued is based on an average closing price for a twenty-day period
preceding the closing date, subject to a ceiling of $43.50 per share and a
floor of $29.00 per share.

The Acquisition Agreement also calls for a contingent payment to be made as
additional purchase price, dependent upon the growth of PIC's business from the
closing date of the transaction through 1997. The maximum total contingent
payment which may be earned is $125,000,000. The contingent payment, if earned,
will be payable in cash, UAM Common Stock, UAM Non-Negotiable 6-1/2%
Subordinated Notes and warrants to purchase shares of UAM Common Stock, all in
pro-rata amounts based on the relative amounts of such consideration paid at the
closing subject to PIC's right to increase the note and warrant portion and
decrease the cash portion by up to a maximum of $10,000,000. The Contingent
Notes and Warrants will be on substantially the same terms as the Notes and
Warrants issued at the closing, except that the due date and expiration date,
respectively, shall be seven (7) years from the date of their issuance. The per
share price of the UAM Common Stock to be used in calculating the number of
shares payable in connection with the contingent payment will be based on an
average closing price for a twenty-day period preceding the contingent closing
date,

-3-

<PAGE>

provided, however, that if such price is less than the higher of $29.00 per
share or 80% of the average of the closing price of UAM's Common Stock over the
year preceding the contingent closing, UAM may opt to pay that portion of the
contingent payment in cash.

In negotiating the amount of consideration to be paid for PIC's assets, UAM
considered, among other things, the following factors with respect to PIC: the
financial results, the value of assets under management, the client history, the
investment performance and quality of management, and the prospects for growth.

There is no material relationship between UAM and PIC or any of their
respective officers, directors, or stockholders, other than the Acquisition
Agreement pursuant to which the acquisition will be made and the other
agreements relating thereto.

(c) Sources of Funds

The principal sources of the cash portion of the purchase price for the
above described transactions will be cash generated by UAM's operations and
borrowings under UAM's Amended and Restated Reducing Credit Agreement dated as
of August 29, 1994 (filed as Exhibit 10 to UAM's report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 1994, which exhibit indicates the identity of each
lending bank) and subsequently amended on November 18, 1994 as further discussed
in Item 5 within this Form 8-K.

-4-

<PAGE>

Item 5. Other Events
- - ------- ------------

The Company amended and restated its Reducing Credit Agreement as of
November 18, 1994 whereby an additional $100,000,000 was made available,
bringing the Company's total line of credit to $500,000,000. In addition to the
pre-existing five year credit facility relating to the $400,000,000, the Company
may borrow the $100,000,000 through November 18, 1995. Any of the $100,000,000
principal amount outstanding at that time will be due. The Company plans to
refinance borrowings under this additional facility through placement of longer
term notes with institutional investors.

Interest rates available, at the Company's election, for amounts drawn on
this additional $100,000,000 are currently: prime, 100 basis points over LIBOR
or 112.5 basis points over certain certificate of deposit rates. In certain
circumstances, interest rate spreads may expand up to an additional 50 basis
points. Currently, a commitment fee of 37.5 basis points is payable on the daily
average unused portion of the $100,000,000 commitment.

The Company is required to meet certain financial covenants, including
covenants restricting dividends and repurchase of the Company's stock, and
requiring the Company to maintain a minimum net worth, as defined. The Company
must also continue to maintain certain minimum working capital, cash flow and
debt to equity ratios.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the
JMB Business Group

We have audited the combined balance sheets of the JMB Business Group (Note 1)
as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related combined statements of income,
changes in combined equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-
year period ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the management of the JMB Business Group. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the JMB Business
Group as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December
31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

JMB BUSINESS GROUP

Notes to the Combined Financial Statements

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

The "JMB Business Group" is comprised of JMB Institutional Realty
Corporation and certain of its affiliates, JMB Properties Company and PRA
Securities Advisors, L.P.; exclusive of certain asset management and
property management contracts that are not part of a transaction
contemplated by the owners of the JMB Business Group. The accompanying
combined financial statements present the accounts of the (a) asset
management, and (b) office, residential and industrial property management
and leasing businesses of the JMB Business Group. The effects of all
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
the combined presentation.

Because of the common control and management of the asset management,
property management and leasing businesses of the JMB Business Group, the
accompanying combined financial statements have been accounted for as a
group of entities under common control, which is similar to the accounting
method used for a pooling of interests.

NOTE 2--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

GENERAL:

Cash and cash equivalents include deposits and United States Government
obligations with original maturities of three months or less.

No provision for federal income taxes has been made as the liability for
any such taxes is that of the owners of the respective combined entities
rather than the JMB Business Group.

Rental expense is recognized over the terms of the leases, inclusive of the
portion of the terms of the leases for which a rental concession has been
granted, with the amount of the concession comprising deferred rent
abatements in the accompanying combined balance sheets. Such amounts are
amortized over the portion of the terms of the leases during which actual
payments of rent are made.

Asset management fees and management and leasing fees are recognized as
revenue when the related services are provided and payment is made or
expected on a current basis.

Depreciation of office furnishings and equipment and amortization of
leasehold improvements are provided over the statutory recovery periods in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Such statutory periods approximate the estimated useful life of the assets.
Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred.

other operating expenses from affiliated entities for activities performed
on their behalf. Such reimbursements aggregated $6,419,278, $3,830,128 and

31, 1992, the Prior Plan was merged into the aforementioned 401(k) Plan.

In 1992, the JMB Business Group was admitted into a defined benefit pension
plan administered by an associated company. The associated company's
policy is to fund pension costs in accordance with the minimum funding
requirements under the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). Pursuant to the requirements
of the plan, the JMB Business Group funded benefit obligations in the

Notes to the Combined Financial Statements

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

The "JMB Business Group" is comprised of JMB Institutional Realty
Corporation and certain of its affiliates, JMB Properties Company and PRA
Securities Advisors, L.P.; exclusive of certain asset management and
property management contracts that are not part of a transaction
contemplated by the owners of the JMB Business Group. The accompanying
combined financial statements present the accounts of the (a) asset
management, and (b) office, residential and industrial property management
and leasing businesses of the JMB Business Group. The effects of all
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
the combined presentation.

Because of the common control and management of the asset management,
property management and leasing businesses of the JMB Business Group, the
accompanying combined financial statements have been accounted for as a
group of entities under common control, which is similar to the accounting
method used for a pooling of interests.

NOTE 2--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

GENERAL:

Cash and cash equivalents include deposits and United States Government
obligations with original maturities of three months or less.

No provision for federal income taxes has been made as the liability for
any such taxes is that of the owners of the respective combined entities
rather than the JMB Business Group.

Rental expense is recognized over the terms of the leases, inclusive of the
portion of the terms of the leases for which a rental concession has been
granted, with the amount of the concession comprising deferred rent
abatements in the accompanying combined balance sheets. Such amounts are
amortized over the portion of the terms of the leases during which actual
payments of rent are made.

Asset management fees and management and leasing fees are recognized as
revenue when the related services are provided and payment is made or
expected on a current basis.

Depreciation of office furnishings and equipment and amortization of
leasehold improvements are provided over the statutory recovery periods in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Such statutory periods approximate the estimated useful life of the assets.
Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred.

Board of Directors
Provident Investment Counsel
Pasadena, California

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Provident Investment Counsel
(an S corporation) as of December 31, 1992 and 1991 and the related statements
of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Provident Investment Counsel as

-----------------

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of the business

Provident Investment Counsel (the Company) acts as a discretionary
investment manager and is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940.

Revenue recognition

Fee income is recognized in the period for which the Company provides
advisory services. Fees generally are based on a percentage of the market
values of the portfolios under management. Accounts receivable are
considered fully collectable as of December 31, 1992.

Investments

Investments are carried at the lower of cost or market.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization of
property and equipment are computed on the straight-line and declining
balance methods over the useful lives of the assets, or in the case of
leasehold improvements the life of the lease. These lives range from five
to ten years.

Income tax

The Company, with the consent of its stockholders, has elected under the
Internal Revenue Code to be an S corporation. In lieu of corporation income
taxes, the stockholders of an S corporation are taxed on their
proportionate share of the Company's taxable income. Under those
provisions, the Company does not pay federal corporate income taxes on its
taxable income. Instead, the stockholders are liable for individual federal
income taxes on the Company's taxable income.

The Company has also elected by consent of its stockholders to be taxed
under the California S corporation provisions. Under such regulations the
state corporate tax rate is 2-1/2%.

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED

Income tax, continued

Amounts provided for state income taxes are based on earnings reported for
financial statement purposes, adjusted for differences between reported
financial and taxable income.

Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.

The Company had uninsured cash balances of $3,107,537 and $1,633,318 at
December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in limited
partnerships. Under this method, investments are stated at cost, adjusted
for the equity in taxable earnings or losses and distributions as reported
by the general partners. These limited partnerships are for a specified
term at which time any cash or stock held by the partnerships will be
distributed to the partners. Management believes the recorded value is not
materially different from the fair market value of these investments.

At December 31, 1992 the aggregate cost of the PIC Pinnacle Funds and
common stocks approximated market.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS ACTIVITY

Provident Investment Counsel (the Company) acts as a discretionary investment
manager and is registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Investment management fees are a function of portfolio values under management.
Income is recognized in the period for which advisory services are provided.
Accounts receivable are considered fully collectable as of December 31, 1993.

INVESTMENTS

Investments are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using both declining
and straight-line methods over their estimated useful lives, which range from
three to ten years. Depreciation expense was $605,347 and $420,598 for the
years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

INCOME TAXES

In 1989, the Company elected to be treated as a Small Business Corporation for
both federal and California income tax purposes. Under this arrangement the
Corporation's stockholders are taxed directly on the Corporation's taxable
income for federal and state purposes. Therefore, a provision has been made
only for an additional California franchise tax imposed at the corporate level.

The Company provides for the income tax effect of transactions reported in the
financial statements. The provision includes only taxes currently due. The tax
effect of temporary differences between book and taxable income are immaterial
to the financial statements and therefore no deferred taxes have been
recognized.

A new method of computing deferred income taxes was adopted beginning with the
year ended December 31, 1993, as mandated by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). The cumulative
effect of this change on the year ended December 31, 1992 is not material to
these financial statements, and is included in net income for the year ended
December 31, 1993.

Provident Investment Counsel
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

For the statement of cash flows, the Company defines cash equivalents as
short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to
cash,and so near to maturity that the risk of changes in value because of
interest rate fluctuations is insignificant.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in 1992 have been reclassified to conform with the 1993
presentation.

2. INVESTMENTS

Investments for each year ending December 31, are as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

1993 1992
--------- ---------
<S> <C> <C>

Limited partnerships $ 193,748 $ 216,672

Common stocks 55,030 46,189
--------- ---------
$ 698,778 $ 462,861

</TABLE>

The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in limited
partnerships. Under this method, investments are originally stated at cost and
adjusted for the Company's share of earnings or losses and distributions as
reported by the general partners. These limited partnerships are for a
specified term at which time any cash or stock held by the partnerships will be
distributed to the partners. Management believes the recorded value of the
partnership interests are not materially different from the fair market value of
these investments. The aggregate cost of the mutual funds, hedge fund and
common stock approximate fair market value.

3. NOTES RECEIVABLE

The Company has established a program to lease automobiles previously owned by
employees of the Company. The Company funded, through a leasing agent, the
purchase of the vehicles in exchange for notes receivable. The respective notes
are to be repaid by the agent over the terms of the leases.

prime plus 1%, per annum. Principal and interest are due on demand.

5. PROFIT SHARING AND 401(k) SAVINGS PLAN

The Company provides a qualified profit sharing and 401(k) retirement plan
covering substantially all of its full time employees with one full year of
service. The Company's profit sharing contribution is based upon a percentage
of the participants' compensation, determined at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. The Company also matches 75% of employee elected salary
contributions to the plan up to a maximum 4% of annual salary. Participants
become 100% vested in their share of company contributions after three years of
service. Contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31, 1993 and
1992 were $702,042 and $516,392, respectively.

6. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Insurance Corporation. Other funds of the Company, those described as cash
equivalents, are uninsured. In the aggregate the Company had uninsured cash
balances of $2,367,585 and $3,107,537 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,

The Company leases its facilities in Pasadena, California under a noncancellable
ten year operating lease agreement. The lease expires in 1999 with two
five-year options to renew. At the inception of the lease the Company was
granted an incentive of several months free rent. Rent expense is being

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS ACTIVITY

Provident Investment Counsel (the Company) acts as a discretionary
investment manager and is registered under the Investment Advisors Act of
1940.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Investment management fees are a function of portfolio values under
management. Income is recognized in the period for which advisory services
are provided. Accounts receivable are considered fully collectable as of
September 30, 1994.

INVESTMENTS

Investments are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using both
declining and straight-line methods over their estimated useful lives, which
range from three to ten years. Depreciation expense was $509,712
(unaudited) and $605,347 (audited) for the nine months ended September 30,
1994 and the year ended December 31, 1993, respectively.

INCOME TAXES

In 1989, the Company elected to be treated as a Small Business Corporation
for both federal and California income tax purposes. Under this arrangement
the Corporation's stockholders are taxed directly on the Corporation's
taxable income for federal and state purposes. Therefore, a provision has
been made only for an additional California franchise tax imposed at the
corporate level.

The Company provides for the income tax effect of transactions reported in
the financial statements. The provision includes only taxes currently due.
The tax effect of temporary differences between book and taxable income are
immaterial to the financial statements and therefore no deferred taxes have
been recognized.

A new method of computing deferred income taxes was adopted beginning with
the year ended December 31, 1993, as mandated by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). The
cumulative effect of this change is included in net income for the year
ended December 31, 1993, and is not considered to be material to these
financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

For the statement of cash flows, the Company defines cash equivalents as
short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to
cash, and so near to maturity that the risk of changes in value because of
interest rate fluctuations is insignificant.

CURRENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"). SFAS 115 requires
that investments be classified as "held to maturity", "available for sale"
or "trading securities". The statement defines investments in securities as
"held to maturity" based upon a positive intent and ability to hold those
securities to maturity. Investments held to maturity would be reported at
amortized cost. Debt and equity securities that are bought and held
principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified
as "trading securities" and would be reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses included in operations. Equity and debt securities not
classified as "held to maturity" or "trading securities" are classified as
"available for sale" and would be recorded at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. SFAS 115 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1993. The Company does not believe that the
implementation of SFAS 115 will have a material effect on the financial
statements.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in the December 31, 1993 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the September 30, 1994 presentation.

2. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash balances held in banks are insured up to $100,000 by the Federal
Depository Insurance Corporation. Other funds of the Company, those
described as cash equivalents, are uninsured. In the aggregate, the Company
had uninsured cash balances of $25,244,734 (unaudited) and $2,367,585
(audited) at September 30, 1994 and December 31, 1993, respectively.

Supplemental disclosures of cash flow information are:

NONCASH FINANCING ACTIVITIES

During fiscal 1993, the Company declared a total of $4,443,166 (audited)
in dividends, of which $1,943,166 (audited) was paid as of December 31,
1993. No dividends have been declared for the nine months ended September
30, 1994.

Common stocks 56,694 55,030
------- -------
$ 776,041 $ 698,778
------- -------
------- -------

</TABLE>

The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in limited
partnerships. Under this method, investments are originally stated at cost
and adjusted for the Company's share of earnings or losses and distributions
as reported by the general partners. These limited partnerships are for a
specified term at which time any cash or stock held by the partnerships will
be distributed to the partners. Management believes the recorded value of
the partnership interests are not materially different from the fair market
value of these investments. The aggregate cost of the mutual funds, hedge
fund and common stock approximate fair market value.

6. OTHER RECEIVABLES

At September 30, 1994, the Company had a receivable of $433,500 (unaudited)
from Arthur J. Gallagher for indemnification of an errors and omissions loss
in excess of its deductible. The Company's management believes that the
receivable is fully collectible as of September 30, 1994.

7. NOTES PAYABLE - STOCKHOLDERS'

At December 1993, certain stockholders made loans to the Company. The loans
required interest payment at prime rate. At September 30, 1994, the loans
have been paid-off.

8. PROFIT SHARING AND 401(k) SAVINGS PLAN

The Company provides a qualified profit sharing and 401(k) retirement plan
(the Plan) covering substantially all of its full time employees with one
full year of service. For fiscal 1994, the Company will match 92.41% of
employee elected salary contributions to the Plan up to a maximum 6% of
annual salary. The Company's profit sharing contribution to the Plan is
based upon a percentage of the participants' compensation, determined at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. Participants become 100% vested in
their share of company contributions after three years of service. Cost
recognized for the Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and the
year ended December 31, 1993 are $755,331 (unaudited) and $702,042
(audited), respectively.

The Company leases its facilities in Pasadena, California under a
noncancellable ten year operating lease agreement. The lease expires in
1999 with two five-year options to renew. At the inception of the lease the
Company was granted an incentive of several months free rent. The lease
incentive is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin
No. 88-1 "Issues relating to Accounting for Leases". As of
September 30, 1994, the difference between future minimum rentals and future
expense recognizable was $654,325 (unaudited) and has been recorded as a
lease incentive. The Company also subleases additional space under a
noncancellable operating lease agreements which expires in 1996. Rent
expense under these agreements amounted to $686,122 (unaudited) and $742,970

the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and $2.06 based on a pro

These amounts have been calculated by dividing total amortization by
the same number of shares used in the fully diluted earnings per share
calculation.

December 31, 1993

NOTE 1

The pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared to reflect
the pending acquisitions of JMB and PIC, which are being accounted for as
purchases. The actual purchase price of JMB and PIC will be based on an
annualized level of revenues as of each respective date of acquisition. For
purposes of the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet, the purchase prices
of JMB and PIC, as contemplated in each of the respective acquisition
agreements, have been adjusted to give effect to the level of annualized
revenues at December 31, 1993. The allocation of the purchase price to
identifiable assets and liabilities based on their fair values has not been
completed for either acquisition.

Pro forma adjustments have been made to reflect:

(a) the net assets to be acquired in connection with the acquisitions of JMB
and PIC.

(b) the purchase prices ascribed to the contracts acquired at JMB and PIC as of
the acquisition date. It is assumed that the historical carrying value of
all assets, other than the value of contracts acquired, is equal to the
fair value of those assets at the date of acquisitions.

(c) the assumed borrowing under UAM's Amended and Restated Reducing Credit
Agreement in an amount equal to the portion of the consideration paid in
cash for the businesses being acquired and to key employees for signing
long-term employment contracts.

(d) the issuance to JMB and PIC of 6.5% seven year subordinated notes.

(e) the elimination of JMB's and PIC's stockholders' equity in consolidation.

(f) the value of common stock to be issued in connection with the acquisition
of PIC.

(g) the estimated value of the UAM warrants to be issued to JMB and PIC.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS

(Unaudited)
For the Year Ended December 31, 1993

NOTE 1

The pro forma condensed combined statement of operations has been prepared
to reflect the pending acquisitions of JMB and PIC, which are being accounted
for as purchases, as if the acquisitions were consummated on January 1, 1993.
The actual purchase price of JMB and PIC will be based on an annualized level of
revenues as of each respective date of acquisition. For purposes of the pro
forma condensed combined statement of operations, the purchase prices of JMB and
PIC, as contemplated in each of the respective acquisition agreements, have been
adjusted to give effect to the level of annualized revenues at January 1, 1993.
The allocation of the purchase price to identifiable assets and liabilities
based on their fair values has not been completed for either acquisition.

Pro forma adjustments have been made to reflect the following:

(a) Historical compensation expenses of JMB and PIC were adjusted to
reflect the terms of the Revenue Sharing Agreement that will be entered into by
UAM and JMB and by UAM, PIC and PIC's principal employees. These agreements
require the companies to remit a specified percentage of their revenues to UAM,
with the difference being retained to pay compensation and other operating
expenses.

(b) Historical amortization of cost assigned to contracts acquired was
adjusted to reflect the amortization of the incremental contract values of the
cost assigned to contracts to be acquired in the JMB and PIC acquisitions.
Amortization of the incremental values was based on estimated weighted average
lives of 13-16 years.

(c) Historical interest expense was adjusted to reflect the increased
level of borrowings associated with the pending acquisitions of JMB and PIC.
The actual rate of interest of 6.5% on the subordinated notes to be issued to
the sellers of JMB and PIC and an estimated rate of 6.25% on the senior notes
were used to calculate the pro forma adjustments.

(d) Historical income tax expense was adjusted to reflect the change in
pre-tax income on a pro forma basis resulting from the inclusion of the
businesses to be acquired in the consolidated income tax returns of UAM.

P-7
<PAGE>

NOTE 2

Per share data are based upon the actual number of common and common
equivalent shares for the year ended December 31, 1993, plus the common stock
and common stock equivalents to be issued in connection with the pending
acquisitions of JMB and PIC. Pro forma net income has been adjusted in the
computation of earnings per share to give effect to the application of the
modified treasury stock method.

(c) ADJUSTMENT AT FIRST CLOSING. At the First Closing, the Sellers
will deliver to Heitman a revised Schedule 1.3A (the "Closing Date Schedule") as
of the close of business on the last business day before the First Closing
prepared as follows:

(i) The Closing Date Schedule will be adjusted so as to reduce pro forma
annual billings with respect to all clients that have terminated in
whole or in part their investment advisory or property management
relationship with the Business, or that, to the knowledge of any of
the Sellers, have expressed to any of the Sellers or their
Affiliates (orally or in writing) their intention to terminate that
relationship in whole or in part (the parties agreeing that in the
case of a client which is not a separate account client, an
expression of an intention to terminate does not include such
expressions from a participant in such client which participant does
not have the authority to terminate such relationship, unless that
number of participants, which, in the aggregate, would have the
ability to cause such termination have expressed an intention to
terminate the relationship) or have directed the Sellers or their
Affiliates to sell one or more properties and to distribute the
proceeds to the client and not reinvest such proceeds or a request
to transfer the management of one or more assets to another manager.
UAM and Heitman acknowledge that one or more accounts for the client
named on Schedule 1.3(d) hereto, are in the process of an orderly
liquidation of properties held by them and that, unless the Sellers'
instructions with respect to such account change or they are
notified that the client intends to terminate the real estate
investment advisory agreement between it and its advisor , the
Closing Date Schedule shall reflect all revenues attributable to
such advisory agreement on the Original Schedule except for those
attributable to assets under management for the client named on
Schedule 1.3(d) hereto which are actually sold or otherwise disposed
of prior to the First Closing Date. The amount of the reduction in
pro forma annual billings hereunder shall reflect the investment fee
basis of the assets with respect to which asset management has been
terminated or proposed to be terminated (as described above), the
annualized billings of properties as to which property management
has been terminated or proposed to be terminated (as described
above), and the fee rates or other fee payment provisions under the
applicable Investment Advisory and Property Management Contract, all
as reflected on the Original Schedule.

(ii) The Closing Date Schedule will be adjusted so as to increase pro
forma annual billings for clients that have placed assets under
management by the

5

<PAGE>

Business and have entered into Investment Advisory and/or Property
Management Contracts (including existing clients on the date hereof
who have placed additional assets under management, whether under
existing or new investment advisory contracts and/or property
management contracts). The amount of the increase shall likewise
reflect the value of the assets with respect to which asset
management has commenced, the annualized billings of the properties
as to which property management has commenced (which shall be based
on the pro forma annualized budget prepared on a basis consistent
with the Original Schedule), and the fee rates and other fee payment
provisions under the applicable Investment Advisory and Property
Management Contracts.

(iii) The Closing Date Schedule shall incorporate in the calculation of
pro forma annual billings any fee reductions or concessions granted
to any clients of the Business since the date hereof.

(iv) The Closing Date Schedule shall not reflect fluctuations in the
market value of assets under management (but shall reflect
additional capital expenditures to the extent that such expenditures
result in an increase in the value of the assets under management
for the purposes of billing the relevant client(s)) since July 1,
1994 or increases (if any) in the Business's fee rates subsequent to
that date.

(v) The Closing Date Schedule shall assume that pro forma annualized
revenues from clients of PRA Securities Advisors L.P. ("PRA") are as
set forth on Schedule 1.3(b).

The investment advisory agreements, partnership agreements providing for payment
of an investment advisory fee, partnership agreements for Institutional
Apartments I, L.P. and Institutional Apartments II, L.P. and property management
agreements identified on the Original Schedule and the Closing Date Schedule are
referred to herein collectively as the "Investment Advisory Contracts" and the
"Property Management Contracts," as appropriate. Pro forma annual billings
shown on the Closing Date Schedule are referred to as "Assigned Annual
Billings." If Assigned Annual Billings are less than Base Annual Billings, the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of such shortfall multiplied by
the multiple set forth on Schedule 1.3(c) hereto (the "Multiple"). If Assigned
Annual Billings are equal to or exceed Base Annual Billings, there shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price at the First Closing.

(d) ADJUSTMENT FOR DECREASED EXPENSES If a client other than
any Fund advised by PRA terminates its investment advisory or property
management relationship with the Business prior to the First Closing and such
termination has resulted in a

6

<PAGE>

reduction in the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.3(c) above, the Purchase
Price shall be increased by the amount of Demonstrable Savings (as defined
below) times the Multiple, but in no event shall such increase exceed the
decrease in Purchase Price with respect to such terminated contracts under
Section 1.3(c). For purposes hereof, the term "Demonstrable Savings" shall mean
the annualized direct cash expenses of the Business that the Sellers are able to
reasonably demonstrate to UAM and Heitman will be saved as a result of such
termination provided, however, that, for the purposes of any adjustment provided
for in this Section 1.3 hereof, Demonstrable Savings with respect to the client
listed on the Original Schedule which on the date hereof does not have a written
Investment Advisory Contract with the Business, shall be deemed to be $400,000.
If the Sellers are able to demonstrate Demonstrable Savings at the Second
Closing which they were unable to demonstrate at the First Closing, the Purchase
Price shall be increased at the Second Closing by the amount of such
Demonstrable Savings times the Multiple, but in no event shall such increase
exceed the decrease in Purchase Price with respect to such terminated contracts
under Section 1.3(c).

(e) ADJUSTMENT AT SECOND CLOSING. At the Second Closing, the
Sellers shall deliver to Heitman a revised Schedule 1.3A (the "Revised Closing
Date Schedule"), which shall be in all respects identical to the Closing Date
Schedule except as follows:

(i) Any of the adjustments called for by Section 1.3(c)(i), (ii) (iii)
and (iv) above with respect to separate account clients of PRA shall
be reflected on the Revised Closing Date Schedule;

(ii) If the New Fund Agreement (as defined in Section 7.7 below) has been
approved by the shareholders of PRA Securities Trust at the meeting
called for such purpose pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof, pro forma
annual revenues for such trust shall be included based on assets
under management on December 31, 1994;

(iii) If a PRA-sponsored Fund has entered into an Advisory Contract with a
Heitman subsidiary, as of the Second Closing Date, such Schedule
shall include pro forma annual revenues for such Fund based on
assets under management on the Second Closing Date; and

(iv) If the New Fund Agreement has not been so approved, pro forma annual
revenues from PRA Securities Trust shall be excluded from the
Revised Closing Date Schedule.

Pro forma annual billings shown on the Revised Closing Date Schedule are
referred to as "Second Closing Assigned Annual Billings." If Second Closing
Assigned Annual Billings are less than Base Annual Billings the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the amount of such shortfall multiplied by the Multiple. If
Second Closing Assigned Annual Billings exceed

7
<PAGE>

Base Annual Billings , there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 1.3(e).

(f) POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS.

(i) If, as a result of adjustments to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Sections 1.3 (c),(d) and (e), the Purchase Price is reduced below
$220,000,000 in aggregate of Short-Term Portion and Long-Term Portion, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount calculated in the following
manner:

(1) The parties shall prepare a list (Schedule 1.3B) as of
December 31, 1994 showing the amount of any increase in annualized investment
advisory and property management fees (excluding transaction fees) resulting
from the consummation prior to December 31, 1994 of any of the property
acquisition transactions listed on Schedule 1.3(f) hereto and the amount of any
decrease in annualized investment advisory and property management fees
(excluding transaction fees) of the Business resulting from the disposition of
any property (other than property dispositions reflected on the Closing Date
Schedule or the Revised Closing Date Schedule) on or prior to December 31, 1994.
The net increase in revenues shown on Schedule 1.3B, if any, is referred to as
the "Post Closing Revenue."

(2) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of
the Post Closing Revenue, if any, multiplied by the Multiple, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that in no event shall the Purchase Price exceed $220,000,000.

(ii) As of the date which is 150 days after the date hereof, the
Sellers shall prepare a list of all separate account clients which have not
delivered a signed Client's Consent. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
amount of pro forma annual billings shown on the Revised Closing Date Schedule
for all such clients multiplied by the Multiple. In addition, if any client for
which there is not on the date hereof a written Investment Advisory Contract
shall not have executed and delivered an Investment Advisory Contract with the
Business and a signed Client's Consent as of such date, the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the amount of pro forma annual billings shown on the Revised
Closing Date Schedule for such client multiplied by the Multiple.

(iii) Any net increase in the Purchase Price payable as a result
of the application of subsections (i) and (ii) of this Section 1.3(f) shall be
paid by delivery of the amount of such adjustment, in Short Term Portion, Long-
Term Portion and Warrant (allocated 50% to the shares with an exercise price of
$46.00 and 50% to the shares with an exercise price of $46.40) pro rata based on
the relative amounts set forth in Section 1.2 above, by UAM on or before the
date which is 180 days after the date hereof. Any net reduction in the Purchase
Price payable as a result of the application of this Section 1.3(f) shall be
paid by redelivery from the Sellers to UAM of the amount of such adjustment, in
Short-Term Portion, Long-Term Portion and Warrant (allocated 50% to the shares
with an

8

<PAGE>

exercise price of $46.00 and 50% to the shares with an exercise price of $46.40)
on or before the date which is 180 days after the date hereof.

(iv) The parties agree that if there is a reduction in the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.3(f)(ii) hereof by reason of the failure of
any client to deliver an executed Client's Consent within 150 days after the
date hereof, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, UAM shall pay to the
Sellers, for a period of three years from the date of the First Closing, an
amount which is equal to 30% of the annual investment advisory fees (but not any
property management fees) actually earned after the First Closing from any such
non-consenting client by Heitman or any entity controlled by Heitman on account
of assets under management by the Business for such client as of the First
Closing Date payable in cash within thirty days of the receipt of any such fees
by Heitman or an entity controlled by Heitman.

(g) EXAMPLE. An example of the operation of this Section 1.3 is
set forth on Schedule 1.3C hereto.

1.4 OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED BY UAM AND HEITMAN. As further consideration
for the sale of the Purchased Assets by the Sellers to Heitman and subject to
the provisions of Article VIII hereof, Heitman agrees, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, to assume at the First Closing all
obligations of the Sellers to perform or provide services after the First
Closing Date under the Investment Advisory Contracts, the Property Management
Contracts, and the contracts, leases and other agreements listed on the
Schedules to Section 1.1, and the accrued liabilities identified on Schedule 1.5
hereto, to the extent the same shall exist on the First Closing Date (the
"Assumed Obligations"). Except as described in the preceding sentence, nothing
in this Agreement or any Related Agreement (as defined herein) shall require UAM
or Heitman to assume, and UAM and Heitman do not assume, any liabilities or
obligations of the Sellers to any person or entity.

1.5 ACCRUED ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE. At the First Closing, prepaid
and accrued items of income and expense with respect to the Business identified
on Schedule 1.5 shall be allocated to the Sellers with respect to all periods on
or prior to the First Closing and to Heitman and/or its designated subsidiaries
with respect to all periods after the First Closing. Except as set forth on
Schedule 1.5 hereto, such prepaid and accrued items of income and expense shall
be determined as of the First Closing Date in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, provided, however, except as set forth on Schedule 1.5
hereto that all transaction fees with respect to transactions which close on or
after October 13, 1994 shall be allocated to Heitman or its designated
subsidiaries. If the amount of prepaid items allocated to Heitman and/or its
designated subsidiaries falls short of the amount of accrued items so allocated,
the cash to be delivered to Heitman and UAM under Section 1.1(j) above shall be
increased by the amount of such shortfall. If the amount of prepaid items
allocated to Heitman and/or its designated subsidiaries exceeds the amount of

excess in cash.

securities to the Sellers is exempt from the registration and prospectus
delivery requirements of the Securities Act and from qualification under any
applicable state securities laws, and that such exemptions are based on the
representations and warranties made herein.

The Sellers are acquiring the Note and Warrant for their own account and
not for that of any other persons, and without a view to or in connection with
any distribution thereof which is proscribed by the Securities Act or any rule
or regulation thereunder or in violation of any applicable state securities
laws.

None of the Sellers shall offer, sell or otherwise dispose of the Note and
Warrant except in conformity with Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission or pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act and
qualification under applicable state securities laws or pursuant to an opinion
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to UAM that such registration and
qualification is not required. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Note
and Warrant shall be endorsed with the legends set forth in Exhibit A and D
hereto.

UAM may require as a condition precedent to any proposed offer, sale,
transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Note and Warrant by
the Sellers other than in conformity with Rule 144 of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities
Act that the proposed transferee first sign, seal and deliver to UAM an
investment agreement with respect to the securities to be offered, sold,
transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of containing
substantially the agreements, representations and warranties set forth in this
Section 3.30.

Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993; its proxy statement in
connection with its annual meeting of May 19, 1994; and its Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 1994, and June 30, 1994. Each
of the Sellers represents to UAM (i) that they have reviewed such reports and
statements; (ii) that they have been afforded the opportunity to ask questions
and receive answers concerning the terms and

27

<PAGE>

conditions of the offering of the Note and Warrant hereby and to obtain any
additional information that UAM possesses or can acquire without unreasonable
effort or expense that is necessary to verify any of the information contained
in any such reports and statements; and (iii) that they have such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that they are capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of an investment in UAM.

licenses, permits and authorizations which are held or used by the Sellers,
Purchased Corporations, Subsidiary Partnerships or Purchased Partnerships in the
conduct of the Business, except for licenses, permits and authorizations issued

License would not have a material adverse effect on the Business. Each of the
Sellers, Purchased Corporations, Subsidiary Partnerships or Purchased
Partnerships, as appropriate, has complied with all conditions or requirements
imposed by the Operating Licenses described on Schedule 3.31, except where
failure to so comply would not be materially adverse to the Business, and none
of the Sellers, Purchased Corporations, Subsidiary Partnerships or Purchased
Partnerships has received any notice, nor have any of the Sellers, Purchased
Corporations, Purchased Partnerships or Subsidiary Partnerships any reason to
believe, that any appropriate authority intends to cancel or terminate any of
such Operating Licenses or that valid grounds for such cancellation or
termination currently exist (exclusive of any such Operating License where
cancellation or termination thereof would not have a material adverse effect on
the Business).

3.32 POOLED INVESTMENT VEHICLES. Correct and complete copies of all

for severance obligations of UAM, Heitman or their Affiliates
arising from their contractual obligations to any such employee or
policies or employee benefit programs or for any statutory
requirement; or

Heitman or any of its Affiliates pursuant hereto.

4.2 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and
warranties of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement and referred to in
Section 4.1 above shall survive the First Closing for two years (except that the
representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth in Section 3.8 (TAXES)
and 3.21 (EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS) of this Agreement shall survive the First
Closing for seven years) notwithstanding the establishment of a shorter period
by any applicable statute of limitations, the provisions of which are hereby
waived, provided that liability with respect to any representation or warranty
as to which a claim is made within such two-year and seven-year periods, as
applicable, shall continue until finally determined and paid.

The representations and warranties of UAM and Heitman set forth in this
Agreement and referred to in Article V shall survive the First Closing for two
years notwithstanding the establishment of a shorter period by any applicable
statute of limitations, the provisions of which are hereby waived, provided that
liability with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
as to which a claim is made within such two-year period shall continue until
finally determined and paid.

Each claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article IV shall be made in
writing and shall set forth specifically the facts claimed to give rise to
indemnification and the

30

<PAGE>

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements claimed to be false or to
have not been fulfilled, and the damages claimed as a result thereof.

4.3 THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. Should any claim be made or suit or proceeding
be instituted against a party entitled to indemnification hereunder (an
"Indemnified Party") which, if valid or prosecuted successfully, would be a
matter for which they are entitled to be defended, saved harmless or indemnified
under this Agreement (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall notify
the parties responsible for such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Parties") in
writing concerning the same promptly after the assertion or commencement
thereof.

The Indemnifying Parties shall control the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties, against
the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties shall use their best
efforts to defeat or minimize any loss resulting from such Third-Party Claim.
The Indemnified Parties shall use their best efforts to minimize any Loss
resulting from any such Third Party Claim, provided, however, that the
provisions of this sentence shall not require an Indemnified Party to take any
action which might interfere with its relationship with a client. The
Indemnifying Parties shall provide the Indemnified Parties with such information
and opportunity for consultation as may reasonably be requested by the
Indemnified Parties, and either they or any of them shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of a Third-Party Claim and to engage counsel for such
purpose at the expense of such Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Parties
shall have the right to settle Third-Party Claims against the Indemnified
Parties on terms which are judged reasonable by the Indemnifying Parties and
such settlements shall be binding upon the Indemnified Parties and the
Indemnifying Parties for purposes of indemnification under this Agreement,
provided that the Indemnified Parties have been held harmless against or
indemnified for amounts agreed to be paid or amounts paid in such settlement.
No Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim
against it except with the consent of the Indemnifying Parties, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld where the settlement of such claim does not
involve the payment of money damages or the admission of any liability or guilt
on the part of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Parties shall in any
event render all such assistance as the Indemnifying Parties shall reasonably
request in the defense of any Third-Party Claim. All costs and expenses
incurred by the Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Parties in connection
with the defense of a Third-Party Claim shall upon demand be paid by the
Indemnifying Parties.

The amount for which any Indemnifying Parties shall be liable in respect of
any Third-Party Claim shall be reduced to the extent that the Indemnified
Parties or any Affiliate thereof shall realize any net proceeds recovered from
insurers with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

4.4 SET-OFF. Subject to the provisions of Section 4.6 below, any amount
or amounts owing from the Indemnitors to UAM and/or Heitman under this Article
IV may be

the Sellers under this Agreement and the Related Agreements, to the extent such
amounts are sufficient, without prejudice to UAM's or Heitman's right to pursue
any other remedies at law or in equity in the event such amounts are
insufficient, and without prejudice to the rights of any such Seller to
contribution from or indemnification by any other Seller.

4.5 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnitors shall have no liability under this Article IV to indemnify UAM
and/or Heitman for any Loss unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses
to UAM and Heitman exceeds two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), in which
event UAM and Heitman shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to the
full amount of such Losses determined without reference to such limitation.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article IV, the Indemnitors'
aggregate liability under this Article IV shall not exceed the total amount of
the Purchase Price paid to the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement.

4.6 ORDER OF PAYMENT Without prejudice to UAM's and Heitman's right to
seek indemnification from any and all of the Indemnitors, UAM and Heitman agree
that they will seek payment due under this Article IV first by set-off against
the Note as permitted by Section 4.4, and then, to the extent such amounts are
insufficient, from JMBRC. If JMBRC does not pay the full balance due under this
Article IV within 30 days of receiving a written demand from UAM or Heitman, UAM
and/or Heitman shall upon demand be paid by the Indemnitors. The aggregate
obligation of any Indemnitor under this Article IV shall be limited to such
Indemnitor's pro rata portion of the Purchase Price, based on such Indemnitor's
percentage ownership of the Purchased Assets set forth on Schedule 1, the
parties agreeing that for the purposes of determining the Indemnitors' pro rata
liability under this Article IV, the members of each control group specified on
Schedule 1 shall be aggregated and treated as one Indemnitor and the liability
within each such control group shall be joint and several as to such control
group's pro rata obligation hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Article IV, no Indemnitor shall have any liability for a
breach of any covenant set forth in Sections 11.1 or 11.2 of this Agreement by
any other Seller following the First Closing. Notwithstanding anything else

Heitman under this Agreement or any exhibit, schedule or certificate or other
document furnished in connection herewith.

32

in writing and shall set forth specifically the facts claimed to give rise to
indemnification and the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
claimed to be inaccurate or to have been breached, and the damages claimed as a
result of such breach.

Closing, with respect to any breach or violation of any representation or
warranty (including without limitation those set forth in Sections III and V
hereof) or any covenant, obligation or other term set forth in this Agreement,
other than a breach or violation of the covenants and terms of Sections 11.1 and
11.2 hereof, the only relief and remedy available to the party indemnified for
such breach in respect of such breach shall be (a) damages, but only to the
extent properly claimable hereunder and as limited pursuant to this Article IV;
(b) specific performance if a court of competent jurisdiction in its discretion
grants the same; or (c) injunctive or declaratory relief if a court of competent
jurisdiction in its discretion grants the same.

acknowledges that as of the date the securities included in the Purchased Assets
are assigned to Heitman, such securities will not have not been registered under
the Securities Act or qualified under any applicable state securities law, on
the ground that the transfer of such securities to Heitman (or its designee) is
exempt from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the
Securities Act and from qualification under any applicable state securities
laws, and that such exemptions are based on the representations and warranties
made herein.

Heitman (or its designee) is acquiring the securities for its own account
and not for that of any other persons, and without a view to or in connection
with any distribution thereof which is proscribed by the Securities Act or any

which are investment advisory clients of the Business have terminated investment
advisory arrangements with Heitman (or any Affiliate) or have made claims
against Heitman (or any Affiliate) in connection with any investment advisory
arrangements with Heitman (or any Affiliate). There are no threatened claims or
disputes involving any investment advisory clients of Heitman (or any Affiliate)

36

<PAGE>

which are also clients of the Business regarding any investment advisory
arrangements with Heitman (or any Affiliate). Neither UAM nor Heitman have any
knowledge of any prospective termination of any investment advisory arrangement
with Heitman (or any Affiliate) by a client of Heitman (or any Affiliate) which
is also a client of the Business or any withdrawal of assets by any such client
from management by Heitman (or any Affiliate) or any proposed reduction by any
such client in any existing fee rate payable in connection with an investment
advisory arrangement with Heitman (or an Affiliate). As used in this Section
5.15, the term "client" shall include the participants of any client which is a
commingled fund.

5.16 INTENT OF UAM AND HEITMAN. Each of UAM and Heitman acknowledges and
agrees that it intends for Heitman and its subsidiaries to own and operate the
Purchased Assets as part of their on-going business and that it has no present
intention of reselling the Purchased Assets in whole or substantially in part.

5.17 NO ADVERSE CHANGE. Since June 30, 1994, there has been no material
adverse change in the financial condition or results of operations of UAM or
Heitman, and neither UAM nor Heitman is aware of any fact or condition in
existence today (but exclusive of general trends in the real property management
industry and the general condition of the economy of the United States) which it
believes would cause any such change in the foreseeable future.

Article VI. TAX MATTERS.

37

<PAGE>

appraiser selected by UAM as and to the extent deemed necessary by UAM, at UAM's
sole expense, beginning as soon as practicable after the date hereof. The
Sellers shall cooperate fully with any such appraisal. The parties acknowledge
that the Purchase Price allocated to Purchased Assets that constitute

Realty Advisors for tax purposes as a purchase of all of the assets of JMB
Institutional Realty Advisors, Inc. , followed by a complete liquidation
thereof. None of the Sellers, directly or indirectly have taken or will take any
action which might disqualify the parties from making such election under the
Code as of the First Closing Date.

6.5 TREATMENT AS AN ASSET ACQUISITION The parties hereto intend that,
to the extent permitted by applicable law (including regulations), the purchase
and sale of the Purchased Assets as described in this Agreement shall be
treated, for purposes of federal income taxation, as the taxable acquisition of
assets, either directly or as deemed acquisitions under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code in the case of the stock of JMB Institutional Realty Advisors , Inc.,
or pursuant to Sections 708 and/or 754 of the Code in the case of the
Partnership Interests or Subsidiary Partnerships and the Sellers will cooperate
with UAM and Heitman in any way necessary, including the filing of appropriate
elections under the Code, to effectuate this intent. In any case where a
Purchased Corporation, Purchased Partnership or a Subsidiary Partnership also

Partnership or Subsidiary Partnership, and parties hereto will take no position
inconsistent with such treatment on any tax return or report.

6.6 SELLERS' RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAX LIABILITIES. The Sellers shall pay
all tax liabilities of the Business for all periods prior to and including the
First Closing Date and UAM and Heitman shall be responsible for all tax

38

liabilities with respect to PRA Assets for all periods prior to and including
the Second Closing Date and UAM and Heitman shall be responsible for all tax
liabilities of PRA for all periods after the Second Closing Date). UAM and
Heitman, on the one hand, and the Asset Sellers, on the other hand, shall

return affecting the other party with respect to the Business or any contest or
dispute with any taxing authority in respect of any such tax return.

UAM shall give the Sellers prompt notice of the commencement of any audit
or examination by any taxing authority of any tax return of a Purchased
Partnership, Subsidiary Partnership or Purchased Corporation for any taxable
period beginning prior to the First Closing Date.

At its own expense, and with counsel chosen by it, the Sellers may assume
the defense of any such audit or examination, and shall, upon such assumption,
have the sole right to defend and contest such audit or examination and to
settle or compromise all or any portion of the issues raised or tax deficiencies
asserted by such taxing authority in connection with such audit or examination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall consult with UAM as to all tax
matters that affect UAM or Heitman and arise from the period prior to and
including the First Closing Date (or the Second Closing Date, as applicable).

authorized representative in connection with any such audit or examination.

6.7 IDENTITY OF PURCHASER. The parties hereto intend that for federal
and state income tax purposes, UAM shall be treated as the purchaser of all of
the Purchased Assets, and in the case of Purchased Assets that are transferred
by the Sellers at the direction of UAM to a direct or indirect subsidiary of
UAM, the parties hereto intend that for federal and state income tax purposes,
UAM will be treated as purchasing such assets and transferring them to Heitman,
which shall, if applicable, be treated as transferring such Purchased Assets to
its subsidiaries, with the transfer reported by each applicable indirect
subsidiary of UAM to which UAM directed the applicable Seller to transfer such
Purchased Assets. The parties hereto will take no position inconsistent with
the preceding sentence on any tax return or report.

heretofore defined. For purposes hereof, the term "Institutional Investor"
shall mean any employee retirement or benefit plan, endowment, foundation,
charitable organization or other tax exempt entity and other entities of
the type to which the Business now provides real estate investment advisory
services, which entity has total assets in excess of $20,000,000. The
parties agree that TIAA/CREFF is not an "Institutional Investor" and an
entity unaffiliated with a Non-compete Seller which is not otherwise an
Institutional Investor will not be deemed an Institutional Investor merely
because any of its partners, investors or shareholders are Instituional
Investors, provided that the decision to invest with a Non-compete Seller
is not made by such Non-compete Sellers, partners, investors or
shareholders and provided further that the Non-compete Seller is not
involved directly or indirectly in raising investments in such entity
through the use of such Non-compete Seller's name or reputation. A Non-
compete Seller may enter into joint ventures with insurance companies so
long as such Non-compete Seller is not providing, directly or indirectly,
real estate investment advisory or property management services.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 11.1(a), a Non-
compete Seller or his Affiliates may enter into real estate investments in
any form with any Institutional Investor which would otherwise be
prohibited by Section 11.1(a), including without limitation any
Institutional Investor which is a party to an

50

<PAGE>

Investment Advisory Contract and/or Property Management Contract, so long
as (i) such Non-compete Seller or his Affiliates makes at least a 10% Cash
Investment, as defined below, (ii) no Asset Management Fee, as defined
below, is paid to any Non-compete Seller or his Affiliates (other than
Heitman or its subsidiary) in connection with such investment or the
ongoing operations of any entity created for the purpose of such
investment, (iii) no property management fee is paid to any Non-compete
Seller or his Affiliate in connection with such investment, (iv) the Non-
compete Seller or his Affiliates use their best reasonable efforts
(subject to the rights of any joint venturer, co-owner or other investor)
to cause the investors to retain Heitman or an affiliate of Heitman to
provide property management services in connection with such investment
and, (v) no investment advisory fee is paid to any person or entity
(subject to the rights of any joint venturer, co-owner or other investor).
Furthermore, the parties agree that nothing in this Section 11.1 shall
prohibit any Non-compete Seller from entering into any real estate
investment with any Institutional Investor so long as Heitman or one of its
subsidiaries is engaged as investment advisor and property manager with
respect thereto. A "10% Cash Investment" shall mean cash invested in the
investment in an amount equal to 10% of the total funds invested as equity
by Institutional Investors ("invested as equity by Institutional Investors"
shall exclude debt from Insitutional Investors where the debt would
reasonably be considered debt for federal income tax and state law
purposes), provided, however, that if Institutional Investors invest any
funds in a form other than equity such cash investment must be in an amount
equal to the greater of 10% of the total funds invested as equity by
Institutional Investors or 4% of all funds invested in the investment as
either debt or equity. The term "Asset Management Fee" shall mean any
guaranteed payment or fee of any kind or any distribution (other than a
distribution of sale or refinancing proceeds) which is prior in time to
distributions to Institutional Investors, excluding reimbursed actual out-
of-pocket expenses. An Asset Managment Fee shall not include (x) any
payment (including distributions) in an amount which is disproportionate to
the payee's capital investment in such entity, the amount of which payment
is based on net cash flow of the entity after payment of all expenses and
interest of the entity, or (y) any payment (including distributions) in an
amount which is disproportionate to the payee's capital investment in such
entity, the amount of which payment is based on the proceeds from the sale
or refinancing of assets of the entity, or (z) an Acquistiion Fee as
defined below or any tax allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
connection with any investment which is otherwise subject to this Section
11.1(c), a Non-compete Seller may receive any payment or fee from an
Institutional Investor, in an amount which is disproportionate to the
payee's capital investment in such entity, made in connection with the
formation of such entity or acquisition of assets of an entity (an
"Acquisition Fee"), provided that within 30 days of payment of any
Acquistion Fee in connection with any such investment, the Non-compete
Seller shall pay to UAM or Heitman that amount which equals 20% of such
Acquisition Fee. Within a reasonable time prior to making any such
investment, the Non-compete Seller shall notify UAM of his intention to do
so and

51

<PAGE>

provide UAM with a brief summary of the terms of such investment
(excluding identification of the specific property or asset involved) and a
description of any Asset Management Fees which might be paid in connection
with such investment. The Non-compete Seller shall promptly provide to UAM
such documentation relating to the investment, that reasonably allows UAM
to review all fee arrangements concerning the investment, including the
relevant pages of the partnership agreement for such investment. All such
material shall be kept confidential by UAM.

(d) The parties understand and agree that nothing in this
Section 11.1 shall limit the Non-compete Sellers from partcipating in the
activities identified on Schedule 11.1 hereto.

(e) Each Non-compete Seller agrees that the periods of time and
the unlimited geographic area applicable to the covenants of this
Section 11.1 are reasonable, in view of the payment of the Purchase Price
hereunder, the geographic scope and nature of the Business, the Sellers'
knowledge of the Business, and the Sellers' relationship with the
Business's and its clients. However, if such period or such area should be
adjudged unreasonable in any judicial proceeding, then the period of time
shall be reduced by such number of months or such area shall be reduced by
elimination of such portion of such area, or both, as are deemed
unreasonable, so that this covenant may be enforced in such area and during
such period of time as are adjudged to be reasonable.

11.1A (a) During the longer of six years following the First Closing
Date or while Jerome J. Claeys, III ("Claeys") is employed by Heitman or UAM,
Claeys shall not, except in the course of his employment with Heitman or UAM,

(i) Provide or offer or attempt to provide, whether as an officer,
director,employee, partner, stockholder, consultant, adviser, subsidiary,
affiliate, independent contractor or otherwise, institutional real estate

employee of the Companies to terminate his or her employment, or hire or attempt
to hire, directly or indirectly, any such person.

52

<PAGE>

Claeys' employment with Heitman or UAM, or eight (8) years from the First
Closing Date, Claeys shall not, directly or indirectly:

(i) Provide or offer or attempt to provide, whether as an officer,
director, employee, partner, independent contractor or otherwise, institutional
real estate investment advisory or property management services to any person or
entity who as of the date of the termination or expiration of Claeys' employment
with Heitman or UAM was or had been a Client (which means Past, Present, and
Potential Client);

(ii) Interfere with the Companies' business relations with any person or
entity who as of the date of the termination or expiration of Claeys' employment
with Heitman was a Client (which means Past, Present, and Potential Client); or

(iii) Induce or attempt to induce directly or indirectly any professional
employee of the Companies to terminate his or her employment, or hire or attempt
to hire, directly or indirectly, any such person.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 11.1A(b)(i) above,
Claeys may after the longer of six year term of his employment agreement with
Heitman become employed by a subsequent employer which provides institutional
real estate investment advisory services to one or more Clients if: (1) Claeys
does not directly or indirectly through persons whom he supervises, solicit any
person or entity who was a Client as of the date of the termination of Claeys'
employment with Heitman to become an investment advisory client of the
subsequent employer; (2) Claeys is not directly or indirectly through persons
whom he supervises involved in institutional real estate investment management
on behalf of the subsequent employer for any Client of Heitman or the Business
unless such Client was a client of the subsequent employer for at least one year
prior to the time Claeys commenced working for such subsequent employer; and (3)
the subsequent employer is not a business which Claeys has established,
sponsored or founded, or in which he owns more than a five percent (5%) equity
interest.

(d) Also notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 11.1A(b)(i) above,
if Claeys after the the six year term of his employment agreement with Heitman
becomes employed by an Institutional Manager (as hereinafter defined), Claeys
may provide or offer to provide institutional real estate investment advisory
services, in the course of such subsequent employment, to a Potential Client
provided that Heitman or the Business, through any of its officers or employees,
had not offered to serve as institutional real estate investment adviser to such
Potential Client (by means of a telephone call, personal meeting, or a written
proposal but not by means of any general solicitation) within one year prior to
the date of the termination of Claeys's employment with Heitman, the Business,
or UAM. For purposes hereof, the term "Institutional Manager" shall mean an
insurance company, a bank or an institutional real estate investment advisory
firm that has (at the time such

53
<PAGE>

institutional manager hires Claeys) assets under management in excess of One
Billion Dollars ($1,000,000,000).

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections 11.1A(a)(i) and
11.1A(b)(i), Claeys may render without compensation investment advisory or
property management services to any immediate member of Claeys' family, which
shall include Claeys and any trust or account which is comprised entirely of
assets held for the benefit of Claeys and/or immediate members of his family.
Nothing contained in this Section 11.1A shall prohibit Claeys from owning not
more than 1% of the equity securities of any entity which operates a business
competitive with the business of the Companies, the securities of which are
traded on a national securities exchange or on the National Market System of
NASDAQ.

(f) Claeys and Heitman agree that the periods of time and the unlimited
geographic area applicable to the covenants of this Section 11.1A are
reasonable, in view of the geographic scope and nature of the business in which
Heitman is engaged, Claeys'knowledge of Heitman's business, and Claeys'
relationships with Heitman's institutional real estate investment advisory and
property management clients. However, if such period or such area should be
adjudged unreasonable in any judicial proceeding, then the period of time shall
be reduced by such number of months or such area shall be reduced by elimination
of such portion of such area, or both, as are deemed unreasonable, so that this
covenant may be enforced in such area and during such period of time as are
adjudged to be reasonable.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for
purposes of this Section 11.1A only, the term "Past Client" shall mean at any
particular time any person or entity who at any point during the two years prior
to such time had been but at such time is not an institutional real estate
advisee, investment advisory customer, property management customer, or client
of Heitman or any of the entities owned, in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, by Heitman (the "Companies") or a participant in a pooled investment

particular time any person or entity to whom the Companies, through any of their
officers or employees, has within two years prior to such time offered (by means
of a personal meeting, telephone call, or a letter or written proposal
specifically directed to the particular person or entity) to serve as an
institutional real estate investment adviser or property manager (directly or
indirectly through a pooled investment vehicle) or client of the Companies. The
preceding sentence is meant to exclude form letters and blanket mailings and any
other type of general solicitation. The terms "Client" or "Client List" when
used in this Section 11.1A shall include all Past, Present and Potential Clients

11.2 CONFIDENTIALITY. Except in performance of services for Heitman,
none of the Sellers shall use for his or its own benefit or disclose to or use
for the benefit of any person outside Heitman, any information not already
lawfully available to the public concerning any Intellectual Property (as
defined below), including client lists, whether such person has such information
in his memory or embodied in writing or other tangible form. All such
Intellectual Property and such information concerning Intellectual Property, and
all originals and copies of any Intellectual Property, and any other written
material relating to the Business shall upon First Closing be the sole property
of Heitman and/or its designated subsidiaries; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that subject
to these restrictions on confidentiality, the Sellers (i) may retain a copy of
any book, record, document or other data included in Intellectual Property, and
(ii) after the First Closing, may upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times
copy, at such Seller's expense, any book record, document or other data included
in the Intellectual Property provided that such copying is for a purpose
reasonably related to contractual and/or statutory obligations imposed upon such
Seller. For purposes hereof, the term Intellectual Property shall mean all
research, information, client lists, and all other investment advisory, property
management, technical and research data which related to investment or property
management advice of the Business as it was or is now rendered. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Sellers may continue after the First Closing to use in their
own businesses (both existing and in the future) any Intellectual Property in
substantially the same manner as has been historically used in such businesses,
provided that the conduct of any such business does not in any way otherwise
violate any provision of this Agreement or any of the Related Agreements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Intellectual Property shall not include any
information which (a) is already in the possession of any unaffiliated third
party (provided that such information is not subject to another confidentiality
agreement with or other legal or fiduciary obligation of secrecy to the party to
which the information relates; (b) becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of any obligation of the parties to maintain the
confidentiality of such information; (c) becomes available to an unaffiliated
third party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the party to

confidentiality agreement with or other legal or fiduciary obligation of secrecy
to the party to which the information relates.

11.3 FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time after the First Closing at
the request of UAM or Heitman and without further consideration, the Sellers or
any of them shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered any
further instruments and take such other action as UAM and/or Heitman may
reasonably require to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing
in this section shall be deemed a waiver by UAM or Heitman of its rights under
Article IX of this Agreement or a waiver by any of the Sellers of their rights
under Article X of this Agreement. In addition, from time to time after the
First Closing at the reasonable request of the Sellers, UAM and Heitman shall
execute and deliver,

55
<PAGE>

or cause to be executed and delivered, any further instruments and take such
other action as the Sellers may reasonably require to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

11.4 AMENDMENT TO REGISTRATIONS AND FILING OF FORM 8-K. Each of the
Sellers shall cooperate with UAM and Heitman to file Form 8-K with the
Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of the Sellers shall cooperate with UAM and Heitman in order to
permit UAM to file, if not filed prior to the First Closing Date, all
registrations and amendments to registration or withdrawals of registration
under federal and state laws requiring registration of investment advisers on
behalf of Heitman Advisory Corporation and/or the Business.

11.5 COMPLIANCE WITH HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT. Each of UAM, Heitman and
the Sellers covenant that from and after the First Closing each shall comply
with any applicable provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

11.6 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS. Each of the Sellers shall maintain in good
condition all presently existing files, books, records and documents of the
Business, and shall make the same available to UAM or its designee upon request,
for the periods of time and in the locations required by the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including without
limitation regulation Section 275.204-2.

After the First Closing (or the Second Closing, as applicable) the parties
shall cooperate to comply with Sections 15(f) and 16(b) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as they apply to the Funds listed on Schedule 1.3A as of the
First Closing (or Second Closing) and generally to comply with the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as they apply to
Heitman, the Sellers, UAM and the clients of the Business. In particular, the
parties each agree to use all reasonable efforts to assure compliance with the
conditions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as it applies
to the Funds listed on Schedule 3.26. In that regard, Heitman agrees that: (a)
for a period of not less than three years after the First Closing, it shall use
its best efforts to assure that no more than 25% of the members of the board of
directors or trustees of any such Fund shall be "interested persons" (as defined
in such Act) of the investment adviser of such Fund or predecessor investment
adviser thereto, and (b) Heitman will not take or recommend any action that
would constitute an "unfair burden" within the meaning of Section 15(f) of such
Act on any such investment company.

11.7 PAYMENT OF SIGNING BONUSES. UAM and Heitman agree that Heitman
shall pay to the employees listed on Schedule 11.7 who are entering into
employment agreements with Heitman (or a subsidiary of Heitman) the cash portion

employment agreement.

11.8 PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO RESIDUAL FEE CALCULATIONS. The parties
hereto acknowledge that certain of the Investment Advisory Contracts contain
provisions calling for adjustment of the fees previously paid under such
contracts, as described on Schedule 1.3A. To the extent that any such provision
results in liability to a client of the Business attributable to any period
prior to and including the First Closing Date or payment by any such client of
additional fees attributable to any period prior to and including the First
Closing Date, the parties agree that the annual net amount of any such
liabilities or fees shall be payable by the Sellers to Heitman (if liabilities
exceed fees) or Heitman to the Sellers(if fees exceed liabilities) in cash
within thirty days after the end of each calendar year. For purposes of this
Section 11.8, any such fee adjustment shall be deemed to be attributable to
periods prior to and including the First Closing Date if the applicable period
used under the applicable Investment Advisory Contract for purposes of
calculating such fee adjustment immediately preceding a sale or appraisal of the
applicable property (as set forth in the applicable Investment Advisory
Contract) includes any period prior to and including the First Closing Date,
and, for purposes of determining the allocation of such liabilities or fees, to
the extent of the differential between the fees paid by the client during such
period and the fees that would have been paid if the value of the property had
increased or decreased over such applicable period immediately preceding the
date on which the property was sold or appraised on a straight-line quarterly
basis from the valuation at the beginning of such applicable period to the
actual sale price or appraised value of such property. Heitman covenants that
it will pay to the appropriate client the amount of any liability arising from
the contractual provisions described above which is actually paid by the Sellers
to Heitman.

11.9 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT LIABILITIES . The Sellers shall satisfy or shall
cause , Affiliates to satisfy all liabilities to employees and former employees
of the Business pursuant to each Benefit Plan and all liabilities to
multiemployer plans as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA with respect to
which employees or former employees of the Business participated.

11.10 IDENTIFICATION OF HEITMAN AS PROPERTY MANAGER. At all times after
the First Closing and for so long as Heitman or any of its subsidiaries shall be
a tenant of the office space in the building located at 900 North Michigan
Avenue, Chicago, Illinois or for so long as Sellers or any of their Affiliates
own such building, the Sellers agree that Heitman shall be identified as the
property manager for the office portion of such building.

11.11 OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT TO CERTAIN SALARIED EMPLOYEES. Heitman (or an
affiliate and/or Farrelly Building Services, Inc.) shall offer employment to all
employees employed by the Business which are listed on Schedule 3.17 on the
terms set forth herein. Each employment offer shall be at salary not less than
the current salary paid to each such employee, as set forth on Schedule 3.17.
The Sellers covenant and agree to reasonably cooperate with Heitman to cause
each of the Employees offered employment by Heitman (or an affiliate and/or
Farrelly Building Services, Inc.) to accept such offer and to reasonably

57
<PAGE>

cooperate with Heitman in all respects with the orderly transition of employment
of such Employees.

The Sellers shall or shall cause their Affiliates to continue in the same
manner as for active employees of Sellers and their Affiliates for group life,
accidental death and dismemberment, short term disability, and health (including
dental) coverage under the Group Life Accident & Major Medical Insurance Plan
for Employees of JMB Realty Corporation - Subsidiaries & Affiliates (Plan No.
501) and for group life and long term disability coverage under the Group
Disability & Life Insurance Plan for Employees of JMB Realty Corporation -
Subsidiaries & Affiliates (Plan No. 502) ("Continuation Plans") for each of the
employees of the Sellers and their Affiliates in connection with the Business
who on or after the First Closing are employed by Heitman (or an affiliate or
Farrelly Building Services, Inc.) until the earliest of the following: (i) the
employee's termination of employment with Heitman (or an affiliate or Farrelly
Building Services, Inc.); (ii) after an employee's failure to remit the amount
payable, if any, for such coverage by comparable active employees, which payment
schedule was provided in writing to the employee, the date upon which coverage
would cease because of nonpayment of premiums if the employee were an active
employee of any Seller or any of its Affiliates; (iii) the last day of a month
specified by Heitman in a written notice to Sellers, provided such written
notice is provided at least ten days prior to such date; and (iv) June 30, 1995.
Heitman (or an affiliate and/or Farrelly Building Services, Inc., as applicable)
shall collect from each employee receiving coverage under this Section 11.11 and
submit to Sellers, the amount described in (ii) above, on a pre-tax or after-tax
basis as it shall determine in its sole discretion. Heitman (or an affiliate
and/or Farrelly Building Services, Inc.) shall pay to the Sellers an amount
equal to the sum of the difference with respect to each employee with the
respective coverages between (a) the aggregate base premium (without the 2%
administrative fee) used for purposes of continuation coverage rates under
Section 4980B of the Code and a premium calculated in a similar manner as
mutually agreed upon between the parties for Continuation Plan coverage not
subject to Section 4980B of the Code, to the extent applicable and (b) the
employee's required contribution to the Continuation Plan determined in the same
manner as for comparable active employees of the Sellers and their Affiliates,
to the extent applicable. To the extent that a benefit under a Continuation
Plan other than a benefit which is subject to Section 4980B of the Code cannot
be provided on the current basis because of an insurance company's refusal to
provide such coverage to former employees, the parties shall in reasonable good
faith agree upon coverage as close as possible to such coverage without an
increase in the total cost of the benefits that would be incurred under the
insurance policies from time to time.

11.12 USE OF NAME "PRA SECURITIES ADVISORS, L.P". The Sellers shall cause
to be changed the name of PRA Securities Advisors, L. P. to a name which is not
confusingly similar effective as of the Second Closing Date. Each of the
Sellers acknowledges and agrees that UAM and Heitman are acquiring the exclusive
use of the name "PRA Securities

58
<PAGE>

Advisors, L.P" for which they will receive full and adequate compensation, and
that none of them will use that name or any similar name subsequent to the
Second Closing.

11.13 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED Intentionally omitted.

11.14 BENEFIT PLAN QUALIFICATION MATTERS With respect to each Benefit
Plan that is a funded employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2)
of ERISA), the Sellers shall cause or shall cause the Affiliates to cause: (1)
the adoption, by the appropriate entity, of all amendments necessary or
desirable to maintain the qualified status under Section 401(a) of the Code of
each such Benefit Plan and to submit each such Benefit Plan, as amended, to the
Internal Revenue Service for a letter on each such Benefit Plan determining that
each such Benefit Plan continues to be so qualified; and (2) the adoption of
such amendments and the submission to the Internal Revenue Service with respect
to each such Benefit Plan no later than the end of the remedial amendment period
applicable to that Benefit Plan for such amendments under Section 401(b) of the
Code.

11.15 IDENTITY OF SENIOR LENDERS. UAM agrees that, for so long as the
Note is outstanding, it shall from time to time inform JMBRC of the identity of
the Holders of Senior Debt, as such term is defined for purposes of the
Subordination Agreement.

12.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or
prior to the First Closing Date:

(a) with the mutual consent of UAM and the Sellers;

(b) by written notice from the Sellers or UAM to the other, if the First
Closing shall not have taken place on or before January 31, 1995 PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if a party fails to perform an obligation hereunder and such
failure has caused a delay in the satisfaction of the closing conditions, then
the non-breaching party shall be entitled to extend such January 31, 1995 date
to the extent of such delay, and further provided that such date shall be March
31, 1995 if the sole reason for the delay beyond January 31, 1995 is complying
with the requirements of Hart-Scott-Rodino Act;

(c) by written notice from the Sellers or UAM to the other, if any court
of competent jurisdiction or other governmental body shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

59
<PAGE>

(d) by written notice from the Sellers or UAM to the other, if the
Purchase Price at First Closing, as adjusted, is less than an aggregate of
$190,000,000 in aggregate of Short-Term Portion and Long-Term Portion, provided,
however, that this Agreement shall not be terminated upon notice of the Sellers
delivered pursuant to this Section 12.1(d) if UAM and Heitman shall agree to pay
at least $190,000,000 in aggregate of Short-Term Portion and Long-Term Portion
(and pro rata portion of Warrant) as calculated for both the First Closing and
the Second Closing as the Purchase Price for the Purchased Assets hereunder.

12.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 12.1, all obligations of the parties hereunder, except for the
obligations set forth in Section 13.5, which shall survive the termination of
this Agreement, shall terminate without liability of any party (or any
stockholder, partner, affiliate, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant
or representative of such party) to any other party, except that no such
termination shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination, and the breaching party shall be fully
liable for any and all losses, claims and damages sustained or incurred by any
other party from such breach.

Article XIII. GENERAL.

13.1 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. All Exhibits and Schedules hereto shall be deemed

together with the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, contains the entire agreement
among the parties and there are no agreements, representations, or warranties by
any of the parties hereto which are not set forth herein. This Agreement may
not be amended or revised except by a writing signed by all parties hereto.

13.2 EQUITABLE RELIEF; BINDING EFFECT. The Sellers recognize and agree
that Heitman's and UAM's remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of this
Agreement would be inadequate and that for breach of such provisions Heitman and
UAM shall, in addition to such other remedies as may be available to them at law
or in equity or as provided in this Agreement, be entitled to injunctive relief
by an action for specific performance to the extent permitted by law. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, this Agreement
and all rights hereunder may not be assigned by the Sellers except by prior

hereunder or by UAM or Heitman except by prior written consent of the Sellers.

13.3 SEPARATE COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in several

13.4 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. UAM and Heitman acknowledge that
one or more of the Sellers may have no actual knowledge as to the

indemnification provisions contained in Article IV, are intended to allocate
risk and economic cost as between UAM and Heitman on the one hand and certain of
the Sellers on the other hand in the event such representations and warranties
are breached. In no event, however, has any of the Sellers given any
representation or warranty which he, she or it actually knows to be inaccurate.

of any nature (except as may otherwise expressly be permitted by this
Agreement), all of the assets of PIC, except such assets to be retained or
distributed by PIC as set forth on Schedule 8 hereto ("Excluded Assets"),
consisting of the assets and business of PIC of every kind and description,
tangible and intangible, real, personal or mixed and wherever located and all
proprietary and associated rights relating thereto, including without limitation
all assets shown or reflected in PIC's balance sheet as of September 30, 1994,
the Investment Advisory Contracts (as hereinafter defined), customer lists,
prospects lists, books, records, and all of PIC's goodwill and the exclusive
right to use the name of PIC as all or part of a trade or corporate name (the
"Assets"). UAM shall then transfer all of the Assets to Newco.

1.2 PURCHASE PRICE. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 1.3,
below, UAM shall pay PIC in consideration of the purchase and sale of the Assets
(the "Purchase Price"):

(a) Two hundred sixty-two million, eight hundred four thousand

wire transfer in same day funds; and

(b) Twenty million, eight hundred fourteen thousand, seven

Seven-Year 6 1/2% Subordinated Note (the "Note"), to be delivered at the Closing
in the form of Exhibit A hereto and subordinated in accordance with the form of
Subordination Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Subordination
Agreement"); and

(c) A Warrant Agreement in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto
(the "Warrant Agreement"), and a Warrant Certificate in the form of Exhibit D
attached hereto to be delivered at the Closing evidencing the right to purchase
459,385 shares ($20,814,776 principal amount of the Note divided by the Warrant
exercise price of $45.31 per share of UAM's Common Stock, $.01 par value (the
"Warrant"), and exercisable in accordance with the Warrant Agreement at forty-
five dollars and thirty-one cents ($45.31) per share, subject to adjustment as
stated in the Warrant Agreement; and

(d) an aggregate of sixty seven million, three hundred seventy
thousand, and seventy-four dollars ($67,370,074) of UAM Common Stock, $.01 par

<PAGE>

(e) the Contingent Payment provided for in Section 1.4 below (in
an aggregate amount which shall not exceed $125,000,000 reduced by the amount of
any Extension Bonus Payment payable by UAM pursuant to Section 11.10 below).

The per share price of UAM Stock to be used in calculating the number of
shares of UAM Stock to be delivered pursuant to section (d) above (the "UAM
Stock Price") shall be the average of the closing price of UAM's Common Stock
for the twenty (20) successive trading days ending on the tenth trading day
preceding the Closing Date as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, subject
to the following. If the average price calculated pursuant to the preceding
sentence is equal to or greater than $43.50 per share, the UAM Stock Price shall
be $43.50 per share. If the average price calculated pursuant to the preceding
sentence is equal to or less than $29.00 per share, the UAM Stock Price shall be
$29.00 per share.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares
of UAM Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of
ownership thereof, will be issued. The number of shares of UAM Stock to be
delivered to PIC pursuant hereto shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.

1.3 ADJUSTMENT IN PURCHASE PRICE. If any adjustment is required by the
provisions of the following subparagraphs, the portion of the Purchase Price
payable by UAM to PIC at the Closing will be reduced or increased, as the case
may be, PRO RATA with respect to the cash portion, the Note and the Warrant
portion, and the UAM Stock portion, by a percentage calculated in the following
manner:

(a) PIC shall have prepared and delivered to UAM on or prior to
the date hereof, a list (Schedule 1.3A) of investment advisory clients of PIC as
of September 30, 1994, showing for each client and as of that date, the client's
name, address, fee arrangements, assets under management, and pro forma annual
billings calculated by multiplying the assets under management by the annual
percentage fee applicable to such client under its Investment Advisory Contract
with PIC (the "Original Schedule"). The Original Schedule shall separately
identify each client which is a Fund (as hereinafter defined) as such. The
Original Schedule shall separately identify each client that is a financial
services firm and for which PIC provides advisory services for assets placed
with such firm pursuant to an agreement under which PIC serves as an investment
manager or submanager for broker-sponsored asset management programs ("Wrap
Accounts"). Each financial services firm for which PIC provides advisory
services for assets placed with such firm in Wrap Accounts shall be referred to
herein as a "Wrap Sponsor" and such firms shall be referred to collectively as
the "Wrap Sponsors". The Original Schedule and Revised Schedule (as hereinafter
defined) shall identify thereon the Wrap Sponsors as clients, but not the
underlying Wrap Account holders. Only assets under management which are
accruing fees shall be included on the Original Schedule or the Revised Schedule
prepared pursuant to subsection (c) below. Attached to the Original Schedule is
a description of each performance fee arrangement in place with any client
listed thereon.

<PAGE>

(b) Based on negotiations as to the Purchase Price leading to
the execution of this Agreement, "Base Annual Billings" of PIC for purposes of
this calculation are $86,034,000.

(c) At the Closing, PIC will deliver to UAM a revised Schedule
1.3A (the "Revised Schedule") as of the close of business on the last business
day before the Closing prepared as follows:

(i) All clients that have terminated their investment advisory
relationship with PIC or that have notified PIC (orally or in
writing) of their intention to terminate that relationship since the
date of the Original Schedule shall be deleted from the Revised
Schedule.

(ii) Clients that have engaged PIC since the date of the Original
Schedule shall be added to the Revised Schedule with their assets
under management by PIC included in the Revised Schedule at the
value of those assets on the date PIC's management of those assets
commenced.

(iii) For clients that have withdrawn assets from management by PIC since
the date of the Original Schedule, assets under management for such
clients shall be reduced from the Original Schedule by the same
percentage as is calculated by dividing (A) the value of the assets
withdrawn as of the date of withdrawal, by (B) the aggregate value
of assets managed by PIC for such client immediately prior to the
withdrawal. If as of the Closing Date PIC has knowledge of any
prospective withdrawal of assets under management for any client,
assets under management for such client on the Revised Schedule
shall be reduced by the same percentage as is calculated by dividing
(A) the value of the assets proposed to be withdrawn by (B) the
aggregate value of assets managed by PIC for such client as of the
last business day before the Closing.

(iv) For clients that have added to assets under management since the
date of the Original Schedule, assets under management for such
clients shall be increased from the Original Schedule by the value
of those added assets on the date PIC's management of the assets
commenced.

(v) Pro forma annual billings for each client shall be calculated in the
same manner as in the Original Schedule, after giving effect to the
adjustments made to assets under management pursuant to
subparagraphs (i) to (iv) above and to any reductions in fees.

(vi) The Revised Schedule shall not reflect fluctuations in the market
value of assets under management since the date of the Original
Schedule (except as

4

<PAGE>

expressly provided in subparagraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv) above) or
increases (if any) in PIC's fee schedule subsequent to that date.

Pro forma annual billings shown on this Revised Schedule are referred to as
"Assigned Annual Billings." The advisory agreements between PIC and the clients
listed on the Original and Revised Schedules are referred to herein as
"Investment Advisory Contracts."

(d) Assigned Annual Billings shall then be divided by Base
Annual Billings, and the resulting percentage shall be determined to the nearest
one-hundredth of a percent (the "Adjustment Percentage").

(e) CALCULATION OF REVALUATION PERCENTAGE.

(i) If the Adjustment Percentage is 95% to 105% , there shall be no
reduction or increase in the Purchase Price payable at the Closing.

(ii) If the Adjustment Percentage is 70% or more, up to 95%, then the
Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be reduced in accordance
with the following table, with interpolation as necessary between
percentages rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a percent:

(iii) If the Adjustment Percentage is less than 70%, UAM may elect not to
proceed under this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.5 and PIC
may elect not to proceed under this Agreement in accordance with
Section 10.7.

(iv) If the Adjustment Percentage is greater than 105%, the portion of
the Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be increased in
accordance with the following table, with interpolation as
necessary between percentages rounded to the nearest one-hundredth
of a percent, subject to the provisions of paragraph (v) below:

(v) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of Section 1.3 to
the contrary, if the Closing occurs after January 27, 1995, the
amount of any increase in the portion of the Purchase Price payable
at the Closing by UAM shall be the lesser of such amount calculated
as of January 27, 1995, (using a revised Schedule 1.3A prepared as
of January 27, 1995, and such amount calculated as of the Closing,
and for purposes of such calculations revised Schedules 1.3A shall
be prepared both as of January 27, 1995, and as of the close of
business on the last business day prior to the day the Closing is
actually held.

The percentage by which the Purchase Price shall be decreased or increased
(i.e., the percentage determined from the right-hand column in the tables above)
is referred to herein as the "Revaluation Percentage".

(f) An example of the operation of this Section 1.3 is set forth
on Schedule 1.3B hereto.

1.4 CONTINGENT PAYMENT. One contingent payment (the "Contingent
Payment") in an aggregate amount that shall not exceed $125,000,000 reduced by
the amount of any Extension Bonus Payment payable by UAM pursuant to Section
11.10 below (the "Overall Limitation") shall be paid to PIC in the amount, in
the manner and on the date indicated below:

(a) Based on negotiations as to the Purchase Price leading to
the execution of this Agreement, the term "UAM's Base Share of Revenues" shall
mean $43,017,000, provided that if an increase or a reduction in the portion of
the Purchase Price payable at the Closing is made in accordance with Section 1.3
because the Adjustment Percentage is less than 95% or greater than 105%, the
term "UAM's Base Share of Revenues" shall mean $43,017,000 increased or reduced,
as the case may be, by the same percent by which the portion of the Purchase
Price payable at the Closing was increased or reduced pursuant to Section 1.3.

(b) To the extent that UAM's Share of Revenues, as that term is
used in the Revenue Sharing Agreement (as hereinafter defined) and adjusted to
normalize performance fees in accordance with the normalization of performance
fees as reflected in Schedule 1.3A, for the year ending December 31, 1997
exceeds UAM's Base Share of Revenues, the latter shall be deducted from the
former, the difference shall be multiplied by seven, and the

7

<PAGE>

product shall be reduced by the amount of any Extension Bonus Payment payable by
UAM pursuant to Section 11.10 below to determine the amount of the Contingent
Payment, if any, due; subject to the Overall Limitation.

(c) The Contingent Payment, if any, shall be paid by UAM to PIC,
or PIC's successors in interest on or before March 1, 1998 (the "Contingent
Closing Date"), and shall be paid in cash by wire transfer in same day funds,
principal amount of UAM's Note (the "Contingent Note") and Warrant Agreement and
Certificate evidencing the right to purchase a number of shares of UAM Common
Stock equal to the number produced by dividing the principal amount of the
Contingent Note by $45.31 (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 5 of
the Warrant Agreement) (the "Contingent Warrant") and UAM Common Stock (the
"Contingent Stock") in pro rata amount based on the relative amounts of such
consideration paid at Closing; provided, however, that (i) no Contingent Payment
shall be paid unless all provisions in the Revenue Sharing Agreement requiring
certain amounts to be distributed to UAM have been complied with in all
material respects (ii) at PIC's option and upon notice to UAM at least thirty
days prior to the Contingent Closing Date, the portion of the Contingent Payment
that shall be paid in cash may be decreased and the portion of the Contingent
Payment that shall be paid in Contingent Note and Contingent Warrant may be
correspondingly increased up to a maximum amount of $10,000,000; and (iii) any
Extension Bonus Payment payable by UAM pursuant to Section 11.10 below shall be
charged against the cash portion of the Contingent Payment.

(d) The per share price of Contingent Stock to be used in
calculating the number of shares of Contingent Stock to be delivered pursuant to
this section (the "Contingent Stock Price") shall be the average of the closing
price of UAM's Common Stock for the twenty (20) successive trading days ending
on the tenth trading day preceding the Contingent Closing Date (the "Pricing
Date") as reported by the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange or market
on which such stock is quoted), subject to the following. The amount of the
Contingent Payment, if any, to be paid in Contingent Stock pursuant to this
section may be paid by UAM in cash by wire transfer in same day funds, at UAM's
option, if the Contingent Stock Price is less than the Contingent Stock Price
Lower Limit as defined in the following sentence. For purposes of this section,
the "Contingent Stock Price Lower Limit" shall be the higher of (i) $29.00 per
share; and (ii) 80% of the average of the closing price of UAM's Common Stock
for the last trading day of each of the fifty-two (52) successive weeks ending
with the week immediately preceding the Pricing Date as reported by the New York
Stock Exchange (or other exchange or market on which such stock is quoted).

(e) The Contingent Note shall have the same terms and shall be
in the same form as the Note (Exhibit A), except that it shall be due seven
years from the date of the Contingent Closing. An additional Subordination
Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B shall be executed at the time
of issuance of the Contingent Note.

8

<PAGE>

(f) The Contingent Warrant shall have the same terms as provided
in Section 1.2 above, including the exercise price as therein provided; shall be
in the same form as the Warrant (Exhibit D); subject to the terms of the Warrant
Agreement (Exhibit C), except that it shall be exercisable at any time up to or
on the seventh anniversary date of the Contingent Closing. An additional
Warrant Agreement in the form of Exhibit D shall be executed at the time of
issuance of the Contingent Warrant.

(g) An example of Contingent Payment calculations is provided in
Schedule 1.4 hereto.

1.5 OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED BY NEWCO. As further consideration for the sale
of the Assets by PIC to UAM and subject to the provisions of Article VIII and
Section 9.15 hereof, Newco agrees, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, to assume at the Closing all obligations of PIC to perform or
provide services after the Closing Date under the Investment Advisory Contracts
and the contracts and other agreements listed on Schedules 3.10A, 3.12 and 3.15,
to the extent the same shall exist on the Closing Date (the "Assumed
Obligations"). Nothing in this Agreement or any Related Agreement (as defined
herein) shall require UAM or Newco to assume, and UAM and Newco do not assume,
any other liabilities or obligations of PIC to any person or entity.

Article II. THE CLOSING.

The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. at the offices of PIC on January 27, 1995, or at such
other later time and other place as the parties hereto may mutually agree upon
(the "Closing Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if as of such date one or
more of the meetings of the shareholders of the Funds contemplated by Section
7.6 below has or have not been held, then PIC shall have the right to defer the
Closing to a later reasonable date and time, but in no event shall such date be
later than March 15, 1995.

Article III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PIC AND THE STOCKHOLDERS.

As a material inducement to UAM and Newco to enter into and perform this
Agreement, PIC and the Stockholders jointly and severally represent, warrant,
covenant and agree that:

3.1 PIC'S ORGANIZATION AND CORPORATE AUTHORITY. PIC is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of California, with full power and authority to own or lease and use its
properties and assets, to carry on its business as such business is now
conducted, to execute and deliver this Agreement, and to

9

<PAGE>

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. PIC is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation under the laws of each jurisdiction in which
the conduct of its business requires such qualification or license, except for
jurisdictions where failure to so qualify or be licensed would not have a
material adverse effect on PIC's business.

3.2 CHARTER, BY-LAWS AND MINUTES. The copies of the Articles of
Organization of PIC as certified by the Secretary of State of California; the
By-laws of PIC as certified by its Secretary; and the minutes of meetings of its
Board of Directors and stockholders (or consents in lieu thereof) furnished to
UAM by PIC, are true, correct and complete and conform to the originals thereof.

3.3 NO VIOLATION. Neither the execution and delivery by PIC or the
Stockholders of this Agreement or of any other agreement or instruments required
by the provisions of this Agreement (collectively, the "Related Agreements") to
which PIC or the Stockholders may be parties, nor consummation of the
transactions herein or therein contemplated, nor compliance with the terms,
conditions and provisions hereof or thereof will conflict with or violate any
provision of law or the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of PIC, or result
in a violation or default in any provision of any regulation, order, writ,
injunction or decree of any court or governmental agency or authority or of any
agreement or instrument to which PIC or a Stockholder is a party or by which PIC
or a Stockholder is bound or to which PIC or a Stockholder is subject, or
constitute a default thereunder or result in the imposition of any lien, charge,
encumbrance or security interest of any nature whatsoever upon any of PIC's
property pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument (except as
contemplated by this Agreement), assuming that all of the consents contemplated
by Section 7.1 have been received and provided that the actions contemplated by
Article VII are taken and the provisions of 15 U.S.C. Section 18(a) and (b) (the
"Hart-Scott-Rodino Act") shall have been complied with pursuant to Section 9.19
hereof. The parties recognize that consummation of the transaction contemplated
herein will result in the automatic termination of PIC's investment advisory
agreements relating to the Funds described in Section 3.25 and that new
agreements may be entered into by Newco in accordance with the procedures
established by the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

3.4 THE STOCKHOLDERS. Except as set forth in Schedule 1, the
Stockholders own all of the issued and outstanding shares of PIC's capital stock
listed next to their respective names in Schedule 1 hereto, free and clear of
all agreements, charges, options, liens, security interests, pledges, claims,
restrictions and encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. PIC has authorized
capital stock consisting of 1,000,000 shares of common stock, $1.00 par value,
of which 166,020 shares are validly issued and outstanding, fully paid, non-
assessable and entitled to vote. There are outstanding no rights to purchase of
any kind affecting any shares of the capital stock of PIC, whether or not
outstanding.

3.5 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Stockholders and PIC have delivered to
UAM audited balance sheets of PIC as at the close of its fiscal years ended
December 31, 1991

10

<PAGE>

through December 31, 1993, together with related audited statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flow for the respective years then ended,
certified by or accompanied by a report of independent public accountants, all
of which balance sheets and financial statements (including the notes thereto)
for such three-year period are collectively called the "Audited Financials" and
are attached hereto as Exhibit G.

The Stockholders and PIC have also delivered to UAM an unaudited balance
sheet as of September 30, 1994, together with related statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flow for the [9]-month period then ended and will
deliver to UAM prior to the Closing an unaudited balance sheet as of the end of
the second month next preceding the month in which the Closing Date occurs,
together with unaudited statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flow
of PIC for the post-December 31, 1994, period then ended, certified by the
principal financial and accounting officer of PIC, all of which balance sheets
and financial statements (including the notes thereto) are referred to
collectively as the "Unaudited Financials" and are or prior to the Closing will
be attached hereto as Exhibit H. The Audited Financials and the Unaudited
Financials are hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the "Financial
Statements."

The Financial Statements, when delivered in accordance with this Section,
will fairly present the financial position and results of operations of PIC on
the dates and for the fiscal periods then ended, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles which, except as may otherwise be noted in the
footnotes thereto, have been applied on a basis consistent with prior periods.
The Financial Statements reflect or provide for all claims against and all debts
and liabilities of PIC, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, as at the
dates thereof in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
except for certain year-end accruals reflected on or omitted from the Unaudited
Financials which are not individually or in the aggregate material.

Schedule 3.5 hereto lists and will list (as modified as of the Closing
Date) all material claims against and all material debts and material
liabilities of PIC, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, including all
material bonuses payable, or paid since the date of the latest Financial
Statements, and taxes due as at the date hereof, and as of the Closing Date.

PIC has no liability of any nature, contingent or otherwise, which is not
fully reflected or reserved against in the Audited Financials for the year ended
December 31, 1993, or in the Unaudited Financials or listed in Schedule 3.5.

Attached to Schedule 3.5 is a projected statement of cash flow for the
twelve-month period immediately following the Closing Date. Such statement was
prepared on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements and was prepared in
good faith based on assumption which PIC and the Stockholders consider to be
reasonable.

11

<PAGE>

3.6 NO ADVERSE CHANGE. Since September 30, 1994, (a) there has been no
material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations,
assets, liabilities or business of PIC; (b) there have been no dividends or
other distributions with respect to PIC's capital stock paid or declared by PIC
except as disclosed to UAM in Schedule 8 hereto; (c) PIC has not issued or sold
any shares of its capital stock; and (d) the physical properties owned or leased
by PIC have not suffered any destruction or damage, regardless of whether or not
the loss suffered was insured, that would materially adversely affect PIC's
business.

3.7 SUBSIDIARIES. PIC has no subsidiaries. PIC does not own, directly
or indirectly, other than for investment purposes, any of the capital stock of
any corporation, association, trust or similar entity, any interest in the
equity of any partnership or similar entity, any share in any joint venture, or
any other equity or proprietary interest in any entity or enterprise, however
organized and however such interest may be denominated or evidenced.

3.8 TAXES. PIC has filed all federal, state, local and other tax
returns which are required to be filed by it and which were due prior to the
date of this Agreement and has paid all taxes shown thereon, including without
limitation all taxes on properties, income, business and occupation, licenses,
sales and payrolls. All federal, state, local and other taxes accruable since
the end of the respective periods covered by such returns and up to the date
hereof and the Closing Date have or will have been paid or accrued on the books
of PIC (other than taxes on so-called built-in gain which will be calculated and
paid in accordance with Section 6.2 hereof). The tax returns of PIC for the
last five fiscal years up to December 31, 1993 heretofore delivered to UAM are
true, accurate and complete in all material respects, and fairly present the
information purported to be shown therein, and reflect all material tax
liabilities of PIC for the periods covered thereby. The Financial Statements
include adequate reserves or liabilities for all accrued and unpaid federal,
state and local taxes of PIC, whether or not disputed, for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1993, and the post-December 31, 1993 periods covered thereby and
for all fiscal periods prior thereto or arising out of transactions entered into
or any state of facts existing on or prior to the dates thereof.

On March 13, 1989, PIC filed a valid election under Section 1362 of the
Internal Revenue Code ("Code") to be an S corporation governed by the provisions
of Subchapter S of the Code effective January 1, 1989. Such election has not
been revoked. PIC, at the time of the filing of the election, and since such
filing, has met all of the requirements of Subchapter S of the Code to be
eligible for treatment as an S corporation under the Code.

No federal income tax returns of PIC filed for any period beginning after
December 31, 1987, have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service, and PIC
has granted no power of attorney to any person to represent it before the
Internal Revenue Service. No federal or state tax liabilities have been
assessed or proposed which remain unpaid. Neither PIC nor any of the
Stockholders is aware of any basis upon which any liability for a material
amount

12

<PAGE>

of additional taxes could be incurred. No state excise or business and
occupation tax returns of PIC filed for any period beginning after December 31,
1987, have been audited, and no state tax liabilities have been assessed or
proposed which remain unpaid.

Present taxes which PIC is required by law to withhold or collect have been
withheld or collected and have been paid over to the proper governmental
authorities or are properly held by PIC for such payment, and all withholdings,
collections or other payments payable in connection therewith as of the dates of
the Unaudited Financials, are fully reflected or disclosed in the balance sheets
included as a part of the Unaudited Financials as at such dates and for the
periods then ended. All such taxes are and will be so withheld, collected, paid
over or held for payment as of the date of this Agreement and the Closing. No
waivers of statutes of limitations with respect to any tax returns of PIC nor
extensions of time for the assessment of any tax have been given which are now
in effect.

Neither PIC nor the Stockholders have taken or will take any action other
than in the ordinary course of business and other than the transactions to occur
pursuant to this Agreement which would create a tax liability of PIC that would
become such on or after the Closing Date.

3.9 INTERESTS OF OFFICERS. Except for normal advances for business
expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business, no officer, director, or
stockholder of PIC nor any affiliate of any of the foregoing parties has any
loan or other obligation outstanding to or from PIC or for which PIC is or may
be liable under guaranty or otherwise, or has any material interest in any firm,
person or entity with which PIC has entered into any contract or lease, or with
which PIC does business and which would influence that person in doing business
with PIC, other than as disclosed in Schedule 3.9.

3.10 PROPERTY. PIC's assets which consist of real estate or leasehold
interests in or options on real estate are listed on Schedule 3.10A, together
with all "Encumbrances" (as hereinafter defined) thereon. PIC has good and
marketable title to all real property owned by it, free of all encumbrances
other than those identified on Schedule 3.10A.

Also set forth on Schedule 3.10A is a list of personal property (including
without limitation machinery, equipment, furniture and computer software) owned,
leased by or under option to PIC with an individual net book value at September
30, 1994 in excess of $10,000 for owned property or with individual annual lease
payments in excess of $10,000 for leased property, together with all
"Encumbrances" thereon. Prior to the Closing, PIC should deliver to UAM a
complete Fixed Asset listing for financial reporting purposes. The term
"Encumbrances" shall mean all claims, liens, pledges, mortgages, security
interests, encumbrances, charges, options, defaults, equities or restrictions or
other matters, if any, affecting PIC's title to, ownership of, or lease interest
in any of the scheduled property.

13

<PAGE>

Schedule 3.10A includes a description of the terms of the aforesaid leases
and options or, in lieu thereof, copies of such leases and options. All leases
listed on Schedule 3.10A are in good standing and are valid and effective in
accordance with their respective terms, and there is not under any such lease
any existing default of PIC or event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default of PIC. The assignment of such leases pursuant hereto
will not constitute a default or event of default of PIC thereunder; provided,
however, that the parties acknowledge that the consent of PIC's landlord under
its lease of primary office space [is] required. The Encumbrances set forth in
Schedule 3.10A do not singly or in the aggregate materially affect the value of
such real or personal property or impair the use thereof in PIC's business as
now conducted. All personal property of PIC has been properly maintained and is
in good order and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted and is operable and
fit to be used for its intended purposes.

PIC owns free and clear of all Encumbrances the bonds, debentures, notes,
stock and other securities listed on Schedule 3.10B hereto, and none other.

3.11 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. The accounts receivable reflected in the
Unaudited Financials of September 30, 1994 arose in the ordinary course of
business and have been collected in full or are fully collectible or, if not
fully collectible, have been written off or have had adequate reserves
established therefor. Set forth on Schedule 3.11 hereto is a list of all
accounts receivable of PIC which were billed as of September 30, 1994, showing
the name of each debtor and the amount due on each account, and indicating any
amount past-due on each account and any write-off or reserve against each such
account. Such accounts receivable are likewise fully collectible, unless
otherwise indicated. Schedule 3.11 shall be supplemented at the Closing to
reflect accounts receivable as of the Closing Date. Except as disclosed on
Schedule 3.11 hereto, no agreements have been in effect since January 1, 1994 or
are now proposed which would require any delay in payment of any fees payable
under the Investment Advisory Contracts.

3.12 INSURANCE. Each insurance policy which is maintained by PIC with
respect to its business or properties or upon the life of any person employed by
PIC is set forth on Schedule 3.12 hereto showing the amount of coverage under
each such policy, other than life insurance policies owned by employees for
which PIC pays the premiums. The listed policies are reasonably adequate to
protect the insured properties against the insured risks, at current replacement
values, subject to reasonable deductibles, and the risks insured against are
normal for the industry. All such policies are assignable, except as set forth
on Schedule 3.12.

3.13 NAMES, FRANCHISES, PERMITS, ETC. To its best knowledge, PIC has the
right to use its name in every state in which it now does business. Except as
noted on Schedule 3.13 hereto, PIC has no franchises, permits, licenses,
trademarks, trade names, patents, patent applications, copyrights, trade
secrets, computer software, formula, designs or inventions and none of the same
are necessary to conduct its business as now operated without infringing on

14

the rights of any other person. To the best knowledge of the Stockholders and
PIC, PIC has not infringed or violated in any way any trademark, trade name,
copyright, trade secret rights or contractual relationships of others, and has
not received any notice, claim or protest respecting any such violations or
infringement. PIC has not given any indemnification to any person for any such
violations or infringements.

which in any material respect by its terms provides any client with the most
favorable provisions offered to any other client of PIC (any "most favored
nation provisions") or which provides for any contingently returnable fees.
Each of the Investment Advisory Contracts to which PIC is a party is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of PIC and, to the knowledge of PIC, each of the
other parties thereto enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
(i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance and transfer and other similar laws of general application,
heretofore or hereafter enacted or in effect, affecting the rights and remedies
of creditors generally, and (ii) the exercise of judicial or administrative
discretion in accordance with general equitable principles, particularly as to
the availability of the remedy of specific performance or other injunctive
relief (the "Remedies Exception"). PIC is not in breach, violation or default
under any such agreement. PIC has no arrangements or understandings relating to
PIC's rendering of investment advisory services to anyone which are not
disclosed on the Original and Revised Schedule 1.3A.

PIC has heretofore delivered to UAM a listing as of September 30, 1994 of
all persons holding Wrap Accounts with Wrap Sponsors and managed by PIC
identifying each such person's assets under management by PIC, and the nature of

business day before the Closing

3.15 OTHER CONTRACTS. All contracts (other than Investment Advisory
Contracts) to which PIC is a party or by which PIC is bound and which are
material to PIC's business and are not identified on any other Schedule hereto,
and all confidentiality agreements obtained from parties other than UAM are
listed on Schedule 3.15 hereto. PIC is not obligated under any contract or
agreement which materially and adversely affects its business, properties,
prospects, assets or condition, financial or otherwise.

PIC is not in default under (nor is PIC or any of the Stockholders aware of
any fact or event which with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both
would constitute a default under) any contract made or obligation owed by it
which would result in a liability that would materially adversely affect the
business of PIC.

16

<PAGE>

employee benefit or fringe benefit plans maintained by PIC or with respect to
which contributions are made by PIC (including health, life insurance and other
benefit plans maintained for retirees). Said plans, including but not limited
to all plans or programs that constitute "employee benefit plans" as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), are sometimes collectively referred to in this section as "Benefit
Plans." True and complete copies of all Benefit Plans, including any insurance
contracts under which benefits are provided, as currently in effect have been
provided to UAM. UAM has also been provided with a true and complete copy of
the summary plan description, if any was required by ERISA to be prepared and
distributed to participants, for each Benefit Plan. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.20:

(a) PIC has fulfilled its obligations to the extent applicable
under the minimum funding requirements of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), with respect to
each Benefit Plan. PIC has made all payments to all Benefit Plans as required
by the terms of each such plan and any applicable collective bargaining
agreements and in accordance, if applicable, with the actuarial and funding
assumptions in effect as for the most recent actuarial valuation of such plans
and the quarterly contribution requirements of Section 302(e) of ERISA and
Section 412(m) of the Code. No lien exists on any of PIC's assets pursuant to
Section 302(f) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code. A copy of the most
recent actuarial valuation and report for each defined benefit pension plan has
been provided to UAM. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.20, PIC has funded or
will fund each Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms through the Closing,
including the payment of applicable premiums on any insurance contract funding a
Benefit Plan for coverage provided through the Closing.

(b) Each Benefit Plan is in compliance in all material respects
with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code, including but
not limited to the satisfaction of all applicable reporting and disclosure
requirements under ERISA and the Code. PIC has filed or caused to be filed with
the Internal Revenue Service annual reports on Form 5500 or 5500C and 5500R, if
applicable, for each Benefit Plan for all years and periods for which such
reports were required, and such reports for the past five years have been
provided to UAM.

(c) No "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred in respect of any Benefit Plan
which could give rise to any liability or tax under ERISA or the Code on the
part of PIC, and no civil or criminal action brought pursuant to part 5 of Title
I of ERISA is pending or is threatened in writing or orally against any
fiduciary of any such plan, other than claims for benefits in the normal course.

(d) The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter for each
employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) determining
that such plan is a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and is
exempt from Federal income tax

17

<PAGE>

under Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the best knowledge of PIC, there has
been no occurrence since the date of any such determination letter which has
adversely affected such qualification.

(e) The assets of each Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV
of ERISA will, as of the Closing, be sufficient to pay all "benefit liabilities"
as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA. There shall not be as of the
Closing any outstanding unpaid minimum funding waiver within the meaning of
Section 412(d) of the Code.

(f) There has not been any (1) termination or partial
termination of any employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) maintained by PIC (or by any person, firm or corporation which is or was
under common control within the meaning of Section 4001(c) of ERISA, with PIC
(hereinafter called "an Affiliate") during the period of such common control, at
a time when Section 4021 of ERISA applied to such plan), (2) commencement of any
proceeding to terminate any such plan pursuant to ERISA, or otherwise, or (3)
written notice given to PIC or any Affiliate of the intention to commence or
seek the commencement of any such proceeding, which (under (1)) resulted or
(under (2) or (3)) would result in any insufficiency of plan assets necessary to
satisfy benefits guaranteed under Section 4022 of ERISA or benefits vested under
the plan. Any termination of any employee pension benefit plan has been
disclosed in Schedule 3.20 attached hereto and was accomplished in accordance
with the requirements of ERISA (including ERISA Section 4041, if applicable) and
the Code and all applicable regulations in effect under ERISA and the Code in
effect at the time the termination occurred. No "Reportable Event" as defined
in Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding "Reportable Events" for which the 30-day
notice requirement is waived) has occurred with respect to any pension benefit
plan and neither PIC nor any of its Affiliates has any liability to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to or arising from the maintenance of
any such plan.

(g) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.20, neither PIC nor any of
its Affiliates is a party to any pension plan that is a "multi-employer plan"
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. Neither PIC nor any of its
Affiliates currently has any liability to make any withdrawal liability payment
to any multi-employer plan. Neither PIC nor any of its Affiliates is delinquent
in making any contributions required to be paid to any multi-employer plan.
There is no pending dispute between PIC or any of its Affiliates and any multi-
employer plan concerning payment of contributions or payment of withdrawal
liability payments.

(h) Each Benefit Plan that provides medical benefits has been
operated in compliance with all requirements of Sections 601 through 609 of
ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code and regulations thereunder, relating to the
continuation of coverage under certain circumstances in which coverage would
otherwise cease.

18

<PAGE>

(i) Schedule 3.20 discloses, and separately indicates, each
plan, fund or program maintained by PIC that provides post retirement medical
benefits, post retirement death benefits or other post retirement welfare
benefits. A copy of any written description of post retirement welfare benefits
that has been provided to employees has been furnished to UAM. A copy of each
plan document, insurance contract or other written instrument providing for post
retirement welfare benefits has been provided to UAM, together with a
description of any advance funding arrangement that has been established to fund
post retirement welfare benefits.

filed by PIC with the Securities and Exchange Commission; copies of all state
registration forms, likewise as amended to date; and copies of all current
reports required to be kept by PIC pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 and rules promulgated thereunder, and required pursuant to applicable state
statutes. The information contained in such forms and reports was true and
complete at the time of filing in all material respects. PIC has filed all
amendments required to be filed to its Form ADV and state registration forms
under federal and state law. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.25, PIC has
filed all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (including Sections 13(d), (g) and (f) thereof) and rules promulgated

"Fund" and collectively the "Funds"), PIC does not act as investment adviser or
subadviser to any "investment company," as defined in the Investment Company Act
of 1940, which is registered under such Act. PIC has a written investment
advisory agreement with each Fund pursuant to which PIC serves as investment
adviser to each Fund, and has delivered to UAM true and complete copies of such
agreements. Each of such agreements is in full force and effect, PIC is not in
default thereunder and, to the best knowledge of PIC, no Fund that is a party
thereto is in default thereunder. The investment advisory agreement relating
to each Fund will terminate upon the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and new agreements may be entered into by Newco
in accordance with the procedures established by the Investment Company Act of
1940 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

that as of the date when the Note and Warrant are issued to PIC, such securities
will not have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and the rules

applicable state securities laws, on the ground that the transfer of such
securities to PIC is exempt from the registration and prospectus delivery
requirements of the Securities Act and from qualification under any applicable
state securities laws, and that such exemptions are based in part on the
representations and warranties made herein.

PIC is acquiring the Note and Warrant for its own account and not for that

Note and Warrant except to the Stockholders upon the liquidation of PIC or in
conformity with Rule

21

<PAGE>

144 of the Securities and Exchange Commission or pursuant to a registration
statement under the Securities Act and qualification under applicable state
securities laws or pursuant to an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to
UAM that such registration and qualification is not required. PIC and the
Stockholders acknowledge and agree that the Note and Warrant shall be endorsed
with the legends set forth in Exhibits A and D hereto.

UAM may require as a condition precedent to any proposed offer, sale,
transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Note and Warrant by
PIC other than in conformity with Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission or pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act that
the proposed transferee first sign, seal and deliver to UAM an investment
agreement with respect to the securities to be offered, sold, transferred,
pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of containing substantially the
agreements, representations and Warranties set forth in this Section 3.30.

PIC and the Stockholders represent to UAM (i) that they have reviewed such
reports and statements; (ii) that they have been afforded the opportunity to ask
questions and receive answers concerning the terms and conditions of the
offering of the Note and Warrant hereby and to obtain any additional information
that UAM possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is

statements; and (iii) that they have such knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters that they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of

parties, nor consummation of the transactions herein or therein contemplated,
nor compliance with the terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof will
conflict with or violate any provision of law or the Certificate or Articles of
Incorporation or By-laws of UAM or Newco, or result in a violation or default in

Contingent Note and the Contingent Warrant have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action of UAM and, when issued, sold and delivered in
accordance with this Agreement, will constitute the legal, valid and binding

subject to the Remedies Exception.

4.12 RESERVATIONS OF COMMON STOCK. The shares of UAM Common Stock

1992, 1991 and 1990 and all Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and all Current

schedules of UAM contained in said reports (or incorporated therein by

December 31, 1990 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and all Current Reports on
Form 8-K filed subsequent to December 31, 1993 did not, on the date of

mailing in the case of such proxy statements, and on the date of filing in the
case of such reports, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be

25

<PAGE>

stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No subsidiary of UAM
has issued a class of securities which is required to be registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

5.3 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement and referred to in Sections 5.1 and 5.2

and warranties of the Stockholders set forth in Sections 3.8 (TAXES), 3.20
(EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS), 4.11 (AUTHORIZATION OF NOTE AND WARRANT), 4.12
(RESERVATIONS OF COMMON STOCK), and 4.13 (AUTHORIZATION OF COMMON STOCK) of this

26

<PAGE>

years) notwithstanding the establishment of a shorter period by any applicable
statute of limitations, the provisions of which are hereby waived, provided that
liability with respect to any representation or warranty as to which a claim is
made within such two-year and seven-year periods, as applicable, shall continue
until finally determined and paid.

Each claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article V shall be made in
writing and shall set forth specifically the facts claimed to give rise to
indemnification and the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
claimed to be false or to have not been fulfilled, and the damages claimed as a
result thereof.

5.4 LIMITATION ON LIABILITIES OF PIC AND THE STOCKHOLDERS. The
following limitations shall apply to any claim against PIC, a Stockholder or
Stockholders which shall arise out of or result from any breach of any
representation or warranty (including without limitation those set forth in
Article III hereof) hereunder:

(a) any claim for a breach of representation or warranty under Sections
3.4, 3.24 or 3.28 hereof shall be the sole responsibility of the Stockholder
responsible for such breach;

(b) any other claim for a breach of representation or warranty under any
Section other than Sections 3.4, 3.24 or 3.28 hereof shall be a claim against
all the Stockholders as a group, but each Stockholder's liability therefore
shall be limited to a pro rata portion of the total liability, based on his or
her percentage ownership of PIC shares at this date;

(c) a Stockholder's aggregate liability for a breach of representations
or warranties hereunder shall in no event exceed such Stockholder's pro rata
portion of the Purchase Price based on his percentage ownership of PIC shares at
this date;

(d) PIC and the Stockholders shall not be required to indemnify UAM or
Newco hereunder with respect to any claims for a breach of representation or
warranty under any Section hereof until the amount of such claims exceed
$500,000, in which event UAM and Newco shall be entitled to indemnification with
respect to the full amount of such claims above such limitation.

5.5 THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. Should any claim be made or suit or proceeding
be instituted against a party entitled to indemnification hereunder (an
"Indemnified Party") which, if valid or prosecuted successfully, would be a
matter for which they are entitled to be defended, saved harmless or indemnified
under this Agreement (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall notify
parties responsible for such indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnifying
Parties") in writing concerning the same promptly after the assertion or
commencement thereof.

The Indemnifying Parties shall control the defense of any Third-Party Claim
against the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties shall use their
best efforts to defeat or

27

<PAGE>

minimize any loss resulting from such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying
Parties shall provide the Indemnified Parties with such information and
opportunity for consultation as may reasonably be requested by the Indemnified
Parties, and either the Indemnified Parties or any of them shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of a Third-Party Claim and to engage counsel at their
own expense for such purpose. The Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to
settle Third-Party Claims against the Indemnified Parties on terms which are
judged reasonable by the Indemnifying Parties and such settlements shall be
binding upon the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties for purposes
of indemnification under this Agreement, provided that the Indemnified Parties
have been held harmless against or indemnified for amounts agreed to be paid or
amounts paid in such settlement. The Indemnified Parties shall in any event
render all such assistance as the Indemnifying Parties shall reasonably request
in the defense of any Third-Party Claim. All costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense
of a Third-Party Claim shall upon demand be paid by the Indemnifying Parties.

5.6 SET-OFF. Any amount or amounts owing from the Stockholders or PIC
to the Indemnified Parties under this Article V, other than as a result of a
Third-Party Claim or other loss requiring the payment of money, shall be paid to
UAM by set-off against any amounts owing to the Stockholders or PIC under the
Note, to the extent such amounts are sufficient, and the balance of such amounts
owing and any other amount or amounts owing from the Stockholders or PIC to the
Indemnified Parties under this Article V may be paid to UAM, at UAM's option, by
set-off against any amounts owing to the Stockholders or PIC under this
Agreement and the Related Agreements, to the extent such amounts are sufficient,
in all cases without prejudice to UAM's or Newco's right to pursue any other
remedies at law or in equity in the event such amounts are insufficient, and
without prejudice to the rights of any such Stockholder to contribution from or
indemnification by any other Stockholder.

5.7 EXCLUSIVITY. The parties hereto agree that, following the Closing,
with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty (including without
limitation those set forth in Articles III and IV hereof) hereunder, the only
relief and remedy available to UAM or Newco or the Stockholders of PIC, as the
case may be, in respect of said breach shall be (a) damages, but only to the
extent properly claimable hereunder and as limited pursuant to this Article V or
otherwise hereunder; (b) specific performance if a court of competent
jurisdiction in its discretion grants the same; or (c) injunctive or declaratory
relief if a court of competent jurisdiction in its discretion grants the same.

Article VI. TAX MATTERS.

The parties agree that from and after the date hereof:

6.1 TAX RETURNS. The parties hereto shall cooperate with one another to
prepare and file all requisite federal, state and local tax returns disclosing
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder in a consistent
manner and as a taxable transaction

28

<PAGE>

under the Code. PIC shall prepare and file, on or before the due date or any
extension thereof, all required federal, state, and local tax returns with
respect to PIC's operations for the taxable year in which the Closing occurs and
with respect to the sale of the Assets (and the Stockholders shall properly
report on their personal tax returns their share of income or loss attributable
to them from the operations of PIC).

6.2 TAXES ON SALE. All transfer, excise, income or other taxes payable
by PIC or the Stockholders by reason of the purchase and sale of the Assets
hereunder (including without limitation any taxes on so-called built-in gain)
shall be paid by PIC or the Stockholders.

6.3 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE AMONG ASSETS. The Purchase Price shall
be allocated by UAM in consultation with PIC among the assets of PIC acquired
hereunder in accordance with the relative fair market values and pursuant to
Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of such
allocation, the fair market values of the such assets, including the Investment
Advisory Contracts, shall be determined by UAM in consultation with PIC, using
an independent appraiser selected by UAM as and to the extent deemed necessary
by UAM, at UAM's sole expense, beginning as soon as practicable after the date
hereof. PIC shall cooperate fully with such appraisal. The parties hereto
shall furnish such information to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to
allocation of the Purchase Price payable hereunder as may be required by Section
1060 of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder. UAM and PIC shall
furnish each other with a copy of the information it proposes to submit to the
Internal Revenue Service at least 30 days prior to the due date for filing such

Article VII. PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS.

7.1 PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING CLIENTS' CONSENTS. Following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, and thereafter as
necessary, the parties hereto shall cooperate with one another to obtain the
execution of a Client's Consent substantially in the form of Exhibit K, relating
to the consent of the advisees (other than the Wrap Accounts and the Funds
described in Section 3.25) under all of PIC's Investment Advisory Contracts to
the assignment of such contracts pursuant hereto. In connection with the
obtaining of such Clients' Consents, the parties shall cooperate with one
another to make full and complete disclosure of all facts material to the giving

course. The term "Managers" as used herein shall mean persons who have or share
the power to decide on behalf of a client whether to execute a Client's Consent,
such as trustees of a trust which is a client, or appropriate officers or
directors of a corporation which is a client. At least two weeks prior to the
Closing, PIC shall contact personally (by telephone or face-to-face) a "Manager"
(as defined above) of each client which has not yet returned an executed
Client's Consent to inquire as to such client's intentions. PIC shall deliver
to UAM prior to the Closing copies of all executed Client's Consents and make
available for inspection the originals of such Consents at or prior to the
Closing.

Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, PIC shall
contact each Wrap Sponsor and establish, subject to UAM's approval, appropriate
procedures to notify persons holding Wrap Accounts managed by PIC and their
brokers of the transaction contemplated hereby and to obtain appropriate
consents from such account holders. The initial notifications to such brokers
and account holders and the related consent requests shall be sent no later than
five weeks prior to the Closing. PIC shall obtain copies of all written
responses to such notifications and a written report describing all oral
responses to such notifications, all of which shall be made available to UAM.

7.2 NON-DISCLOSURE. PIC and the Stockholders agree that no disclosure
of the negotiation or execution of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be made to clients of PIC or to other persons not
employed by PIC or its attorneys and accountants in advance of the joint
publication by UAM and PIC of a press release on such matters, except in
accordance with procedures established by UAM in order to comply with federal
securities laws and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. PIC shall consult
with UAM in this regard and both parties shall have joint approval as to the
timing and content of any such press release, subject to UAM's obligations under
such laws and rules.

7.3 FILINGS. Prior to or on the Closing Date, the parties shall
cooperate to prepare and to file all documents and forms and amendments to
forms, including, without limitation, PIC's Form ADV-W filed with the Securities

making the applicable filing.

7.4 CLOSING CONDITIONS. PIC and the Stockholders shall use their best
efforts to cause the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to UAM's and
Newco's obligations hereunder set forth in Article IX. UAM and Newco shall use
their best efforts to cause the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to
PIC's and the Stockholders' obligations hereunder set forth in Article X.

7.5 RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. As soon as practicable after
the execution hereof, PIC and its agents and representatives shall exercise
their rights under all confidentiality agreements with parties other than UAM to
obtain the return or destruction of all confidential information concerning PIC
delivered thereunder.

7.6 AGREEMENT RELATING TO MUTUAL FUNDS. PIC and the Stockholders agree
to use their best efforts to cause to be prepared and filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission proxy materials for meetings of the shareholders of the
Funds and to use their reasonable best efforts to cause proxy solicitation to be
undertaken in order that such meetings be held prior to the Closing, at which
the approval of the shareholders of the Funds will be sought for new investment
advisory agreements with Newco (the "New Fund Agreements") with respect to the
Funds to be effective at the Closing, and for such other matters as may be
required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, including
specifically Section 15(f) thereof relating to the sale of investment advisers.
PIC and the Stockholders agree to seek the approval of the New Fund Agreements
by the Funds' boards of directors (or the equivalent) acting in accordance with
Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

For purposes of preparing a revised Schedule 1.3A as of the Closing Date,
any Fund which has approved a New Fund Agreement prior to the Closing shall not
be deemed to have terminated its investment advisory relationship with PIC; and
any Fund which has not done so shall be deemed to have terminated its investment
advisory relationship with PIC. The New Fund Agreement with any Fund which is
listed on the Revised Schedule as of the Closing shall have been approved by the
board of directors (or the equivalent) and the shareholders of such Fund in
conformity with the Investment Company Act of 1940, including, without
limitation, Sections 15(a) and (c) thereof, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and with any applicable state statutes and regulations, and as of the
Closing shall be in full force and effect. As of the Closing, at least 75% of
the members of the board of directors of each Fund which is listed on the
Original Schedule or the Revised Schedule as of the Closing shall not be
"interested persons" (as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940) of PIC, UAM, or Newco and shall have been selected, proposed for election,
and elected in accordance with Section 16(b) of that Act; and the composition of
the board of directors of each Fund which is listed on the Revised Schedule as
of the Closing shall comply with Section 10 of that Act.

Newco and PIC shall each use their best efforts to ensure that none of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will cause the imposition of an
"unfair burden" (as such

31

<PAGE>

term is defined in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940) on any
of the Funds listed on Schedule 1.3A.
.
7.7 REGISTRATION OF UAM STOCK.

Contingent Closing by performing the following:

(i) UAM shall prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") registration statements with respect
to the UAM Stock and the Contingent Stock and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and
remain effective for a period of three years from the Closing Date
and the Contingent Closing Date, respectively, and shall comply with
all applicable state securities laws with respect hereto. The

which the broker or dealer so engaged will attempt to sell the

broker or dealer as principal and resale by such broker or dealer
for its own account, (d) regular brokerage transactions executed on
the New York Stock Exchange, (e) negotiated transactions effected at
such prices as may be obtainable and as may be satisfactory to the
Selling Shareholder, or (f) other means. If the Securities Act
and/or the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission thereunder require that such Registration
Statement or the Prospectus forming a part thereof be amended or
supplemented in order to properly reflect the Stockholders' plan of
distribution, the Stockholders will promptly notify UAM of such
matters and cooperate with UAM in effecting such amendment or
supplement.

(ii) UAM shall prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to such registration statements and the prospectuses
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to update and keep
such registration statements effective and to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the sale of all
securities covered by such registration statements. Notwithstanding
anything else to the contrary contained herein, UAM shall not be
required to disclose any confidential information concerning pending
acquisitions not otherwise required to be disclosed.

32

requirements under the Securities Act.

All expenses incurred by UAM in complying with this subsection (a), including,
without limitation, all registration and filing fees (both federal and state),
printing expenses, and fees and disbursements of counsel for UAM, are herein
called Registration Expenses. All selling commissions applicable to the sales
of UAM Stock and all fees and disbursements of counsel for any Stockholder are
herein called Selling Expenses.

(b) ALLOCATION OF EXPENSES. UAM will pay all Registration
Expenses in connection with registration pursuant to this Section 7.7. All
Selling Expenses in connection with such registration shall be borne by the
Stockholders.

(c) INDEMNIFICATION. In connection with the registration of UAM
Stock and Contingent Stock under the Securities Act pursuant to this Section
7.7, UAM will indemnify and hold harmless the seller of such UAM Stock and
Contingent Stock, each underwriter of such UAM Stock and Contingent Stock and
each other person, if any, who controls such seller or underwriter within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses, joint or several, to which such seller,
underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under which
such UAM Stock and Contingent Stock was registered under the Securities Act
pursuant to this Section 7.7, or any post-effective amendment thereof, or the
omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
(ii) any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any final prospectus
(as amended or supplemented, if UAM shall have filed with the Commission any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto), or the omission (or alleged omission)
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading; and will reimburse such
seller, underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such seller, underwriter or such controlling
person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that UAM will not be liable in
any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or omission (or
alleged omission) of a material fact made in said registration statement, said
preliminary prospectus, or said prospectus or said amendment or supplement in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to UAM
through an instrument duly executed by such seller or underwriter specifically
for use in the preparation thereof.

<PAGE>

In connection with the registration of the UAM Stock and Contingent Stock
under the Securities Act pursuant to this Section 7.7, each seller of such UAM

harmless UAM, each person, if any, who controls UAM within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act, each officer of UAM who signs the registration
statement, each director of UAM, each underwriter, and each person who controls
any underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, joint or several, to which
UAM or such officer, director, underwriter or controlling person may become
subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, and will reimburse UAM or such
officer, director, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by UAM or such officer, director, underwriter or
controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or expense, but only insofar as such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or
are based upon any untrue statement or omission (or alleged omission) of a
material fact referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding paragraph of
this subsection (c), and provided, however, that this paragraph shall apply if
and only if such statement or omission (or alleged omission) was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to UAM by
or on behalf of such seller specifically for use in such registration statement
or prospectus.

It shall be a condition of UAM's obligations to effect registration of the
UAM Stock and Contingent Stock that the sellers participating in such
registration provide UAM and the underwriters, if any, with all material facts,
including, without limitation, furnishing such certificates, questionnaires and
legal opinions as may be required by UAM or such underwriters, concerning such
participating sellers and the UAM Stock and Contingent Stock to be registered
which are reasonably required to be stated in the registration statement or in
the prospectus or are otherwise required in connection with the offering.

9.7 OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR PIC AND THE STOCKHOLDERS. PIC and the
Stockholders shall have delivered to UAM opinions from Proskauer Rose Goetz &
Mendelsohn of Los Angeles, California, and/or Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe
of San Francisco, California, counsel for PIC and the Stockholders, that:

(i) PIC is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of California, with full corporate power and
authority to own its properties and assets and to conduct its
business as it is now conducted. PIC has duly authorized 1,000,000
shares of common stock ($1.00 par value) with voting power, of which
166,020 shares are validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable,
outstanding, entitled to vote, and, except as set forth on Schedule
1, owned of record and, to the knowledge of such counsel,
beneficially by the Stockholders. There are no other shares of
stock of any description authorized or outstanding of record, and,
in the corporate minute books of PIC made available to such counsel
there is no evidence of the existence of any options, warrants, or
rights to purchase of any kind affecting the stock of PIC which may
require PIC to issue additional stock, nor does such counsel have
actual knowledge of the existence of any such options, warrants or
rights.

(ii) Except as disclosed in the Agreement or any Exhibit or Schedule
annexed hereto, the execution and delivery by PIC and the
Stockholders of the Agreement and the Related Agreements to which
they are parties and the consummation by the Stockholders and PIC of
the transactions contemplated therein do not conflict with and do
not violate any provision of the State of California or federal law
or of the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of PIC or result in a
violation or default in any provision of any regulation, order,
writ, injunction or decree known to such counsel of any court or
governmental agency or authority, or, to the best of such counsel's
knowledge after due inquiry (and assuming all consents contemplated
by Section 7 have been received), any provision of any agreement
listed on the Schedules attached hereto, to which PIC or any of the
Stockholders is a party or by which PIC or any of the Stockholders
is bound or to which PIC or any of the Stockholders or any of their
shares of PIC Stock is subject, or to the best of such counsel's
knowledge after due inquiry, result in the creation or imposition of
any lien, charge, encumbrance or security interest upon any of the
properties owned by PIC.

(iii) The Stockholders have duly executed and delivered the Agreement and
the Related Agreements to which they are parties. The Agreement and
such Related Agreements are the valid and binding obligations of the
Stockholders, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to the Remedies Exception.

38

<PAGE>

(iv) To such counsel's knowledge, there is no claim, litigation,
proceeding or governmental investigation pending or threatened
against PIC or any of its directors, officers, employees or
Stockholders affecting the transaction contemplated by the Agreement
or affecting the property or assets of PIC.

(v) No authorization, approval, order, license, permit, franchise or
consent of or registration, declaration or filing with any
California or United States governmental authority is required in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance of the
Agreement which has not been obtained, other than a withdrawal of
PIC's Form ADV and corresponding state forms, if such have not been
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
appropriate states prior to the Closing.

(vi) The execution, delivery and performance by PIC of this Agreement has
been duly authorized and approved by all requisite action of PIC's
Board of Directors and Stockholders. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by PIC and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligations of PIC, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Remedies Exception.

(vii) To counsel's knowledge, PIC is duly registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, registered as an
investment adviser in the states referenced in item 7, Part I of its
current Form ADV, and in material compliance with all state laws
requiring registration, licensing or qualification as an investment
adviser; and each such federal and state registration is in full
force and effect, in each case such that no materially adverse
change in the financial condition or business of PIC would result.
PIC is not an "investment company" (within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940), which is required to be registered
under that Act in order to engage in the transactions described in
Section 7 of that Act, is not a "broker" or "dealer" within the
meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and does not act as
an investment adviser or subadviser to any "investment company" (as
defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940), which is registered
under such Act other than the Funds. To counsel's knowledge after
due inquiry, there is not pending or under way any inspection of PIC
or its records by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any
state regulatory authority, and counsel does not have knowledge of
any inspection reports or similar documents furnished to PIC by the
Securities and Exchange Commission or state regulatory authorities
since January 1, 1989, that have not been listed on Schedule 3.25.

(viii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge after due inquiry, (x) PIC
has timely filed an election to be treated as an S Corproation
governed by the provisions

39

<PAGE>

of Subchapter S of the Code for the taxable year beginning January
1, 1989, and ending December 31, 1989, and (y) since such filing all
of the following have remained true through the Closing:

(I) PIC has not had more than 35 shareholders;

(II) PIC has not had as a shareholder any non-resident alien;

(III) PIC has not had as a shareholder a person (other than a
trust described in Section 1361(c)(2) of the Code) who is not an
individual; and

(IV) PIC's Articles and By-laws, as amended, and its other
governing provisions known to such counsel, do not provide for or
purport to create more than one class of stock.

In rendering the foregoing opinions, such counsel may assume that the relevant
substantive and procedural law of the State of Massachusetts is identical to the
law of the State of California, and further, such counsel need express no
opinion with respect to (i) any indemnification obligation to the extent it may
be contrary to public policy, (ii) any non-competition or confidentiality
obligation, or (iii) any choice of law or jurisdiction provision. Proskauer
Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn shall not be required to opine as to matters relating to
the federal or state regulation of investment advisors or investment companies,
including but not limited to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
9.8 PIC'S AND THE STOCKHOLDERS' PERFORMANCE. Each of the obligations of
PIC and/or the Stockholders to be performed on or before the Closing Date
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall have been duly performed on or
before the Closing Date.

9.9 PAYMENTS MADE. All payments required by paragraph (i) of Article
VIII of this Agreement shall have been made or adequately funded and UAM shall
have received a certificate to that effect, dated as of the Closing Date and
signed by PIC and the Stockholders, in the form of Exhibit O hereto.

shall have been conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII and
Schedule 8 hereto.

9.11 CERTIFICATE RELATING TO REAL PROPERTY INTERESTS. The Stockholders
shall have executed a certificate in the form of Exhibit P hereto relating to
foreign ownership of real estate interests in the United States.

40

<PAGE>

9.12 APPROVAL OF DOCUMENTATION. The form and substance of all opinions,
certificates, and other documents shall be reasonably satisfactory in all
respects to UAM and its counsel.

9.13 EXAMINATION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS. For purposes of compliance with
and performance of this Agreement, UAM, acting through its own management and
personnel or through counsel, accountants, or other representatives designated
by it, shall have been afforded full and complete opportunity to examine and
investigate all aspects of PIC's business and affairs and assets and
liabilities, including without limitation, its minute books and stock transfer
records, financial books and records, the workpapers of PIC's independent public
accountants, the Investment Advisory Contracts, titles and leases to properties,
loan and other agreements, the condition of its facilities and equipment, and
the collectibility of accounts receivable. UAM shall also have been afforded
the opportunity to confer with PIC's advisory clients in the presence of a
representative of PIC (in such manner, at such times, and with such frequency,
as may be reasonably required by UAM).

9.14 ADVISERS ACT REGISTRATION. Registration of Newco as an investment
adviser and withdrawal of the registration of PIC as an investment adviser under
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and under applicable state investment
advisory statutes shall have been filed and become effective as contemplated by
Article VII, if so requested by UAM.

9.15 WORKING CAPITAL. At the Closing Date, PIC's cash, liquid marketable
securities, and accounts receivable which are collectible or realizable within a
normal billing cycle for PIC ("Working Capital") and which will be transferred
to Newco will be sufficient to fund: (1) accounts payable and accrued expenses,
including income, excise and business and occupation taxes and bonuses which
would be accrued in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as
of the Closing Date and which are to be paid by Newco; (2) any deferred revenues
which will have been billed in advance by the Closing Date but not yet earned;
(3) normal compensation and other operating expenses, including all accrued
employee compensation and other accrued items; and (4) an amount equal to a pro
rata share of projected bonuses and other incentive compensation under the
Revenue Sharing Agreement, which would be incurred between the Closing Date and
the point in time that the next full cycle of fee billings are collected and all
accrued "Stock Pickers Bonuses", so that after the Closing, Newco is
sufficiently capitalized with liquid current assets to operate on a freestanding
basis without investment of cash in Newco by UAM for the reasonably foreseeable
future. Fees earned by Newco following the Closing will be realizable in cash
so that all future operating expenses of Newco can be met without investment of
cash in Newco by UAM and UAM's Share of Revenues can be paid to UAM promptly
after the collection of fees by Newco.

9.16 HEALTH. Each person listed on Schedule 3.28 shall be in good
physical health.

41

records, including without limitation the work papers of its bookkeepers and
accountants, as may be required by UAM in connection with UAM's obligation, if
any, to file a report of its acquisition of the business and assets of PIC
hereunder with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K and, in the
sole judgment of UAM, UAM shall be in a position timely to file such report.

9.19 HART-SCOTT-RODINO FILING. The provisions of the "Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act" shall have been complied with to the satisfaction of UAM or, in UAM's
judgment, an exemption from the requirements of such section shall be available
for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.20 EXCHANGE LISTING. The New York Stock Exchange shall have notified
UAM that the Exchange has approved UAM's application to list upon official
notice of issuance the shares of UAM Common Stock issuable in connection with
this Agreement.

is not an advisee, investment advisory customer, or client of PIC or Newco. The
term "Present Client" shall mean at any particular time any person or entity who
is at such time an advisee, an investment advisory customer, or client of PIC or

such period or such area should be adjudged unreasonable in any judicial

and during such period of time as are adjudged to be reasonable.

any person in order to avoid a breach of the terms of any lease, contract or

11.5 COMPLIANCE WITH HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT. PIC and each Stockholder
covenant that from and after the Closing each shall comply with any applicable
provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

11.6 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS. PIC, the Stockholders and Newco shall
maintain in good condition all presently existing files, books, records and
documents of PIC, and shall make the same available to each other or their
designees upon request, for the periods of time and in the locations required by
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
including without limitation regulation Section 275.204-2.

After the Closing, the parties shall cooperate to comply with Sections
15(f) and 16(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as they apply to the Funds
listed on Schedule 1.3A as of the Closing and generally to comply with the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as they
apply to Newco, PIC, UAM and the clients of PIC.

11.7 USE OF NAME "PROVIDENT INVESTMENT COUNSEL" The parties hereto shall
cooperate to change PIC's name to a name not confusingly similar to "Provident
Investment Counsel " and to change Newco's name to "Provident Investment
Counsel, Inc." effective as of the Closing Date. PIC and the Stockholders
acknowledge and agree that UAM is acquiring the exclusive use of the name
"Provident Investment Counsel" for which the Stockholders will receive full and
adequate compensation, and that none of the Stockholders will use that name or
any similar name subsequent to the Closing except in connection with activities
performed for Newco.

11.8 OPTIONS. UAM shall recommend to the Compensation Committee of its
Board of Directors that options be issued under UAM's Incentive Stock Option
Plan with respect to an aggregate of 150,000 shares of UAM's Common Stock to be
awarded to employees of Newco as soon as practicable following the Closing Date
with an exercise price equal to the market value of UAM's Common Stock on the
date of grant.

11.9 STATUTORY COMPLIANCE. For a period of three years following the
Closing Date, Newco and PIC agree that they will each use their best efforts to
ensure that (i) at least 75% of the members of the Board of Directors of each
Fund which (either prior or subsequent to the Closing) has entered into a New
Fund Agreement will not be "interested persons" (as such term is defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940) of UAM, Newco or PIC and (ii) nothing within
their reasonable control will cause the imposition of an "unfair burden" (as
such term is defined in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940) on
any of the Funds listed on the Original Schedule or the Revised Schedule.

11.10 EXTENSION BONUS PAYMENT. Under the terms of Schedule 2 to the
Employment Agreements attached hereto as Exhibits E-4 and E-5, Newco is
obligated to make bonus payments out of the Pool referred to therein. To the
extent that such Pool exceeds the

48

<PAGE>

Operating Income Cap (as defined therein), UAM shall contribute such excess in
cash to Newco as a capital contribution at such time as the relevant bonus
payments are due to such employees.

11.11 UAM CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION. Immediately following the Closing, UAM
shall contribute cash to Newco in the amount of $1,750,000 for the purpose of
funding the payments due on the Closing Date to the employees under the
Employment Agreements attached hereto as Exhibit E-5.

11.12 EMPLOYEES; EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

(a) Newco shall offer employment to all employees of PIC
identified on Schedule 3.16 . To the extent permitted under applicable law,
Newco's offer of employment shall include employee benefits at least
substantially equivalent to those applicable to each such employee immediately
before the Closing Date based on those Benefit Plans described on Schedule 3.20
hereto; provided, however, that Newco shall have no obligation with respect to
retirement benefits other than to become a participating employer in the United
Asset Management Corporation Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan (the "UAM 401(k)
Plan"). Effective as of the Closing Date, all such employees will become
employees of Newco ("Hired Employees").

(b) In any termination or layoff by Newco of any Hired Employee
after the Closing, Newco will comply fully, if applicable, with the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN") and all other
applicable Federal, state and local laws, including those prohibiting
discrimination and requiring notice.

(c) On the Closing Date, PIC shall transfer and Newco shall
assume and will have responsibility for PIC's 401(k) Plan, and Newco will be
deemed a successor employer to PIC with respect to such plan. Assets held in
trust for such plan shall be transferred to any relevant plan adopted or
maintained by Newco.

(d) As of the Closing Date, and without any waiting period,
Newco will provide all Hired Employees (and their dependents) with medical
benefit coverage under plans maintained or established by Newco, to the extent
reasonably available on a basis comparable to the existing coverage and
consistent with Newco's obligations under this Section 11.12. As to any Hired
Employee (or a dependent thereof) who was covered by PIC's medical plans as of
the Closing, to the extent permitted under the coverage provided pursuant to the
preceding sentence, Newco will waive any pre-existing condition exclusions
contained in the applicable medical plans and consider any monies paid under
PIC's medical and dental plans by Hired Employees (or their dependents) prior to
the Closing Date toward any deductibles, co-pays or other maximums under Newco's
medical and dental plan for the first plan year after the Closing Date. Newco
will be responsible for satisfying its obligations under Section 601 et seq. of
ERISA and Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of

49

<PAGE>

1986, as amended (the "Code"), to provide continuation coverage ("COBRA") to any
Hired Employee in accordance with law.

(e) As of the Closing Date, Newco will assume all obligations of
PIC to Hired Employees for any vacation entitlement and vacation pay
entitlement, regardless of whether such obligations have been accrued on the
books of the business. Newco shall provide vacation benefits (including,
without limitation, vacation entitlement and vacation pay entitlement) to Hired
Employees in accordance herewith.

(f) Newco will provide each Hired Employee with full credit for
such Hired Employee's service with PIC prior to the Closing for purposes of any
participation or eligibility requirement and for purposes of vesting under the
UAM 401(k) Plan,, and for purposes of any eligibility, participation, vesting or
similar requirement for retirees medical (including, without limitation,
dental), life insurance, medial, severance pay, incentive compensation and
vacation benefits, if any. Newco shall fully vest all participants in the PIC
401(k) plan no later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date.

(g) Any liabilities, costs or expenses incurred by PIC or Newco
associated with the termination by Newco of any Hired Employees, shall be the
responsibility of Newco. Any liabilities, costs or expenses incurred by PIC or
Newco associated with the termination by PIC of any PIC employees shall be the
responsibility of PIC.

(h) Neither Newco nor PIC intend this Section 11.12 to create
any rights or interest, except as between Newco and PIC, and no present or
future employees of either party (or any dependents of such employees) will be
treated as third party beneficiaries in or under this Agreement.

(i) All costs and expenses incurred by Newco in complying with
the terms of this Section 11.12 shall be paid out of Newco's Share of Revenues
under the Revenue Sharing Agreement.
