FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

MELLON ANNOUNCES $130 MILLION ONE-TIME CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO 
REPOSITION CLIENTS' SECURITIES LENDING INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS

PITTSBURGH, NOV. 28, 1994 -- Mellon Bank Corporation today
announced that it expects to take a one-time, after-tax charge of 
approximately $130 million against its fourth quarter 1994 earnings
as a result of actions it will undertake on behalf of its
securities lending clients. These actions will reduce the interest 
rate sensitivity of certain clients' securities lending portfolios
in light of current market conditions.

Mellon said it expects to arrange for a third party to enter into 
interest rate swap contracts that will convert the income generated
by certain securities lending collateral investments to a
short-term floating rate. The securities lending portfolios 
involved were managed primarily by an investment unit of The Boston
Company, which Mellon acquired in May 1993.

Mellon said the charge to earnings, which reflects the estimated 
cost of the transactions, is expected to reduce 1994 earnings by 
approximately 88 cents per common share. After the charge, Mellon 
expects to report a profit in the fourth quarter of 1994. The 
action taken by Mellon is not expected to have any effect on 1995
earnings. Mellon said that, after taking the charge, it will 
remain the highest capitalized large bank holding company, with 
an equity to total assets ratio of approximately 9.4 percent. This 
ranking is based upon the 25 largest bank holding companies in 
the United States, using Sept. 30, 1994 figures.

"We have initiated this action unilaterally for the benefit of our clients
because we determined that the interest rate sensitivity of certain client
portfolios is not appropriate under current conditions for the unique
requirements of the securities lending business," said Frank V. Cahouet,
chairman, president and chief executive officer of Mellon Bank Corporation.
"We have managed client portfolios so they have a high degree of credit
quality. In light of the sharp rise in interest rates, however, we believe our
decision to change the income characteristics of these securities lending
portfolios is in the best interests of our clients and shareholders and
reflects Mellon's continued commitment to the institutional trust and custody
businesses."

Under a securities lending program, banks, acting as agent on behalf of
their trust and custody clients, lend participating clients' securities 
primarily to broker-dealers that periodically need these securities. Agents
typically receive cash collateral from the borrowing brokers--paying an
overnight interest rate for the use of cash--and then invest this cash
collateral in fixed-income investment securities. Clients benefit when returns
from these investment securities exceed interest paid to the brokers for use of
their cash.

With balance sheet assets of approximately $39 billion and assets under
management or administration of more than $850 billion, Mellon Bank 
Corporation is a major financial services company headquartered in Pittsburgh.
