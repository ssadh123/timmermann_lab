Ladies and Gentlemen:

Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation and formerly
known as First Alabama Bancshares, Inc. (the "Company"), proposes from time to
time to enter into one or more Terms Agreementss (each a "Terms Agreement") in
the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties
thereto may determine and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein
and therein, to issue and sell to the firm or firms named in Schedule I to the
applicable Terms Agreement (such firm or firms constituting the "Underwriters"
with respect to such Terms Agreement and the securities specified therein)
certain of its debt securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to
such Terms Agreement (such Securities, as so specified in such Terms Agreement,
being herein sometimes referred to as the "Designated Securities"), less the
principal amount of Designated Securities covered by Delayed Delivery
Contracts, if any, as provided in Section 3 hereof and as may be specified in
Schedule II to such Terms Agreement (such Designated Securities to be covered
by Delayed Delivery Contracts, as so specified in such Terms Agreement, being
herein sometimes referred to as "Contract Securities" and the Designated
Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters (after giving effect to the
deduction, if any, for Contract Securities) being herein sometimes referred to
as the "Underwriters' Securities").

The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated
Securities shall be as specified in the Terms Agreement relating thereto and in
or pursuant to the indenture dated as of December 1, 1992 (such indenture,
together with any indentures supplemental thereto, being herein referred to as
the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bankers Trust Company, as trustee
(the "Trustee").
<PAGE> 2
1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made
from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom CS First
Boston Corporation, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corporation will act as the representatives (the "Representatives").
This Underwriting Agreement (the "Agreement") shall not be construed as an
obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of
any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the
Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of
the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the
Terms Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein.
Each Terms Agreement shall state the aggregate principal amount of such
Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated
Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated
Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the
principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each
Underwriter, whether any of such Designated Securities shall be covered by
Delayed Delivery Contracts (as defined in Section 3 hereof), and the fee
payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date,
time, and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment
therefor. The Terms Agreement also shall specify (to the extent not set forth
in the registration statement and the prospectus with respect thereto and the
Indenture) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Terms Agreement shall be
in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts) and may be
evidenced by an exchange of facsimile transmissions. Each Terms Agreement
shall be deemed to be an agreement by the Company and the Underwriters to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement. The obligations of the Underwriters
under this Agreement and each Terms Agreement shall be several and not joint.

2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees
with, each of the Underwriters that:

(a) The Company has filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations adopted by the
Commission thereunder (the "Securities Act Rules"), a registration statement
(Nos. 33-54225 and 22-21712) on Form S-3, including a prospectus relating to
the Securities, and has filed such amendments thereto and such amended
prospectuses as may have been required by the Commission in order to enable the
Commission to declare such registration statement effective. Such registration
statement, including all exhibits, as the same may have been amended or
supplemented from time to time prior to the date of any Terms Agreement, is
referred to herein as the "Registration Statement." Any preliminary prospectus
or preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities included as
part of the Registration Statement or filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the
Securities Act is referred to herein as a "Preliminary Prospectus." The
prospectus relating to the Securities, in the form in which it has most
recently been filed, or mailed for filing, with the Commission on or prior to
the date of this Agreement, is herein referred to as the "Prospectus." The
Registration Statement, as amended, has been declared effective under the
Securities Act by the Commission; and no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement

-2-
<PAGE> 3
has been issued, and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or
threatened by the Commission. Any reference herein to the Registration
Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus shall be deemed to
include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of
Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration
Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case
may be; any reference to any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus shall be deemed to
include any documents filed after the effective date of the Registration
Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case
may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), and so incorporated by reference; and any reference to the phrase
"Prospectus as amended or supplemented" shall be deemed to refer to the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented to describe the offering of a particular
series of Designated Securities in the form in which it is first filed, or
mailed for filing, with the Commission pursuant to an amendment to the
Registration Statement or Rule 424 under the Securities Act, including any
documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such filing or
mailing;

(b) The documents incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus, when they were filed with the Commission, conformed in all material
respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
of the Commission thereunder (the "Exchange Act Rules"), and any further
documents so filed and incorporated by reference, when they are filed with the
Commission, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Exchange Act Rules;

(c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus
conform, and any amendments or supplements thereto will conform, in all
material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
where applicable, and the Securities Act Rules and the Exchange Act Rules, as
applicable, and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to
the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of the applicable
filing date as to the Prospectus and any supplement or amendment thereto,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall
not apply to any statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of
Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities; when the
Registration Statement became effective the Indenture was, and at all times
thereafter the Indenture has been, and will be, duly qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"); and when the
Registration Statement became effective the Indenture conformed, and at all
times thereafter the Indenture has conformed, and will conform, in all material
respects to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act;

(d) Any contract, agreement, instrument, lease, license,
document, arrangement, or understanding required to be described in, to be
filed as an exhibit to, or

businesses as provided in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and as

(h) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed,
and delivered on behalf of the Company; upon execution and delivery of each
Terms Agreement by the Company, such Terms Agreement shall have been duly
authorized, executed, and delivered on behalf of the Company and, when executed
and delivered by the Representatives, will be a valid and legally binding
agreement of the Company in accordance with its terms; on the date of each
Terms Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities covered thereby, such
Designated Securities shall be duly authorized and, when such Designated
Securities are authenticated as contemplated by the Indenture and issued and
delivered in accordance with this Agreement and the Terms Agreement applicable
to such Designated Securities and, in the case of any Contract Securities,
pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts applicable to such Contract Securities,
will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued, and delivered and will
constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company in accordance
with their terms and will be entitled to the benefits provided by the

<PAGE> 5
Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles,
regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law;

(i) In the event that any of the Securities are purchased
pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, each of such Delayed Delivery Contracts
has been duly authorized by the Company and, when executed and delivered on
behalf of the Company and duly authorized, executed and delivered on behalf of
the purchaser thereunder, will constitute a valid and legally binding agreement
of the Company in accordance with its terms;

(j) There is no consent, approval, authorization, order,
registration, or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority
or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company which is
required for, and the absence of which would materially affect, the issue and

Indenture, except the registration under the Securities Act of the Securities,

consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations, or qualifications as may be
required under the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the public offering of the Securities by the Underwriters;

(k) Other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are
no legal, regulatory, governmental, or arbitration proceedings pending, or to
the best knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its

subsidiaries is the subject of such action or proceeding, which, if determined
adversely to the Company, are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect upon the general affairs, financial
position, net worth, or results of operations (on an annual basis) of the
Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole;

(l) The audited and unaudited financial statements
(including the related notes and schedules and any pro forma financial
information) included in, or incorporated by reference into, the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act, the Securities
Act Rules, the Exchange Act, and the Exchange Act Rules, and said financial
statements present fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its subsidiaries as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of
operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the periods
specified. Such financial statements and related notes and schedules and pro
forma financial information have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved. The selected consolidated financial

-5-
<PAGE> 6
data, the tables and financial and statistical data included in, or
incorporated by reference into, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
present fairly the information shown therein and have been derived from, and
are consistent with, the audited and unaudited consolidated financial
statements included in, or incorporated by reference into, the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus. The financial statements and related notes and
schedules and pro forma financial information included in, or incorporated by
reference into, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform to the
requirements of Regulation S-X of the Commission applicable thereto and present
fairly the information presented therein for the periods shown. The
statistical information required by Commission Industry Guide 3 ("Guide 3") to
be included in, or incorporated by reference into, the Registration Statement
and the Prospectus presents fairly the information set forth therein, is in
compliance with the Securities Act, the Securities Act Rules, and Guide 3, and
is consistent with the Company's consolidated financial statements incorporated
by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus;

(m) Ernst & Young LLP, who have certified certain of the
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, to
the best knowledge of the Company, are independent certified public accountants
as required by the Securities Act and the Securities Act Rules; and

(n) Since the respective dates as of which information is
given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented, there has not occurred any material adverse change in, or any
development involving a prospective material adverse change in, or having a
material adverse effect upon, the general affairs, financial position, net
worth, or results of operations (on an annual basis) of the Company and its
subsidiaries considered as a whole, other than as set forth or contemplated in
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.

3. Upon the execution of the Terms Agreement applicable
to any Designated Securities and the authorization by the Representatives of
the release of the Underwriters' Securities, the several Underwriters propose
to offer the Underwriters' Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions
set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and, in connection with
such offer or the sale of such Designated Securities, will use the Prospectus
as amended or supplemented, together with any amendment or supplement thereto,
that specifically describes such Designated Securities, in the form which has
been most recently distributed to them by the Company, only as permitted or
contemplated thereby, and will offer and sell such Designated Securities only
as permitted by the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws or
regulations of any jurisdiction. The Representatives will use their best
efforts to inform the Company when they have authorized the sale of the
Underwriters' Securities to the public and when they have been advised that
such Underwriters' Securities have been sold by the several Underwriters within
a reasonable period of time after such sales are completed.

-6-
<PAGE> 7
The Company may specify in Schedule II to the Terms Agreement
applicable to any Designated Securities that the Underwriters are authorized to
solicit offers to purchase Designated Securities from the Company pursuant to
delayed delivery contracts (herein called "Delayed Delivery Contracts"),
substantially in the form of Annex II attached hereto but with such changes
therein as the Representatives and the Company may authorize or approve. If so
specified, the Underwriters will endeavor to make such arrangements, and as
compensation therefor the Company will pay to the Representatives, for the
accounts of the Underwriters, at the Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4
hereof), such commission, if any, as may be set forth in such Terms Agreement.
Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, shall be with institutional investors of
the types described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and subject to
other conditions therein set forth. The Company will enter into a Delayed
Delivery Contract in each case in which the Underwriters have arranged for such
a contract and the Company has advised the Representatives of their approval of
the proposed sale of Contract Securities to the purchaser thereunder; provided,
however, that the minimum principal amount of Contract Securities covered by
any Delayed Delivery Contract (or the aggregate amount under Delayed Delivery
Contracts with related purchasers) shall be $1,000,000, and the aggregate
principal amount of all Contract Securities shall not exceed the maximum
aggregate principal amount specified in Schedule II to the Terms Agreement with
respect to the Designated Securities specified therein, unless the Company
otherwise shall agree in writing. However, if the aggregate principal amount
of Contract Securities requested for delayed delivery is less than the minimum
aggregate principal amount specified in such Schedule II, the Company will have
the right to reject all requests. Each Underwriter to whom Contract Securities
have been attributed will make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in
obtaining performance by the purchaser in accordance with the terms of the
Delayed Delivery Contract covering such Contract Securities, but no Underwriter
will have any liability in respect of the validity or performance of any
Delayed Delivery Contract.

The Company will notify the Representatives not later than 3:30 p.m.,
New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Time of Delivery
specified in the applicable Terms Agreement (or such other time and date as the
Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing), such notice to be
confirmed in writing prior to such Time of Delivery, of the principal amount of
Contract Securities and the name of, and principal amount thereof to be
purchased by, each purchaser. The principal amount of Contract Securities to
be deducted from the principal amount of Designated Securities to be purchased
by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement
applicable to such Designated Securities shall be, in each case, the principal
amount of Contract Securities of which the Company has been advised in writing
prior to the time of Delivery by the Representatives as having been attributed
to such Underwriter, provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the
amount of Contract Securities to be so deducted shall be, in each case, that
proportion of Contract Securities which the principal amount of Designated
Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Terms Agreement bears
to the total principal amount of the Designated Securities (rounded, as the
Representatives may determine, to the nearest $1,000 principal amount) and
that,

-7-
<PAGE> 8
subject to Section 8 hereof, the total principal amount of Underwriters'
Securities to be purchased by all of the Underwriters pursuant to such Terms
Agreement shall be the total principal amount of Designated Securities set
forth in Schedule I to such Terms Agreement, less the principal amount of the
Contract Securities.

4. Underwriters' Securities to be purchased by each
Underwriter pursuant to the Terms Agreement relating thereto shall be delivered
(to the extent practicable) in definitive form or in the form of one or more
global securities, as specified in such Terms Agreement by the Company to the
Representatives, for the account of such Underwriter, against payment of the
purchase price therefor by such Underwriter or on its behalf, by certified or
bank cashier's check or checks, payable to the order of the Company, or by wire
or internal bank transfer to an account specified by the Company, in the funds
specified in such Terms Agreement, all at the place and time and date specified
in such Terms Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the
Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date
being herein called the "Time of Delivery" for such Securities. If any
Underwriters' Securities are to be delivered in definitive form, the
Underwriters' Securities so delivered shall be in such authorized denominations
and shall be registered in such name or names as the Representatives shall
request in writing at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the Time of
Delivery. For the purpose of expediting the checking of such Securities by the
Representatives, the Company agrees to make such Securities available to the
Representatives not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the business
day next preceding the Time of Delivery at the office of the Representatives as
designated in Section II hereof. If any Underwriters' Securities are to be
delivered in global form, unless otherwise provided in the applicable Terms
Agreement, the Underwriters' Securities as delivered shall be deposited with,
or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company (the "Depositary") and registered
in the name of the Depositary's nominee.

Concurrently with the delivery of and payment for the Underwriters'
Securities, the Company will deliver to the Representatives for the accounts of
the Underwriters a check payable to the order of the Representatives in the
amount of any compensation payable by the Company to the Underwriters in
respect of any Delayed Delivery Contracts as provided in Section 3 hereof and
in the Terms Agreement relating to such Securities, or such amount may be
deducted from the amounts delivered pursuant to the preceding paragraph.

5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of
any Designated Securities:

(a) To make no amendment or any supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented after the
date of the Terms Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and prior to
the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities prior to having furnished
the Representatives with a copy of the proposed form thereof and having given
the Representatives a reasonable opportunity to review the same; to file
promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information

-8-
<PAGE> 9
statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to
Section 13(a), 13(c), 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act subsequent to the date
of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and for so long as the delivery of
a prospectus is required by law in connection with the offering or sale of such
Designated Securities and during such same period to advise the
Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when
any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or became effective
or any supplement to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any amended
Prospectus has been filed or mailed for filing, of the issuance of any stop
order by the Commission, of the suspension of the qualification of such
Designated Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the
initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any
request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or for additional
information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any
order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to such
Designated Securities or suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its
best efforts to obtain its withdrawal;

(b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the
Representatives reasonably may request in order to qualify such Designated
Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such states as
the Representatives may request and to continue such qualifications in effect
so long as necessary under such laws for the distribution of such Designated
Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be
required to qualify as a foreign corporation to do business, or to file a
general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction, and provided further
that the expense of maintaining any such qualification more than one year from
the date of the Terms Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities
shall be paid by the Underwriters;

(c) To furnish the Underwriters with copies of the
Registration Statement (excluding exhibits) and copies of the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may from time
to time reasonably request; and if, before a period of six (6) months shall
have elapsed after the date of the Terms Agreement applicable to such
Designated Securities and the delivery of a prospectus shall be at the time
required by law in connection with sales of any such Designated Securities,
either (i) any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as

misleading, or (ii) for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same
period to amend or supplement the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or to

prior written consent of the Representatives for a period beginning at the time
of execution of the Terms Agreement and ending the number of days after the

threatened by the Commission; the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made
by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities
(other than the financial statements and other accounting information contained
in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or
any further amendments or supplements thereto, or omitted therefrom, as to
which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material

accurate and fairly present the information required or purported to be shown;

(xii) Such counsel believe that the Registration

proceedings which, in their opinion, will not have a material adverse effect
upon the general affairs, financial position, net worth, or results of
operations (on an annual basis) of the Company and its subsidiaries considered
as a whole.

Such opinion may be made subject to the qualification that the enforceability
of the terms of the Indenture, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, and the
Designated Securities may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
or other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and by general equitable principles, regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

(c) Alston & Bird, counsel to the Underwriters, shall
have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion, dated the Time of
Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form satisfactory to the
Representatives in their reasonable judgment, to the effect that:

(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is
validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware, with corporate power under the laws of such State to own, lease,
and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented and as presently conducted;

(ii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under
the Trust Indenture Act, has been duly authorized, validly executed, and
delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms;

authorized by the Company; the Underwriters' Securities, when executed by the
Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and
delivered and paid for as provided in this Agreement and the applicable Terms

valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided

authenticated by the Trustee as aforesaid), when delivered and paid for as
provided in the Delayed Delivery Contracts, will have been duly issued under
the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company
entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;

-14-
<PAGE> 15
(iv) The documents incorporated by reference in
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements
and other accounting information contained or incorporated by reference therein
or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when
they were filed with the Commission, appeared on their face to be appropriately
responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the Exchange Act Rules;

(v) The Registration Statement has become
effective under the Securities Act, is still effective, and to the best
knowledge of such counsel, no proceedings for a stop order are pending or
threatened;

(vi) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus
as amended or supplemented and any further amendments or supplements thereto
made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities
(other than the financial statements and other accounting information contained
in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or
any further amendments or supplements thereto, or omitted therefrom, as to
which such counsel need express no opinion) appear on their face to be
appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Securities Act Rules;

(vii) The Indenture and the Designated Securities
conform with the descriptions thereof contained in the Registration Statement
and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in all material respects; and

Such opinion may be made subject to the qualification that the enforceability
of the terms of the Indenture and the Designated Securities may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar laws relating to or
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law.

(d) (i) At the time of execution of this Agreement,
Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter dated
the latest effective date of the Registration Statement; (ii) at the time of
execution of the Terms Agreement for such Designated Securities, Ernst & Young
LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter dated the date of such
Terms Agreement; and (iii) at the Time of Delivery for such Designated
Securities, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a
letter dated such Time of Delivery; in each case in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Representatives to the effect set forth in Annex III hereto
and, with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other
matters as the Representatives reasonably

-15-
<PAGE> 16
may request as shall be referred to in Schedule II to the Terms Agreement
applicable to such Designated Securities;

(e) Since the respective dates as of which information is
given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented, there shall not have occurred any material adverse change, or any
development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting
the general affairs, financial position, net worth, or results of operations
(on an annual basis) of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole,
otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, which in any such case makes it
impracticable or inadvisable in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives
to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated
Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;

(f) Since the time of execution of the Terms Agreement
applicable to the Designated Securities, there shall not have occurred (i) any
downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company by any
"nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for
purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act), or any public announcement
that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any
debt securities of the Company (other than an announcement with positive
implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible
downgrading, of such rating), (ii) any suspension or limitation of trading in
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum
prices for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of any
securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market,
(iii) any banking moratorium declared by Federal or New York authorities, or
(iv) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States
is involved, any declaration of war by Congress, or any other substantial
national or international calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of a
majority in interest of the Underwriters, including any Representatives, the
effect of any such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity, or emergency
makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the public
offering or the sale of and payment for the Designated Securities; and

(g) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be
furnished to the Representatives, at the Time of Delivery for such Designated
Securities, certificates in form satisfactory to them in their reasonable
judgment to the effect that: (i) the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of such Time
of Delivery as though made at and as of such Time of Delivery; (ii) the Company
has duly performed, in all material respects, all obligations required to be
performed by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement at or prior to such
Time of Delivery; (iii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has
been initiated or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the
Commission and all requests for additional information on the part of the
Commission have been complied with or otherwise satisfied;

-16-
<PAGE> 17
and (iv) at and as of such Time of Delivery the Registration Statement (and the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented) did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided,
however, that no such certificate shall apply to any statements or omissions
made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing
to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use
therein.

The obligations of the Company and the Underwriters of any
Designated Securities under the Terms Agreement applicable to such Designated
Securities are subject to the additional condition that there shall have been
furnished to the Company and such Underwriters, at the Time of Delivery for
such Designated Securities, such certificates of officers as, in the reasonable
judgment of the Representatives and the Company, shall be appropriate to
indicate that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered
by the Trustee.

7. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless
each Underwriter of the applicable Designated Securities against any losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter
may become subject with respect to such Designated Securities, under the
Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the
Registration Statement, or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any
amendment or supplement thereto with respect to such Designated Securities, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such Underwriter for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent
that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability arises out of or is based upon
an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated
Securities through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and provided,
further, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter of
Designated Securities or any person controlling such Underwriter under the
indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any of such
documents to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability of such
Underwriter or controlling person results from the fact that such Underwriter
sold such Designated Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or
given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, if required by
law, a copy of the Prospectus or of the Prospectus as then amended or
supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference), whichever is most
recent, if the Company previously has furnished copies thereof to such
Underwriter.

-17-
<PAGE> 18
The indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) shall be in addition to
any liability which the Company otherwise may have and shall extend, upon the
same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter
within the meaning of the Securities Act.

(b) Each Underwriter of the applicable Designated
Securities will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the
Company against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities to which the
Company may become subject with respect to such Designated Securities, under
the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the
Registration Statement, or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any
amendment or supplement thereto with respect to such Designated Securities, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission was made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such
Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein and will
reimburse the Company for any legal fees or other expenses reasonably incurred
by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or
claim.

The indemnity agreement in this subsection (b) shall be in addition to
any liability which the Underwriters otherwise may have and shall extend, upon
the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and
to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the
Securities Act.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
subsection (a) or (b) immediately above of written notice of the commencement
of any action, such indemnified party, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, shall notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, and in the event
that such indemnified party shall not so notify the indemnifying party within
thirty (30) days following receipt of any such notice by such indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall have no further liability under such
subsection to such indemnified party unless such indemnifying party shall have
received other notice addressed and delivered in the manner provided in the
second paragraph of Section 11 hereof of the commencement of such action; but
the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such
subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified
party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the
extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such
indemnified

-18-
<PAGE> 19
party in its reasonable judgment, and after notice from the indemnifying party
to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such
subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7
is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) immediately
above in respect of any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received
by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated
Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which
such loss, claim, damage, or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates.
If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is
not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute
to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative
fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated
Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the
other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds
from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to
the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters,
in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented with respect to such Designated Securities. The
relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
the Company or such Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission, including, with respect to any such Underwriter, the extent to which
such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
result from the fact that such Underwriter sold such Designated Securities to a
person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written
confirmation of such sale, if required by law, a copy of the Prospectus or of
the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents
incorporated by reference), whichever is most recent, if the Company previously
has furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter. The Company and the
Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if
the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or
payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this
subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending any such action or claim.

-19-
<PAGE> 20
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any
damages which such Underwriter otherwise has been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or allegedly untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of
the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute
are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with
respect to such Securities and not joint.

8. If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to
purchase the Underwriters' Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the
Terms Agreement applicable to such Securities, the Representatives may in their
discretion arrange for themselves or for another party or other parties to
purchase such Underwriters' Securities on the terms contained herein. If
within thirty-six (36) hours after such default by any Underwriter the
Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Underwriters'
Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of
thirty-six (36) hours within which to procure another party or other parties to
purchase such Underwriters' Securities on such terms. In the event that,
within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the
Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Underwriters'
Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged
for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities, the Representatives or the
Company, respectively, shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery
for such Underwriters' Securities for a period of not more than seven (7) days
in order to effect whatever changes thereby may be made necessary in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any
other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented which in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters
referred to in Section 6(c) hereof and counsel for the Company referred to in
Section 6(b) hereof thereby may be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as
used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section
with like effect as if it originally had been a party to the Terms Agreement
with respect to such Designated Securities. In the event that neither the
Representatives nor the Company arrange for another party or parties to
purchase such Underwriters' Securities as provided in this Section, the Company
shall have the right to require each nondefaulting Underwriter to purchase and
pay for the Underwriters' Securities which such nondefaulting Underwriter
agreed to purchase under the Terms Agreement relating to such Designated
Securities and, in addition, to require each such nondefaulting Underwriter to
purchase the Underwriters' Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters shall have so failed to purchase up to an amount thereof equal to
10% of the principal amount of the Underwriters' Securities which such
nondefaulting Underwriter otherwise has agreed to purchase under the Terms
Agreement relating to such Designated Securities; provided, however, that if
the aggregate principal amount of Underwriters'

-20-
<PAGE> 21
Securities which any such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters shall have so
failed to purchase is more than one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount
of the Designated Securities, then the Terms Agreement relating to such
Designated Securities will be terminated without liability on the part of any
nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses referred to
in Section 5(f) hereof and the indemnification provided in Section 7 hereof;
but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for
its default.

9. The respective indemnities, agreements,
representations, warranties, and other statements of the Underwriters and the
Company hereunder, as set forth in this Agreement or made by them,
respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and

which the most recent report filed with the Commission containing financial
statements disclosed have occurred or may occur or which are described in each

[REVERSE SIDE]

This Note is issued under an Indenture, dated as of December 1, 1992,
(herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bankers Trust Company,
as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor
trustee under the Indenture), and represents the aggregate principal amount of
the duly authorized issue of the series of 7 3/4 % Subordinated Notes Due 2024
issued by the Company under the Indenture (herein called "this Series"),
limited in aggregate principal amount to $100,000,000. Every reference herein
to Securities of this Series also applies specifically to this Note. Reference
is made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for the
declaration of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee, the holders of Senior
Indebtedness, and the holders of Securities of this Series and of the terms
upon which Securities of this Series are, and are to be, authenticated and
delivered.

The indebtedness evidenced by the Securities of this Series is
subordinate and junior in right of payment of principal and interest and in all
other respects to the Company's obligations to holders of "Senior Indebtedness"
of the Company. Senior Indebtedness is defined in the Indenture to include all
indebtedness and other obligations of the Company to its creditors, whether
outstanding on the date of execution of the Indenture or thereafter created,
assumed, or incurred, including but not limited to (i) the principal of, and
premium, if any, and interest on all indebtedness for money borrowed, (ii) all
obligations to make payment pursuant to the terms of financial instruments
(including securities contracts, derivative instruments, option contracts, and
similar financial instruments), (iii) any indebtedness or obligations of others
of the kind described in either (i) or (ii) above for the payment of which the
Company is responsible or liable as guarantor or otherwise, and (iv) any
deferrals, renewals, or extensions of any such Senior Indebtedness, except
Subordinated Indebtedness. Securities of this Series are issued subject to the
provisions of the Indenture regarding subordination to Senior Indebtedness.
Each holder of this Note, and each owner of a beneficial interest in Securities
of this Series, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by such
provisions, authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such
action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so
provided, and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such
purposes.

If an Acceleration Event (defined generally in the Indenture as
certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings or reorganization
of the Company) shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities
of this Series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the
effect provided in the Indenture. The principal of the Securities of this
Series may not be declared due and payable upon an Event of Default (as

4
<PAGE> 5
defined in the Indenture) other than an Event of Default which also constitutes
an Acceleration Event.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the holders of Securities of this Series to be
effected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with
the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities of this Series. The Indenture also includes
provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount
of the Securities of this Series, on behalf of the holders of all such
Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal and interest on the Securities
of this Series herein provided, and at the time, place and rate and in the coin
or currency herein prescribed.

Securities of this Series are initially issued only in the form of a
Global Security, and will not be exchanged for Securities in definitive
registered form except under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in
the Indenture. Securities of this Series are issuable in denominations of
$1,000 and integral multiples thereof, will not be redeemable by the Company,
in whole or in part, prior to the Date of Maturity and do not provide for any
sinking fund.

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of a permitted
transfer, the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
will treat the person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner for
purposes of payment of principal and, subject to certain provisions in the
Indenture, interest, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the
Company, the Trustee, nor any agent shall be affected by notice to the
contrary. For any other purpose under the Indenture, the Company, the Trustee,
and any agent of the Company and any agent of the Trustee shall treat a person
as the holder of such principal amount of the Securities of this Series as
shall be specified in a written statement of the Depository (or of a successor
depository under the Indenture) which is provided to the Trustee by the
Depository or successor depository.

This Note may be surrendered for registration of transfer, or
exchange, subject to the terms of the Indenture, at the Corporate Trust Office
of the Trustee in the City of New York, at the principal office of the Company
in Birmingham, Alabama, or at the office of a successor Security Registrar or
of a transfer agent as may be designated by the Company from time to time.

holder hereof, a new Note or Notes of any authorized denominations as requested
by such registered holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to, and in
exchange for, the unredeemed portion of the principal of this Note being

The indebtedness evidenced by the Securities of this Series is

of this Series, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by such
provisions, authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such
action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so
provided, and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such
purposes.

certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings or reorganization
of the Company) shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities
of this Series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the

provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount
of the Securities of this Series, on behalf of the holders of all such
Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.
