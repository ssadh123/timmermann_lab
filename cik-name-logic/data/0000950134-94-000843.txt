INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On July 13, 1994, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of March 24, 1994 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Registrant, KNE
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("KNE Acquisition") and
American Oil and Gas Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("AOG"), KNE
Acquisition was merged with and into AOG. KNE Acquisition had been formed by
the Registrant in February 1994, as its wholly owned subsidiary, for the
purpose of participating in the merger. As a result of the merger, each share
of common stock, $0.04 par value, of AOG (the "AOG Common Stock") outstanding
immediately before the merger was converted into 0.47 of a share of common
stock, $5.00 par value, of the Registrant("K N Common Stock") and the right to
receive in cash the value of any fractional share of KN Common Stock. The
stockholders of the Registrant and the shareholders of AOG approved the merger
on July 13, 1994. The determination of the exchange ratio of AOG Common Stock
for K N Common Stock was the result of negotiations between the managements of
the Registrant and AOG and the approval thereof by their respective boards of
directors.

The Merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests.

AOG operates principally in Texas in the mid-stream segment of the
natural gas industry, providing gathering, processing, transportation, storage
and marketing services between the wellhead and the end user. It is expected
that AOG will continue such business as a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Registrant.
