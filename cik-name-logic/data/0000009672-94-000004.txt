BANKAMERICA FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS

SAN FRANCISCO, January 19, 1994 -- BankAmerica Corporation today
reported 1993 earnings per share of $4.79, based on annual earnings of
$1,954 million. Reported earnings per share for 1992 were $4.24, based
on annual earnings of $1,492 million. The corporation's 1992 results
were affected by nonrecurring and certain other items. Excluding the
effects of these items, the corporation's results of operations for 1992
were $1,682 million, or $4.85 per common share.

Included in 1993 annual results were fourth-quarter earnings per
share of $1.21, based on quarterly earnings of $496 million. Earnings
per share for the third quarter of 1993 were $1.19, based on quarterly
earnings of $486 million, and earnings per share for the fourth quarter
of 1992 were $1.19, based on quarterly earnings of $473 million. 

"Although we are not fully satisfied with the corporation's
financial performance, we are encouraged by a number of events in 1993,"
Richard M. Rosenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said. "The
wholesale banking side of the corporation, including commercial,
corporate, and international banking, capital markets and corporate
finance, had the most successful year in the corporation's history, and
despite California's continuing economic concerns, the consumer side of 
our banking operations opened more accounts than ever before." 
Rosenberg cited five business units -- Seafirst, Residential Lending, 
U.S. Group, California Retail Banking, and Asia -- as being the strongest 
contributors to the corporation's earnings for 1993.

"Our employees performed superbly during the year, often in
difficult circumstances," Rosenberg continued. "We completed the
consolidation of Security Pacific operations and continued to diversify
the franchise, both geographically and in terms of products and
services. The challenge is to continue this positive momentum and to
improve our per-share earnings."

Results of Operations

Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 1993 was
$1,865 million, down $16 million from the amount reported in the
previous quarter. The fourth-quarter 1993 net interest margin was 
4.66 percent, down 8 basis points from the previous quarter. 

The provision for credit losses was $150 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1993, down $28 million from the amount reported in the 
previous quarter.

Noninterest income and expense increased $112 million and 
$126 million, respectively, from the amounts reported in the previous
quarter. Each of these increases was primarily attributable to various
nonrecurring items. Included in fourth-quarter 1993 noninterest income
were gains from sales of assets pending disposition of $80 million,
primarily resulting from a sale of certain real-estate-related assets. 
These gains were offset by a $90 million charge included in noninterest
expense relating to the accrual of various restructuring expenses. 

Credit Quality

During the fourth quarter of 1993, credit quality continued to
improve. Total nonaccrual assets decreased $1,042 million, or 
27 percent, primarily due to reductions in nonaccrual construction and
development loans secured by real estate, nonaccrual restructuring-
country-related loans, and nonaccrual commercial loans secured by real
estate. In addition, real estate acquired in satisfaction of debt
decreased $72 million between September 30, 1993 and December 31, 1993. 
During the fourth quarter of 1993, in-substance repossessions (ISR) were
reclassified to the loan portfolio as a result of regulatory
clarification of the definition of an ISR. Corresponding prior-period
amounts also have been reclassified.

Net credit losses for the fourth quarter of 1993 totaled
$212 million, down $24 million from the amount reported in the previous
quarter.

BankAmerica Corporation's results of operations reflect the effects of
the merger with Security Pacific Corporation from April 22, 1992
forward. Accordingly, the corporation's results of operations for the
year ended December 31, 1993 are not comparable to the corresponding
information for the year ended December 31, 1992.

accrual of restructuring expenses related to the merger and a
net gain on the sale of Bank of America NT&SA's payroll
processing business. If the nonrecurring and certain other
items had been excluded from the results of operations, net
income would have been $1,682 million. In addition, earnings
per common and common equivalent share would have been
$4.85 and earnings per common share-assuming full dilution
would have been $4.81.

/a/ Estimated.

/b/ This risk-based capital information is calculated in
accordance with the guidelines of the federal banking
regulators as they apply to the corporation beginning in
1993. Due to the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
(SFAS No. 109) in the first quarter of 1993, core deposit
intangibles (CDI) and other identifiable intangibles that
are normally deducted from Tier 1 capital under the current
guidelines are estimated to be $510 million higher at
December 31, 1993 and were $516 million higher at
September 30, 1993, with corresponding increases in deferred
taxes. The federal banking regulators have not issued final
capital regulations on the adoption of SFAS No. 109 and are
currently considering whether such increased intangibles
should be deducted from capital. Management believes that
the increased amounts of CDI and other identifiable
intangibles resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 109 do
not pose a risk to the corporation's capital and should not
be deducted from capital in determining capital ratios.
Pending final resolution of this issue by the banking
regulators, such amounts have not been deducted from capital
in determining the December 31, 1993 and September 30, 1993
capital ratios shown above.

/a/ In the first quarter of 1993, the corporation adopted SFAS
No. 109, which requires that the tax effects recorded in
connection with purchase accounting be recorded as part of
deferred income taxes rather than as part of the carrying
values of individual assets and liabilities. Therefore,
assets pending disposition balances at December 31, 1993 and
September 30, 1993 do not include net tax effects. For
comparability purposes, the December 31, 1992 balances 
have been presented after removing such tax effects. At 
December 31, 1992, net tax effects of $526 million included 
in assets pending disposition as reported in the consolidated 
balance sheet but excluded from this table related to the 
following categories of assets: commercial and industrial 
loans of $41 million, loans secured by real estate of 
$130 million, construction and development loans secured by 
real estate of $290 million, other loans of $5 million, 
foreign loans of $61 million, real estate acquired in 
satisfaction of debt of $73 million, and other assets of 
$(74) million.

/b/ Consists primarily of the estimated net realizable values
(NRV) of former assets of Security Pacific Corporation that
were identified for accelerated disposition as they were not
deemed essential to the operating goals of the corporation.

/c/ Includes loans with aggregate estimated NRVs of
$123 million, $192 million, and $1,158 million at
December 31, 1993, September 30, 1993, and December 31,
1992, respectively, which would have been on nonaccrual
status if they had been included in the corporation's loan
outstandings.

/d/ Includes subsidiaries and operations pending disposition of
$137 million, $138 million, and $820 million at December 31,
1993, September 30, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
respectively.

/e/ Represents certain nonaccrual loans related to borrowers in
restructuring countries that have been identified for
accelerated disposition.

/a/ During the fourth quarter of 1993, ISRs were reclassified to
the loan portfolio as a result of regulatory clarification of
the definition of an ISR. This clarification also resulted in
the reclassification of corresponding prior-period amounts.
ISRs reclassified to loans during the fourth quarter of 1993
were as follows: secured by first mortgages on residential
properties of $2 million, loans secured by real estate of
$148 million, construction and development loans secured by
real estate of $411 million, and other foreign of $7 million.
Loans previously reported as ISRs at September 30, 1993 and
December 31, 1992 that were reclassified to loans were as
follows: secured by first mortgages on residential properties
of $11 million and $14 million, respectively; loans secured
by real estate of $222 million and $211 million, respectively; 
construction and development loans secured by real estate of 
$650 million and $944 million, respectively; and other foreign 
of $10 million and $17 million, respectively.

/b/ Installment loans, individual lines of credit, and other
consumer loans included the following aggregate amounts that
were collateralized by junior mortgages on residential real
estate: $12,847 million at December 31, 1993, $13,117 million 
at September 30, 1993, and $13,870 million at December 31, 1992.
