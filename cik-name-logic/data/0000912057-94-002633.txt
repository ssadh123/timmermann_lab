ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On August 10 and August 12, 1994, PNS Inc. ("PNS"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Registrant, acquired an aggregate of $14.32 million principal
amount of its outstanding 12-1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes (the "Senior
Notes") for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7.7 million
(including on account of accrued and unpaid interest due July 15, 1994). In
order to finance such purchase, PSSC Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of PNS, sold mortgage certificates (having a book value of approximately $72
million and which secured financing ("Mortgage Financing") of approximately
$69 million) receiving net proceeds of approximately $3 million, after
repayment of the Mortgage Financing secured by such mortgage certificates.

As a result of the foregoing transactions, and giving effect to the
payment on August 12, 1994 of interest due July 15, 1994 on the Senior Notes
and the Registrant's 7-1/8% Convertible Debentures (the "Debentures"), the
Registrant's principal assets will consist of approximately $41.5 million
comprised primarily of mortgage certificates and related receivables and its
principal obligations will consist of approximately $40 million of Mortgage
Financing borrowings, leaving an approximately $1.5 million net difference
available for holders of the remaining $5.26 million of Senior Notes and
$28.67 million of Debentures. Accordingly, it is not expected that the
Registrant will have sufficient capital resources to meet its debt service
requirements and working capital needs for the next 12 months.
