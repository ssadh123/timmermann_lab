BORDEN TO RECORD CHARGES IN THIRD QUARTER

COLUMBUS, Ohio, October 5, 1994 -- Borden, Inc. (NYSE: BN) today said
that it expects to record pretax charges of $150 million to $200 million in its
third quarter 1994 results, scheduled to be announced October 26. 
Approximately $95 million of the amount relates to less-than-estimated
proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations. In its results for 
the fourth quarter of 1993, Borden had recorded an aggregate pretax charge of 
$637.4 million for estimated losses on these business disposals.
The 1994 third quarter charges include approximately $50 million for
transaction fees and other expenses, most of which relate to previously
disclosed fees to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., in connection with the
proposed merger with a KKR affiliate.
Third quarter results will also include charges for the writedown of
certain impaired assets, and the reversal of the unused portion of the 1993
restructuring charge for business re-engineering. Management reviewed the 1993
restructuring program in light of recent events and determined that a portion 
of the reserve for this project would not be utilized.
Borden said that the charges would lead to a net loss for the third
quarter of 1994. 
Aggregate cash flows from divestitures are expected to be essentially
in line with the amounts announced in January due to the anticipated sales of
non-core assets in addition to those included in discontinued operations. 
These sales are expected to generate a small aggregate net gain.
