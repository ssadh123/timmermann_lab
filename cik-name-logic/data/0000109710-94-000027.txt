CLARK EQUIPMENT'S MELROE UNIT FORMS
A JOINT VENTURE WITH JAPANESE FIRM

SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, August 31, 1994 -- Melroe Company, a North Dakota-
based business unit of Clark Equipment Company (NYSE: CKL), completed a
joint venture agreement to export Bobcat skid-steer loaders and
attachments manufactured in North Dakota and market them in Japan. The
new company, Marubeni Bobcat Sales Company, will be headquartered in
Yokohama, Japan. It will market a full line of Bobcat loaders and
establish a network of branches and dealerships throughout Japan under the
direction of Mr. Isao Owada, President, and Mr. Kirk Haws, Executive Vice
President of the joint venture.

Bobcat loaders were previously manufactured and sold in Japan by Toyo
Umpanki Co. (TCM) under a technical license agreement spanning 18 years.
In 1993, Melroe and TCM mutually agreed to terminate that agreement. Mr.
Haws said, "The name 'Bobcat' is highly recognized in the Japanese market. 
That fact, along with marketing, sales and product support from the United
States, makes this a very exciting business venture."

"There is a potentially large market for Melroe products in Japan,"
according to Mr. Chin Wah Ying, Melroe's International Sales Manager. He
added, "Thanks to our previous business experience in Japan, we are poised
and ready to take advantage of that demand."

Marubeni is one of the largest industrial trading companies in Japan, with
annual worldwide trading volume of over $150 billion. Melroe and Marubeni
have had business dealings for 17 years. Marubeni is the trading company
for Melroe purchases of Japanese-made components such as engines and
excavator under-carriages.

Mr. Haws is Melroe's representative director for the joint venture. Other
Melroe directors for the joint venture are Mr. Ying and Melroe Vice
President and Controller, Mr. Charles Hoge. Marubeni Corporation's
representative director is Mr. Isao Owada, and Messrs. Isao Ishikawa and
Hiroyuki Anabuki are its other two board members.

Melroe Company is a business unit of Clark Equipment Company, South Bend,
Indiana. Clark's business is the design, manufacture and sale of skid-
steer loaders, construction machinery, asphalt paving equipment, and axles
and transmissions for off-highway equipment.
