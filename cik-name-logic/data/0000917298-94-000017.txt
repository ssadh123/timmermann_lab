PRESS RELEASE

GENESCO ANNOUNCES RESTRUCTURING
PLAN AND REVISED CREDIT AGREEMENT

NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 4, 1994 - Genesco Inc. (NYSE: GCO) today

announced a restructuring plan designed to focus the Company's

operations on its footwear business.

The plan will involve charges of approximately $92.5

million. These charges will be included in the results for the

third fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31, 1994, which will be reported

later this month. They include estimated asset writedowns,

expenses associated with the closing of certain facilities and

employee related costs and benefits.

David M. Chamberlain, president and chief executive officer,

said implementation of the plan will begin immediately. "All 

phases are expected to be completed during the fiscal year ending

Jan. 31, 1996. The Company's on-going business lines will be

Johnston & Murphy, Jarman, Journeys, Dockers Footwear, Nautica

Footwear, Laredo Boot Company and Volunteer Leather Company. 

These operating units represented $392 million, or 68% the

Company's net sales of $573 million in the fiscal year ending

Jan. 31, 1994. As a result of the decision to strategically

focus on these business lines, we will be divesting both the

Mitre soccer business and University Brands children's shoes."

Chamberlain said, "Mitre is a recognized and successful

international brand in the growing worldwide soccer business. 

-more-
<PAGE>
Add one - Genesco

We believe its established reputation will make it an attractive

acquisition opportunity for a strategic buyer with international

expertise and financial resources."

"An important element of this restructuring also includes

the decision to divest the men's tailored clothing business. 

Although our Greif and GCO Apparel operations contributed $105.0

million in sales in fiscal 1994, the capital now invested in the

apparel business can be more productively employed in our

footwear operations."

Chamberlain added, "We are actively exploring alternatives

which will result in the continuation of the Greif tailored

clothing line and the Career Apparel and GCO Apparel Businesses

through the operations of others."

The Company also announced that the current limit of its

revolving credit agreement has been reduced from $100 million to

$65 million to reflect the downsizing and the borrowing

requirements of the ongoing footwear operations. Genesco

presently has outstanding borrowings and commitments totalling

approximately $44 million through that credit facility. Certain

covenants of the credit agreement have also been adjusted to

reflect the impact of the restructuring charge on the third

quarter results as well as the expected future performance of the

continuing businesses. The limit under the credit agreement will

be reduced to $50 million following April 1995, and is subject to

further reductions in case of certain asset sales. The

expiration of the amended agreement remains August 1996.

Genesco, headquartered in Nashville, is a consumer products

company which manufactures and markets footwear.
