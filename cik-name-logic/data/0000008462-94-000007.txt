AUGAT ANNOUNCES SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT DECISION

MANSFIELD, Mass., April 13, 1994 - Augat Inc. (NYSE: AUG)
today announced that on April 12, 1994, the state Supreme
Judicial Court vacated a 1992 Superior Court judgment which had
awarded Augat Inc. compensatory damages of $14,140,000. That
award was doubled pursuant to Chapter 93A, and the resulting
final judgment included attorney's fees and interest on the award
at the rate of one percent per month, beginning in May 1985. The
award was not recorded in the company's previously reported
earnings.
Although it let stand its earlier decision that the conduct
of defendants Aegis, Inc. and Jeremy Scherer was a knowing
violation of the state unfair trade practices statute, the Court
rejected the Superior Court's finding that the profits of
Isotronics, Inc., Augat's former subsidiary, were affected for
twenty-seven months by the departure of three employees and held
that the impact of those departures was limited to six months.
The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Superior Court
and included in its opinion instructions to the Superior Court
about how to recalculate the damage award, taking into account,
among other things, the six-month damages period and certain
losses resulting from causes unrelated to the departures. The
award will be reduced when recalculated according to the
instructions of the Court.

"Augat is evaluating its options including the possibility
that the company will ask the Supreme Judicial Court to
reconsider its decision," stated Marcel P. Joseph, Chairman of
the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Joseph concluded, "This
decision will not impact Augat's first quarter or full-year
earnings results".
One of the largest manufacturers of connector products in
the world, Augat Inc., is pursuing a strategy for growth in the
automotive, computer, industrial and telecommunications markets,
through customer partnerships, new product introductions,
strategic acquisitions and ongoing productivity measures.
