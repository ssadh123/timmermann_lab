Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors
Centrum Communications, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Centrum
Communications, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrum Technology
Corporation) as of September 30, 1993 and 1992, and the related
statements of operations, shareholder's equity (deficit), and cash
flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Centrum
Communications, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrum Technology
Corporation) as of September 30, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Financial Statements

September 30, 1993 and 1992

(1) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

(a) The Company

Centrum Communications, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated
in California in July 1991 to engage in the development,
manufacturing, and marketing of remote access products and
technology. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Centrum Technology Corporation (CTC), a company incorporated
in the Republic of China.

(b) Basis of Presentation

As of September 30, 1992, the Company was a development
stage company and, accordingly, directed its efforts and
resources towards product and market planning, and research
and development activities. As such, the accompanying
statement of operations for the year ended September 30,
1992, should not be regarded as typical for normal years of
operation. The Company commenced manufacturing and shipping
product in September 1992 and, consequently, is no longer
considered a development stage company as of September 30,
1993. The Company continues to expend significant resources
on product research and development.

(c) Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with
banks and certificates of deposit with maturities of three
months or less.

(d) Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-
out method) or market and consist primarily of finished
goods.

(e) Property and Equipment

Equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the respective assets, ranging from three to five years.
Purchased software is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful life of three years.

CENTRUM COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
(A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Centrum Technology Corporation)

Notes to Financial Statements

September 30, 1993 and 1992

(f) Income Taxes

The Company elected to adopt Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires an asset and liability
approach for financial reporting of income taxes. Under the
asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are
recognized for the tax consequences of "temporary
difference" by applying enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of
existing assets and liabilities.

(g) Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized upon product shipment to customers
with an appropriate allowance for any anticipated returns.

(h) Development Costs

Development costs incurred in the research and development
of new software products and enhancements to existing
software products are expensed as incurred until
technological feasibility has been established. Through
September 30, 1993, the Company's software development has
been essentially completed concurrently with the
establishment of technological feasibility, and accordingly,
no costs have been capitalized to date.

(i) Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the accompanying 1992 financial
statements have been reclassified to conform with the 1993
financial statement presentation.

(2) Related Parties

The Company purchases all inventory from the parent company, CTC.
As of September 30, 1993 and 1992, the intercompany payable to
CTC for inventory purchases was $894,400 and $28,400,
respectively.

Notes to Financial Statements

September 30, 1993 and 1992

(3) Property and Equipment

A summary of property and equipment follows:

1993 1992

Equipment $301,300 $62,000
Purchased software 89,300 48,000

390,600 110,000
Less accumulated depreciation
and amortization 102,000 22,600

$288,600 $87,400

(4) Income Taxes

Income tax expense consists of the minimum California franchise
tax for the years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992.

For federal income tax purposes, the Company has net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $2,900,000, which expire in
the tax years 2006 through 2008. For California income tax
purposes, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $1,400,000. The difference between the net
operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes and
for California income tax purposes results primarily from a 50%
limitation on the California loss carryforwards.

As of September 30, 1993, the Company has federal and state gross
deferred tax assets of approximately $1,000,000 and $300,000,
respectively, which were fully offset by a valuation allowance of
$1,300,000.

The Company's ability to utilize the net operating loss
carryforwards and research credit carryforwards may be subject to
certain limitations upon a change in ownership of the Company as
defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 382.

2. Plan Of Reorganization.

2.1 The Merger.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Agreement of Merger, Sub shall be merged with
and into Centrum in a statutory merger pursuant to the Agreement
of Merger and in accordance with applicable provisions of
California law so that:

(i) Each share of common stock of Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall continue to be
issued and shall be converted into one share of Centrum Common
Stock outstanding after the Merger; and

(ii) Each share of Centrum Common Stock and
of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time,
other than the shares held by holders who perfect their
dissenter's rights under California law with respect thereto
("Dissenters' Shares"), shall, by virtue of the Merger, and
without further action on the part of any holder thereof, be
canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Centrum Share Price. Such cash amount shall
be payable in two installments, (i) the first payable at or as
promptly after the Closing as is practicable and in an amount
equal to 19/36 of the Centrum Share Price, and (ii) the second
payable on the date six months after the Closing and in an amount
equal to 17/36 of the Centrum Share Price. The aggregate cash
payment to be made to the holders of Centrum Common Stock and
Preferred Stock as described above in clause (i) is referred to
herein as the "First Payment," and the aggregate cash payment to
be made to the holders of Centrum Common Stock and Preferred
Stock as described above in clause (ii) is referred to herein as
the "Second Payment."

(iii) Each Option outstanding at the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further
action on the part of any option holder, be assumed by 3Com at
the Effective Time. The Options assumed by 3Com will continue to
be on the terms and conditions set forth in the respective option
agreements, except that: (i) the Option shall be exercisable for
a number of shares of 3Com Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of Centrum Common Stock subject to such Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Centrum Share Price and the denominator
of which is the 3Com Closing Price (with the resulting number of
shares of 3Com Common Stock rounded down to the nearest whole
number), (iii) the per share exercise price shall be an amount
equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Option prior to the
Merger divided by the number of shares of 3Com Common Stock
subject to such Option rounded up to the nearest whole cent, and
(iv) continuous employment with Centrum, whether occurring before
or after the Effective Time, shall be credited to an optionee for
purposes of determining the number of shares subject to exercise,
vesting or repurchase after the Effective Time. It is the
intention of the parties that the assumption of Options shall
meet the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and that
therefore the Options assumed by 3Com qualify following the
Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in
Section 422 of the Code ("incentive stock options") to the extent
the Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the
Effective Time. After the Effective Time, 3Com shall issue to
each holder of an outstanding Option a document evidencing the
foregoing assumption by 3Com. Such option assumption agreements
will provide a mechanism for withholding or placing into escrow
[** ] of the shares of 3Com Common Stock issuable
under such options, or the proceeds thereof, as provided in
Section 8.3. No fractional shares of 3Com Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with options. All fractional shares which
would otherwise be issuable shall be rounded down to the next
full share.

(b) At the closing of the Merger, 3Com will
deduct from the First Payment to the former holders of Centrum
stock (the "Centrum Shareholders"), on a pro rata basis, a total
of [** ] of the First Payment, and, as provided in
the Escrow Agreement, will deduct from the Second Payment to the
Centrum Shareholders, on a pro-rata basis, up to a total of [**
] of the Second Payment, and will deliver such
amounts to the escrow agent as provided under the Escrow
Agreement as described in Section 8.3. The amount so delivered
to the escrow agent is referred to herein as the "Escrow Amount,"
which will be paid to the parties as provided in the Escrow
Agreement to be executed pursuant to Section 8.3.

2.2 The Closing. Subject to termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 12 below, the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich, 400
Hamilton Avenue, Palo Alto, California at 10 a.m. on January 28,
1994, or such other place, time and date as 3Com and Centrum may
mutually select (the "Closing Date").

2.3 Effective Date. Simultaneously with the Closing,
the Agreement of Merger shall be filed in the office of the
Secretary of State of the State of California. The Merger shall
become effective immediately upon the filing of the Agreement of
Merger (the "Effective Time").

3. Representations and Warranties of Centrum. Except as
otherwise set forth in the "Centrum Disclosure Schedule" attached
hereto as Exhibit "B" ("Centrum Disclosure Schedule"), Centrum
represents and warrants to 3Com as set forth below. No fact or
circumstance disclosed to 3Com shall constitute an exception to
these representations and warranties unless such fact or
circumstance is set forth in the Centrum Disclosure Schedule
attached hereto or such supplements thereto as may mutually be
agreed upon in writing by Centrum and 3Com. Whenever the term
"enforceable in accordance with its terms" or like expression is
used, it is understood that excepted therefrom are any
limitations on enforceability under applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws of general
application affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights.

3.1 Organization. Centrum is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of California and has corporate power and authority
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Centrum
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary except
to the extent that any failure to qualify or obtain licenses
would not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the
operations, assets or financial condition of Centrum. The
Centrum Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete listing
of the locations of all sales offices, manufacturing facilities,
and any other offices or facilities of Centrum and a true and
complete list of all states in which Centrum maintains any
employees. The Centrum Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list of all states in which Centrum is duly qualified to
transact business as a foreign corporation. True and complete
copies of Centrum's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, as in
effect on the date hereof and as to be in effect as of the
Closing have been provided to 3Com or its representatives.

3.2 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of
Centrum consists of (i) 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock
("Centrum Common Stock") and (ii) 19,350,000 shares of Preferred
Stock, 7,000,000 of which are designated Series A Preferred Stock
("Series A Preferred") and 12,350,000 of which are designated

the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock are referred to as the 
"Preferred Stock"). Of such shares, one share of Centrum Common
Stock, 6,780,000 shares of Series A Preferred, and 12,037,039
shares of Series B Preferred are issued and outstanding and held
of record by Centrum's respective stockholders as set forth and
identified in the stockholder lists provided to 3Com or its
representatives. In addition, warrants to acquire 263,888 shares
of Series B Preferred are issued and outstanding. All of the
outstanding Securities have been duly authorized and are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All outstanding Securities
were issued in compliance with applicable securities laws. 

As of the date hereof, 6,480,000 shares of Centrum Common
Stock are available or reserved for issuance under the Centrum
1993 Stock Option Plan, of which 3,693,750 are reserved to
satisfy commitments made by the Centrum to its employees.

Centrum Disclosure Schedule, Centrum does not have any other
shares of its capital stock issued or outstanding and does not
have any other outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
rights or other agreements or commitments obligating Centrum to
issue shares of its capital stock or other securities.

3.3 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Centrum has
the corporate power to enter into this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to carry out its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
have been duly authorized by its Board of Directors and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Centrum are necessary to
authorize this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated herein and therein other than the
consent of the holders of outstanding shares of Centrum. Centrum
is not subject to or obligated under any charter, bylaw or
contract provision or any license, franchise or permit, or
subject to any order or decree, which would be breached or
violated by or in conflict with its executing and carrying out
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder and
under the Transaction Documents. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, no consent of any person who is a party to a contract
which is material to Centrum's business, nor consent of any
governmental authority, is required to be obtained on the part of
Centrum to permit the transactions contemplated herein and
continue the business activities of Centrum as previously
conducted by Centrum without material adverse change. This
Agreement and the other agreements, forms of which are attached
hereto as Exhibits, when executed by Centrum shall be the valid
and binding obligations of Centrum enforceable against Centrum in
accordance with their terms.

3.4 Financial Statements.

(a) Centrum has delivered to 3Com copies of
Centrum's unaudited balance sheet as of September 30, 1993 and
unaudited balance sheet as of December 30, 1993 (the latter
referred to herein as the "Centrum Balance Sheet") and statements
of income, stockholders' equity and changes in financial position
for the periods then ended.

(b) All financial statements delivered pursuant
to Section 3.4(a) (collectively, the "Centrum Financial
Statements") present fairly the financial position of Centrum as
of their historical dates. The Centrum Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a basis consistent with prior periods
except with respect to the unaudited financial statements for the
absence of footnotes and normal year-end adjustments, none of
which would be material. Except as to the extent reflected or
reserved against in such balance sheets (including the notes
thereto), Centrum did not have, as of the dates of such balance
sheets, any liabilities or obligations (absolute or contingent)
of a nature required or customarily reflected in a balance sheet
(or the notes thereto) prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The reserves, if any, reflected
on the Centrum Balance Sheet are adequate in light of the
contingencies with respect to which they are made. The
statements of income, stockholder's equity and changes in
financial position present fairly the results of operations,
equity transactions and changes in financial position of Centrum
for the periods indicated.

(c) Centrum has no debt, liability, or obligation
of any nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent, or
otherwise, and whether due or to become due, that is not
reflected or reserved against in the Centrum Financial
Statements, except for those (i) that may have been incurred
after the date of the Centrum Balance Sheet or (ii) that are not
required by generally accepted accounting principles to be
included in a balance sheet or the notes thereto, except that
Centrum has not established any reserves with respect to the
costs and fees associated with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. All material debts,
liabilities, and obligations incurred after the date of the
Centrum Financial Statements were incurred in the ordinary course
of business, and are usual and normal in amount both individually
and in the aggregate and none of which are material.

3.5 Tax Matters.

(a) Centrum has fully and timely, properly and
accurately filed all tax returns and reports required to be filed
by it prior to the date of this Agreement, including all federal,
foreign, state and local tax returns for all years and periods
(and portions thereof) for which any such returns and reports
were due prior to the date of this Agreement. All such returns
and reports were prepared in the manner required by applicable
law. All income, sales, use, occupation, property or other taxes
or assessments due from Centrum prior to the date of this
Agreement have been paid other than taxes for which adequate
reserves have been established on the Centrum Financial
Statements. To Centrum's knowledge, there are no pending
assessments, asserted deficiencies or claims for additional taxes
that have not been paid. The reserves for taxes, if any,
reflected on the Centrum Balance Sheet are adequate for any
unpaid taxes for periods through the date of this Agreement and
there are no tax liens on any property or assets of Centrum other
than liens for taxes not yet due and payable. There have been no
examinations of any tax returns or reports by any applicable
governmental agency. To Centrum's knowledge, no state of facts
exists or has existed which would constitute grounds for the
assessment of any penalty or of any further tax liability beyond
that shown on the respective tax reports or returns for any tax
period ending on or prior to the date of this Agreement. There
are no outstanding agreements or waivers extending the statutory
period of limitation applicable to any federal income tax return
or report for any period.

(b) All taxes which Centrum has been required to
collect or withhold have been duly withheld or collected and, to
the extent required prior to the date of this Agreement, have
been paid to the proper taxing authority.

(c) Centrum is not a party to any tax-sharing
agreement or similar arrangement with any other party.

(d) At no time has Centrum been included in the
federal consolidated income tax return of any affiliated group of
corporations.

(e) No payment which Centrum is obliged to pay to
any director, officer, employee or independent contractor
pursuant to the terms of an employment agreement, severance
agreement or otherwise will constitute an excess parachute
payment as defined in Section 280G of the Code.

(f) Centrum will not be required to include any
material adjustment in taxable income for any tax period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date pursuant to
Section 481(c) of the Code or any provision of the tax laws of
any jurisdiction requiring tax adjustments as a result of a
change in method of accounting implemented by Centrum prior to
the Closing Date for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending
on or before the Closing Date or pursuant to the provisions of
any agreement entered into by Centrum prior to the Closing Date
with any taxing authority with regard to the tax liability of
Centrum for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date.

(g) Except as may disclosed in connection with
Section 3.5(c) and except as required by this Agreement, Centrum
is not currently under any contractual obligation to pay any tax
obligations of any other person.

3.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the
date of the Centrum Balance Sheet, Centrum has not (a) suffered
any material adverse change in its financial condition or in the
operations of its business; (b) suffered any damage, destruction
or loss, whether covered by insurance or not, materially and
adversely affecting its properties or businesses; (c) granted any
increase in the compensation payable or to become payable by
Centrum to its officers or employees, except those occurring in
the ordinary course of business; (d) declared, set aside or paid
any dividend or made any other distribution on or in respect of
the shares of the capital stock of Centrum or declared any direct
or indirect redemption, retirement, purchase or other acquisition
by Centrum of such shares; (e) issued any shares of capital stock
of Centrum or any warrants, rights, options or entered into any
commitment relating to the shares of Centrum except for the
issuance of Centrum Shares pursuant to the exercise of
outstanding Options or Securities described in Section 3.2;
(f) made any material change in the accounting methods or
practices it follows, whether for general financial or tax
purposes, or any change in depreciation or amortization policies
or rates adopted therein; (g) sold, leased, abandoned or
otherwise disposed of any real property or any machinery,
equipment or other operating property other than in the ordinary
course of business (h) sold, assigned, transferred, licensed or
otherwise disposed of any patent, trademark, trade name, brand
name, copyright (or pending application for any patent, trademark
or copyright) invention, process, know-how, formula or trade
secret or interest thereunder or other intangible asset except in
the ordinary course of its business; (i) suffered any labor
dispute; (j) engaged in any activity or entered into any material
commitment or transaction (including without limitation any
borrowing or capital expenditure) other than in the ordinary
course of business; (k) incurred any liabilities except in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice
which would be required to be disclosed in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles; (l) permitted or allowed any of its property or
assets to be subjected to any mortgage, deed of trust, pledge,
lien, security interest or other encumbrance of any kind, except
those permitted under Section 3.7 (Title and Related Matters)
hereof, other than any purchase money security interests incurred
in the ordinary course of business; (m) made any capital
expenditure or commitment for additions to property, plant or
equipment except in the ordinary course of business; (n) paid,
loaned or advanced any amount to, or sold, transferred or leased

arrangement with any of its Affiliates, officers, directors or
stockholder or any Affiliate or associate of any of the
foregoing; (o) made any amendment to or terminated any agreement
which, if not so amended or terminated, would be required to be
disclosed on the Centrum Disclosure Schedule; or (p) agreed to
take any action described in this Section 3.6 (Absence of Certain
Changes or Events) or outside of its ordinary course of business
or which would constitute a breach of any of the representations
contained in this Agreement. 

3.7 Title and Related Matters. Centrum has good and
marketable title to all the properties, interests in properties
and assets, real and personal, reflected in the Centrum Balance
Sheet or acquired after the date of the Centrum Balance Sheet
(except properties, interests in properties and assets sold or
otherwise disposed of since the date of the Centrum Balance Sheet
in the ordinary course of business), free and clear of all
mortgages, liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances of any kind or
character, except the lien of current taxes not yet due and
payable and except for liens which in the aggregate do not secure
more than Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) in liabilities. The
equipment of Centrum necessary to the operation of its business
is in good operating condition and repair, except for ordinary
wear and tear and defects. All real or personal property leases
to which Centrum is a party are valid, binding, enforceable and
effective in accordance with their respective terms. There is
not under any of such leases any existing material default or
event of default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a material default. The Centrum
Disclosure Schedule contains a description of all real and
personal property leased or owned by Centrum, describing its
interest in said property and with respect to real property a
description of each parcel and a summary description of the
buildings, structures and improvements thereon. True and correct
copies of Centrum's leases have been provided to 3Com or its
representatives.

and to, or has licenses to, all patents, copyrights, technology,

such rights. No claims have been asserted against Centrum (and
Centrum is not aware of any claims which are likely to be
asserted against Centrum or which have been asserted against
others) by any person challenging Centrum's use or distribution
of any patents, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, trade
secrets, software, technology, know-how or processes utilized by
Centrum (including, without limitation, the Third Party
Technology) or challenging or questioning the validity or
effectiveness of any license or agreement relating thereto
(including, without limitation, the Third Party Licenses). To
Centrum's knowledge, there is no valid basis for any claim of the
type specified in the immediately preceding sentence which could
in any material way relate to or interfere with the continued
enhancement and exploitation by Centrum of any of the Centrum
Products. To Centrum's knowledge, none of the Centrum Products
nor the use of any patents, trademarks, trade names, copyrights,
software, technology, know-how or processes by Centrum in its
current business infringes on the rights of, constitutes
misappropriation of, or in any way involves unfair competition
with respect to, any proprietary information or intangible
property right of any third person or entity, including without
limitation any patent, trade secret, copyright, trademark or
trade name.

(b) Centrum has not granted any third party any
right to manufacture, reproduce, distribute, market or exploit
any of the Centrum Products or any adaptations, translations, or
derivative works based on the Centrum Products or any portion
thereof. Except with respect to the rights of third parties to
the Third Party Technology, no third party has any right to
manufacture, reproduce, distribute, market or exploit any works
or materials of which any of the Centrum Products are a
"derivative work" as that term is defined in the United States
Copyright Act, Title 17, U.S.C. Section 101.

(c) All designs, drawings, specifications, source
code, object code, documentation, flow charts and diagrams
incorporating, embodying or reflecting any of the Centrum
Products at any stage of their development (the "Centrum
Components") were written, developed and created solely and
exclusively by employees of Centrum without the assistance of any
third party or entity or were created by third parties who
assigned ownership of their rights to Centrum in valid and
enforceable consultant confidentiality and invention assignment
agreements. Centrum has at all times used commercially
reasonable efforts to treat the Centrum Products and Centrum
Components as containing trade secrets and has not disclosed or
otherwise dealt with such items in such a manner as to cause the
loss of such trade secrets by release into the public domain.

(d) To Centrum's knowledge, no employee of
Centrum is in violation of any term of any employment contract,
patent disclosure agreement or any other contract or agreement
relating to the relationship of any such employee with Centrum
or, to the best of Centrum's knowledge, any other party because
of the nature of the business conducted by Centrum or proposed to
be conducted by Centrum.

(e) Each person presently or previously employed
by Centrum (including independent contractors, if any) with
access to confidential information has executed a confidentiality
and non-disclosure agreement pursuant to the form of agreement
previously provided to 3Com or its representatives. Such
confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements constitute valid
and binding obligations of Centrum and such person, enforceable
in accordance with their respective terms. To the best of
Centrum's knowledge, neither the execution or delivery of such
agreements, nor the carrying on of Centrum's business as
employees by such persons, nor the conduct of Centrum's business
as currently anticipated, will conflict with or result in a
breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of or constitute a
default under any contract, covenant or instrument under which
any of such persons is obligated.

(f) No product liability or warranty claims which
individually or in the aggregate could exceed $15,000 have been
communicated to or threatened against Centrum nor, to the best of
Centrum's knowledge, is there any specific situation, set of
facts or occurrence that provides a basis for such claim. The
Centrum Disclosure Schedule sets forth all software bugs or other
product defects known to Centrum in the Centrum Products.

3.9 Employee Benefit Plans. There is no unfunded
prior service cost with respect to any bonus, deferred
compensation, pension, profit-sharing, retirement, stock
purchase, stock option, or other employee benefit or fringe
benefit plans, whether formal or informal, maintained by Centrum. 
To Centrum's knowledge, each bonus, deferred compensation,
pension, profit-sharing, retirement, stock purchase, stock
option, and other employee benefit or fringe benefit plans,
whether formal or informal, maintained by Centrum conforms to all
applicable requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974. The Centrum Disclosure Schedule lists and

full force and effect, and enforceable by Centrum in accordance
with their respective terms. No such material contract,

successors, executors, heirs, representatives, administrators and
assigns of the parties hereto.

14.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof, shall for any reason and to any
extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement and application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances shall be interpreted so as best to reasonably
effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this

hereto, the documents referenced herein, and the exhibits
thereto, constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements or
understandings, inducements or conditions, express or implied,
written or oral, between the parties with respect hereto and
thereto. The express terms hereof control and supersede any
course of performance or usage of the trade inconsistent with any
of the terms hereof.

14.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original as
against any party whose signature appears thereon and all of

costs and expenses incurred with respect to the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the exhibits hereto;

other remedy conferred hereby or by law on such party, and the

however, that no amendment of Section 7 or Section 8.3 may be
effected without the written approval of the Representative (as
defined in the Escrow Agreement), and after approval of this

amendment shall be effected which by law requires the further
approval of the Centrum Shareholders without obtaining such
further approval. The waiver by a party of any breach hereof for
default in payment of any amount due hereunder or default in the
performance hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of
any other default or any succeeding breach or default.

agreements, representations and warranties made herein shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
notwithstanding any investigation of the parties hereto, subject

fees on any appeal). The prevailing party shall be the party
entitled to recover its costs of suit, regardless of whether such
suit proceeds to final judgment. A party not entitled to recover
its costs shall not be entitled to recover attorneys' fees. No
sum for attorneys' fees shall be counted in calculating the
amount of a judgment for purposes of determining if a party is
entitled to recover costs or attorneys' fees.

INDEMNITY AND ESCROW AGREEMENT

This Indemnity and Escrow Agreement (the "Agreement") is
entered into as of February , 1994 by and among 3Com
Corporation, a California corporation ("3Com"), Centrum
Communications, Inc., a California corporation ("Centrum"), the
Representative named in Section 2 (Representative) hereof and the
Escrow Agent named herein.

RECITALS

A. 3Com, 3Sub Acquisition Corporation, a California
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of 3Com ("Sub"), and
Centrum have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
dated as of January 18, 1994 (the "Plan") pursuant to which Sub
will merge with and into Centrum, with Centrum surviving the
Merger. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein will have the meanings given them in the
Plan.

B. The Plan provides for [** ] of the amount
of the First Payment and, if and to the extent any Claims (as
defined below) have been made and remain unresolved at the time
the Second Payment becomes payable, for up to [** ]
of the amount of the Second Payment (together with the amount
withheld from the First Payment, the "Escrow Amount") to be
placed in an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") to secure
certain obligations to 3Com under the Plan on the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

C. The parties hereto desire to establish the terms and
conditions pursuant to which the Escrow Amount will be withheld
by 3Com and subsequently deposited, held in, and disbursed from
the Escrow Account.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Indemnification.

1.1 Indemnification by Centrum Securityholders from
Escrow Amount. If the Merger occurs, all the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of Centrum in the Plan shall
survive the Effective Time, but Centrum shall have no further
liability with respect thereto, and all such liability will
become the obligation and collective responsibility of the
shareholders of Centrum immediately after the Closing
(collectively "the Centrum Shareholders") and the holders of
Options (collectively, the "Centrum Optionholders"), in
accordance with this Agreement, subject to the limitations set
forth herein. The Centrum Shareholders and the Centrum
Optionholders are collectively referred to herein as the "Centrum
Securityholders." Centrum having originally made such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall in no
way limit the obligations of the Centrum Securityholders pursuant
to this Agreement, which obligations shall remain in full force
and effect, subject to the limitations set forth herein. All the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Centrum
in the Plan shall survive the Effective Time as to the Centrum
Securityholders, subject to the limitations set forth herein. 
Pursuant to and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
Centrum Securityholders shall indemnify and hold harmless 3Com
and Centrum in respect of any and all claims, losses, damages,
liabilities, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, settlement costs and any legal or
other expenses for investigating, bringing or defending any
actions or threatened actions) (collectively the "Costs")
incurred or suffered by 3Com or Centrum resulting from (i) any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation made by Centrum in the Plan or in any of the other
Transaction Documents and (ii) any matter set forth on Schedule A
hereto. Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan shall limit
3Com rights or claims with respect to any Centrum Shareholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time arising out of such
Centrum Shareholder's failure to own all right, title and
interest in and to the shares of Centrum listed of record as
owned by such Centrum Shareholder.

1.2 Payment for Indemnification Claims; Threshold. 
The Centrum Securityholders agree to pay 3Com for Costs claimed
by 3Com in the manner and to the extent provided in this
Agreement. The parties agree that the Escrow Amount will be
security for this obligation. Promptly after the receipt by 3Com
of notice or discovery of any claim, damage or legal action or
proceeding giving rise to rights under Section 1.1
(Indemnification by Centrum Securityholders from Escrow Amount),
3Com will give the Representative and the Escrow Agent written
notice of such claim, damage, legal action or proceeding (a
"Claim") in accordance with Section 4 (Notice of Claim) hereof. 
3Com shall notify the Representative of the status or progress of
any such Claim.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement or in any of the other Transaction Documents, in the
absence of fraud, if the Merger is consummated: (a) the Escrow
Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy and source of
compensation to 3Com for any Costs incurred by 3Com or Sub
arising out of the breach or alleged breach by Centrum of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the
Plan or in any of the other Transaction Documents and for any
matter set forth on Schedule A, and (b) except as specifically
provided in the following paragraph or in Schedule A, Centrum and
the Centrum Securityholders shall be liable only as to any
individual claim if it involves [** 
] provided that,
once such [** ] then 3Com will be entitled to make
Claim for indemnification of all such Costs [** 
] 

1.3 Allocation of Costs between Shareholders and
Optionholders. With respect to any Costs for which 3Com may be
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, 3Com will be
entitled to be paid in cash out of the Escrow Amount that
percentage of such Costs equal to the percentage of all fully
diluted Common Stock equivalents of Centrum (assuming conversion
of all outstanding Preferred Stock and exercise of all
outstanding Options whether vested or not) represented by the
outstanding Centrum Common Stock and Preferred Stock immediately
prior to the Closing. All such fully diluted Common Stock
equivalents are referred to herein as the "Centrum Shares." All
such fully diluted Common Stock equivalents are referred to
herein as the "Centrum Shares." The remainder of such Costs will
be subject to indemnification by means of corresponding
provisions in the assumption agreements pursuant to which 3Com
assumes the Options, with the Optionholders' indemnification for
such Costs effected through the loss of the right to exercise a
portion of their Options, not to exceed [** ] of the
number of shares of 3Com Common Stock subject to such options
immediately after the Closing, in the absence of fraud.

1.4 Limitation on Liability. In the absence of fraud,
if the Merger is consummated, the maximum liability of Centrum
and the Centrum Shareholders for any matter set forth in this
Agreement shall not exceed [** 
] Payments for Costs shall be deducted from the
Escrow Amount payable to each Centrum Shareholder in proportion
to the ratio of the number of shares of Centrum Common Stock and
Preferred Stock held by such Centrum Shareholder over the total
number of outstanding shares of Centrum Common Stock and
Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
shall be deducted from shares of 3Com Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of Options held by each Centrum Optionholder in
proportion to the number of shares of Centrum Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of Options held by such Centrum
Optionholder over the total number of shares of Centrum Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of all Options immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

or transferred, including by operation of law, by any Centrum
Shareholder or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable
process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of a
Centrum Shareholder, prior to the delivery to such Centrum
Shareholder of the released amount by the Escrow Agent.

Claim") shall be in writing to the Representative and the Escrow
Agent and shall contain the following information to the extent
it is reasonably available to 3Com:

(a) 3Com's good faith estimate of the reasonably

the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged
Costs based on 3Com's good faith belief thereof.

party claim which could result in a Notice of Claim promptly
after 3Com becomes aware of such third party claim. 3Com agrees
not to settle such claims without the prior written consent of
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Escrow Amount held in the Escrow Account to 3Com pursuant to a
Notice of Claim until such Notice of Claim has been resolved in
accordance with Section 5 (Resolution of Notice of Claim) below.

4.4 In the event 3Com receives a claim from a third
party for damages caused by one or more breaches of the
representations and warranties set forth in the Plan, 3Com shall
promptly send a Notice of Claim in accordance with this Section 4
(Notice of Claim) and shall keep the Representative and Escrow
Agent informed of the status of such claim.

5. Resolution of Notice of Claim. Any Notice of Claim
received by Representative and the Escrow Agent pursuant to
Section 4 (Notice of Claim) above will be resolved as follows:

5.1 Uncontested Claims. In the event that the
Representative does not contest a Notice of Claim by delivering a
notice to that effect in writing to the Escrow Agent and 3Com
within 30 calendar days after such Notice of Claim is deemed
delivered pursuant to Section 7 (Notices) below, the Escrow Agent
will immediately deliver to 3Com an amount equal to the amount
specified in the Notice of Claim and notify the Representative of
such transfer.

5.2 Contested Claims. In the event that the
Representative gives written notice contesting all or a portion
of a Notice of Claim to 3Com and the Escrow Agent (a "Contested
Claim") within the 30-day period provided above, the matter will
be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with this
Section 5.2 (Contested Claims). Any portion of the Notice of
Claim which is not contested shall be resolved as set forth above
in Section 5.1 (Uncontested Claims). The final decision of the
arbitrator shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent, the
Representative, and 3Com in writing and will constitute a
conclusive determination of the issue in question, binding upon
Centrum Securityholders, the Representative and 3Com and shall
not be contested by any of them. After notice that the Notice of
Claim is contested by the Representative, the Escrow Agent will
continue to hold in the Escrow Account a portion of the Escrow
Amount sufficient to cover that portion of such Claim for which
the Centrum Shareholders are responsible under Section 1.3
(Allocation of Costs between Shareholders and Options holders)
above until (i) execution of a settlement agreement by 3Com and
the Representative setting forth a resolution of the Notice of
Claim, or (ii) receipt of a copy of the final award of the
arbitrator.

(a) Arbitration. Any Contested Claim shall be
settled by arbitration in Santa Clara, California and, except as
herein specifically stated, in accordance with the commercial
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA
Rules") then in effect. However, in all events, these
arbitration provisions shall govern over any conflicting rules
which may now or hereafter be contained in the AAA Rules. Any
judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof. 
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any equitable
and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial
proceeding instituted to resolve a Contested Claim.

(b) Compensation of Arbitrator. Any such
arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator who
shall be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be
determined by the parties or by the American Arbitration
Association, but based upon reasonable hourly or daily consulting
rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties are not able to
agree upon his or her rate of compensation.

(c) Selection of Arbitrator. The AAA Rules for
the selection of the arbitrator shall be followed.

(d) Payment of Costs. 3Com and Centrum
Shareholders as a group shall each advance fifty percent (50%) of
the initial compensation to be paid to the arbitrator in any such
arbitration and fifty percent (50%) of the costs of transcripts
and other normal and regular expenses of the arbitration
proceedings; provided, however, that the arbitrator shall have
the discretion to grant to the prevailing party in any
arbitration an award of attorneys' fees and costs, and all costs
of arbitration.

(e) Discovery. The parties shall be entitled to
conduct discovery proceedings in accordance with the provisions
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, subject to any
limitation imposed by the arbitrator.

(f) Burden of Proof. For any claim submitted to
arbitration, the burden of proof shall be as it would be if the
claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding.

(g) Judgment. Upon the conclusion of any
arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrator shall render
findings of fact and conclusions of law and a written opinion
setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision reached by
him or her and shall deliver such documents to each party to the
Agreement along with a signed copy of the award.

(h) Terms of Arbitration. The arbitrator chosen
in accordance with these provisions shall not have the power to
alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration
provisions or the provisions of this Agreement or the Plan.

(i) Exclusive Remedy. Except as specifically
provided in this Agreement or the Plan, arbitration shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the parties for any Contested Claim
arising out of such Agreement or Plan.

5.3 No Exhaustion of Remedies. The parties
acknowledge that no other action need be taken by 3Com before
proceeding directly in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. 3Com need not exhaust any other remedies that may be
available to it but may proceed directly in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. 3Com may institute Claims against
the Escrow Amount and in satisfaction thereof may recover the
Escrow Amount, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
without making any other Claims directly against the Centrum
Shareholders and without rescinding or attempting to rescind the
transactions consummated pursuant to the Plan. The assertion of
any single Claim for payment hereunder will not bar 3Com from
asserting other claims hereunder.

6. Limitation of Escrow Agent's Liability.

6.1 The Escrow Agent will incur no liability with
respect to any action taken or suffered by it in reliance upon
any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other
document believed by it to be genuine and duly authorized, nor
for any other action or inaction, except its own willful
misconduct or negligence. The Escrow Agent will not be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any agreement amendatory or supplemental hereto. In all
questions arising under the Agreement, the Escrow Agent may rely
on the advice or opinion of counsel, and for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Escrow Agent based on
such advice or opinion, the Escrow Agent will not be liable to
anyone. The Escrow Agent will not be required to take any action
hereunder involving any expense unless the payment of such
expense is made or provided for in a manner satisfactory to it.

6.2 In the event conflicting demands are made or
notices are served upon the Escrow Agent with respect to the
Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent will have the absolute right, at
the Escrow Agent's election, to do either or both of the
following: resign so a successor can be appointed pursuant to
Section 10 (Successor Escrow Agreement) or file a suit in
interpleader and obtain an order from a court of competent
jurisdiction requiring the parties to interplead and litigate in
such court their several claims and rights among themselves. In
the event such interpleader suit is brought, the Escrow Agent
will thereby be fully released and discharged from all further
obligations imposed upon it under this Agreement, and 3Com will
pay the Escrow Agent (subject to reimbursement from the Centrum
Shareholders pursuant to Section 9 (Expenses) hereof) all costs,
expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees expended or incurred by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the exercise of Escrow Agent's
rights under this Section 6 (Limitation of Escrow Agent's
Liability) (such costs, fees and expenses shall be treated as
extraordinary fees and expenses for the purposes of Section 9
(Expenses) hereof).

6.3 In consideration of its acceptance of the
appointment as Escrow Agent, the other parties hereto, jointly
and severally, agree to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent
harmless as to any liability incurred by it to any person, firm
or corporation by reason of its having accepted the same or in
carrying out any of the terms hereof, and to reimburse the Escrow
Agent for all its costs and expenses, including, but not limited
to, reasonable counsel fees and expenses, incurred by reason of
any matter as to which an indemnity is paid; provided, however,
that no indemnity need be paid in the case of the Escrow Agent's
negligence or willful misconduct.

7. Notices. Any notice provided for or permitted under
this Agreement will be treated as having been given when
(a) delivered personally, (b) sent by confirmed telex or
telecopy, (c) sent by commercial overnight courier with written
verification of receipt, or (d) mailed postage prepaid by

fees or expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with
a dispute over the distribution of the Escrow Amount or the
validity of a Notice of Claim, will be paid fifty percent (50%)
by 3Com and fifty percent (50%) by Centrum. Centrum' liability
for the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent or of the
arbitrator appointed under Section 5.2 (Contested Claims) may be
paid by 3Com and recovered as a Claim hereunder out of the Escrow
Amount. If 3Com has paid the Centrum Shareholders' portion of
such fees and expenses as permitted hereunder, then the Escrow
Agent will, upon demand by 3Com, deliver to 3Com a portion of the
Escrow Amount equal to such portion of fees and expenses.

9.2 Representative. The Representative shall not be
entitled to receive any compensation from 3Com or the Centrum
Shareholders in connection with this Agreement. Any fees and
expenses incurred by the Representative in connection with
actions taken pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be
paid by 3Com and recovered as a Claim hereunder out of the Escrow
Account.

10. Successor Escrow Agent. In the event the Escrow Agent
becomes unavailable or unwilling to continue in its capacity
herewith, the Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its
duties or obligations hereunder by giving resignation to the
parties to this Agreement, specifying not less than sixty (60)
days' prior written notice of such a date when such resignation
will take effect. 3Com shall designate a successor Escrow Agent
prior to the expiration of such 60-day period by giving written
notice to the Escrow Agent and the Representative. 3Com may
appoint a successor Escrow Agent without the consent of the
Centrum Shareholders or the Representative so long as such
successor is a bank with assets of at least $50 million, and may
appoint any other successor Escrow Agent with the consent of the
Representative, which will not be unreasonably withheld. The
Escrow Agent will promptly deliver the portion of the Escrow
Amount remaining in the Escrow Account at such time to such
designated successor.

11. Limitation of Responsibility; Notices. The Escrow
Agent's duties are limited to those set forth in this Agreement
and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the written notices delivered
to the Escrow Agent hereunder.

12. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended with the
written consent of 3Com, the Escrow Agent and the Representative,
provided that if the Escrow Agent does not agree to an amendment
agreed upon by 3Com and the Representative, 3Com shall appoint a
successor Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 10 (Successor
Escrow Agent) above.

13. Miscellaneous. Escrow Agent may execute any of its
powers or responsibilities hereunder and exercise any rights
hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or
attorneys. Nothing in this Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to
impose upon Escrow Agent any duty to qualify to do business or
act as fiduciary or otherwise in any jurisdiction other than The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed this
Agreement as of the day and year first above written and shall be
effective as to all the Centrum Securityholders when executed by
3Com, the Escrow Agent, the Representative and approved by the
Centrum Securityholders holding a majority of the Centrum Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.

SCHEDULE A
TO INDEMNITY AND ESCROW AGREEMENT

Matters subject to special indemnification:

A. One-half of all Costs, as qualified below, of 3Com or
Centrum due to claims by or disputes with the following
international distributors (the "Distributors") of Centrum:

a. Sumitronics, Inc. and Sumisho Electronics Co., LTD,
arising out of that certain Centrum Communications,
Inc. International Distributor Agreement dated
August 11, 1993, as amended;

b. DynaLab INC. arising out of that certain Centrum
Communications, Inc. Distribution Agreement dated
March 1, 1993, as amended;

c. Netcom Ltd. arising out of that certain Centrum
Communications, Inc. International Distributor
Agreement dated September 1, 1993, as amended.

in light of the following circumstances and mutual
understandings:

1. Notwithstanding the terms of the existing contracts
with the Distributors, 3Com will commence distribution of Centrum
products through normal 3Com international distribution channels,
including those in effect in the territories allocated by Centrum
to the Distributors.

2. 3Com will promptly offer each Distributor the
opportunity, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the Distributor's agreement, to terminate its respective
distribution agreement with Centrum and in place thereof to enter
into a new international distribution agreement on 3Com standard
terms appointing the Distributor as a nonexclusive distributor of
the same Centrum products in the same territory now subject to
the distribution agreement with Centrum (but not additional 3Com
products) for a one year term. In the case of
Sumitronics/Sumisho, the appropriate territory is understood to
be Japan; in the case of DynaLab, the appropriate territory is
understood to be Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Mainland China.

3. 3Com will cause the individual employee performance
plan for Ann Zeichner (assuming she agrees to remain an employee
of Centrum or 3Com following the Merger) to include a milestone
relating to the successful transitioning of the Distributors to
nonexclusive, one year status consistent with this Schedule, will
tie a reasonable amount of her incentive compensation package to
such milestone, and will empower her to take an active role in
bringing about a cost-effective transition. The individual
performance plan contemplated by this paragraph is to be
specified within forty days after the Effective Date.

4. 3Com will keep the Representative informed of the
status of discussions with each Distributor, and will not enter
into any settlement with a Distributor or agree to make any
payment that would be subject to indemnification under the
Indemnity and Escrow Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.

5. 3Com will not be entitled to make any Claim for 3Com's
internal costs incurred in managing the relationship with or
negotiating the transition of the Distributors as contemplated by
this Schedule, nor for any legal or other fees and expenses
incurred in the course of negotiating and documenting a
transition to nonexclusive, one year distributor contracts, but
will be entitled to make a Claim for any payments to a
Distributor or other out-of-pocket costs beyond the foregoing,
and for any Costs (including any legal or other fees) with
respect to any Distributor after such time as the Distributor
makes a written claim for damages or commences a formal dispute.

B. All Costs of 3Com or Centrum due to claims by Ming-Chih
Hsieh with respect to ownership or rights in intellectual
property relating to work product provided by him to Centrum for
which written assignment from him was not obtained at the time of
the Closing.

C. Any Costs subject to indemnification under this Schedule A
shall not be subject to the minimum amounts and threshold set
forth in Section 1.2 (Payment for Indemnification Claims;
Threshold) of the Escrow Agreement.
