FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

Florida Progress Corporation releases first-quarter earnings

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (April 21, 1994) -- Florida Progress Corporation, parent
of St. Petersburg-based Florida Power Corporation, today reported first-quarter
earnings of $35.8 million, compared with $34.4 million earned a year ago. 
Higher revenues from Florida Power and improved operating results from Florida
Progress' diversified operations were the main reasons for the company's
increase in first-quarter earnings. Florida Power's higher revenues in the
first quarter of 1994 were offset significantly because of costs associated
with an early retirement option. 

Revenues for the quarter ended March 31 totaled $629.3 million, compared with
$493.3 million for the same period in 1993. Earnings per share in the first
quarter of 1994 were 40 cents, compared with 39 cents a share a year ago.

Florida Power, the largest subsidiary of Florida Progress, earned $31.8
million, or 36 cents per share, on revenues of $483.5 million in this year's
first quarter, compared with earnings of $31.5 million, or 36 cents a share, on
revenues of $407 million for the same period a year ago. 

Utility revenues increased in 1994 primarily because retail kilowatt-hour sales
rose 5.5 percent and due to the continued impact of a phased-in rate increase
during 1993. Colder-than-normal temperatures across Florida Power's 32-county
service area contributed to the higher customer usage during the first three
months of this year. The average residential customer used 8.2 percent more
electricity this year than during the same three-month period last year.

A voluntary early retirement option, offered by the company to more than 200
eligible employees in December 1993, was accepted by 177 of them in January
1994. Costs related to this option lowered earnings by $7.9 million, or 9
cents a share, during the first quarter of this year. In last year's fourth
quarter, initial expenses for the early retirement option reduced 1993 earnings
by $3.4 million.

In this year's first quarter, earnings from Florida Progress' diversified
operations nearly doubled over the same period in 1993, largely because of
higher revenues and increased earnings from Electric Fuels Corporation, the
company's coal mining and 

- - more -

transportation subsidiary. An acquisition in June 1993 by Electric Fuels
boosted the company's 1994 operating results. Diversified earnings were $4
million, or 4 cents per share, compared with the $2.1 million, or 2 cents a
share, earned last year.

Florida Progress (NYSE: FPC) is a diversified utility holding company with
assets of $5.6 billion. Its principal subsidiary is Florida Power, the state's
second-largest electric utility with more than 1.2 million customers. 
Diversified operations include coal mining and transportation, life insurance,
real estate and lending and leasing.

Florida Progress Corporation releases first-quarter earnings

Florida Progress Corporation, parent of St. Petersburg-based Florida Power
Corporation, today reported first-quarter earnings of $35.8 million, compared
with $34.4 million earned a year ago. Higher revenues from Florida Power and
improved operating results from Florida Progress' diversified operations were
the main reasons for the company's increase in first-quarter earnings. Florida
Power's higher revenues in the first quarter of 1994 were offset significantly
because of costs associated with an early retirement option. 

Revenues for the quarter ended March 31 totaled $629.3 million, compared with
$493.3 million for the same period in 1993. Earnings per share in the first
quarter of 1994 were 40 cents, compared with 39 cents a share a year ago.

Florida Power, the largest subsidiary of Florida Progress, earned $31.8
million, or 36 cents per share, on revenues of $483.5 million in this year's
first quarter, compared with earnings of $31.5 million, or 36 cents a share, on
revenues of $407 million for the same period a year ago. 

Utility revenues increased in 1994 primarily because retail kilowatt-hour sales
rose 5.5 percent and due to the continued impact of a phased-in rate increase
during 1993. Colder-than-normal temperatures across Florida Power's 32-county
service area contributed to the higher customer usage during the first three
months of this year. The average residential customer used 8.2 percent more
electricity this year than during the same three-month period last year.

As a measure of cold weather, heating-degree days indicate variances from year
to year. In this year's first quarter, the heating-degree days in Florida
Power's service territory were more than 35 percent higher than last year's
first quarter, and about 19 percent above the 10-year average. These variances
indicate that the utility's service area experienced relatively cold
temperatures during the first three months of 1994.

- - more -

Energy sales also increased during the first quarter of this year because
customer growth was 3.2 percent, compared with 2.1 percent a year ago. The
higher customer growth rate is primarily due to Florida Power's acquisition of
the city of Sebring's distribution system in June of last year. This
acquisition added about 12,500 customers to Florida Power's system.

Another factor contributing to increased revenues and higher earnings at the
utility this year has been the continued impact of a phased-in rate increase
during 1993. State regulators granted Florida Power an $86-million base rate
increase in 1992, to be collected in three steps. The phased-in approach was
designed to coincide with the completion of new capital additions, such as the
in-service dates of new generating units. 

The first phase of the increase, or about $58 million in annual revenues, went
into effect in November 1992. In April 1993, the utility began collecting the
second phase, or approximately $10 million in annualized revenues. The third,
and final, part of the increase -- estimated to result in revenues of about $18
million annually -- went into effect in November 1993. 

A voluntary early retirement option, offered by the company to more than 200
eligible employees in December 1993, was accepted by 177 of them in January
1994. Costs related to this option lowered earnings by $7.9 million, or 9
cents a share, during the first quarter of this year. In last year's fourth
quarter, initial expenses for the early retirement option reduced 1993 earnings
by $3.4 million. 

In this year's first quarter, earnings from Florida Progress' diversified
operations nearly doubled over the same period in 1993, largely because of
higher revenues and increased earnings from Electric Fuels Corporation, the
company's coal mining and transportation subsidiary. An acquisition in June
1993 by Electric Fuels boosted the company's 1994 operating results. Earnings
also were higher during the quarter due to a state tax adjustment that lowered
corporate overhead costs in 1994. Diversified earnings were $4 million, or 4
cents per share, compared with the $2.1 million, or 2 cents a share, earned
last year.

Florida Progress (NYSE: FPC) is a diversified utility holding company with
assets of $5.6 billion. Its principal subsidiary is Florida Power, the state's
second-largest electric utility with more than 1.2 million customers. 
Diversified operations include coal mining and transportation, life insurance,
real estate and lending and leasing.
