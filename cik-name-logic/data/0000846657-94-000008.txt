On May 23, 1994, United States Brass Corporation ("U.S. Brass"), an 
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Eljer Industries, Inc. (the "Company"), 
filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal 
Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District
of Texas, Plano Division (Case No. 94-40823S). 

U.S. Brass manufactures faucets, plumbing supplies, connectors and plumbing
systems for use in residential and commercial construction. U.S. Brass is 
currently operating its business and managing its assets as "debtor-in-
possession" and is expected to continue to act in that capacity during the 
pendency of the reorganization proceeding. U.S. Brass' principal lender, 
Congress Financial Corporation, has agreed, subject to court approval, to 
continue its existing secured working capital credit facility and to provide up
to $20 million of debtor-in-possession financing to meet U.S. Brass' continuing
operating expenses during the reorganization proceeding.

The U.S. Brass Chapter 11 filing was necessitated by the substantial 
contingent liabilities associated with claims and lawsuits filed against U.S. 
Brass alleging defects in its Qest polybutylene plumbing system (the "Qest 
system"). U.S. Brass manufactured and sold the Qest system for residential
site-built installations from 1979 through 1986 and for other installations 
from 1975 through 1990. Homeowners, developers and others have instituted a
substantial number of claims and filed numerous lawsuits (including purported
class actions) against U.S. Brass, the Company and its subsidiary, Eljer
Manufacturing, Inc. ("Eljer Manufacturing"), suppliers of U.S. Brass and others
alleging defects in the Qest system. The claims and lawsuits seek damages on
a variety of theories, including strict liability, breach of warranty,
negligence, misrepresentation and fraud and various state deceptive trade
practice statutes. In addition, Shell Oil Company and Hoechst Celanese
Corporation, suppliers to U.S. Brass, have filed lawsuits against U.S. Brass, 
the Company, Eljer Manufacturing and Household International, Inc., seeking 
damages against the various defendants on a variety of theories, including 
breach of contract, fraud and alter ego. The capital stock of the Company 
was owned by Household International, Inc. prior to the distribution thereof 
to its stockholders in April 1989. For further information regarding the 
Qest system litigation, reference is made to Note (13) to Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the Company included in Item 8 of its Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended January 2, 1994.

Although U.S. Brass believes it has sufficient insurance to cover the 
indemnity costs for Qest system claims and litigation, its insurance carriers 
are contesting the nature and extent of coverage and, as a result, U.S. Brass 
has determined that it may be unable to absorb the ongoing costs, either 
indemnity or expense, of the litigation. In addition, claimants in the
litigation typically seek awards for punitive damages for which there may be no
insurance coverage.

U.S. Brass believes that a reorganization proceeding provides the best 
means of maximizing the return to its creditors and resolving the Qest system 
claims and litigation against U.S. Brass.

Neither the Company nor Eljer Manufacturing is a party to the U.S. Brass
reorganization proceeding. The U.S. Brass Chapter 11 filing does not constitute
an event of default under the Company's existing bank credit agreement.

UNITED STATES BRASS CORPORATION ANNOUNCES CHAPTER 11 FILING

DALLAS, Texas, May 24, 1994 --United States Brass Corporation, a 
manufacturer of faucets, plumbing supplies, and plumbing systems for residential
and commercial construction, remodeling and do-it-yourself applications, and an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Eljer Industries, Inc. (NYSE:ELJ) announced
today that it had filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11
of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the 
Eastern District of Texas, Plano Division.

Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate its business in the 
ordinary course under court protection from creditors while seeking to work out 
a plan of reorganization to provide for the payment of its creditors. U.S. 
Brass indicated that its principal lender, Congress Financial Corporation, has 
agreed to provide up to $20,000,000 of debtor-in-possession financing for U.S. 
Brass' continuing operations. The financing would be a continuation of the 
existing secured working capital credit facility. 

The possitility of a Chapter 11 reorganization for U.S. Brass had been 
previously announced. U.S. Brass stated that the Chapter 11 filing was 
necessitated by substantial contingent liabilities associated with litigation 
arising from its manufacture and sale of Qest polybutylene plumbing systems 
and the substantial costs associated with and anticipated for such 
litigation. Other defendants in the Qest system lawsuits are Shell Chemical 
Company, a subsidiary of Shell Oil Company, the manufacturer of polybutylene 
resin from which U.S. Brass extrudes the pipe used in the system, Celanese 
Specialty Resins, a unit of Hoechst Celanese Corporation and the manufacturer
of a resin from which U.S. Brass injection molded the Celcon acetal fittings 
formerly used in the system, other pipe and fittings manufacturers, builders,
developers and plumbing contractors.

While U.S. Brass believes it has sufficient insurance to cover the 
indemnity costs for such claims, its insurance carriers are contesting the 
nature and extent of coverage and, as a result, it may be unable to absorb 
the ongoing costs, either indemnity or expense, of the litigation. In 
addition, claimants in the litigation typically seek awards for punitive 
damages, for which there may be no insurance coverage.

Scott G. Arbuckle, Chairman of U.S. Brass and President and Chief Executive
Officer of Eljer Industries, commented: "The decision to reorganize U.S. Brass 
under federal bankruptcy laws is based on our belief that it is the best means 
of maximizing the return to its creditors while enabling us to systematically 
resolve the issues raised in the polybutylene-related litigation that have 
placed a severe burden on our entire Company since our spin-off from Household
International in 1989."

Mr. Arbuckle continued: "This action comes at a time when our relationship
with our vendors and creditors is strong, our market position is established, 
economic trends remain favorable and our operating performance continues to 
demonstrate the substantial improvement we have made over the past three years."

The predecessor to U.S. Brass Corporation was incorporated in the 1940's, 
and since that time the Company has grown into a nationally recognized plumbing
company. It was acquired by Household International, Inc. in 1981. U.S. Brass
Corporation is a subsidiary of Eljer Manufacturing, Inc., which is based in 
Dallas, Texas. Neither Eljer Industries nor Eljer Manufacturing is a party 
to the reorganization proceeding. 

Eljer Industries, Inc. is a leading manufacturer and marketer of high 
quality building products, including plumbing, heating and ventilating 
products, for the residential and commercial construction, remodeling and 
repair, and do-it-yourself markets.
