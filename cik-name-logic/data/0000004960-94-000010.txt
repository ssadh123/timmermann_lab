Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Operations

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The pro forma condensed consolidated statement of
operations for the six months ended July 2, 1994, has been
prepared assuming the Acquisition had been consummated on
January 2, 1994, and includes the historical consolidated
results of operations of the Company for the six months
ended July 2, 1994, and the historical results of Frozen
Specialty Foods for the five months ended May 31, 1994. The
pro forma combined results of operations are not necessarily
indicative of results of operations that would have resulted
had the Acquisition actually occurred on January 2, 1994 nor
are they necessarily indicative of future results of
operations.

The pro forma combined statement of operations does not
give effect to the $1 million extraordinary net loss
resulting from the consummation of a new bank term loan and
revolving line of credit and related early extinguishment of
the existing revolving line of credit.

Note 2. Pro Forma Adjustments

(a) To record the net change in depreciation expenses based
on the fair value of depreciable assets, versus their
historical cost, using the straight line method over
their estimated useful lives.

(b) To record amortization of trademarks over 25 years and
goodwill over a period of 40 years, and eliminate
amortization of the historical goodwill of Frozen
Specialty Foods.

(c) To record additional interest attributable to the
increase in bank debt to finance the Acquisition,
record amortization of debt issue costs over the term
of the new bank debt and eliminate amortization of debt
issue costs attributable to debt which was
extinguished.

(d) To record the tax benefit attributable to the net pro
forma adjustments based on the statutory (federal and
state) tax rate of 40%. The effective tax rate in
future years is expected to be in excess of the
statutory rate due to non-deductible amortization of
previously recorded intangible assets.

(e) The weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares used in the pro forma earnings per
share computation were 7,921,000 (historical).
