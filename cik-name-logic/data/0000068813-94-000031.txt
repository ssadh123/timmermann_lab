BARTLETT TO RETIRE AS MULTIMEDIA CHAIRMAN AND CEO

GREENVILLE, SC - June 13, 1994 -- Multimedia, Inc. today announced
the intention of Walter E. Bartlett to retire as the Company's Board
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board's nominating
committee has recommended that Donald D. Sbarra, Senior Vice
President of the Company, be elected to succeed Mr. Bartlett. The
Board is expected to give favorable consideration to the action of
the committee at a meeting scheduled for Thursday, June 16. 
According to a spokesman for the nominating committee, Bartlett, age
66, has agreed to remain as Senior Consultant to the Board of
Directors of Multimedia. 

Bartlett said when announcing his retirement, "I have recommended
Don Sbarra to become Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Multimedia in what the Board and I plan to be a seamless transition. 
This is my second retirement as CEO. I had resumed these
responsibilities on a temporary basis in December of this past year
to prepare us for a management transition. We are now ready for the
next step in this process, and I am delighted that Don Sbarra is
available for this leadership role. We have begun the interviewing
process for President and Chief Operating Officer, and Sbarra, with
his experience in operations, will be the perfect mentor for the
person chosen for this job."

Sbarra commented, "I have greatly valued my association with Walter
Bartlett for the last 13 years, and I am grateful for Walter's
recommendation and the action of the nominating committee. Walter
has done a tremendous job as Chief Executive of the Company since
our recapitalization in 1985. He was the guiding force in reducing
the Company's debt and creating shareholder value after the
recapitalization."

Before joining Multimedia in 1976, Bartlett was Senior Vice
President of Avco Broadcasting. During his career at Avco, he was
responsible for the development of the Phil Donahue talk show. At
Multimedia, Bartlett served as President of both the Broadcasting
and Entertainment divisions before becoming President and Chief
Operating Officer of the parent company in 1981. In 1985 he was
elected President and Chief Executive Officer and led the Company
after its successful recapitalization in 1985. In 1989 he was
elected Chairman of the Board.
