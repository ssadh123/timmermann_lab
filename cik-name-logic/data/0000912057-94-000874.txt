ITEM 1. CHANGES IN CONTROL OF REGISTRANT

Reference is made to the information set forth under Item 5 of this
Report.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On August 4, 1993, pursuant to an agreement with Nick G. Karabots and
two corporations owned by him, the Registrant acquired for its Kable News
Company subsidiary various present and future rights to distribute magazines,
and in payment issued a total of 575,593 shares of the Registrant's common
stock. Such shares are beneficially owned by Mr. Karabots. As part of its
agreement with Mr. Karabots, the Registrant (i) proposed him for election, and
he was elected, to the Board of Directors at Registrant's Annual Meeting of
Shareholders held September 23, 1993, and (ii) agreed, subject to certain
exceptions, that so long as he owns at least one-half of the common stock issued
in the transaction the Registrant will propose him for election at each meeting
of shareholders for the election of directors until July 2003, unless he is
already in a Class of the Board whose term continues beyond such meeting.
