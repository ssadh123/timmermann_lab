Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
-------------------------------------

On December 20, 1994, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of
October 8, 1994, as supplemented (the "Warren Agreement"), among Scott Paper
Company ("Scott"), Sappi Limited, a South African corporation ("Sappi") and SDW
Acquisition Corporation ("Acquisition"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SDW
Holdings Corporation ("Holdings"), Scott consummated the sale of all of the
outstanding common shares, no par value, of S. D. Warren Company ("Warren") and
the S. D. Warren International business in Belgium. Warren manufactures and
sells coated free-sheet paper, uncoated paper and specialty paper, with
manufacturing operations in Muskegon, Michigan, Skowhegan, Maine, Westbrook,
Maine, and Mobile, Alabama and approximately 900,000 acres of timberlands in
Maine.

Scott received $1.6 billion, consisting of approximately $1.48 billion in
cash and the buyer's assumption, supported by a letter of credit, of
approximately $120 million in debt and capital lease obligations relating to
Warren facilities. The consideration received by Scott is subject to adjustment
after the closing based on the value of Warren's net assets, as defined in the
Warren Agreement, on the closing date.

In addition, the parties entered into a number of ancillary agreements
which, among other things, provide for (a) long-term arrangements between or
among Scott, Warren and Mobile Energy Services Company, Inc. ("MESC"), relating
to the Mobile, Alabama site, including an agreement under which Warren will
purchase pulp from Scott's pulp mill at that site (see Item 5 below), and (b)
transition services.

The foregoing description is a summary only and is not intended to be
complete. A copy of the Stock Purchase Agreement is filed as an exhibit to this
Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Item 5. Other Events
------------

(a) On December 16, 1994, Scott consummated the sale of the energy and
recovery complex (the "Energy Complex") located at its Mobile, Alabama mill site
to MESC, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company. The assets
sold include fixtures and equipment, certain contracts related to the Energy
Complex, certain supplies and spare parts. In addition, the land under the
Energy Complex was leased to MESC under a lease with an initial term of twenty-
five years and optional renewal terms. Scott received approximately $350
million, consisting of approximately $265 million in cash and the buyer's
assumption, guaranteed by The Southern Company, of approximately $85 million of
liabilities under a tax-exempt financing relating to the Energy Complex.

In addition, Scott, Warren and MESC have entered into a number of ancillary
agreements with initial terms of twenty-five years and
<PAGE>

optional renewal terms. Among other things, these agreements provide for (a)
the processing by MESC of power, steam and pulping liquor and the provision of
additional services, in each case as applicable, to Scott's tissue mill and pulp
mill and to Warren's paper mill, (b) the supply by Scott's pulp mill of biomass
to the Energy Complex and of water to all facilities at the site, (c) the
coordination of operations by all facilities at the site, and (d) common
services arrangements.

(b) Scott intends to use the net after-tax proceeds from the sale of Warren
and the Mobile Energy Complex to reduce its debt by approximately $1.3 billion
(including the above-mentioned assumptions of debt) and to repurchase Scott
common shares in open market transactions for approximately $300 million. Scott
intends to complete the debt repayment in January 1995 and to repurchase shares
during the first half of 1995.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits

-------------------
Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Pro forma Financial Statements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. As described in Item 2, on December 20, 1994, Scott completed the sale of
S.D. Warren (Warren) and announced its intention to reduce Scott's corporate
debt and to repurchase Scott common shares with the net after-tax proceeds.
Scott's historical financial results have been restated on a pro forma basis
to reflect these transactions. These pro forma consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto of Scott. Additionally, the pro forma
consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the
actual results that would have been achieved had the transactions occurred
on those dates, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results.

2. All summary consolidated balance sheet pro forma adjustments assume the
transactions giving rise to the adjustments were consummated on the balance
sheet date. The pro forma balance sheet adjustments give effect for the
disposition of substantially all assets and certain liabilities of Warren
and the debt and share repurchase transactions. Scott currently estimates
that any gain or loss to be recorded related to the sale of Warren will not
be material and the pro forma financial statements do not reflect any gain
or loss related to the sale of Warren.

Net after-tax proceeds from the sale of Warren were assumed to be used to
reduce debt (including debt assumed by the purchaser of Warren) and to
repurchase 3.9 million of the Company's common shares. The estimated after-
tax loss to be recorded related to the repurchase of debt has been reflected
as of the beginning of the period.

3. All summary consolidated condensed statement of operations pro forma
adjustments assume the transactions giving rise to the adjustments were
consummated immediately prior to the first day of the year ended December
25, 1993; accordingly, no gain or loss from the transactions are reflected
in the consolidated condensed statements of operations for the periods
presented.

The pro forma consolidated condensed statements of operations gives effect
for the following unaudited pro forma adjustments:
(a) Elimination of the results of operations, associated with the Warren
sale, for the periods presented.
(b) Elimination of interest expense based on the assumed reduction in debt.
(c) Calculation of the pro forma tax provision using the statutory rates for
the periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

4. Earnings per share appearing on the pro forma consolidated condensed
statements of operations relating to the sale of Warren has been determined
after deducting the dividends on Scott's preferred shares. Earnings per
share are based on the average number of common shares outstanding for the
nine month periods ended September 24, 1994 and the year ended December 25,
1993 of 70.7 million and 70.1 million shares, respectively. The average
number of shares was adjusted to reflect the assumed buy back of 3.9 million
shares, at the September 24, 1994 closing price of $61.25 per share, with a
portion of the proceeds from the sale.

disputed items and amounts within thirty

6
<PAGE>

days after delivery of such Disagreement Notice, this Agreement and the disputed
items and amounts will be submitted to Ernst & Young, or if such firm is unable
or unwilling to act, such other independent, nationally recognized accounting
firm which has not provided services to either Seller or its affiliates or Buyer

written report of the Independent Accountants (the "Report") shall be delivered
to Buyer and Seller promptly, but in no event later than twenty business days
after such disputed items and amounts are submitted to the Independent
Accountants, and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties. The
procedures for resolution of disputes concerning the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the Closing Statement set forth in this Section 1.6 are intended to be final
and exclusive of any other contest or appeal in relation thereto, so that if (i)
Buyer shall have failed to give the Disagreement Notice within the required
ninety-day period, or (ii) having so given the Disagreement Notice, Buyer
subsequently reaches written agreement with Seller on the disputed items or
amounts, or (iii) no such agreement is reached and the matter is submitted to
the Independent Accountants and they issue their Report, then in all such cases
neither party shall be entitled to subject the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the
Closing Statement, such agreement or the Report to appeal to any court or
tribunal. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants regarding the
preparation and delivery of the Report shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller. The fees and disbursements of Buyer's independent auditors incurred in
connection with their review of the Closing Date Statement shall be borne by
Buyer, and the fees and disbursements of Seller's independent auditors incurred
in connection with preparation of the Closing Date Statement and review of any
Disagreement Notice shall be borne by Seller.

(f) Within five business days after the earliest to occur of (i) in
the event no Disagreement Notice has been delivered by Buyer in accordance with
Section 1.6(d), the date that is ninety days after the Closing Date, (ii) mutual
agreement in writing by Seller and Buyer as to the amount of the adjustment, if
any, and

7
<PAGE>

(iii) delivery of the Report to Seller and Buyer by the Independent Accountants,
Buyer shall pay Seller an amount in cash equal to the amount by which Closing
Net Assets exceeds Base Net Assets or Seller shall pay Buyer an amount in cash
equal to the amount by which Base Net Assets exceeds Closing Net Assets, as the
case may be, together, in either case, with interest in accordance with Section
1.6(g) below.

(g) Any amount payable pursuant to this Section 1.6 will be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by the party receiving such payment at least three business days prior to the
date such payment is due and shall include interest, to the extent such amount
payable is less than $25,000,000, at the Prime Rate (as hereinafter defined) as
in effect on the Closing Date and, to the extent such amount payable is equal to
or greater than $25,000,000, at the Prime Rate as in effect on the Closing Date
plus 2% per annum, in each case from the Closing Date to the date the payment is
made. Interest payable under the provisions of this Section 1.6 shall be
computed on the basis of a 365-day year and actual days elapsed. As used in
this Agreement, the term "Prime Rate" shall mean the rate of interest from time
to time announced publicly by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York as its
base rate. The Initial Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to this Section
1.6, is herein referred to as the "Purchase Price."

(h) From the Closing Date until the final determination of the amount
of the adjustment, if any, each party and its representatives will have
reasonable access to the Company and its employees and records in order to
assist in such determination.

1.7 Transactions. All of the transactions contemplated by this
------------ 
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (other than the Merger Agreement and the
Asset Agreement) shall be deemed to occur simultaneously on the Closing Date at
the time set forth in Section 1.3 hereof, and no such transaction shall be
deemed to have been consummated until all such transactions have been
consummated. The transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Asset
Agreement shall be deemed to occur immediately after the transactions referred
to in the immediately preceding sentence. Substantially con-

8
<PAGE>

temporaneously with the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this
Agreement, Buyer intends to consummate the Financing as contemplated by Section
4.4 hereof (which is expected to include borrowings secured by properties and
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries) and, effective immediately after the
purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to the Agreement, to consummate the
merger of Buyer with and into the Company, which shall be the surviving
corporation thereof (pursuant to which the Company will assume, by operation of
law, all liabilities of Buyer, including with respect to the Financing). Seller
and the Company acknowledge such intentions and agree that the Financing and
such merger shall be considered transactions contemplated by this Agreement for
all purposes of this Agreement.

3.1 Organization of Seller; Authority. Seller is a corporation duly

thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and by
Seller or the Company of such Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller or the
Company, as the case may be. This Agreement has been (and each such Ancillary
Agreement upon execution and delivery will be) duly executed and delivered by

is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on
the business, assets, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise)
or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (a "Material
Adverse Effect"). A list of the jurisdictions in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries are so qualified is set forth in Section 3.3 of the Disclosure

contributions to, and payments from, the Benefit Plans, except those pay-

26

Code; no such determination letter has been revoked, and, to the knowledge of

application for a determination letter. Seller has also made available to Buyer

since the date of such actuarial report, other than (i) amendments thereto for
incentive retirements and (ii) changes in the market value of assets after the

engaged in a transaction described in Section 4069 of ERISA that could subject

that would give rise to any material liability of the Company.

to any additional benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting

taxes under Sections 401(a) and 5.01(a), respectively, of the Code or under any
Welfare Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

of the liability of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for "postemployment
benefits" as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112

Sheet if FAS 112 had been in effect for the period reflected thereon.

(o) No Continuing Employee, as defined in Section 6.2, has received
or will receive prior to the Closing Date notification from Seller or the
Company that his employment will be terminated on or after the thirtieth day

officer of the Company and in such a way as to avoid unreasonably disrupting the

under a legal obligation not to supply and (iv) Buyer shall not be permitted to

-------- ------- 
and hold harmless Seller from any and all liabilities, obligations or damages to
Seller by reason of any actions taken or statements made pursuant to this
sentence by any such employee, accountant, counsel or other representative in
connection with the provisions of this Section.

(b) Buyer will hold and will cause the Buyer Representatives to hold
any information which it or they receive in connection with the activities and
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in
strict confidence in accordance with and subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated as of June 21, 1994 between Sappi and Seller

anything to the contrary herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer shall
be permitted to use and disclose such information (other than proprietary
information of Seller or the Company) to the extent it reasonably deems
necessary or appropriate in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including in connection with making any filing or obtaining any
consent or approval and in connection with arranging or consummating the
Financing). Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating solely to the
Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that Buyer acknowledges that
-------- ------- 
any and

48

all other information provided to it by Seller or Seller's representatives

that might result from the transactions contemplated hereby, answer inquiries
and supply information, whether written or oral, relating to the business or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including legal, accounting,
environmental, pension and benefits, government affairs and other information).

Company or Buyer shall have any obligation to pay any fee to any third party for
the purpose of obtaining any consent or approval or any costs and expenses of
any third party

49

inquiries received from the DOJ or FTC for additional information or

necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary
under the HSR Act. Seller and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the
status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, the FTC and the DOJ. For purposes of this Section 5.5, the

may be required by law or securities exchange regulations applicable to any such
party, in which case such party shall advise the other party and

50

discuss the contents of the disclosure before issuing any such report, statement
or press release. In addition, neither Sappi, Buyer nor Seller shall, and
Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the Company not to, make any
general communication to suppliers, lenders, creditors, distributors, employees,
customers or others having business or financial relationships with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions

provided further, however that, with respect to clause (b) above, any such
- -------- ------- ------- 
supplement or amended disclosure shall, for purposes of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (other than for the purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Article VIII are satisfied), be deemed to have been
disclosed as of the date of this Agreement, provided that any such supplement or
amended disclosure is disclosed in writing to Buyer at least five business days
before the Closing Date; provided, however, that in the event that Seller
-------- ------- 
becomes aware of any such event less than five business days prior to the

such supplement or amendment and Buyer shall have the right to postpone the
Closing Date for up to three business days following such disclosure in order to
evaluate such information.

(b) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of, and furnish Buyer any
information it may reasonably request with respect to, the occurrence, to
Seller's knowledge, of any event or condition or the existence, to Seller's

51
<PAGE>

knowledge, of any fact that would cause any of the conditions to Buyer's
obligation to consummate the purchase and sale of the Shares not to be
fulfilled.

5.8 Confidentiality. Seller shall keep confidential, and cause its
--------------- 
affiliates and its and their officers, directors, employees and advisors to keep
confidential, all information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their businesses, except as required by law or administrative process and except
for information which is available to the public on the Closing Date, or
thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach of

--------- 
to the Company and its Subsidiaries any and all assignable rights which Seller
may have under insurance policies covering claims relating to the business,
assets or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the period on or
prior to the Closing Date.

5.10 Assignment of Confidentiality Agreements. On the Closing Date,
---------------------------------------- 
Seller shall assign to Buyer and the Company its rights under all
confidentiality agreements entered into by such persons with any person in
connection with the proposed sale of the Company to the extent such rights
relate to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Seller shall use its reasonable
efforts to cause copies of such confidentiality agreements to be provided to
Buyer on the Closing Date.

5.11 Certain Licenses and Permits. Seller covenants that all
---------------------------- 
licenses, permits and authorizations which are held in the name of Seller or any
of its affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) or any employee,
officer, director, stockholder or agent of Seller or any of its affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) or otherwise on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be duly and validly transferred, to the
extent transferable, to the Company or such Subsidiary without consideration
prior to the Closing and that the warranties, representations, covenants and
conditions contained in this Agreement

52
<PAGE>

shall apply to the same as if held by the Company or such Subsidiary as of the
date hereof.

5.12 Records. (a) On the Closing Date or as soon as practicable
------- 
thereafter, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer all original
agreements, documents, books, records and files, including records and files

operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent not then in the
possession of the Company and its Subsidiaries, subject to the following
exceptions:

(i) Buyer recognizes that certain Records may contain incidental

(ii) Seller may retain all Records prepared in connection with the
sale of the Shares, including bids received from other parties and analyses

all books, records and personnel of the Company which relate to transactions or
events occurring prior to the Closing ("Pre-Closing Transactions") or
transactions or events occurring subsequent to the Closing which are related to
or arise out of Pre-Closing Transactions, to the extent such Pre-Closing
Transactions relate to liabilities retained by Seller pursuant to this Agreement
or as necessary to comply with applicable financial reporting obligations.

seven years following the Closing, or for such longer period following the
Closing as may be required by law.

6.1(c) hereof, Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes with respect to
the Company shown to be due on the Prior Period Returns.

(ii) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall file, or
cause to be filed, on a timely basis (in each case, at its sole cost and

"Straddle Period Returns"). Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, subject to
Buyer's right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3 hereof, all Taxes
shown to be due on such Returns; provided, however, that any estimated Tax
-------- ------- 
payments shown to be due on such Returns shall be paid one-half by Buyer and
one-half by Seller.

(iii) Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of any Straddle Period
Returns at least twenty business days prior to the due date thereof (giving
effect to any extensions thereto), accompanied by a statement calculating in
reasonable detail Seller's indemnification obligation for the Straddle Period
pursuant to Section 10.3 hereof (the "Indemnification Statement"). Seller shall
have the right to review such Straddle Period Returns and Indemnification
Statement prior to the filing of such Straddle Period Returns. If Seller agrees
to the Indemnification Statement amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the Taxes shown on the Indemnification Statement not later than three
business days before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for payment
of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return. If Seller disputes the
amount calculated in the Indemnification Statement, Seller and Buyer shall
consult and resolve in good faith any issues arising as a result of the

57
<PAGE>

review of such Straddle Period Return and Indemnification Statement. If the
parties are unable to resolve any dispute within 15 business days after Seller's
receipt of such Straddle Period Return and Indemnification Statement then Seller
shall submit the dispute to the Independent Accountants, whose expense shall be
borne equally by Seller and Buyer, and such dispute shall be resolved by the
Independent Accountants, which shall resolve any issue in dispute as promptly as
practicable. If the Independent Accountants are unable to make a determination
with respect to any disputed issue prior to the due date (including any
extensions) for the filing of the Straddle Period Return in question, (A) Buyer
shall file, or shall cause to be filed, such Straddle Period Return without such
determination having been made and (B) Seller shall pay to Buyer, not later than
three days before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for the
payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return, the amount of
Seller's indemnification obligation as set forth on the Indemnification
Statement. Upon delivery to Seller and Buyer by the Independent Accountants of
its determination, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the amount paid by
Seller in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence in order to reflect
the decision of the Independent Accountants. The determination by the
Independent Accountants shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.

(iv) Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause
their respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Returns
(including amended returns and claims for refund), including making available to
each other all existing records necessary in connection with such Returns and in
resolving disputes and audits with respect to Taxes. Buyer and Seller recognize
that Seller will need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to
certain accounting and tax records and information held by the Company to the
extent such records and information pertain to events occurring prior to the
Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing Date Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company to allow Seller and its agents and
representatives (and agents and representatives of its affiliates) upon
reasonable notice to inspect, review and make copies of such records as Seller
reasonably may deem necessary or appropriate from

58
<PAGE>

time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal business hours that
are reasonably acceptable to Buyer and at Seller's cost and expense.

(v) For a period of three years from the Closing Date, Buyer shall in
good faith, and shall cause the Company in good faith to, maintain the business
records and files of the Company relating to material Taxes, that Seller has
identified in writing and that exist on the Closing Date, and Buyer shall not,
and shall cause the Company not to, willfully and knowingly dispose of or
destroy any such business records and files of the Company during such period
without first offering to turn over possession thereof to Seller by written
notice to Seller at least thirty days prior to the proposed date of such
disposition or destruction.

(vi) Subject to Section 6.1(h), any refunds and credits of Taxes of
the Company with respect to (A) any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date that are not attributable to any item of credit, loss or deduction
or expense generated in a period ending after the Closing, shall be for the
account of Seller, and if received or utilized by Buyer or the Company, shall be
paid, net of any expense or Tax cost to Buyer (other than a Tax cost that is
indemnified) to Seller within 20 business days after Buyer or the Company
receives such refund or utilizes such credit, (B) any taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date shall be for the account of Buyer, and if received or
utilized by Seller or any of its affiliates shall be paid, net of any Tax cost
to Seller (other than a Tax cost that is indemnified), by Seller to Buyer within
20 business days after Seller or any of its affiliates receives such refund or
utilizes such credit and (C) except as provided in the next sentence, any
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as if such taxable
period ended on and included the Closing Date. In the case of a refund or
credit attributable to any real property, personal property and intangible
property Taxes, the refund or credit of such Taxes of the Company for the Pre-
Closing Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such refund or credit for the
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period.

59
<PAGE>

(e) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. On or prior to the
------------------------------------- 
Closing Date, any agreement, arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes to
which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party shall be terminated (other than
agreements, arrangements or practices solely between or among the Company and
its Subsidiaries), all obligations thereunder shall be settled, and no
additional payments shall be made under any provisions thereof after the Closing
Date.

(f) Carrybacks. To the maximum extent allowed by law, Buyer must
---------- 
carry back any Tax Benefit which is attributable to the Company for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date or for the Pre-Closing Period
relating to Seller or the Seller Group unless Buyer requests and obtains the
written consent of Seller to do otherwise. Seller shall have the sole
discretion to accept or reject any such request by Buyer.

(g) Elections. Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to,
--------- 
make, amend or revoke any Tax election if such action would adversely affect any
member of the Seller Group with respect to any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date or for the Pre-Closing Period or any Tax refund with
respect thereto.

(h) Timing Adjustments. (i) If an audit or other examination of any
------------------ 
Return prepared in connection with income taxes ("Income Tax Return") of Seller
or the Company for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date shall
result (by final settlement or other final disposition) in any adjustment the
effect of which is to increase deductions, losses or tax credits or decrease
income, gains or recapture of tax credits ("Changes") reflected on the Income
Tax Returns of Buyer or the Company for taxable periods commencing on or after
the Closing Date, Seller will notify Buyer and provide Buyer with all necessary
information so that it can reflect on the Income Tax Returns of Buyer or the
Company any appropriate Changes. If as a result of such Changes, Buyer enjoys a
net Tax Benefit from an increase in deductions, losses or tax credits and/or a
decrease in the income, gains or recapture of tax credits (after taking into
account the deferral of, or decrease in, deductions, losses or tax credits, or
acceleration of, or increase in, income, gain or recapture of tax credits
suffered by Buyer as a result of such Changes) (collectively, the

60
<PAGE>

"Buyer Benefits") with respect to Income Tax Returns for any taxable period
commencing after the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly make payments to Seller
as and when Buyer realizes such Buyer Benefits. Buyer shall cause such Buyer
Benefits to be claimed on the appropriate Income Tax Returns of Buyer or the
Company if, in the sole judgment of Buyer, such claim will not adversely affect
Buyer, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates. For
purposes of this Section 6.1(h)(i), the amount of Buyer Benefits paid to Seller
shall include the amount of interest actually received by Buyer or the Company,
if any.

(ii) If an audit or other examination of any Income Tax Return of
Buyer or the Company for taxable periods ending after the Closing Date shall
result (by final settlement or other final disposition) in any Changes reflected
on the Income Tax Returns of Seller, any Affiliated Group, the Company or its
Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, Buyer
will notify Seller and provide Seller with all necessary information so that it
can reflect on the Income Tax Returns of Seller, an Affiliated Group or the
Company any appropriate Changes. If, as a result of such Changes, Seller or any
of its affiliates enjoys a net Tax Benefit from an increase in deductions,
losses or tax credits and/or a decrease in the income, gains or recapture of tax
credits (after taking into account the deferral of, or decrease in, deductions,
losses or tax credits, or acceleration of, or increase in, income, gain or
recapture of tax credits suffered by Seller as a result of such Changes)
(collectively, the "Seller Benefits") with respect to Income Tax Returns for any
taxable period commencing after the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly make
payments to Buyer as and when Seller realizes such Seller Benefits. Seller
shall cause such Seller Benefits to be claimed on the appropriate Income Tax
Returns of Seller or the Company if, in the sole judgment of Seller, such claim
will not adversely affect Seller or its affiliates. For purposes of this

(b) Assumption of Liabilities of, and Transfer of Assets from,
----------------------------------------------------------
Pension Plans and Warren Pension Plans.
- -------------------------------------- 

62
<PAGE>

After the date of this Agreement and before the Closing Date, Seller
shall take all actions (or shall cause the Company to take all actions)
necessary or appropriate to create one or more (as determined by Buyer, subject
to any applicable legal requirements) defined benefit pension plans (together,
"Buyer's Pension Plans") and related trust or trusts intended to qualify and be
tax-exempt under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code, and sufficient
to satisfy all benefits protected under Section 411(d)(6) of the Code, for the
benefit of the Continuing Employees and to permit the transfer of assets and
liabilities pursuant to the requirements of Section 414(l) of the Code. Prior
to Closing, and subject to Section 6.2(f) hereof, (i) Buyer's Pension Plans
shall assume all liabilities for accrued benefits, including, without
limitation, all ancillary benefits, under the Scott Pension Plans and the Warren
Pension Plans in respect of all Continuing Employees, and the Scott Pension
Plans and the Warren Pension Plans shall be relieved of all liabilities for such
benefits, and (ii) Seller shall direct the trustee of the Scott Pension Plans
and the Warren Pension Plans to transfer, in one or more steps, from the Master
Trust in which such plans participate (the "Scott Master Trust") to a trust
under Buyer's Pension Plans that is not part of the Scott Master Trust, assets
selected by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Buyer equal to an amount
initially determined by Towers Perrin ("Seller's Actuary") to be equal to the
amount of assets which must be transferred as of the date as of which the
transfer occurs (the "Pension Transfer Date") solely on account of benefits for
Continuing Employees as determined in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder. On the Closing Date, Seller shall contribute
(in such proportion as Seller and Buyer shall agree) to Buyer's Pension Plans an
amount in cash equal to $15.0 million increased (or decreased) by the amount, if
any, by which the value of the assets in Buyer's Pension Plans as of the Pension
Transfer Date is less than (or greater than) the value that the assets in
Buyer's Pension Plans would have had on such date if (A) $74.2 million had been
transferred to Buyer's Pension Plans on June 30, 1994, and (B) the investment
results applicable to such amount thereafter had been the same as if such amount
had been invested in the Scott Master Trust; provided, however, that to the
extent that Seller will be unable to claim a current Federal income tax
deduction on its 1994 consoli-

63
<PAGE>

dated income tax return for the amount to be contributed, such amount shall not
be contributed to Buyer's Pension Plans but instead shall be paid by Seller
directly to Buyer or the Company, at Buyer's direction, at Closing. If the
amount of such transfer, contribution or payment cannot be determined with
certainty by the Closing Date, the amount transferred, contributed or paid on or
before the Closing Date shall be an amount agreed by Seller and Buyer to be
substantially all of a reasonable estimate of such transfer, contribution or
payment, with the remainder to be transferred, contributed or paid as promptly
as possible thereafter with interest thereon from the Pension Transfer Date to
the date of the transfer, contribution or payment at the rate equal to the yield
on 90-day U.S. Treasury bills on the Pension Transfer Date. Between the Pension
Transfer Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall consult in good faith with
Buyer on the investment of assets in Buyer's Pension Plans. The determinations
hereunder shall be initially made by Seller's Actuary but shall be subject to
the approval of an actuary selected by Buyer, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Company to, assume and become the sponsor of Buyer's Pension Plans and on and
after the Closing Date, the Company shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless for
all liabilities for all accrued benefits, including, without limitation, all
ancillary benefits, assumed by Buyer's Pension Plans and each of Seller, the
Scott Pension Plans and the Warren Pension Plans shall be relieved of all
liabilities for such benefits. Buyer and Seller shall provide each other with
such records and information as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out
their respective obligations under this Section or for the purposes of
administration of Buyer's Pension Plan, and each shall cooperate in the filing
of documents required by the transfer of assets and liabilities described
herein.

(c) Defined Contribution Plans.
-------------------------- 

As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall have
established (or shall have caused the Company to establish) one or more (as
determined by Buyer, subject to any applicable legal requirements) qualified
defined contribution savings or thrift plans ("Buyer's Thrift Plan") and a
related trust or trusts thereunder intended to qualify and be tax-exempt under

64
<PAGE>

Section 401(a) and Section 501(a), respectively, of the Code. Buyer's Thrift
Plan shall contain provisions: (i) allowing for the trust-to-trust transfer of
all assets held for the benefit of Continuing Employees under Seller's Salaried
Investment Plan or Seller's Hourly Investment Plan (together, "Seller's Thrift
Plan") into Buyer's Thrift Plan, including, without limitation, the transfer in
kind of common shares, no par value, of Seller and the transfer of plan loans to
participants, (ii) allowing Continuing Employees to elect to receive their
assets from Buyer's Thrift Plan under the optional forms of benefit provided
under Seller's Thrift Plan and (iii) recognizing for all purposes under Buyer's
Thrift Plan all service that was recognized under Seller's Thrift Plan as if it
were service rendered to Buyer. At the Closing, in accordance with the terms of
Seller's Thrift Plan, the Company shall cease being a participating company in
Seller's Thrift Plan and both employer and employee contributions to such plans
shall cease at the Closing Date for all Continuing Employees. Upon receipt by
Seller of written evidence of the adoption of Buyer's Thrift Plan and the trust
thereunder by Buyer and either (A) the receipt by Seller of a copy of a
favorable determination letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service with
respect to Buyer's Thrift Plan or (B) an opinion, reasonably satisfactory to
Seller's counsel, of Buyer's counsel to the effect that the terms of Buyer's
Thrift Plan and its related trust qualify under Section 401(a) and Section
501(a) of the Code, Seller shall direct the trustee of Seller's Thrift Plan to
transfer to the trustee of Buyer's Thrift Plan assets selected by Seller and
acceptable to Buyer equal to the account balances under Seller's Thrift Plan as
of the date of transfer in respect of Continuing Employees participating in
Seller's Thrift Plan. Upon such transfer, Buyer's Thrift Plan shall assume, and
the Company shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless for, all liabilities for
all accrued benefits under Seller's Thrift Plan in respect of all Continuing
Employees and each of Seller and Seller's Thrift Plan shall be relieved of all
liabilities for such accrued benefits. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in the
filing of documents required by the transfer of assets and liabilities described
herein.

(d) Other Benefits.

On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) permit Continuing
Employees to participate immediately in Buyer's medical and dental benefit
plan(s) (or in new medical and dental plan(s) created by the Company), with a

incurred after Closing, and provide such Continuing Employees and their
beneficiaries credit for any deductibles and copayments incurred under Seller's
medical and dental benefit plans during the current plan year before the Closing
Date, (ii) recognize for all purposes under Buyer's severance pay plan or plans
(or new severance plan(s) created by the Company) the service of Continuing

Continuing Employees the same benefits for such period as it provides to its own
similarly situated employees, and (iii) permit Continuing Employees to take
vacation during 1994 to the extent of any unused vacation entitlement under
Seller's vacation plans, or reimburse such Continuing Employees for the loss
thereof at the rate of pay not less than that in effect at Closing. As of the
Closing Date, in accordance with the terms of Seller's welfare plans, the
Company shall cease to be a participating company in such plans. Neither Buyer

provided under any plan of the Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
including any claims resulting from disabilities incurred but not reported as of
the Closing Date, (ii) any benefits provided to persons who do not become
Continuing Employees, or (iii) any expenses incurred under Seller's welfare
plans. Seller shall be responsible for any award granted prior to the Closing
Date of stock appreciation rights, stock options, restricted stock or
performance shares or units, or other incentive compensation to any employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to any employee of the Seller who
becomes a Continuing Employee. Buyer shall not assume, and neither Buyer nor
the Company shall have, any liability with respect to Items 11-21 listed in

(iii) With respect to all other tax-exempt bond financings set forth

Solid Waste Bonds, if Seller is not released from its guarantee thereof pursuant
to paragraph (ii) above), at the Closing the Company shall assume all Seller's
obligations under the applicable financing documents. As security for the
foregoing, Buyer shall obtain at its own expense and cause to be delivered to
Seller, for each such bond financing, an irrevocable standby letter of credit
for the benefit of Seller from a bank with total assets of not less than $20
billion and a long-term senior debt rating or long-term deposit rating by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. of A3 or better and a long-term senior debt

6.3(g), each such letter of credit shall from time to time have a stated amount
determined by Seller of not more than the sum of: the then outstanding
principal of the related bonds plus the premium, if any, payable on such bonds
upon optional redemption thereof (or, if such bonds are not presently subject to
optional redemption, on the first optional redemption date), plus one year's
interest on such bonds plus, if such bonds are not then subject to optional
redemption, an amount equal to interest that will accrue on such bonds until the
first date such bonds are subject to optional redemption. Such letter of credit
shall permit a drawing of the full amount by Seller if (i) Seller is called upon
to make any payment thereon (whether or not the bonds are accelerated) unless

part of its property. If Seller makes a drawing under any such letter of

interest on the bonds to the extent of the drawing, and (ii) hold any excess of
such drawings over the payments of principal and interest on the bonds (and any
earnings on such excess) in a segregated account as cash collateral solely to
secure payments of principal, interest and premium (if any) on the bonds. When
such bonds have been paid in full, redeemed or defeased, Seller will return to
Buyer all funds drawn on the letter of credit in excess of those applied to the
payment, redemption and/or defeasance of such bonds and payment of fees, costs
and other expenses incurred by Seller in connection therewith (it being agreed

amount.

year (except that the final expiration date shall not be later than 120 days
after the scheduled termination date, as extended by any optional renewals, of
the Power Sales Agreement and the Feedwater Equipment Lease) unless at least
fifteen days' notice of non-renewal is given to Seller and shall permit a draw

such time under the Power Sales Agreement and the Feedwater Equipment Lease and
may

71
<PAGE>

reduce by amounts payable thereunder for which Seller has obtained a release
from GE Capital Corporation. Such letter of credit shall permit a drawing of
the full amount by Seller if (i) Seller is called upon to make any payment or
notice is given of failure to perform any other obligation and any applicable
cure period for such failure lapses and provides a right to accelerate any
payment under the documents assumed (whether or not the payments under the Power
Sales Agreement or the Feedwater Equipment Lease are accelerated) unless the
Company is contesting the applicability of such obligation diligently by
appropriate proceedings instituted in good faith (other than if such payments
are accelerated or in the case of a failure to make a scheduled payment) or (ii)
the Company or Buyer (A) commences a voluntary case seeking relief with respect
to itself or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or seeks
the appointment of a trustee, receiver or similar official of it or any

payments when due under the Power Sales Agreement and the Feedwater Equipment
Lease. One hundred twenty days following the termination of the Power Sales
Agreement and the Feedwater Equipment Lease, Seller will return to Buyer all
funds drawn on the letter of credit in excess of those applied to the payments
due under the Power Sales Agreement and the Feedwater Equipment Lease and
payment of fees, costs and other expenses incurred by Seller in connection
therewith (it being agreed that Buyer shall have the right to grant a security
interest in its right to such excess). Any draw on a letter of

72
<PAGE>

credit shall automatically reduce Buyer's liability to Seller on the relevant
underlying obligation by a corresponding amount.

(g) Letters of Credit.
----------------- 

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.3 to the
contrary, Seller shall provide Buyer with a schedule, no later than ten business

stock of the Company, or the assets or business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. In the event that Seller, the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any other affiliate of Seller receives a written proposal relating to

8.2 Alternative Satisfaction of Condition.
------------------------------------- 

(a) Notwithstanding Section 8.1(a) of this Agreement, (i) if the
condition set forth therein could not be satisfied but for this Section 8.2 and
the failure of such condition relates to matters that will result in losses,
diminution in value (including the fair market value of the Shares),
liabilities, damages or expenses to Buyer (including such as are suffered or
incurred indirectly as an adverse effect on the business, properties, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Company) in an aggregate amount on
a pre-tax basis (the

81
<PAGE>

"Section 8.1 Amount") less than or equal to the amount of the Basket (as
hereinafter defined), then the condition set forth in Section 8.1(a) hereof
shall be deemed satisfied and the Basket shall be reduced by such aggregate
amount for purposes of Section 10.5 hereof; and (ii) if the Section 8.1 Amount
is greater than the Basket and less than an amount equal to three percent of the
Initial Purchase Price (the "Maximum Threshold"), the condition set forth in
Section 8.1(a) hereof shall be deemed satisfied and the Initial Purchase Price
shall be reduced by such Section 8.1 Amount (and the Basket shall be reduced to
zero for purposes of Section 10.5 hereof). If the Section 8.1 Amount is equal
to or greater than the Maximum Threshold, the condition set forth Section 8.1(a)
shall not be deemed satisfied.

(b) If Buyer determines that there is a failure or a prospective
failure of the condition set forth in Section 8.1(a) hereof as aforesaid, Buyer
shall promptly submit to Seller a written statement setting forth in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances surrounding such failure or prospective
failure of condition and Buyer's estimate (to the extent ascertainable) of the
Section 8.1 Amount. Seller shall have five business days to notify Buyer
whether it agrees or disagrees with all or any portion of the facts and
circumstances set forth in such notice. Failure of Seller to disagree within
such five business day period shall be deemed to constitute Seller's agreement
with such statement and the estimate of the Section 8.1 Amount, and the Closing
shall occur on the basis set forth in Section 8.2(a) (subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement). If Seller notifies Buyer within such five
business day period of its disagreement with the facts and circumstances set
forth in Buyer's notice, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine
the Section 8.1 Amount, if any. Any dispute as to the Section 8.1 Amount may be
submitted by either party for resolution by, and shall be resolved by, Morgan
Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such
other independent, nationally recognized investment banking firm which has not
provided services to either Buyer or its affiliates or Seller or its affiliates
during the one-year period immediately preceding the date hereof (the
"Independent Bankers"), and the determination of the Independent Bankers shall
be made as promptly as practicable and shall be final, conclusive and binding
upon the parties.

82
<PAGE>

The fees and expenses of the Independent Bankers regarding the determination of
the Section 8.1 Amount shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. If there is
a dispute as to whether the Section 8.1 Amount exceeds the Basket, and such
dispute is not resolved prior to the Closing Date, the Section 8.1 Amount in
dispute shall be paid at Closing by Buyer to a mutually acceptable escrow agent
pursuant to an escrow agreement containing customary terms (and in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller) and such escrowed funds
shall be released to Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, in accordance with the
determination of the Independent Bankers; provided, however, that if there is a
-------- ------- 
dispute as to whether the Section 8.1 Amount exceeds the Maximum Threshold, the
Closing shall not occur until such dispute is resolved in accordance with the
procedures set forth above.

8.3 Benefit of Assignment.
--------------------- 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
but without limiting Section 8.1(m) or 10.4, with respect to each Scott Leased
Asset, Seller shall not be obligated to assign or transfer, or cause such
assignment or transfer to Buyer of any of Seller's right, title and interest,
whether legal or equitable, in and to such Scott Leased Asset without first
having obtained all necessary consents and approvals, if any, or a waiver
thereof, required with respect to such assignment or transfer of such Scott
Leased Asset. For a period of six months after the Closing Date, Seller shall
use reasonable efforts (which shall not require Seller to incur any financial
obligation to any party), and Buyer shall cooperate with Seller to obtain the
consents and approvals, if any, or a waiver thereof, referred to in this Section
8.3(a).

(b) To the extent that such consents and approvals, if any, or a
waiver thereof, are not obtained by Seller, Seller shall use its reasonable
efforts, and Buyer shall cooperate with Seller, to establish arrangements that
are reasonably satisfactory and lawful as to Seller and Buyer, and which result
in Buyer being able to enjoy the benefits and Seller being protected from the
obligations under or relating to each such Scott Leased Asset from and after the
Closing Date.

83
<PAGE>

(c) If Seller obtains consents to assign or transfer any Scott Leased
Asset after the Closing, each such Scott Leased Asset shall be deemed to be
assigned or transferred to Buyer promptly after Seller obtains such consent, and
the obligations under such Scott Leased Asset shall be deemed assumed for all
purposes by Buyer, effective as of Buyer's receipt of notice given by Seller of
such consent. Any agreement which Seller and Buyer have theretofore entered
into or agreed upon in respect of such Scott Leased Asset shall be terminated
with respect to such Scott Leased Asset effective as of the date that such
notice is given to Buyer; provided, however, that in no event shall the
-------- ------- 
termination of such agreement relieve either Seller or Buyer of its respective
obligations under such agreement that are attributable to periods of time
occurring prior to such termination.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, Seller
makes no representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to whether any
consent, approval or waiver with respect to the assignment or transfer of a
Scott Leased Asset shall be obtainable.

IX. TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.

9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
----------- 
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements may be

(b) at any time after the 180th day following the date of this
Agreement (the "Termination Date"), by either Seller or Buyer upon five business
days' prior written notice to the other party, if the Closing shall not have
occurred for any reason other than a breach of this Agreement by the terminating
party;

(c) by Buyer if, in its good faith opinion, compliance with any
request for additional information made by the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to the
HSR Act would be unduly burdensome or expensive; provided that prior to such
-------- 
termination Buyer shall have exercised reasonable efforts to negotiate an
arrangement acceptable to it with the FTC or the DOJ for satisfying such
request;

84
<PAGE>

(d) (i) by Seller if any condition set forth in Section 7.1 was not,
or cannot reasonably be, satisfied in all material respects on or prior to the
Termination Date and shall not have been waived by Seller or (ii) by Buyer if
any condition set forth in Section 8.1 (subject to the provisions of Section
8.2) was not, or cannot reasonably be, satisfied in all material respects on or
prior to the Termination Date and shall not have been waived by Buyer, unless
the failure of such condition is the result of a material breach of this
Agreement by the party seeking termination; or

(e) by Buyer or Seller if any court of competent jurisdiction or any
Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the
purchase of Shares pursuant to this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable.

9.2 Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of the
----------------------------------- 
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements pursuant to Section 9.1(b)

and thereby shall be abandoned without further action by Seller or Buyer. If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or (b) hereof:

and all confidential information received by Buyer with respect to the Company
shall be treated in accordance with Section 5.2 hereof and the Confidentiality
Agreement referred to in such Section;

(b) At the option of Seller, all filings, applications and other
submissions made pursuant to Sections 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 hereof shall, to the
extent practicable, be withdrawn from the agency or other person to which made;

85
<PAGE>

(c) If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated
hereby are abandoned as described in this Section 9.2, this Agreement shall
become null and void and of no further force or effect, except for the
obligations provided for in Sections 3.21, 4.7, 5.6, 9.2 and 10.1 hereof, the
confidentiality provision contained in Section 5.2 hereof and the
Confidentiality Agreement referred to in such Section shall survive any such
termination of this Agreement; and

(d) Such termination shall not be deemed to release and shall not
relieve either party hereto from any liability for any wilful or grossly
negligent breach or violation by such party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or to impair the
right of either party to compel specific performance by the other party of its
obligations under this Agreement.

9.3 Amendment, Modification and Waiver. This Agreement may be
---------------------------------- 
amended, modified or supplemented at any time but only by written agreement of
the parties hereto. Any failure of Seller or Buyer to comply with any term or
provision of this Agreement may be waived by the other party at any time;
provided that any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
- -------- 
in writing signed by or on behalf of such other party, and such waiver shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure to comply.

X. FEES AND EXPENSES: SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS; INDEMNIFICATION.
---------------------------------------------------------------- 

10.1 Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
----------------- 
hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements are consummated pursuant hereto and
thereto, each of Seller and Buyer shall pay all fees and expenses incurred by it
or on its behalf and Seller shall cause the Company to pay all fees and expenses
incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with or in anticipation of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; provided,
-------- 
however, that if the Closing occurs, the Company may pay all or any portion of
- ------- 
the fees and expenses incurred by Buyer. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,

86
<PAGE>

prior to the Closing, the Company shall have requested final invoices from its
accountants, attorneys and other similar professionals reflecting all fees and
expenses payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
services rendered to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall have paid in full the agreed amount of such invoices. To the
extent that such final invoices do not reflect fully the services and fees of
such persons rendered on or prior to the Closing, such persons may supplement
within 30 days after the Closing, their respective final invoices, and the
amount thereof shall, for the purposes of Section 1.6 hereof, be included (to
the extent not theretofore included) as a Liability on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet.

10.2 Survival of Representations. The representations and warranties
--------------------------- 
in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive
the Closing solely for purposes of Article X and shall terminate two years after
the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) representations and warranties

3.13 hereof shall terminate six years after the Closing Date; and (iv)
representations and warranties under Section 3.19 hereof shall terminate four

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, agents, employees, stockholders and
representatives ("Seller Indemnified Parties"), at any time after the Closing,
from and against any liability for Taxes of the Company for any taxable period
ending after the Closing Date (except to the extent such taxable period began
before the Closing Date, in which case

87
<PAGE>

Buyer's indemnity will cover only that portion of any such Taxes that is not
attributable to the Pre-Closing Period). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its affiliates from and
against any liability for Taxes of the Company attributable to activities or
actions taken by the Buyer after the Closing outside of the ordinary course of
business (including, but not limited to, any Taxes resulting from the Financing
and the Merger contemplated hereby) other than Taxes arising from the Election
or, if state or local law does not recognize an election comparable to an
election under 338(h)(10) of the Code, from any election under state or local
law that is comparable to the election under Section 338(g) of the Code. Buyer
shall indemnify Seller for any net income Tax, on a marginal basis, that is
imposed by the State of New York or the State of Ohio upon Seller with respect
to the sale of the Shares as a result of such State's not recognizing an
election comparable to an election under 338(h)(10) of the Code; provided,
-------- 
however, that Buyer's indemnity obligation with respect to Taxes imposed by each
- ------- 
such State shall not exceed the aggregate amount of indemnity payments received
by Buyer from Seller pursuant to Section 10.3(b)(iii)(B) hereof with respect to
such State. Buyer shall indemnify Seller for all liabilities for reasonable
legal, accounting, appraisal, consulting or similar fees and expenses relating
to any item contained in this Section 10.3(a).

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Buyer, its affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and their
respective officers, directors, agents, employees, stockholders and
representatives ("Buyer Indemnified Parties") at any time after the Closing,
from and against any liability for (i) any Taxes of Seller, the Company, its
Subsidiaries, any of their respective affiliates and any member of any
Affiliated Group for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
and for the Pre-Closing Period, (ii) all liability (including, without
limitation, liability for Taxes of Seller or the Seller Group arising pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or otherwise) for Taxes of Seller or
any other person (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) and (iii) (A) all
liability for Taxes relating to the Election and (B) if state or local law does
not recognize

88
<PAGE>

an election comparable to an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, all
liability for Taxes relating to any election under state or local law that is
comparable to the election under Section 338(g) of the Code. Seller shall
indemnify Buyer for all liabilities for reasonable legal, accounting, appraisal,
consulting or similar fees and expenses relating to any item contained on this
Section 10.3(b).

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period, except as provided in
subparagraph (d) below, the liability for Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Period (other than Transfer Taxes) shall be
computed as if such taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date.

(d) In the case of any real property, personal property and
intangible property Taxes for the Straddle Period (other than Transfer Taxes)
the liability for such Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-
Closing Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period.

(e) If a claim for Taxes shall be made by any Taxing Authority in
writing, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to
this Section 10.3, the party seeking indemnification (the "Tax Indemnified
Party") shall promptly notify the other party (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") in
writing of such claim (a "Tax Claim"), and in reasonable detail to apprise the
Tax Indemnifying Party of the nature of the Tax Claim, and provide copies of all
correspondence and documents received by it from the relevant Taxing Authority.
Failure to give prompt notice of a Tax Claim hereunder shall not affect the Tax
Indemnifying Party's obligation under this Section 10.3, except to the extent
that the Tax Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give
prompt notice.

(f) With respect to any Tax Claim which might result in an indemnity
payment to Buyer pursuant to Section 10.3(b) (including, without limitation,
Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period), if Seller acknowledg-

89
<PAGE>

es in writing its obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
therefor, then Seller shall control all proceedings taken in connection with
such Tax Claim and, without limiting the foregoing, may, after consultation with
Buyer, in its sole discretion and at its sole expense pursue or forego any and
all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either
pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such
refund suits or contest such Tax Claim. Buyer shall not under any circumstances
settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim referred to in the preceding
sentence without Seller's prior written consent. In connection with any
proceeding taken in connection with such Tax Claim, (i) Seller shall keep Buyer
informed of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim if
involving a material liability for Taxes and (ii) Buyer shall have the right, at
its sole expense, to participate in (but not control) any such proceedings.
Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in contesting such Tax Claim (without charge
to Seller, except that Seller shall bear all reasonable third-party expenses
incurred by Buyer), which cooperation shall include, without limitation, the
retention and the provision to Seller of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available to Seller
to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim, provided,
-------- 
however, that no charges shall be incurred by Seller for the services of such
- ------- 
employees (except that Seller shall bear all reasonable third-party expenses
incurred by Buyer) and provided, further, (i) that Seller and its
-------- ------- 
representatives shall take such action as is deemed necessary in the reasonable
judgment of Buyer and the Company to schedule such access and visits through a
designated officer of the Company and in such a way as to avoid disrupting the
normal business of the Company, (ii) the Company shall not be required to take
any action which would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other
privilege and (iii) the Company need not supply Seller with any information
which, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer or the Company, the Company is under
a legal obligation not to supply.

(g) With respect to any Tax Claim not described in Section 10.3(f)
which might result in an

90
<PAGE>

indemnity payment to Seller pursuant to Section 10.3(a), Buyer shall control all
proceedings in accordance with provisions that are parallel to those in Section
10.3(f).

(h) Except as set forth in Section 6.1(d)(iii), any indemnity payment
payable by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this Section 10.3
shall be paid within thirty days after the Tax Indemnified Party's written
request therefor (or, if later, ten days prior to the date such Tax is required
to be paid), provided that such request shall be accompanied by a copy of the
applicable Return or a final audit determination and a statement reflecting the
calculation of the amount for which the Tax Indemnifying Party is liable.
Within thirty days following the receipt of a request for any indemnity payment
hereunder, together with a computation by the Tax Indemnified Party of the
indemnity amount payable hereunder, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall pay such
amount in immediately available funds in the manner designated by the Tax
Indemnified Party to the Tax Indemnified Party and may in good faith request in
writing the Independent Accountants to determine, at the Tax Indemnifying
Party's expense, whether such computation and amount are correct. After each
party has had the opportunity to consult with, and present evidence and
arguments to, the Independent Accountants, upon receipt thereof, the Tax
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Tax Indemnifying Party a statement from
the Independent Accountants setting forth the determination by the Independent
Accountants of such computation and the amount payable hereunder as an
indemnity. The determination by the Independent Accountants in conformity with
the provisions of this Agreement shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties hereto, subject to review only by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Within five business days after delivery to the Tax Indemnifying Party of the
statement of determination by the Independent Accountants of such amount, the
Tax Indemnified Party shall pay, in immediately available funds to the Tax
Indemnifying Party in the manner designated by the Tax Indemnified Party, the
difference between (i) the amount paid to the Tax Indemnified Party by the Tax

sentence of this Section 10.3(h).

<PAGE>

(i) Any provision in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
the liability of any party hereto to indemnify any other party hereto pursuant
to Section 10.3 hereof in respect of Tax Claims shall be limited to Tax Claims
as to which the Tax Indemnified Party has given the Tax Indemnifying Party
written notice, setting forth therein in reasonable detail the basis for such
Tax Claim, on or prior to the later of (A) the day and date on which the
applicable statute of limitations relating to the Taxes at issue expires (after
giving effect to extensions thereof) or (B) thirty days after the Tax
Indemnified Party receives written notice from the relevant Taxing Authority of
the Tax Claim.

10.4 Seller's Agreement to Indemnify. Upon the terms and subject to
------------------------------- 
conditions of this Article X, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Buyer Indemnified Parties, at any time after the Closing, from and against all
demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages,
diminution in value, liabilities, costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
(collectively, "Damages") asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or
suffered or incurred by Buyer Indemnified Parties by reason of or arising from
(i) a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement (other than those contained in Section 3.14 hereof)
or the Asset Agreement or any facts or circumstances constituting such a breach;
(ii) other than such for which indemnification is provided in Section 10.3, non-
fulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Seller contained in or made pursuant
to this Agreement or the Asset Agreement or any facts or circumstances
constituting such non-fulfillment; (iii) Seller's transfer of any asset subject
to a Safe Harbor Lease or assignment of any Safe Harbor Lease, including any
termination payments resulting from any such transfer or assignment; (iv) the
grant, issuance, cancellation, termination or settlement of any stock
appreciation rights, stock options, restricted stock, performance shares or
units or other incentive compensation granted to employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or to any employee of Seller who becomes a Continuing
Employee prior to the Closing Date; (v) any judgment or settlement and any
related legal fees and expenses arising out of the litigation referred to in

92
<PAGE>

Schedule; or (vi) Seller's failure to transfer any of the Scott Assets at or
prior to Closing or to obtain any required consent to the transfer of any Scott
Leased Assets, subject to the provisions of Section 8.3(b) hereof (collectively,
"Buyer Claims").

The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this Section 10.4, or Taxes or Expenses for which indemnification is provided
under Section 10.3(b), to a Buyer Indemnified Party shall be (i) increased to
take account of any net Tax cost incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Party
arising from the receipt or accrual of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up
for any such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of any Tax benefit
realized by such Buyer Indemnified Party as a result of the deductibility of
such Damages, Taxes or Expenses (or payments with respect thereto). Any
indemnification payment hereunder shall initially be made without regard to this
paragraph and shall be increased or reduced to reflect any such net Tax cost
(including gross-up) or net Tax benefit only after such Buyer Indemnified Party
has actually realized such cost or benefit. For purposes of this Agreement, a
Buyer Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax
cost or a net Tax benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of
Taxes payable by such Buyer Indemnified Party is increased above or reduced
below, as the case may be, the amount of Taxes that such Buyer Indemnified Party
would be required to pay but for the receipt of the indemnity payment or the
incurrence or payment of such Damages.

10.5 Seller's Limitation of Liability. Any provision in this
-------------------------------- 
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the liability of Seller to indemnify
Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 10.4(i) hereof against any Damages
sustained by reason of any Buyer Claim with respect to the breach of a
representation or warranty shall be limited to Buyer Claims as to which a Buyer
Indemnified Party has given Seller written notice, setting forth therein in
reasonable detail the basis for such Buyer Claim, on or prior to the termination
of such representation or warranty pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof; provided,
-------- 
however, that the provisions for indemnification contained in Section 10.4(i)
- ------- 
(other than with respect to Sections 3.2 and 3.21) shall be effective only with
respect to any Buyer Claim (or group of similar

93
<PAGE>

Buyer Claims) for Damages which exceeds $50,000 and only after the aggregate
amount of all such Buyer Claims for which Seller is liable under this Agreement
exceeds an amount equal to the product of (y) the Initial Purchase Price
multiplied by (z) .0125 (the "Basket"), and only to the extent of such excess,
and in no event shall the aggregate amount of all Buyer Claims for which Seller
is liable pursuant to such Section 10.4(i) (other than with respect to Sections
3.2 and 3.21) exceed an amount equal to the product of (a) the Initial Purchase
Price multiplied by (b).25.

10.6 Buyer's Agreement to Indemnify. Upon the terms and subject to
------------------------------ 
conditions of this Article X, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller Indemnified Parties, at any time after the Closing, from and against all
Damages asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by Seller
Indemnified Parties by reason of or arising from (i) a breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement or the Asset Agreement or any facts or circumstances constituting such
a breach; (ii) other than such for which indemnification is provided in Section
10.3, non-fulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Buyer or, after the
Closing, the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or the
Asset Agreement, including, without limitation, those set forth in Sections 6.2
and 6.3 hereof with respect to the assumption by Buyer, Buyer's Pension Plan,
Buyer's Thrift Plan or the Company of pension plan or financing arrangement
obligations, respectively, or any facts or circumstances constituting such non-
fulfillment; or (iii) any obligation or liability of the Company or the
Continuing Business prior to the Closing Date that has been set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule (other than matters for which the Seller has agreed to
indemnify the Buyer pursuant to Section 10.3, 10.4 or 10.8 hereof)
(collectively, "Seller Claims").

The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this Section 10.6, or Taxes or Expenses for which indemnification is provided
under Section 10.3(a), to a Seller Indemnified Party shall be (i) increased to
take account of any net Tax cost incurred by such Seller Indemnified Party
arising from the receipt or accrual of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up
for any such increase) and (ii) reduced to

94
<PAGE>

take account of any Tax Benefit realized by such Seller Indemnified Party as a
result of the deductibility of such Damages or Taxes (or payments with respect
thereto). Any indemnification payment hereunder shall initially be made without
regard to this paragraph and shall be increased or reduced to reflect any such
net Tax cost (including gross-up) or net Tax benefit only after such Seller
Indemnified Party has actually realized such cost or benefit. For purposes of
this Agreement, a Seller Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have "actually
realized" a net Tax cost or a net Tax benefit to the extent that, and at such
time as, the amount of Taxes payable by such Seller Indemnified Party is
increased above or reduced below, as the case may be, the amount of Taxes that
such Seller Indemnified Party would be required to pay but for the receipt of
the indemnity payment or the incurrence or payment of such Damages.

10.7 Buyer's Limitation of Liability. Any provision in this
------------------------------- 
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the liability of Buyer to indemnify
Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 10.6(i) hereof against any
Damages sustained by reason of any Seller Claim with respect to the breach of a
representation or warranty shall be limited to Seller Claims as to which a
Seller Indemnified Party has given Buyer written notice thereof, setting forth
therein in reasonable detail the basis for such Seller Claim, on or prior to the
termination of such representation or warranty pursuant Section 10.2 hereof;

provided, however, that the provisions for indemnification contained in Section
- -------- ------- 
10.6(i) (other than with respect to Section 4.7) shall be effective only with
respect to any Seller Claim (or group of similar Seller Claims) for Damages
which exceeds $50,000 and only after the aggregate amount of all such Seller
Claims for which Buyer is liable under this Agreement exceeds an amount equal to
the Basket and only to the extent of such excess, and in no event shall the
aggregate amount of all Seller Claims for which Buyer is liable pursuant to such
Section 10.6(i) (other than with respect to Section 4.7) exceed an amount equal
to the product of (a) the Initial Purchase Price multiplied by (b) .25; provided
--------
further, however, that after the Closing Date, in no event shall the aggregate
- ------- ------- 
amount of all Seller Claims for which Buyer is liable pursuant to Section
10.6(i) (other than with respect to Section 4.7) exceed an amount equal to $50
million.

10.8 Environmental Indemnification.
----------------------------- 

(a) Buyer Indemnification of Seller. Except as provided in paragraph
------------------------------- 
10.4 and in subparagraphs 10.8 (b) and (c), Buyer shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller Indemnified Parties from and against Damages asserted
against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by Seller Indemnified Parties by
reason of or resulting from any Environmental Claim related to the Company.

(b) Seller Indemnification of Buyer. (i) Seller shall indemnify,
------------------------------- 
defend and hold harmless Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against Damages
asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by Buyer Indemnified
Parties by reason of:

(A) cleanup of Hazardous Substances disposed of or discharged prior
to the Closing Date at any site other than the Real Property or sites adjacent
to the Real Property to which such Hazardous Substances have migrated from the
Real Property if such Hazardous Substances were generated, used, stored,
treated, transported or released by or on behalf of Seller, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, including such sites identified
on Section 10.8 of the Disclosure Schedule.

(B) such other Environmental Claims listed on Schedule 10.8.

(ii) Seller will undertake the complete administration, management, and cleanup
of the sites and matters described in paragraphs 10.8(b)(i) (A) and (B) on
behalf of itself and Buyer Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that Seller
will administer, manage and remediate all conditions giving rise to such Claims
so as not to interfere unreasonably with the Company's ongoing operations after
the Closing Date. Buyer Indemnified Parties shall appoint Seller their
attorney-in-fact to take actions required to be taken in connection with the
administration, management and remediation of all conditions giving rise to such
Environmental Claims and shall take such further actions as are necessary to
give effect to the provisions of this Section 10.8.

(c) Environmental Claims Arising from Joint Operations in Mobile,
-------------------------------------------------------------
Alabama. Buyer shall indemnify,
- ------- 

96
<PAGE>

defend and hold harmless Seller Indemnified Parties and Seller shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against all Damages
asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by reason of or
resulting from any Environmental Claims arising out of the operation of the
facilities in Mobile, Alabama in accordance with the indemnification provisions
of the separate agreements governing Seller's provision of water and effluent
treatment services ("Water and Effluent Agreement"), the provision of energy to
Buyer ("Energy Services Agreement"), and, to the extent necessary, the
allocation of environmental liabilities at the Mobile facility between Buyer and
Seller ("Mobile Environmental Agreement"). In the event of a conflict between
the terms of this paragraph 10.8 of this Agreement and the terms of such
separate agreement, the more specific provision shall govern.

10.9 Conditions of Indemnification With Respect to Third-Party
---------------------------------------------------------
Claims. The obligations and liabilities of Seller and Buyer with respect to
Buyer Claims and Seller Claims, respectively, which arise or result from claims
for Damages made by third parties (other than claims relating to Taxes) ("Third-
Party Claims") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

(i) (A) The indemnified party will give the indemnifying party
prompt notice of any such Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to
-------- ------- 
give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced
as a result of such failure (except that the indemnifying party shall not be
liable for any expenses incurred by the indemnified party during the period in
which the indemnified party failed to give such notice); and (B) the
indemnifying party shall have the right, after it acknowledges in writing to the
indemnified party its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party hereunder,
to undertake the defense thereof by counsel chosen by it; provided that (1) such
-------- 
counsel is not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party and (2) if the
indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not
reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense, separate
from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being

97
<PAGE>

understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense;

(ii) Until the indemnifying party acknowledges in writing its
obligation hereunder with respect to, and assumes the defense of, a Third-Party
Claim, the indemnified party shall (upon further notice to the indemnifying
party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such
Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the indemnifying
party subject to the right of the indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such Third-Party Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final
determination thereof (subject to subclause (B) of clause (i) above); and

(iii) Any provision in this Article X to the contrary
notwithstanding, (A) if, in the good faith judgment of the indemnified party,
there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may materially and
adversely affect the indemnified party other than as a result of money damages
or other money payments, the indemnified party shall have the right, at the cost
and expense of the indemnifying party, to defend, compromise or settle such
Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that if such Third-Party Claim is settled
-------- ------- 
without the indemnifying party's consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), the indemnified party shall be deemed to have waived all
rights hereunder against the indemnifying party for money damages arising out of
such Third-Party Claim; and (B) if the indemnifying party acknowledges in
writing liability for a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party will agree to
any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third-Party Claim that the
indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third-Party Claim and releases the indemnified party completely in
connection with such Third-Party Claim and that would not, in the good faith
judgment of the indemnified party, otherwise adversely affect the indemnified
party; provided, however, that the indemnified party may refuse to agree to any
-------- ------- 
such settlement, compromise or discharge if the indemnified party agrees that
the indemnifying party's indemnification obligation with respect to such Third-
Party Claim shall not exceed the amount that would be required to be paid by or
on behalf of the indemnify-

98
<PAGE>

ing party in connection with such settlement, compromise or discharge.

10.10 Other Claims. In the event any indemnified party should have a
------------ 
claim against any indemnifying party under Section 10.4, 10.6 or 10.8 hereof
that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver
notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. The
failure by any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such
indemnified party under Section 10.4, 10.6 or 10.8 hereof, except to the extent
that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced
by such failure. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified
party within 10 calendar days following its receipt of such notice that the
indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under Section
10.4, 10.6 or 10.8 hereof, such claim specified by the indemnified party in such
notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under
Section 10.4, 10.6 or 10.8 hereof and the indemnifying party shall pay the
amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of
any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion
thereof) becomes finally determined. If the indemnifying party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of competent jurisdiction, subject to Article XI.

10.11 Sole Remedy. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that, if
----------- 
the Closing occurs, their sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing with
respect to any and all claims, including, without limitation, Buyer Claims and
Seller Claims (whether Third-Party Claims or otherwise), relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in this
Article X.

99
<PAGE>

XI. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
------------------ 

11.1 General. In the event of any claim (including any counterclaim
------- 
or cross-claim) by Seller or Buyer arising after the Closing (whether relating
to facts, events or circumstances occurring or existing prior to or at the
Closing or otherwise) and relating to or arising out of any provision of this
Agreement, the party making such claim shall give written notice to the other of
the fact that a claim has arisen pursuant hereto and that such party is
submitting such claim for determination pursuant to the dispute resolution
procedures set forth in this Article XI; provided, however, that if the party
-------- ------- 
making such claim seeks an order, injunction or other relief other than money
damages, such party may, at its sole option, bring such claim (and any or all
other claims, whether or not related, being made by such party at the same time,
regardless of the remedies sought) in a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with Section 12.9. Any such notice submitting a claim to the dispute
resolution procedures set forth in this Article XI shall include (a) a
reasonably detailed statement of the facts, events, circumstances, evidence and
arguments underlying such claim and (b) proposed arrangements for a meeting to
attempt to settle the claim to be held within sixty days of receipt of such
notice. Within thirty days after such notice is received, the other party
hereto shall submit to the party giving such notice a written summary responding
to such statement of facts, events, circumstances, evidence and arguments
contained in the notice and an acceptance of or proposed alternative to the
meeting arrangements set forth in the initial notice.

11.2 Meeting of Executive Officers. The chief executive officers (or
----------------------------- 
any other executive officer or officers directly reporting to, and duly
designated by, such chief executive officers) of each of the parties shall meet
at a time and place mutually acceptable to such parties to attempt to settle in
good faith any claim submitted for determination pursuant to this Article XI;
provided, however, that such meeting shall be held at the principal offices of
- -------- ------- 
the party receiving the notice of dispute unless otherwise agreed; and provided
--------
further, that any such meeting shall be held within sixty days after the initial
- ------- 
written notice of claim is given pursuant to Section 11.1 hereof. Each party
shall bear its

100
<PAGE>

own costs and expenses with respect to preparation for, attendance at and
participation in such meeting. If any claim submitted for determination
pursuant to this Article XI cannot be resolved in such meeting, such claim,
subject to the provisions of Section 10.11 hereof, may be resolved by litigation
in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

XII. MISCELLANEOUS.

12.1 Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing Date,

than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall be valid and be

12.5 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement and all of the
-------------------------- 
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective heirs, executors, successors and permitted assigns,
but except as contemplated herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, directly or indirectly, by
Seller or Buyer without the prior written consent of the other party hereto;

provided, however, that (i) the rights and obligations of Buyer may be assigned

by operation of law to the Company pursuant to a merger of Buyer with and into
the Company, (ii) Buyer may freely assign all or any part of its rights under
this Agreement to Sappi or any majority-owned subsidiary of Sappi and (iii)

Seller may be assigned to any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which at the
time of such assignment owns the Shares provided that no such assignment shall

---------------------------- 
and shall not be deemed to confer upon or give any person except the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right under or by reason of
this Agreement (except as set forth in Article X with respect to Buyer

103
<PAGE>

Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties and except that any rights or
remedies of Buyer under this Agreement may be exercised by Holdings or,
following the proposed merger of Buyer with and into the Company, the Company).

12.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
------------ 
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

12.8 Interpretation. The article and section headings contained in
-------------- 
this Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the
agreement of the parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term
"including" shall mean including without limitation, the "knowledge" of Seller
shall be deemed to include the knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and, unless the context otherwise requires, the word "or" is not exclusive. As
used in this Agreement, the term "person" shall mean and include an individual,
a partnership, a joint venture, a corporation, a trust, an unincorporated
organization and a government or any department or agency thereof. As used in
this Agreement, the term "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule
12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act. All
references in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States
dollars.

12.9 Forum; Service of Process. Any legal suit, action or proceeding
------------------------- 
brought by Seller or Buyer, or any of their respective affiliates, arising out
of or based upon this Agreement shall be instituted in (a) the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, or if such suit, action or
proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, (b) the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County (collectively, the
"Courts"), and each of Seller and Buyer (on its behalf and on behalf of such
affiliates) waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. Each of
Sappi and Buyer has appointed CT Corporation System as its authorized agent (the
"Authorized Agent") upon which process may be served in any action based on this
Agree-

104
<PAGE>

ment which may be instituted in the Courts, by Seller and each of Buyer and
Seller expressly accepts the jurisdiction of any such Court in respect of such
action. Such appointment shall be irrevocable. Sappi and Buyer represent and
warrant that the Authorized Agent has agreed to act as said agent for service
of process, and each of Sappi and Buyer agree to take any and all action,
including, without limitation, the filing of any and all documents and
instruments, which may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force
and effect. Service of process upon the Authorized Agent and written notice of
such service to Buyer shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of
process upon Buyer. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, any
action based on this Agreement may be instituted by Seller in any competent
court in the country of the Republic of South Africa. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives all right to a trial by jury in any suit,
action or proceeding (including any counterclaim) arising out of or based upon
this Agreement.

12.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
------------- 
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard
to the principles of conflicts of law thereof (to the extent that the
application of the laws of another jurisdiction would be required thereby).

12.11 Attorney Fees. A party in breach of this Agreement shall, on
------------- 
demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party for and against all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees, incurred by such other
party by reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under this
Agreement. The payment of such expenses is in addition to any other relief to
which such other party may be entitled.

12.12 Specific Performance. Each party hereto acknowledges that
-------------------- 
money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any
breach of this Agreement by such party and that any such breach would cause the
other party hereto irreparable harm. Accordingly, each party hereto also agrees
that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this
Agreement by such party, the other party hereto shall be entitled to equitable
relief without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, including

105
<PAGE>

in the form of injunctions and orders for specific performance, in addition to
all other remedies available to such other parties at law or in equity.

12.13 Sappi Obligation. Subject to and effective only upon its
---------------- 
receipt of the approval of the South African Reserve Bank, Sappi agrees to cause
Buyer to comply with Buyer's obligations hereunder until the Closing Date. As

December 19, 1994

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT
TO STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED AS OF
OCTOBER 8, 1994, BY AND AMONG SCOTT PAPER COMPANY,
SAPPI LIMITED AND SDW ACQUISITION CORPORATION

Dear Sirs:

Reference is made herein to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of
October 8, 1994 (the "Purchase Agreement"), by and among Scott Paper Company
("Seller"), Sappi Limited and SDW Acquisition Corporation ("Buyer"). Capitalized
terms used herein but not defined herein are used as defined in the Purchase
Agreement. The parties hereto desire to amend, modify and supplement the
Purchase Agreement and to confirm certain understandings with respect thereto.

The parties hereby agree as follows:

1. Seller and Buyer hereby (i) reaffirm their respective obligations under
Section 5.14 of the Purchase Agreement to negotiate in good faith regarding the 
conveyance of additional Real Property to the Company at the Mobile mill site, 
and (ii) agree that each of them shall continue to negotiate in good faith after
the Closing Date with the other party with respect to such conveyance of 
additional Real Property until the earlier of one year after the Closing Date 
and the determination by both Seller and Buyer that such matter has been 
resolved.

2. The parties hereto agree that (i) Seller will be transferring to the 
Company, at or prior to the Closing, all Seller's right, title and interest in 
and to the loans and equity advances identified on Exhibit A hereto and that, to
the extent so transferred, the amounts of such loans and advances shall be 
reflected as Assets for the purpose of determining Closing Net Assets and (ii) 
the Company will be assuming, at or prior to the Closing, Seller's obligations 
to make the mortgage subsidy and cost of living adjustment payments identified 
on Exhibit A hereto and that the amount of such mortgage subsidy payments and 
cost of living adjustment payments shall not be reflected as Liabilities for the
purpose of determining Closing Net Assets.

3. With respect to Section 6.2(iii) of the Purchase Agreement, the
parties hereto agree and understand that, notwithstanding the definition of
"Continuing Employee" contained within such Section, for all purposes of the
Purchase Agreement, (i) the term "Continuing Employee" shall include each person
whose name is set forth in Section 1 of Exhibit B and shall not include each
person whose name is set forth in Section 2 of Exhibit B and (ii) the employment
status of Harold E. Wilson will be treated as set forth in Exhibit C hereto.

4. Reference is made to Section 1.7 of the Purchase Agreement which
provides that the transactions contemplated by the Asset Agreement shall be
deemed to occur immediately after the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding said Section 1.7, the
parties hereto agree and understand that the effect of the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Agreement shall be reflected on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and in Closing Net Assets as though such transactions occurred at
the time of the Closing.

5. From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against all Damages (including,
without limitation, any fine or forfeiture imposed by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission ("FERC") or the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"),
any additional costs associated with obtaining electric power to replace power
currently generated by the Saccarappa Hydroelectric Project, FERC Project No.
2897, as well as any costs associated with the decommissioning and/or removal of
such hydroelectric project) suffered or incurred by Buyer Indemnified Parties as
a result of:

(a) the failure of FERC to grant the Company's November 22, 1994
request for extension of time for the Company to file the Lake Level
Management Plan for Sebago Lake required by the FERC's August 4, 1994
"Order on Complaints" in Project No. 2984, S.D. Warren Co., 68 FERC 
paragraph 61,213 (1994); or

(b) FERC's (i) refusal to accept for filing, (ii) rejection or (iii)
denial of the Company's Application for New License for the Saccarappa
Hydroelectric Project, FERC Project No. 2897 (if such application is filed)
based solely upon or solely as a result of Seller's filing its Notice of
Intent to File a New application after the deadline set forth in

<PAGE>
3

Section 15(b)(1) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. (S) 808(b)(1), and 
Section 16.6(c) of the FERC's regulations, 18 C.F.R. (S) 16.6(c) (1994);

(c) the failure of the FCC to grant all authorizations necessary for 
the Company to operate after the Closing Date the facilities in the Private
Land Mobile Radio Services associated with the following stations and/or
the frequencies associated with such stations: KA84728, KD27000, KEH669,
KVI937, WNQU340, WNWT925, WNXJ239, WNXY358, WPDC301, KB21324, KCB403,

and WNSK419.

Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to (i) support the Seller's intervention and 
active participation in any proceedings before the FERC for the purpose of 
addressing the matters set forth in clauses 5(a) and (b) above and (ii) mitigate
any Damages for which Seller may be liable hereunder.

6. The proviso to the first paragraph of Section 1.3 of the Purchase 
Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:

"provided, however, that the parties hereto intend that such Closing 
-------- -------
shall be deemed to be effective, and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall be deemed to occur at 7:01
a.m. on the date on which the Closing actually occurs (the 'Closing
Date')."

7. Section 1.2 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended to read in 
its entirety as follows:

"1.2. Consideration. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of 
-------------
this Agreement, in consideration of the aforesaid sale, conveyance,
assignment, transfer and delivery of the Shares (which represent ownership
of the Continuing Business), and grant of the Covenant, at the Closing,
Buyer shall pay to Seller, in cash, an amount (the "Initial Purchase
Price") equal to (i) One Billion Six Hundred Million Dollars
($1,600,000,000) less (ii) the sum of (x) the amount of any indebtedness of
the Company for borrowed money outstanding (including all capitalized lease
obligations) on the Closing Date (which amount will not be less than $118
million)

<PAGE>

and (y) the purchase price to be paid under the Asset Agreement."

8. Buyer hereby acknowledges receipt of the supplemental and amended 
Disclosure Schedule (the "Supplemental Disclosure Schedule") of Seller 
delivered pursuant to Section 5.7(a) of the Purchase Agreement and attached 
hereto as Exhibit D-1. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.7(a) of the 
Purchase Agreement, Buyer agrees that all matters disclosed in the Supplemental 
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed as of the date of the
Purchase Agreement as contemplated by the first proviso to Section 5.7(a) of the
Purchase Agreement, except as set forth in Exhibit D-2 hereto.

9. Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer that (i) the Company's 
Mobile senior level management were consulted with respect to, and given the 
opportunity to provide input on, the specifications, allocations, usages and 
volumes incorporated in Exhibits 2.2(a)-(e) to the Purchase Agreement and (ii) 
Seller believes such specifications, allocations, usages and volumes, as well as
the specifications, allocations, usages and volumes incorporated in the 
Ancillary Agreements (and all exhibits, schedules and attachments thereto) 
described in Sections 2.2(a)-(e) to the Stock Purchase Agreement, to be 
reasonable. Seller agrees that the foregoing representation and warranty shall 
constitute a representation and warranty of Seller made pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement for purposes of Section 10.4 thereof.

10. Reference is made to the General Assignment and Assumption Agreement 
(the "Assignment") dated as of December 20, 1994, to be entered into by Seller, 
Scott Continental N.V. and the Company. Seller represents and warrants to the 
Buyer that the Patents and Trademarks (as such terms are defined in the 
Assignment) owned by Seller and Scott Continental N.V. and set forth on the 
Disclosure Schedule and the Supplemental Disclosure Schedule as attached to the 
Assignment constitute all the Patents and Trademarks used in or necessary to the
Continuing Business and not used in the business of Seller and its Subsidiaries 
(other than the Continuing Business). Seller agrees that such representation and
warranty shall constitute a representation and warranty of Seller made pursuant 
to the Purchase Agreement for purposes of Section 10.4 thereof, except that the 
indemnity obligations of Seller in respect of any breach of such representation 
and warranty shall not
<PAGE>
5

be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.5 of the Purchase 
Agreement.

Except as expressly set forth herein, the Purchase Agreement shall remain 
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles
thereof (to the extent that the application of the laws of another jurisdiction
would be required thereby). This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties thereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns (including the Company following the merger of Buyer with and
into the Company).

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which 
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and 
the same instrument.

If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign the form of 
acceptance on the enclosed counterpart of this letter and return the same to the
undersigned, whereupon this letter shall become a binding agreement between you 
and the undersigned.

Very truly yours,

SDW ACQUISITION CORPORATION,
