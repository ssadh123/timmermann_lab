FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ZENITH REPORTS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS 

GLENVIEW, Ill., July 21, 1994 -- Zenith Electronics Corporation 
today announced that it reduced its second-quarter net loss by 
66 percent -- to $8.4 million, or 20 cents per share, in 1994 
from a loss of $24.7 million, or 79 cents per share, in 1993. 
Contributing to the $16 million improvement in quarterly 
results were higher sales in Zenith's core business, lower 
costs resulting largely from new re-engineering programs and a 
substantial reduction in losses from non-core business areas that 
have been sold or downsized. 
Total revenues in the quarter were up 9 percent to 
$299 million in 1994 from $275 million in 1993. Sales for the 
core Consumer Electronics and Network Systems business increased 
by $42 million, even after absorbing $12 million of lower consumer 
electronics selling prices from a year ago. Non-core business 
revenues declined by $18 million. 
Driving the increase in Consumer Electronics sales were 
higher Zenith color TV unit sales to dealers compared with 
the year-earlier period, reflecting the strong acceptance of Zenith's 
new color TV line and increased industry sales. Revenues for 
Network Systems, particularly set-top boxes, also increased from 
second-quarter 1993 levels.

In non-core business areas, Zenith completed the sale 
of its switch mode power supply magnetics business in the quarter. 
Non-core business areas represented less than 2 percent of 
second-quarter 1994 revenues, versus about 8 percent a year earlier.
The company completed the sale of its 1.7-million- 
square-foot Springfield,Mo., plant in the second quarter bringing 
the amount of plant and office spacethat Zenith has sold so 
far in 1994 to 2.6 million square feet. Another 500,000-square- 
foot building is under contract for sale. The completed transactions 
did not have a material effect on earnings.
Short-term debt of $49 million at the end of the second 
quarter of 1994 (compared with $46 million in the 1993 quarter) 
financed increased receivables and planned higher inventory 
levels to support seasonal demand in the second half. 
For the first six months of 1994, Zenith reported a net 
loss of $20.3 million, or 51 cents per share, compared with a net 
loss of $46.5 million, or $1.51 per share, in the first half of 
1993. First-half sales were $596 million in 1994 and $565 million 
in 1993.
