ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

Beginning on July 14, 1994, Ames will distribute, to its banks and 
other lenders, principal trade vendors and factors, summaries of its 
unaudited financial results for the five and twenty-two weeks ended 
July 2, 1994. These monthly and year-to-date results (collectively, 
the "monthly results") are attached hereto as Exhibit 20 and are 
incorporated by reference herein. 

Compared with the projections contained in the Form 8-K dated May 27, 
1994 (referred to herein as the "Plan"), sales for the five weeks 
ended July 2, 1994 were $5.8 million above Plan and EBITDA (as 
defined in Exhibit 20) was $.8 million above Plan. In June, the 
major portion of the favorable sales variance was in seasonal 
merchandise and apparel. The favorable impact from the higher-than- 
planned sales on June's gross margin was partially offset by a 
lower-than-planned gross margin rate that was due, in part, to the 
sales of certain lower-margin seasonal merchandise. Also, in June, 
the Company received its share of the Wertheim settlement and 
recorded a non-recurring gain of $12.0 million.

Sales for the twenty-two weeks ended July 2, 1994 were $7.5 million 
below Plan; however, EBITDA was $.9 million better than Plan. The 
unfavorable impact on the year-to-date EBITDA from the lower-than- 
planned sales and gross margin rate was more than offset by lower- 
than-planned expenses. The lower year-to-date gross margin rate was 
due to higher-than-planned advertising markdowns. Store, field and 
home office expenses were all below the year-to-date Plan.

As of July 2, 1994, LIFO inventories were $1.5 million above Plan. 
Trade payables were $9.6 million above Plan due primarily to improved 
payment terms. Outstanding borrowings under the Company's new 
revolving line of credit as of July 2, 1994 were $10.8 million below 
Plan due primarily to the better-than-planned trade payable terms. 

Ames is distributing the monthly results to its banks and other 
lenders, principal trade vendors and factors to facilitate their 
credit analyses. The summary results SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR 
ANY OTHER PURPOSE and should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994, the 
Company's Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter ended April 30, 
1994, and the Company's Form 8-K dated May 27, 1994. The monthly 
results are being reported publicly solely because they are being 
distributed to a large number of the Company's vendors for purposes 
of their credit analyses.

During the pendency of its reorganization case, Ames disclosed 
publicly its monthly results through filings with the Office of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee and continued to report publicly its monthly 
results during the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994. Although Ames 
expects to continue to make its monthly results public for the fiscal 
year ending January 28, 1995, Ames does not believe it is obligated 
to provide such information indefinitely, other than as required by 
applicable regulations, and Ames may cease making such disclosures 
and updates at any time. The monthly results were not examined, 
reviewed or compiled by Ames' independent certified accountants. 
Moreover, Ames does not believe that it is obligated to update the 
monthly results to reflect subsequent events or developments. The 
reported monthly results are subject to future adjustments, if any, 
that could materially affect such results. However, in the opinion 
of the Company, the monthly results contain all adjustments 
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair 
statement of the results for the periods presented.
