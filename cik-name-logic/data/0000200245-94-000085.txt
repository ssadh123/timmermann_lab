SALOMON INC REPORTS QUARTERLY NET INCOME OF $476 MILLION;
FULL YEAR NET INCOME WAS $827 MILLION

New York, January 27, 1994 - Salomon Inc today announced fourth quarter
net income of $476 million. Net income was $827 million for the full year, up
50% from $550 million earned in 1992. Results for 1993 include a $37
million aftertax charge recorded in the first quarter to reflect a cumulative
change in accounting for postretirement benefits. Return on common equity for
the year, on a fully diluted basis, was 19% (before the cumulative accounting
charge) compared with 13% in 1992. Earnings per share for the year, on a
fully diluted basis, were $6.57 (before the cumulative accounting charge), up
62% from $4.05 in 1992.

Salomon Brothers, the Company's global investment banking business, posted
quarterly pretax earnings of $862 million, compared with $503 million in last
year's fourth quarter. For the full year, Salomon Brothers' pretax earnings
were $1.6 billion, compared with $1.4 billion in 1992.

Fourth quarter results for Salomon Brothers' Client-Driven Businesses were 
indicative of the favorable conditions for the industry as well as the 
continued strengthening of these businesses. Pretax earnings for these
businesses were $354 million, compared with $115 million in the comparable
1992 quarter. Pretax earnings for the year were $1.2 billion, more than four
times the $276 million earned in 1992. Customer trading activities in the
fourth quarter were strong and record investment banking revenues were 
generated for the third consecutive quarter.

Salomon Brothers' Proprietary Trading Businesses had an exceptional quarter,
producing pretax earnings of $508 million following a $173 million loss in the
third quarter. However, management believes that Proprietary Trading results
are best evaluated over periods of one or more years. For the full year,
pretax earnings for these businesses were $416 million; Salomon Brothers 
earned $1.4 billion from these activities in 1992.

The Phibro Division, the Company's energy and other commodities trading 
business, recorded a pretax loss of $21 million in the fourth quarter. As a
result of this loss, the division reported a pretax loss of $15 million for
the year. In 1992, the division reported a pretax loss of $181 million for
the fourth quarter and $194 million for the year. Last year's results
included fourth quarter losses of $147 million in connection with the 
downsizing of the division, including losses attributable to businesses that 
were exited.

Results for Phibro USA, the Company's oil refining business, included a 
fourth quarter pretax charge of $30 million to write down the carrying amount
of the business's core refining and marketing inventories to the lower market
prices that prevailed at year-end. These inventories are neither hedged nor
marked-to-market as trading inventories, but instead are carried at the 
lower of their aggregate cost or market value. Once written down, these 
inventories are not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in market value. 
Excluding this charge, Phibro USA operated at near break-even for the quarter,
reflecting weakness in refining margins. Phibro USA incurred a pretax loss 
of $31 million in the 1992 fourth quarter. For the year, Phibro USA reported
a pretax loss of $16 million before the inventory writedown, compared with a 
loss of $47 million in 1992.

During 1993, the Company repurchased approximately 362,000 of its common 
shares for treasury, at an aggregate cost of $15.5 million. Substantially
all of these repurchases took place in the fourth quarter. Shares authorized
for additional repurchase by the Company's Board of Directors totaled 9.6
million at year-end. Fourth quarter results increased book value per common
share to $38.57 at December 31, 1993, compared with $32.33 at the end of
1992. 

Salomon Inc Chairman Robert E. Denham stated, "I am pleased but not satisfied 
by the results for the quarter and year. While quarterly results fluctuate, 
the Company can acheive satisfactory returns on equity over meaningful 
periods. The extraordinary improvement in the results of Salomon Brothers' 
Client-Driven Businesses is due, in part, to favorable securities market 
conditions, but is also due, I believe, to important changes made by the 
management of Salomon Brothers in some of these businesses. Salomon 
Brothers' Proprietary Trading Businesses continue to demonstrate long-term 
profitability, notwithstanding significant quarterly fluctuations."
