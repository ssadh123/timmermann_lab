ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

As previously reported, approximately 2,100 claims for

alleged personal injury relating to the 1979 TMI-2 accident are

pending against the Company and its subsidiaries before Judge

Rambo in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of

Pennsylvania. On February 18, 1994, Judge Rambo denied the

defendant's motion for summary judgment and ruled that the

plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages are not barred by the

Price-Anderson Act, as amended in 1988, to the extent that the

funds to pay punitive damages do not come from the United States

Treasury.

In a second ruling on that date, Judge Rambo denied the

defendants' motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of all

cases on the grounds that the defendants complied with applicable

safety standards regarding permissible releases from TMI-2.

Although the court ruled that the defendants' duty of care was

governed by applicable federal standards, and not standards of

state tort law, the Judge held that there was a dispute as to a

material fact--namely, whether the radiation and emissions

released exceeded the federal standard--that could not be

resolved on a motion for summary judgment.
