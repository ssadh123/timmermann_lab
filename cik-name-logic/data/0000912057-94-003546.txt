Item 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

(a) On October 11, 1994, TJ International, Inc. (the"Company") formed a
Delaware general partnership (the "Partnership"),combining the
Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Norco Windows, Inc.,a Wisconsin
corporation ("Norco"), with SealRite Windows, Inc., a Nebraska
corporation ("SealRite") and Oldach Window Corp., a Delaware
corporation ("Oldach"). The Partnership, which was initially formed
as the N-S&O Partnership, will operate under the name "Outlook Window
Partnership."

Under the terms of a Partnership Formation and Contribution Agreement
(the "Contribution Agreement"), the Company contributed to the
Partnership all of the assets and liabilities of Norco and all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Dashwood Industries Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of
the Province of Ontario, Canada ("Dashwood"), and R. LaFlamme & Frere,
Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the Province of
Quebec, ("LaFlamme"), in exchange for a 73.5% interest in the
Partnership.

The Contribution Agreement also provided that each of SealRite and
Oldach contributed all of their respective assets and liabilities
in exchange for an aggregate 26.5% interest in the Partnership.
The Partnership Agreement of the Partnership (the "Partnership
Agreement") provides that the Company shall make an additional cash
contribution to the Partnership equal to the amount of any operating
losses for Norco, Dashwood and LaFlamme, from the period October 3,
1994 to December 31, 1995.

The day-to-day business of the Partnership is under the control and
direction of a chief executive officer. However, the Partnership may
not take certain significant actions concerning the business of the
Partnership, such as incurring indebtedness, selling assets or
changing the nature of the Partnership's business without majority
approval of the management board of the Partnership, consisting of
three members appointed by the Company, two members appointed by
SealRite and Oldach, and the chief executive officer.

The Partnership Agreement provides that if either Norco or SealRite
and Oldach experiences a change of control, the other party or parties
will have the right to buy the Partnership interest of the party
experiencing the change of control (the "Change Party") at a value
that does not include any takeover premium attributable to the change
of control. The interest of either party in the Partnership will be
valued by a qualified investment banker mutually approved by the
parties. The foregoing provisions may have the effect of discouraging
certain transactions which involve an actual or threatened change of
control of the Company.

<PAGE>

Under the terms of a Liquidity Transaction Agreement, the Company has
agreed to use its best efforts to cause a planned corporate successor
to the Partnership to undertake a firm commitment underwritten public
offering of common stock, pursuant to which the shareholders of
SealRite and Oldach would be given piggy-back registration rights. The
timing of such initial public offering is anticipated during calendar
year 1995; however, the Company may delay such offering up to an
additional 12 months. Once the corporate successor to the Partnership
has completed a public offering, the SealRite and Oldach shareholders
are granted two demand registration rights. If at least 80% of the
SealRite and Oldach shareholdings have not been publicly registered by
October 3, 1997, SealRite and Oldach may unilaterally market the
Partnership (or its corporate successor), subject to the Company's
right of first refusal.

(b) The assets contributed by Norco, SealRite and Oldach to the
Partnership will continue to be used in the manufacturing,
distribution and sale of windows and doors and related products.

combined net worth of the TJI Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis as of the
Effective Date (the "TJI EFFECTIVE DATE NET WORTH") in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the TJI Balance Sheets (to the extent
the TJI Balance Sheets were prepared on a stand-alone basis in accordance
with GAAP). The cost of preparing the TJI Effective Date Balance Sheet and
the report thereon, which shall be part of an overall audit of the

(b) S&O, with the advice and counsel of the S&O Accountants, shall

PARTNERSHIP FORMATION AND CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT - 8
<PAGE>

matters set forth therein, which objections shall be set forth in
reasonable detail. SealRite and Oldach expressly covenant and agree to
cause the S&O Accountants to review the TJI Effective Date Balance Sheet
using an accounting methodology which is consistent with the accounting
methodology used in preparation of the TJI Balance Sheets (to the extent
the methodology conforms to GAAP), and that there shall be no changes in
methodology or major judgments by the S&O Accountants in such review (to
the extent such methodology and major judgments conform to GAAP) without a
corresponding change in a factual event. If no objections are raised
within such 30-day period, the TJI Effective Date Balance Sheet shall be
deemed accepted and approved by S&O.

(c) If S&O shall raise any objections within the 30-day period, TJI
and S&O shall attempt to resolve the matter or matters in dispute.

(d) If such dispute cannot be resolved by TJI and S&O within thirty
(30) days after the delivery of the TJI Effective Date Balance Sheet, then
the specific matters in dispute shall be submitted to a nationally-
recognized "Big Six" accounting firm mutually agreed to by TJI and S&O,
which firm shall make a final and binding determination as to such matter
or matters. Such accounting firm shall send its written determination to
the Parties and the Partnership as soon as possible (but in no event more
than forty-five (45) days after submission of such matters to such
accounting firm). The fees and expenses of the accounting firm referred to
in this Section 2.4(d) shall be paid by the Partnership.

(e) Upon the acceptance and approval of the TJI Effective Date
Balance Sheet in accordance with Sections 2.4(b)-2.4(d) of this Agreement,
if the TJI Effective Date Net Worth shall EXCEED $50,000,000, the Parties
shall cause the Partnership to make a cash payment to TJI in an amount
equal to the amount by which the TJI Effective Net Worth exceeds
$50,000,000. If the TJI Effective Date Net Worth shall be LESS than
$50,000,000, TJI shall make or shall cause Norco to make, an additional
cash contribution to the Partnership equal to the amount by which the TJI
Effective Date Net Worth is less than $50,000,000.

under this Section 2.4(e).

requirements of any bulk transfer acts or similar laws of any application

(specifying with reasonable particularity the basis therefor) and will give
the Indemnitors such information with respect thereto as the Indemnitors

PARTNERSHIP FORMATION AND CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT - 12
<PAGE>

may reasonably request. The Indemnitors may, at their own expense,
participate in and, upon notice to such Indemnitee, assume the defense
of any such Action, PROVIDED, that the Indemnitors' counsel is
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee. If the Indemnitors assume
such defense, the Indemnitors shall thereafter consult with such
Indemnitee upon such Indemnitee's reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such Action, and the
Indemnitors shall not, without such Indemnitee's consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, settle or compromise any
such Action. Such Indemnitees shall have the right (but not the duty)

expenses of more than one counsel employed by any Indemnitee in any

defense thereof, the Indemnitees shall thereafter consult with the
Indemnitors upon the Indemnitors' reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such Action and the
Indemnitees shall not, without the Indemnitors' consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise any such
Action. Whether or not the Indemnitors choose to defend or prosecute
any claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof.

(b) The Indemnitors shall not be liable under Section 3.3 hereof with
respect to any Loss resulting from a claim or demand the defense of which
the Indemnitors were not offered the opportunity to assume as provided
under Section 3.4(a) hereof, with respect to which the Indemnitors did not
receive appropriate notice on or before any applicable notice period, to
the extent the Indemnitors' liability under Section 3.3 hereof is
prejudiced as a result thereof. No investigation by any Indemnitee prior
to the Closing Date shall relieve any Indemnitor of any liability
hereunder.

(with respect to the Business only) nor any TJI Subsidiary (except Dashwood
and LaFlamme) is a party to or participates in or has any liability with
respect to:

(i) Any "employee welfare benefit plan" or "employee
pension benefit plan" (as those terms are respectively defined in
Sections 3(1) and 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA)), including a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA);

(ii) Any retirement or deferred compensation plan, incentive
compensation plan, stock plan, unemployment compensation plan,
vacation pay, severance pay, bonus or benefit arrangement, insurance
or hospitalization program, or any other material fringe benefit
arrangements (herein referred to collectively as "EMPLOYEE FRINGE
BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS") for any employee, which does not constitute an
"employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA); or

(iii) Any employment agreement.

Neither Dashwood nor LaFlamme is a party to or participates in any plan,
program, policy or arrangement which provides any employee benefits to any
United States employee performing services within the United States.

PARTNERSHIP FORMATION AND CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT - 26
<PAGE>

Federal statues, state law (including, without limitation, state insurance
law) and the regulations and rules promulgated pursuant thereto or in
connection therewith and the terms of each such respective plan,
arrangement and agreement. Neither TJI nor any TJI Subsidiary has any
notice or knowledge of any material violation of any of the foregoing by
any such plan, arrangement or agreement.

(c) All employee pension benefit plans listed in SCHEDULE 6.14 which
are subject to ERISA materially comply in form and in operation with the
applicable requirements of Section 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code. To the

pension benefit plan listed in SCHEDULE 6.14 that is subject to ERISA or to
a tax under Section 511 of the Code; and no such plan which is subject to
Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title 1 of ERISA has incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency." Neither TJI nor the TJI Subsidiaries (excluding
Dashwood and LaFlamme) has otherwise engaged in any transaction with
respect to any employee benefit plan listed in SCHEDULE 6.14 which could
result in a tax under Section 4975 of the Code. There are no Actions
(other than routine claims for benefits) pending or, to the knowledge of
TJI, threatened against such plans or the assets of such plans, and, to the
knowledge of TJI or the TJI Subsidiaries, no facts exist which are
reasonably likely to give rise to any such Actions (other than routine
claims for benefits). As to any employee pension benefit plan which is
listed in SCHEDULE 6.14 and which is subject to Title IV of ERISA, there
have been no "reportable events" (as described in Section 4043 of ERISA),
and no steps have been taken to terminate any such plan. All group health
plans (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code in which any
employees of the TJI Subsidiaries (excluding Dashwood and LaFlamme)
participate (including any plans of current and former affiliates of TJI or
the TJI Subsidiaries which must be taken into account under Section 162(i)
or Section 162(k) of the Code) have been operated in material compliance
with the group health plan continuation coverage requirements of
Section 162(k) of the Code as

participates in or has any liability with respect to any "employee pension
benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, which is a
"multiemployer plan", as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

(f) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 6.14, or except as required by
section 4980B of the Code, neither TJI nor any ERISA Affiliate has promised
any former employee or other individual whether or not employed by TJI or
any ERISA Affiliate, medical or other benefit coverage, and neither TJI nor
any ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to any plan or arrangement
providing medical benefits, life insurance, or other welfare benefits to
former employees, their spouses or dependents or any other individual
whether or not employed by TJI or any ERISA Affiliate.

(g) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 6.14, neither TJI nor any ERISA
Affiliate is a party to or participates in or has any liability with
respect to any employee pension benefit plan which is subject to Title IV
of ERISA.

(h) Neither TJI nor any ERISA Affiliate has failed to make any
contributions to or to pay any amounts due and owing as required by the
terms of any of the plans, arrangements, and agreements listed in SCHEDULE

applicable law.

SECTION 6.15 PENSION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS OF DASHWOOD AND LAFLAMME.

(a) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 6.15 attached hereto, neither
Dashwood nor LaFlamme is party to or has any liability with respect to any
employee benefit, welfare, bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred
compensation, stock option, retirement, hospitalization insurance, medical
and dental insurance, disability insurance, vacation pay, severance pay or
any other material employee benefit arrangements or practice related to the
employees or former employees which are currently maintained or were
maintained, at any time in the last five calendar years (herein referred to
collectively as "CANADIAN PLANS").

(b) TJI has furnished to S&O a true and correct copy of all Canadian
Plans as listed in SCHEDULE 6.15 as amended to the date hereof together
with all related documentation including, without limitation, funding
agreements, actuarial reports, funding and financial information and plan
summaries, booklets and personnel manuals, and there have been no material
changes in the financial condition of any such plan from that stated in the
documentation supplied. All employee data provided is substantially true
and correct. No amendments have been made to the Canadian Plans and no
improvements to the Canadian Plans have been promised and the amendments or
improvements to the Canadian Plans will be made or promised prior to the
date hereof. No insurance policy requires or any other contract or
agreement affecting the Canadian Plans requires or permits a retroactive
increase in premiums or payments due thereunder.

(c) All of the Canadian Plans have been established, registered,
qualified, invested and administered, in all respects, in accordance with
all applicable laws, regulations, orders or other legislative,
administrative or judicial promulgations (herein referred to as "APPLICABLE
LAWS"). None of the Canadian Plans enjoy any special tax status under the
Income Tax Act (Canada) or under other applicable legislation, nor have any
advance tax rulings been sought or received in respect of the Canadian
Plans. All obligations regarding the Canadian Plans have been satisfied
and there are no outstanding defaults or violations by any party thereto,

PARTNERSHIP FORMATION AND CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT - 29
<PAGE>

or any taxes owing under any Canadian Plans. All contributions or premiums
required to be made by Dashwood and/or LaFlamme under the terms of the
Canadian Plans or by Applicable Laws have been made in a timely fashion in
accordance with Applicable Laws and the terms of the Canadian Plans and
neither of Dashwood or LaFlamme have any liability (other than liabilities
accruing after the date hereof with respect to any of the Canadian Plans).
Contributions and premiums are to be paid on an accrual basis for the
period up to the Effective Date even though not otherwise required to be
made until a later date in respect of the period that includes the
Effective Date. All of the Canadian Plans which are subject to
actuarially-based funding requirements are fully funded or fully insured on
both an ongoing and solvency basis pursuant to the actuarial assumptions
and methodology contained in the going concern actuarial valuation report
most recently filed with the provincial pension authorities as of the date
hereof. The level of insurance reserves under each of the Canadian Plans
which is an insured plan is reasonable and sufficient to provide for all
incurred but unreported claims. There have been no improper withdrawals or
transfer of assets from the Canadian Plans or the funds relating thereto,
and neither Dashwood nor LaFlamme has been in breach of any fiduciary
obligation with respect to the administration of the Canadian Plans or the
funding media relating thereto.

(d) None of the Canadian Plans, nor any related funding medium
thereunder, is subject to any pending investigation, examination or other
proceeding, action or claim initiated by any governmental agency or
instrumentality, or by any other party, and there exists no state of facts
which after notice or lapse of time or both could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any such investigation, examination or other proceeding,
action or claim or to affect the registration of any of the Canadian Plans.
Further, should any matter arise which could affect the registration of any
of the Canadian Plans, Dashwood and/or LaFlamme, as the case may be, will,
in a timely fashion, take all steps required to ensure the registration is
not affected.

PARTNERSHIP FORMATION AND CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT - 30
<PAGE>

(e) Dashwood and LaFlamme have reserved the right to amend, modify or
terminate each of the Canadian Plans, subject to approval required by
Applicable Laws.

(f) Except for registered pension plans or group registered
retirement savings plans, none of the Canadian Plans provides benefits to
retired employees.

(g) No employee or former employee of Dashwood or LaFlamme will
become entitled to any bonus, retirement, severance, job security or
similar benefit enhancements of such benefits solely as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

hereto, under which TJI or any TJI Subsidiary has any right, interest, or

TJI or the TJI Subsidiaries, is not subject to any threatened amendment,

execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Partnership Agreement, and
the other Related Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby) which, with the giving of notice or the
lapse of time or both, would become a breach or default, and there is no
basis for any valid claim of a default in any respect, under any such
permits, contracts, agreements or other documents.

a whole.

properties related thereto; and

(d) To the knowledge of S&O, there are and have been no underground

heretofore owned, leased or rented by or otherwise under the control of
either SealRite or Oldach, which tanks or impoundments, if determined by

(e) SCHEDULE 7.20 sets forth an accurate and complete list of all
currently pending Actions and claims or allegations of any person relating
to Environmental Laws or otherwise relating to environmental, health, and

ARTICLE VIII

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES

SECTION 8.1 CASH DISTRIBUTION TO S&O.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, it
is expressly acknowledged and agreed by TJI that at the Closing, TJI shall cause
the Partnership to make a cash distribution to S&O in an amount equal to $16
million (two-thirds to Oldach and one-third SealRite). The "Units" (as defined
in Section 4.1 of the Partnership Agreement) assigned to S&O pursuant to the
Partnership Agreement reflect the foregoing distribution, and therefore shall
not be adjusted in any way as a result thereof.

SECTION 8.2 TAX DISTRIBUTIONS BY S&O.

In addition to the cash distribution provided in Section 6.1 above, TJI
expressly acknowledges and agrees that at the Closing, S&O shall distribute or
shall have distributed to the shareholders of S&O an amount sufficient to enable
them to pay all federal, state and local income taxes payable by them on S&O's
taxable income for the portion of its current fiscal year ending on the Closing
Date (net of any distributions previously made by S&O on account of such taxes).
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the amount of the foregoing tax
distribution shall be subject to adjustment on or prior to December 31, 1994.
Such adjustment shall be made by the payment of cash by the Partnership or S&O,
as the case may be, to S&O or the Partnership, as the case may be, on or before
January 13, 1994, and shall not be deemed to be an adjustment to the capital
accounts of S&O (or any other partner) for financial reporting purposes or for
purposes of Section 12.7 of the Partnership Agreement.

SECTION 8.3 TRANSFER TAXES.

The Partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, all sales, use and other
(excluding income) taxes and recording, registration and filing fees imposed on
any transfers by any Party of real property and tangible and intangible personal
property, including without limitation intellectual property, applicable to the
transfers of the Norco Assets, the Dashwood Stock and the S&O Assets.

PARTNERSHIP FORMATION AND CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT - 54
<PAGE>

SECTION 8.4 CONSENTS, PERMITS, ETC.

Each of TJI and S&O covenants and agrees with the other Party as follows:

(a) Each Party (i) has maintained in full force and effect and
renewed, when required, all consents, approvals, governmental filings,
authorizations, and permits, and (ii) has obtained (or will use its best
efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable date hereafter) all consents,
approvals, governmental filings, authorizations, and permits necessary to
(A) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Partnership Agreement, and the other Related Agreements and (B) the
continued conduct of the Business by the Partnership after the Effective
Date as it is presently conducted by TJI, the TJI Subsidiaries and each of
S&O, and each Party delivers herewith (or will deliver when obtained
hereafter) to the Partnership copies of each such consent, approval,
governmental filing, authorization, and permit.

(b) To the extent that any of the contracts, leases, agreements,
Permits, plans, commitments, purchase orders, or other binding arrangements
relating to the TJI Assets, the S&O Assets or the Business (in this
Section 8.4(b) called "NON-ASSIGNED AGREEMENTS") cannot be assumed by or
assigned to the Partnership without the consent of another party, and such
consent has not been obtained as of the Closing Date, each of the Parties
hereto agrees to continue to use its best efforts to obtain such consent
and to cooperate with the other in any reasonable arrangement designed to
enable TJI, the TJI Subsidiaries or SealRite and/or Oldach, as applicable,
to perform its obligations under, and to provide for the Partnership the
benefits of, any such Non-Assigned Agreements, including enforcement at any
reasonable cost, and for the account for the Partnership, of any and all
rights of TJI, the TJI Subsidiaries or S&O, as applicable, against the
other party thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof by
such other party or otherwise. TJI and S&O will promptly pay to the
Partnership when received all monies received by such Party under any such
Non-Assigned Agreements.

required (i) for TJI to assign part or all of its rights under this Agreement to
one or more corporations owned or controlled by TJI (ii) for either SealRite or

extent permitted to preserve the Parties' original intent, failing which, it
shall be severed from this Agreement with the balance of this Agreement
continuing in full force and effect. Such occurrence shall not have the effect

is available and not otherwise committed, and (b) be restricted or limited if
the syndicate of TJI lenders involved in such credit facility determines not to

deemed borrowing cost to TJI be in excess of 0.05% over the base rate of

the Partnership, will enforce all rights for the benefit of and at the cost of

other property is pro rata shall be determined by reference to
value. No Partner shall be entitled to distributions of property
other than cash.

SECTION 5.4 DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO CANADIAN NET OPERATING LOSS TAX
BENEFITS.

5.4.1 IN GENERAL. Dashwood and LaFlamme have significant
Canadian NOLs (as defined in Section 5.7 hereof). The Partners agree that Norco
should receive additional distributions hereunder for the value of such Canadian
NOLs.

5.4.2 DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT. The additional distribution
to Norco under this Section 5.4 shall be computed at an amount equal to the
income tax that would have been paid (but was not paid) to the Canadian taxing
authorities (after the date hereof with respect to taxable income arising after
the date hereof resulting from the operations of the Canadian Subsidiaries,

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT - 17
<PAGE>

as opposed to resulting from any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or
the Related Agreements), had there been no Canadian NOLs.

5.4.3 DISTRIBUTIONS TO NORCO. At such time as all or any
part of the Canadian NOLs are actually realized by the Partnership on a
consolidated basis (determined in accordance with the provisions of Section
5.4.2 above), the tax benefit of such amount shall be credited to the capital
account of Norco, and the Partnership shall make an immediate cash distribution
to Norco equal to the amount of such tax benefit (which distribution shall be a
debit to Norco's capital account).

5.4.4 TAX ALLOCATION. The treatment of the Canadian NOLs
may or may not have any income tax impact on the federal, state or local taxable
income of the Partnership. If there is any such tax impact, then such impact
shall be allocated to Norco, which shall, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, reduce the amount of distributions which would
otherwise be payable to Norco.

5.4.5 CANADIAN NOLS NOT FULLY REALIZED PRIOR TO LIQUIDATION.
The Partnership may liquidate or have a Liquidity Transaction prior to the
Canadian NOLs being fully realized. If the Partnership's assets are transferred
to a successor corporation, the successor corporation shall, pursuant to an
instrument reasonably satisfactory to Norco, assume the Partnership's obligation
to pay Norco the amount of such tax benefits of such Canadian NOLs which remain
unrealized pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Such agreement shall
provide that it shall be a condition precedent of any payments thereunder that
the corporate successor shall realize the tax benefit of such Canadian NOLs.

5.4.6 INDEPENDENT PROVISION. Section 5.4 is intended to
operate separate and apart from the other provisions of this Agreement. For
example, the distributions under Sections 5.3 and 5.5 shall not take into
account any distributions under this Section 5.4.

5.4.7 SALE OF CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES. If either or both of
the Canadian Subsidiaries are sold pursuant to Section 7.6, this Section 5.4 and
Section 5.2.1(b) shall terminate AB INITIO with respect to the Canadian
Subsidiary which has been sold and shall have no force and effect, and Norco
shall pay the Partnership a refund of any distributions made pursuant to this
Section 5.4 prior to such sale with respect to such Canadian Subsidiary.

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT - 18
<PAGE>

SECTION 5.5 TAX DISTRIBUTIONS.

5.5.1 IN GENERAL. If the Partnership has federal taxable
income for a particular tax year, such federal taxable income will flow through
to the Partners (including the owners of Partners that are flow through
entities) and such Partners (including the owners of Partners that are flow
through entities) are responsible for the payment of federal, state and local
tax on such Partnership taxable income.

5.5.2 GOOD FAITH DETERMINATION. The Management Board shall
assume a 46.6% federal, state and local income tax rate, as shall be amended
from time to time to take into account changes in applicable income tax rates.
Such rate may be assumed to be lower in the event taxable income includes
special items, such as capital gains. The Management Board may also consider
other factors as it deems relevant, including the known or anticipated taxable
income for the Partnership for other quarters in the same taxable year.

5.5.3 DETERMINATION OF HIGHEST PRO RATA ALLOCATION. The
Management Board shall then determine the highest per Unit allocation of taxable
income to a particular Partner. For example, Partner A may have 10 Units and be
allocated $100 of taxable income and Partner B may have 20 Units and be
allocated $180 of taxable income. Thus, Partner A would have the highest per
Unit allocation of taxable income.

5.5.4 MANDATORY TAX DISTRIBUTIONS. The Management Board
shall cause the Partnership to distribute to each Unit holder an amount equal to
the estimated income tax per Unit per quarter determined pursuant to Sections
5.5.2 and 5.5.3 above, based on the highest per Unit allocation of taxable
income for such quarter ("MANDATORY TAX DISTRIBUTIONS"). Said amount shall be
distributed by wire transfer on January 14, April 14, June 14 and September 14
of each year, commencing January 14, 1995. The amount of any Mandatory Tax
Distribution shall be reduced by any distributions of Distributable Cash made
within the prior 92 days pursuant to Section 5.3.3. To the extent the aggregate
of the amounts of Mandatory Tax Distributions hereunder is determined to be less
than the income tax per Unit pursuant to Sections 5.5.2 and 5.5.3 for a taxable
year, based upon the Partnership's determination of actual taxable income after
the close of such taxable year, an additional amount equal to such difference
shall be distributed by the Partnership no later than April 14th of the year
following such taxable year.

5.5.5 CHANGES IN INTERESTS OR HOLDINGS. The principles of
Section 5.6.2, relating to changes in interests or holdings, shall apply for
purposes of this Section 5.5, but it is understood that Mandatory Tax
Distributions to be made that relate

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT - 19
<PAGE>

to a Partner's predecessors in interest shall be made instead to such Partner.

5.5.6 AUTHORITY OF MANAGEMENT BOARD. Determinations under
this Section 5.5 shall be made reasonably and in good faith by the Management
Board. In making such determinations, the Management Board shall be entitled to
make reasonable assumptions and estimates in reasonable pursuit of convenience
of administration.

SECTION 5.6 TAX ALLOCATIONS.

5.6.1 IN GENERAL. All items of Partnership income, gain,
loss, deduction, credit, basis adjustment, and the like for any taxable year
shall be allocated among the Partners for income tax purposes in accordance with
the Partners' respective holdings of Units and in accordance with law, including
Code section 704(b), in a manner reasonably and in good faith determined by the
Management Board for the intended benefit of the Partners generally. In
accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the Regulations thereunder, income,
gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the
capital of the Partnership shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among
the Partners so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis
of such property to the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and its fair
market value to the Partnership.

5.6.2 CHANGES IN INTERESTS AND HOLDINGS. Where there is a
change in the holders of partnership interests, in the respective holdings of
partnership interests, or in the respective rights or duties appurtenant to
partnership interests (caused, E.G., by a transfer, issuance, retirement or
modification of a partnership interest), allocations under Section 5.6.1 for a
taxable year among the persons who are or were holders of partnership interests
shall be made in the manner determined by the Management Board to be required by
the Code, including Code section 706, and if the Management Board determines
that more than one method is permitted, then by the method that the Management
Board selects as appropriate, taking into account both principles of substantial
fairness and convenience of administration.

5.6.3 NONRECOURSE LIABILITIES. For purposes of Treas. Reg.
Section 1.752-3(a)(3) relating to allocation of nonrecourse liabilities of the
Partnership among the Partners for purposes of allocating nonrecourse
deductions, each Partner's interest in Partnership profits shall be in
Section accordance with Units. For purposes of Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-2,
income, gain, loss, deduction and expenditure attributable to nonrecourse
liabilities shall also be in accordance with Units.

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT - 20
<PAGE>

5.6.4 EFFECT ON TAXES ONLY. Nothing in this Section 5.6
shall be construed to cause, or to permit or require the Partnership, the
Management Board, or any other person to cause, any adjustment to the rights or
duties of the Partners or the Partnership relating to contributions,
distributions, liabilities to third parties, or the like.

SECTION 5.7 DEFINITION OF CANADIAN NOLS.

5.7.1 "CANADIAN NOLS" means an amount calculated for the
purposes of this Agreement equal to the SUM of (A) $9,027,493 Canadian (which
is the unused non-capital losses and unused tax credits for Canadian income tax
purposes of the Canadian Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993), PLUS (B) the
following:

(a) for the period from January 1, 1994 through and
including June 30, 1994, 100% of the non-capital losses and unused
tax credits for Canadian income tax purposes of the Canadian
Subsidiaries as shown on Form T-25(4) (Continuity of Losses
Carryforward Schedule) (the "REPORTABLE LOSS AMOUNT"); and

(b) for the Start-Up Period, (i) 100% of the Reportable Loss
Amount in the event that Norco is required to make any payments as a
result of ND&L Operating Losses pursuant to Section 3.6 hereof (but
only to the extent of cash contributed as a result of such ND&L
Operating Losses for the Canadian Subsidiaries only).

5.7.2 In computing Canadian NOLs, that portion expressed in
Canadian currency shall be translated into U.S. currency on the date or dates
that they provide a tax benefit to the Canadian Subsidiaries.

5.7.3 For purposes of this Agreement, a tax benefit will be
realized when the Canadian Subsidiaries reduce the Canadian income tax payments
to the Canadian authorities by the tax benefit.

5.7.4 For any period which does constitute a full fiscal year,
the resulting full fiscal year will be prorated and shall be used to calculate
the Reportable Loss Amount for the period.

SECTION 5.8 MISCELLANEOUS TAX MATTERS.

5.8.1 AUTHORITY OF MANAGEMENT BOARD. All tax and accounting
determinations and elections shall be made reasonably and in good faith by the
Management Board for the intended benefit

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT - 21
<PAGE>

of the Partners generally and without preference or bias as to any Partner or
Partners.

5.8.2 PARTNERSHIP ELECTIONS. The Management Board may make
or decline to make, or may revoke or seek to revoke, any election which the
Partnership may make under the tax laws, including the election provided by
section 754 of the Code.

5.8.3 TAX MATTERS PARTNER. Unless otherwise required by
law, the tax matters partner within the meaning of section 6231(a)(7) of the
Code shall be Norco.

5.8.4 CERTAIN PARTNERSHIP-LEVEL TAXES. The Management Board
is authorized to file "group" or "composite" state income tax returns on behalf
of nonresident Partners in states where the Partnership conducts business to the
extent applicable state law permits the filing of such returns and the
Management Board determines that the interests of such Partners as a whole would
thereby be served. The Management Board may take any actions on behalf of the
Partnership and such Partners as may be necessary or appropriate to satisfy any
conditions that may be imposed by state law on the right to file such returns.
To the extent the Management Board files a group or composite state income tax
return, the Management Board shall notify each Partner of his share of tax paid
with such return, which share shall be determined pursuant to any reasonable
method chosen by the Management Board that is in accordance with applicable law.
The amount of such Partner's share of tax paid with such return shall be treated
as a distribution of such amount to such Partner. In the event that any state,
local or other income tax imposed on the Partnership as an entity (such as the
Illinois Personal Property Tax Replacement Income Tax) is reduced by reason of
the holding of a partnership interest by any holder, no part of the expense of
the Partnership for such tax shall be allocated to such holder, and an amount
equal to the reduction attributable to such holder shall be distributed to such
holder on March 14 of each year, commencing March 14, 1995. Any payment
hereunder shall be in addition to the Mandatory Tax Distributions provided
above.

SECTION 7.6 SALE OF CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES.

7.6.1 SALE OF CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, until and including March 31,
1995 (the "SALE PERIOD"), the Partnership, in the sole discretion of Norco,
may sell Dashwood. Such transaction may or may not include LaFlamme, and if it
does not, the Partnership shall cause Dashwood to transfer the voting stock of
LaFlamme to a corporation which, as of February 7, 1992, was an affiliate of
Dashwood and as at the date of the transfer is an affiliate of TJI and such
stock shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Partnership. For the
purposes of this Section 7.6.1, affiliate shall have the meaning attributed to
that term in the Share Purchase Agreement dated February 7, 1992 ("LaFlamme
Agreement"), pertaining to the purchase by Dashwood of the shares of LaFlamme.
Non-voting stock of LaFlamme which will carry all of the economic benefits shall
be transferred to the Partnership. LaFlamme will not be sold under this Section
7.6 without the concurrent or prior sale of Dashwood. LaFlamme also will not be
sold under this Section 7.6 unless sold during the Sale Period. For purposes
hereof, the term "SELL" shall mean the consummation and completion of a sale
transaction and the receipt of the proceeds therefrom and, in the case of
Dashwood only, pursuant to a binding agreement entered into not later than
December 31, 1994. In the event of a sale during the Sale Period, all benefits
and detriments of such transaction and of the Partnership's ownership of the
stock prior to the sale, including, but not limited to, sale proceeds,
transaction costs and expenses, indemnification obligations, Canadian tax
obligations (including any taxes attributable to the distribution of LaFlamme to
the Partnership, if any) and U.S. (federal, state and local) tax obligations
shall inure solely to the benefit of, and/or be solely borne by, Norco.
Further, the parties agree that in the event of a sale of Dashwood only (and not
LaFlamme), there will be a deemed return to Norco of its contribution of
Dashwood, and a subsequent contribution to the Partnership of LaFlamme, all as
of the Effective Date. Appropriate adjustment to Norco's capital account will
be made as provided in Section 7.6.2 below. Norco shall reimburse the
Partnership in cash for all such detriments paid by the Partnership and all
contributions or loans to Dashwood or LaFlamme, it being intended that neither
the Partnership nor the other Partners shall suffer economically by reason of
such sale or sales or by reason of owning the stock of Dashwood or LaFlamme
prior to such sale or sales.

7.6.2 PAYMENT OF SALE PROCEEDS; REDUCTION IN OWNERSHIP
PERCENTAGES. The net proceeds of any sale of Dashwood, or of Dashwood and
LaFlamme, during the Sale Period shall be distributed solely to Norco. Norco's
capital account shall be reduced by an amount representing the agreed fair
market value of the Canadian Subsidiary (or Subsidiaries) sold (as reflected in

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT - 31
<PAGE>

Section 3.1 hereof), and its percentage ownership of the Units in the
Partnership shall be recalculated retroactively to the Effective Date. For
example, in the event Dashwood is sold during the Sale Period, but LaFlamme is
not, Dashwood will be deemed to be returned to Norco, LaFlamme distributed by
Dashwood to Norco, and LaFlamme contributed to the Partnership by Norco, all as
an adjustment to Norco's initial contribution to the Partnership; in such event,
Norco's capital account would be reduced by a net amount equal to $15 million,
with a corresponding deemed reduction in its percentage ownership of the Units
in the Partnership to 66,037 Units, or 66.037% (35/53rds) of the outstanding
Units. If both Dashwood and LaFlamme are sold, Norco's capital account would be
reduced by an amount equal to $18 million, with a corresponding reduction in its
Units and percentage ownership in the Partnership to 64,000 Units, or 64.0%
(32/50ths) of the outstanding Units. In each case, S&O's Units and percentage
ownership in the Partnership would increase proportionately. Upon a sale of
Dashwood and LaFlamme pursuant to this Section 7.6, the amount of the TJI
Effective Date Net Worth (after taking into account the cash adjustment made
pursuant to Section 2.4(e) of the Contribution Agreement) attributable to Norco
only, shall be computed. If the TJI Effective Date Net Worth (attributable to
Norco only) exceeds $32 million, the Partners shall cause the Partnership to
make a cash payment to TJI in the amount of the excess. If the TJI Effective
Date Net Worth is less than $32 million (attributable to Norco only), Norco
shall pay the Partnership the amount of the deficiency. If only Dashwood and
not LaFlamme is sold pursuant to this Section 7.6, the foregoing amount shall be
$35 million (rather than $32 million), and the TJI Effective Date Net Worth
shall be attributable to both Norco and LaFlamme. The foregoing payments and
distributions, if any, will not affect the number of Units held by each Partner.

7.6.3 EFFECT OF SALE. If Dashwood or LaFlamme are sold
pursuant to Section 7.6.1, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to remove references to
Dashwood and LaFlamme, as applicable, and all calculations, determinations,
payments and adjustments made pursuant to this Agreement which are based on the
inclusion of Dashwood and LaFlamme in the contribution of TJI to the Partnership
shall be adjusted and, where necessary, reversed to reflect such removal.

7.6.4 TERMINATION IF NO SALE. If a binding agreement for
the sale of Dashwood is not entered into on or before December 31, 1994, or if
Dashwood, or Dashwood and LaFlamme are not sold (as defined in Section 7.6.1
above) on or before March 31, 1995, this Section 7.6 shall terminate in its
entirety without any further force or effect.

appointed for a meeting, a quorum of the Management Board is not present, the
Chairman shall adjourn the meeting to a time and place mutually convenient to
the Board members, at time not more than 30 days from the date of adjournment.

time copies of all correspondence and documents delivered to or sent by the

SECTION 7.12 WRITTEN DECISIONS.

one or more counterparts by all the members of the Management Board or their

Board. Any decision in writing will be effective on the date specified therein
or, if not date is specified, on the date it is signed by the last of the

illiquidity.

11.4.2 ESTABLISHMENT OF VALUE. The Valuation Expert shall
then establish the value of the Units/interest of the Defaulting Partner(s) and

such Partner based on the number of Units held related to the total number of

12.2.2 WAIVER OF DISSOLUTION AND PARTITION RIGHTS. The
Partners hereby agree that notwithstanding any provision of the Act, the
Partnership shall not dissolve except as provided in Section 12.2.1, and each
Partner waives the benefit of all provisions of law, as now in effect or as
enacted in the future, relating to actions of partition of real and personal
property. Each Partner further agrees that it will not resort to any action at
law or in equity to partition the real or personal property held or used by the
Partnership except as provided in this Agreement. If it is determined that the
Partnership has dissolved prior to the occurrence of a Dissolution Event, the
Partners hereby agree to reconstitute the Partnership as of such dissolution and
continue the business of the Partnership without a winding up or liquidation.

SECTION 12.3 TERMINATION ELECTION.

Upon the certification of a Deadlock by the boards of directors of
either TJI or S&O, the party making such certification can give notice to the
other parties of an election to dissolve and terminate the Partnership and to
designate a date upon which the Partnership will be dissolved, which such notice
shall be not less than thirty (30) days prior to its effective date (a
"TERMINATION ELECTION").

SECTION 12.4 APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER.

Upon notice of a Termination Election, or upon the election of the
Non-Defaulting Partner(s) to dissolve the Partnership pursuant to Section
11.2(e), the Partner(s) giving such notice or making such election shall apply
to a court of competent jurisdiction ("COURT") to appoint a receiver (the
"RECEIVER"), who may be a Partner. Subject to the directions of the Court,
the Receiver shall wind-up the affairs of the Partnership in accordance with
Section 12.5 and while doing so may

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT - 42
<PAGE>

manage and operate any property and assets of the Partnership and will have all
necessary powers and authority of the Partners. Any non-Partner Receiver shall
be entitled to reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses incurred in
carrying out its duties as Receiver.

SECTION 12.5 DISSOLUTION UPON TERMINATION ELECTION OR EVENT OF DEFAULT.

If the Partnership is dissolved pursuant to a Termination Election
or upon the election of the Non-Defaulting Partner(s) pursuant to Section
11.2(e), the Receiver shall sell all of the Partnership's assets if it can or,
if not, shall make whatever allocation of assets and liabilities to the Partners
as it determines in its sole discretion, consistent with ensuring that each
Partner receives its respective percentage interest of the value of the Business
and assets of the Partnership. If so determined by the Receiver, all of the
assets of the Partnership shall be liquidated by the Receiver, and the Receiver
shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain from the sale of the assets of the
Partnership a price approximately equal to or greater than the fair market value
of the assets at the date of sale.

result of a Dissolution Event OTHER THAN a Termination Election or an election
by the Non-Defaulting Partner(s) pursuant to Section 11.2(e), the Partnership
shall immediately commence to wind up its affairs and the Partners shall proceed
with reasonable promptness to liquidate the business of the Partnership. The
assets of the Partnership may be distributed to a liquidating trust to conduct
the winding up, if Approved by the Management Board. Such liquidating trust
shall be organized and operated in such manner as to be treated for federal
income tax purposes as a trust rather than an association taxable as a
corporation.

12.6.2 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS DURING WINDING UP. During the
period of the wind up of the affairs of the Partnership (other than pursuant to
a Termination Election or an Event of Default), the rights and obligations of
the Partners set forth herein with respect to the management of the Partnership
shall continue. For purposes of winding up, the Management Board shall continue
to act as such and shall make all decisions relating to the conduct of any
business or operations during the winding up period and to the sale or other
disposition of Partnership assets; PROVIDED, however, that if the termination
of the Partnership results from an Event of Default, the Defaulting Partner
shall have no further right to participate in the management or affairs of the
Partnership or to attend Management Board meetings or vote on

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT - 43
<PAGE>

decisions by the Management Board, but shall nonetheless be bound by all
decisions made by the Non-Defaulting Partner(s). Each Partner hereby waives any
claims it may have against the Non-Defaulting Partner(s) that may arise out of
the management by the Non-Defaulting Partner(s) of the Partnership, so long as
such Non-Defaulting Partner(s) acts in good faith.

SECTION 12.7 DISTRIBUTIONS ON LIQUIDATION.

The assets of the Partnership shall be applied or distributed in
liquidation in the following order of priority:

(a) FIRST, to payment of all debts and liabilities of the
Partnership owed to third parties, and all expenses of liquidation;

(b) SECOND, to payment of all debts and liabilities of the
Partnership to any Partner;

(c) THIRD, to set up such cash reserves, if any, as the
Receiver may deem reasonably necessary for any contingent
liabilities or obligations of the Partnership. Such cash reserves,
to the extent no longer necessary, shall be distributed as set forth
in Sections 12.7(d) and (e) below;

(d) FOURTH, to the proportionate repayment of each Partner
of the credit balance in the Partner's capital account in the
Partnership;

(e) FIFTH, distributions to Partners (other than in their
capacity as creditors) ("LIQUIDATION DISTRIBUTIONS"), shall be
made upon the wind-up of the Partnership, (i) as provided in Section
5.2.1(a) relating to distributions of Distributable Cash.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, the
amount of any distribution made pursuant to Section 12.7(d) hereof shall vary,
between Norco on the one hand and S&O on the other hand, from their respective
percentage interests in Units only (i) to the extent any Partner has contributed
any additional capital to the Partnership which is not required under the
provisions of this Agreement, or (ii) up to the aggregate amount of
distributions then due to Norco pursuant to Section 5.4.3 hereof, but not yet
paid.

SECTION 12.8 DISPOSITION OF DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS.

All documents and records of the Partnership, including, without
limitation, all financial records, vouchers, cancelled checks and bank
statements, shall be delivered to TJI upon

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT - 44
<PAGE>

termination of the Partnership. Unless otherwise approved by the other
Partners, TJI shall retain such documents and records for a period of not less
than seven (7) years and shall make such documents and records available during
normal business hours to the other Partners for inspection and copying at the
other Partners' cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no documents
or records of the Partnership shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of
without prior notice to S&O, in which event S&O shall have the right to retain
such records.

SECTION 12.9 CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION OF PARTNERS.

Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement, upon a
dissolution of the Partnership and the winding-up of its affairs, to the extent
the Partnership's assets (including unpaid contribution obligations, if any, of
Partners) are insufficient to satisfy the liabilities of the Partnership for
which the Partners are liable under applicable law as partners, the Partners
shall make contributions to the Partnership therefor in proportion to their
respective Units. The Partners shall have rights of contribution among
themselves under the allocation principles of this Section 12.9 for payments
made by Partners with respect to such Partnership liabilities.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

SECTION 2.1 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.

it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company to file a
registration statement for, and to consummate a firm commitment underwritten
initial public offering of, Company Common Stock ("INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING")
at a time mutually agreed upon by the parties during calendar year 1995;
PROVIDED, however, that the Company may delay the filing of any such
registration statement for up to 12 months if the Underwriter shall advise the
Company and the S&O Shareholders that, in its good faith opinion, an Initial
Public Offering during 1995 would materially adversely affect the success of the
offering or otherwise materially adversely affect the price of the shares of
Company Common Stock to be offered solely for the Company's account. The period
of any delay hereunder shall not exceed the period of delay recommended by the
Underwriter within such twelve (12) month period. If by the end of 1995 (or
1996 in the event that the first proviso to the next preceding sentence is
applicable), the Company has not consummated an Initial Public Offering or if
such an Initial Public Offering was so consummated but any S&O Shareholder was
unable to include in such Initial Public Offering all of the Registrable
Securities sought to be included therein by such Person pursuant to Section 2.2
below (without giving effect to any reductions required by Section 2.2.4), the
Company shall be obligated to satisfy its obligations under Sections 2.3 and 2.4
below relating to the S&O Shareholders' special demand registration rights.
With respect to a registration in connection with an Initial Public Offering,
the Company, in consultation with the S&O Shareholders, shall have sole
authority to make all decisions in connection with the filing, effectiveness and
consummation of the proposed offering, subject to the express provisions hereof
(including,

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 3
<PAGE>

without limitation, the selection of an underwriter mutually acceptable to TJI
and the S&O Shareholders as provided by the definition of the term
"UNDERWRITER").

2.1.2 The parties agree that at such time as it is determined
to undertake an Initial Public Offering as provided in Section 2.1.1 above, or
the Company is otherwise required pursuant to any of the terms of this Agreement
to publicly sell its securities, the parties will (and cause SealRite and
Oldach, and Norco and other Affiliates, respectively, to) execute and deliver
all documents and perform all acts as will be necessary or appropriate to:

(a) merge SealRite and Oldach with and into Norco with Norco
as the surviving entity (the "COMPANY"), for which the S&O
Shareholders shall receive, pursuant to an S-4 registration
statement under the Act, common stock in the Company in exchange for
their common stock in SealRite and Oldach, the fully-diluted
percentage of such shares of common stock in the Company to be the
same as the fully-diluted percentage of the Units of the S&O
Shareholders in the Partnership.

(b) dissolve and wind-up the Partnership and distribute its
assets to the Company, in which event the Company shall assume all
of the liabilities of the Partnership, including the Partnership's
obligations to pay the amount of the Canadian NOLs pursuant to
Section 5.4.5 of the Partnership Agreement.

(c) cause the Company to, for a period of at least three
years, timely file all reports required to be filed pursuant to
Section 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and if
the Company is subject to neither Section 13 nor 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, make publicly available on a timely basis the
information specified in paragraphs (a)(15)(i) to (xiv), inclusive,
and (xvi) and of Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act and other
information, if any, from time to time required to meet the
so-called public information requirements of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation).

(d) amend, if necessary, the Company's bylaws and
certificate of incorporation and to enter into a shareholders
agreement so that, until the first public sale of the Company's
equity securities (i) the governance provisions with respect to the
Company's board of directors will be substantially similar to the
governance provisions with respect to the Partnership's Management
Board as set forth in the Partnership

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 4
<PAGE>

Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions governing
Major Decisions, (ii) there will be transfer restrictions on the
transfer of shares of stock held by all of the shareholders of the
Company substantially similar to the restrictions on the transfer of
the Partnership interests in the Partnership Agreement (and after
the first public sale of the Company's equity securities, customary
"tag along" rights shall be imposed upon TJI (in the case of a sale
of control transaction involving the Company) for the benefit of the
S&O Shareholders, and (iii) there is only one class of authorized
capital stock.

It is the intent of the parties that the foregoing actions shall be accomplished
on a tax free basis to the parties. The Partnership and/or the Company shall
pay all of the costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, of all
such actions. Immediately prior to such merger, the Partnership shall make a
Mandatory Tax Distribution with respect to the taxable income of the Partnership
through the date immediately prior to the effective date of such merger in
accordance with the Partnership Agreement, it being understood that such
Mandatory Tax Distribution shall not exceed the amount of the Mandatory Tax
Distribution required under the Partnership Agreement.

SECTION 2.2 PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

2.2.1 If the Company proposes to file a registration statement
under the Securities Act (i) with respect to an Initial Public Offering for its
own account or (ii) otherwise (but not including a Demand Registration) (each of
the foregoing registrations referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) next above being
a "PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION"), then the Company shall give written notice of
such proposed filing to each S&O Shareholder holding Registrable Securities at
least 20 days before the anticipated filing date, and such notice shall offer
such S&O Shareholders the opportunity to register such number of Registrable
Securities as each such S&O Shareholder may request (a "PIGGYBACK
REGISTRATION").

2.2.2 Such notice by the Company pursuant to Section 2.2.1
above (a "PIGGYBACK NOTICE") shall specify, at a minimum, the number and kind
of securities so proposed to be registered, the proposed date of filing of such
registration statement with the Commission, the proposed means of distribution,
the proposed managing underwriter or underwriters (if any and if known), and a
good faith estimate by the Company of the proposed minimum offering price
thereof, as such price is proposed to appear on the facing page of such
registration statement. Upon the written request of an S&O Shareholder given
within ten (10) business days of such holder's receipt of the Piggyback Notice
(which written request shall specify the number and kind of Registrable
Securities

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 5
<PAGE>

intended to be disposed of by such holder and the intended method of
distribution thereof), the Company shall, subject to Section 2.2.4 below,
include in such registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which
the Company has received such written requests for inclusion.

2.2.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the S&O Shareholders
specifically acknowledge and agree that TJI, at its option, may, subject to
Section 2.2.4, include its Registrable Securities in any Piggyback Registration.

2.2.4 If the Underwriter in connection with the Piggyback
Registration delivers gives its good faith opinion to the Company and the S&O
Shareholders holding Registrable Securities that the total amount of securities
which they, the Company and TJI propose to be included in such offering is
sufficiently large to materially and adversely affect the success of such
offering or materially adversely affect the price of the securities to be
offered solely for the account of the Company, then the amount or kind of
Registrable Securities to be offered for the accounts of the S&O Shareholders
and TJI shall be reduced pro rata on the basis of the number of Registrable
Securities sought to be included thereby to the extent necessary to reduce the
total amount of securities to be included in the offering to the amount
recommended by the Underwriter without creating such an effect.

2.2.5 The Company may withdraw any Piggyback Registration
(including proposed Initial Public Offering) initiated by the Company without
the consent of any S&O Shareholder, notwithstanding the request of the S&O
Shareholders to participate therein in accordance with this Section 2.2;
provided, however that any Initial Public Offering which is withdrawn and not
consummated shall not satisfy the obligations of TJI and the Company under
Section 2.1.

2.2.6 Further notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to include
Registrable Securities in any registration statement if the proposed
registration is (i) a registration on Form S-8 (or any successor form) of a
stock option or other employee incentive compensation plan, (ii) a registration
of securities issued or issuable pursuant to a stockholder reinvestment plan, or
other similar plan, or (iii) a registration of securities pursuant to a
shareholders rights plan (a so-called "POISON PILL") or other similar plan
designed to protect the Company's stockholders from a coercive or other attempt
to take control of the Company (each of the foregoing being a "PERMITTED
REGISTRATION").

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 6
<PAGE>

SECTION 2.3 DEMAND REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

2.3.1 Subject to the conditions of this Section 2.3 and
Section 2.4 below, S&O Shareholders holding at least 40% of the total number of
Registrable Securities then held by such Shareholders (such amount being the
"DEMAND MINIMUM AMOUNT") may make a written request (a "DEMAND") to the
Company for registration with the Commission for the resale of such Registrable
Securities under and in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act (a
"DEMAND REGISTRATION"). Each Demand shall specify: (i) the aggregate number
and kind of Registrable Securities requested to be registered, and (ii) the
intended method of distribution in connection with such Demand Registration to
the extent then known. Within 10 business days after receipt of such request,
TJI shall cause the Company to, and the Company will serve written notice (the
"NOTICE") of such registration request to all S&O Shareholders holding
Registrable Securities and TJI shall cause the Company to, and the Company will,
include in such registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which
the Company has received from an S&O Shareholder written requests for inclusion
therein within 20 days after the receipt by the applicable holder of the Notice.

SECTION 2.4 NUMBER OF DEMAND REGISTRATIONS.

2.4.1 S&O Shareholders holding Registrable Securities, as a
class, shall, subject to the provisions of Section 2.4.2 below, be entitled to
TWO Demand Registrations. The Company shall not be required to effect any
such Demand Registration until there has been an Initial Public Offering as
provided in Section 2.3, and then, not within 6 months from the effective date
of such offering; PROVIDED, however, that the Company shall be required to
effect such Demand Registration at any time at the request of S&O Shareholders
holding the Demand Minimum Amount in the event that a Qualified Initial Public
Offering (as herein defined) has not been consummated by the end of 1995 or 1996
(as the case may be) in accordance with Section 2.1.1. A "QUALIFIED INITIAL
PUBLIC OFFERING" shall mean an Initial Public Offering in which each S&O
Shareholder was able to include all Registrable Securities sought to be included
therein by each such S&O Shareholder pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof (but without
reduction pursuant to Section 2.2.4 hereof).

2.4.2 Neither the Company nor any Person (other than TJI and
other than an S&O Shareholder, in each case with respect to Registrable
Securities) shall include any securities in a Demand Registration, except with
the written consent of the S&O Shareholders holding a majority of the
Registrable Securities sought to be registered by such Shareholders pursuant to
such Demand Registration. If the Underwriter of a Demand Registration (or in
the case of a Demand Registration not being underwritten, S&O Shareholders
holding a majority of the Registrable Securities

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 7
<PAGE>

sought to be included therein by such Shareholders), advise the Company that in
its or their good faith opinion the number of securities proposed to be sold in
such Demand Registration by the S&O Shareholders, TJI and, if authorized
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.4.2, the Company or any other
Person exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering at the desired
price, the Company will include in such registration only the number of
securities which, in the opinion of the Underwriter (or such S&O Shareholders,
as the case may be) can be sold, selected first, pro rata among the S&O
Shareholders on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities sought to be
included thereby in such Demand Registration and second (and only after all
S&O Shareholders have included all Registrable Securities sought to be included
thereby in such Demand Registration) TJI and third (and only after all S&O
Shareholders and TJI have included all Registrable Securities sought to be
included thereby in such Demand Registration) other Persons, authorized pursuant
to the first sentence of this Section 2.4.2, who have requested to be included
in such Demand Registration pro rata on the basis of the number of securities
sought to be included thereby in such Demand Registration.

SECTION 2.5 CONDITIONS TO DEMAND REGISTRATION.

Sections 2.3 and 2.4 hereof are subject to each of the following
limitations, conditions and qualifications:

2.5.1 The Company shall be entitled to postpone for a
reasonable period of time (but in any event, not past the date on which the
Company is next required to (or, if earlier, does) file an annual, quarterly or
special report under the Exchange Act (or if the Company is then not then
subject to the Exchange Act, a period not exceeding 90 days) the filing (but not
the preparation) of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared
and filed by it pursuant hereto if, at the time the Company receives a request
for such registration, the Company is in possession of material non-public
information that would be required to be disclosed in a registration statement
but that has not been and will otherwise not be disclosed to the public (and
which is not otherwise required to be disclosed under law or applicable exchange
or NASDAQ rule), and, within ten (10) days after receipt of a request for Demand
Registration, the Company advises the S&O Shareholders in writing such
disclosure would materially adversely affect the Company and its stockholders.
The Company shall be entitled to postpone the filing of such a registration
statement pursuant to this paragraph only once in respect of any Demand
Registration.

2.5.2 In addition, the Company shall be entitled to postpone
for a reasonable period of time (not exceeding 120 days, but in the case of an
acquisition referred to below (including,

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 8
<PAGE>

without limitation, by tender offer), 135 days) the filing (but not the
preparation) of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and
filed by it pursuant hereto if, within 10 days after it receives a request for a
Demand Registration, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in the
good faith exercise of its business judgment (and the Company notifies the S&O
Shareholders of such determination ) that such registration and offering would
materially interfere with any material financing, acquisition, tender offer,
corporate reorganization or other material transaction involving the Company
that prior to such request the Board of Directors of the Company had agreed by
resolution to pursue. The right of the Company to postpone a Demand
Registration under this paragraph shall be limited to one postponement with
respect to each Demand Registration.

2.5.3 A registration shall not be treated as one (1) of the
two (2) permitted Demand Registrations until (i) the applicable registration
statement under the Securities Act has been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("COMMISSION") with respect to such Demand Registration
and (ii) such registration statement shall have been maintained continuously
effective for a period of at least one hundred eighty (180) days or such shorter
period when all Registrable Securities included therein have been sold
thereunder in accordance with the manner of distribution set forth in such
Demand.

2.5.4 If the S&O Shareholders holding a majority of the
Registrable Securities sought to be registered thereby pursuant to a Demand
Registration request that such Demand Registration be an underwritten offering,
then such holders shall select an Underwriter or Underwriters to manage and
administer such offering, such underwriter or underwriters, as the case may be,
to be subject to the approval of TJI, which such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld (and such underwriter or underwriters, as the case may be,
shall constitute the Underwriter hereunder).

2.5.5 If the Company has received a Demand and if the
applicable registration statement in respect of such Demand has not been
withdrawn or abandoned, the Company will not file or cause to be effected any
other registration of any of its equity securities or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for its equity securities under the Securities
Act (except a Permitted Registration), whether on its own behalf or at the
request of any holder or holders of such securities, until a period of at least
one hundred eighty (180) days has elapsed from the effective date of a firm
commitment underwritten Demand Registration or a period of at least ninety (90)
days have elapsed from the effective date of any other Demand Registration,
unless, in each case, a shorter period of time is approved by the S&O
Shareholders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities included thereby
in such Demand Registration.

respect to TJI as provided in Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 hereof), the Company
shall not grant to any Person he right to require or request the Company to
register any equity securities of the Company, or any securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for such securities, without the prior written
consent of the S&O Shareholders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall be
entitled to grant rights to other Persons to participate in Piggyback
Registrations so long as such rights are subordinate to the rights of the S&O
Shareholders with respect to such Piggyback Registrations. The Company will not
hereafter enter into any agreement with respect to its securities which is

Rule 144) of the issue being registered or a similar security of the Company or
any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such
securities, during the 7 days prior to, and during the 180-day period beginning
on, the effective date of a registration statement filed by the Company (except
as part of such registration) in connection with a firm commitment underwritten
public offering of securities of the same class as or substantially similar to
the Registrable Securities, but only if and to the extent requested in writing
(with reasonable prior notice) by the Underwriter with respect thereto. An
"EXEMPTED HOLDER" shall be a Person (other than an officer or director of the
Company from whom the Underwriter reasonably requests, in writing, a so-called
"holdback" or "lockup" agreement) who does not beneficially own (within the
meaning of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) 1% or more
of the Company's Common Stock.

SECTION 3.2 RESTRICTIONS ON PUBLIC SALE BY THE COMPANY.

TJI agrees to cause the Company not to effect (whether for itself or
for any other Person) any public sale or distribution of any securities of the
same class as or substantially similar to those being registered, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities,
during the 7 days prior to, and during the 180-day period beginning on, the
effective

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 10
<PAGE>

date of any registration statement in connection with a Demand Registration or a
Piggyback Registration in which S&O Shareholders are participating (except a
public sale or distribution pursuant to such registration statement to the
extent permitted by this Agreement.) In addition, the Company shall (and TJI
shall cause the Company to), in connection with a Demand Registration, cause
each of the Company's officers and directors to agree not to effect any public
sale or distribution (including sales pursuant to Rule 144) of any such
securities of the Company during such period (except as part of such
underwritten registration to the extent permitted pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement). This Section 3.2 shall not be deemed to limit the exercise of
Demands hereunder by the S&O Shareholders or the disposition of securities by
such Shareholders as permitted (or expressly not restricted) by the other terms
of this Agreement.

SECTION 3.3 COOPERATION BY HOLDERS.

3.3.1 The offering of Registrable Securities by any Holder
shall comply in all respects with the applicable terms, provisions and
requirements set forth in this Agreement, and each such Holder shall timely
provide the Company with all information and materials required to be included
in a registration statement that (i) relate to the offering, (ii) are in
possession of such Holder, and (iii) relate to such Holder, and to take all such
action as may be reasonably required in order not to delay the registration and
offering of the securities by the Company. The Company shall have no obligation
to include in such registration statement shares of a Holder who has failed to
furnish such information which, in the written opinion of counsel to the Company
(which counsel is reasonably acceptable to the S&O Shareholders), is required in
order for the registration statement to be in compliance with the Securities
Act.

3.3.2 In addition to the foregoing, no Holder who holds
Registrable Securities may participate in any underwritten registration
hereunder unless such Holder (i) agrees to sell such Holder's securities on the
terms of and on the basis provided in any underwriting agreements applicable to
such registration and (ii) subject to the remainder of this Section 3.3.2,
completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms
of such underwriting arrangements.

Without limiting any of the foregoing, in the event that the
offering of Registrable Securities is to be made by or through an Underwriter,
the Company shall enter into an underwriting agreement with a managing
Underwriter or Underwriters containing representations, warranties, indemnities
and agreements customarily included (but not inconsistent with the agreements
contained herein) by an issuer of common stock in underwriting agreements

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 11
<PAGE>

with respect to offerings of common stock for the account of, or on behalf of,
such issuers. In connection with the sale of Registrable Securities hereunder
by an S&O Shareholder, any such seller of such Registrable Securities may, at
its option, require that any and all representations and warranties by, and
indemnities and agreements of, the Company to or for the benefit of such
Underwriter or Underwriters (or which would be made to or for the benefit of
such an underwriter or underwriters if such sale of Registrable Securities were
pursuant to an underwritten offering) be made to and for the benefit of such
seller and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of
such Underwriter or Underwriters (or which would be so for the benefit of such
underwriter or underwriters under a customary underwriting agreement) be
conditions precedent to the obligations of such seller in connection with the
disposition of its securities pursuant to the terms hereof (if being agreed that
in connection with any Demand Registration, without limiting any rights or
remedies of the S&O Shareholders, in the event any such condition precedent
shall not be satisfied and, if not so satisfied, shall not be waived by such S&O
Shareholders holding a majority of the Registerable Securities to be included
thereby in such Demand Registration, such Demand Registration shall not be
counted as one (1) of the two (2) permitted Demands hereunder). No such seller
of Registrable Securities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be
required to make any representations or warranties to, or agreements with, the
Company or underwriter or underwriters or any other Person, other than
representations and warranties regarding such seller's authority and ownership
of such Registrable Securities and the intended method of distribution and other
than any agreements expressly contemplated by the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 3.4 RULE 144.

TJI covenants that, upon any registration statement covering Company
securities becoming effective, it will cause the Company to timely file the
reports required to be filed by the Company under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder
(or, if the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the
request of S&O Shareholders holding Registrable Securities then constituting the
Demand Minimum Amount, cause the Company to make timely publicly available such
other information as is necessary to permit sales under Rule 144 under the
Securities Act), and it will cause the Company to take such other action as S&O
Shareholders holding Registrable Securities then constituting the Demand Minimum
Amount may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to
enable such S&O Shareholders to sell Registrable Securities without registration
under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a)
Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 12
<PAGE>

to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the
Commission. Upon the request of S&O Shareholders holding Registrable Securities
then constituting the Demand Minimum Amount, TJI will cause the Company to
deliver to such S&O Shareholders a written statement as to whether it has
complied with such requirements.

ARTICLE 4

REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

SECTION 5.1 GENERAL.

Whenever any Registrable Securities are to be registered pursuant to
this Agreement, TJI will cause the Company to use its reasonable best efforts to
effect the registration of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the
intended method of disposition thereof as quickly as practicable. In connection
with any Piggyback Registration or Demand Registration, TJI will cause the
Company to, as expeditiously as possible, perform the following:

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 13
<PAGE>

5.1.1 Prepare and file with the Commission a registration
statement which includes the Registrable Securities and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; PROVIDED,
that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or
supplements thereto, including documents incorporated by reference after the
initial filing of the registration statement, the Company will furnish to the
S&O Shareholders holding Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement; and to the Underwriter, if any, draft copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed at least 5 business days prior thereto, which documents
will be subject to the reasonable review of such S&O Shareholders and
Underwriter, and the Company will not file any registration statement or
amendment thereto or any prospectus or any supplement thereto (including such
documents incorporated by reference) to which S&O Shareholders holding a
MAJORITY of the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement
or the Underwriter, if any, shall reasonably object, and will notify each S&O
Shareholder holding Registrable Securities of any stop order issued or
threatened by the Commission in connection therewith and use its reasonable best
efforts to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered.
Promptly notify the selling holders of Registrable Securities of each of (x) the
filing and effectiveness of the registration statement and prospectus and any
amendments or supplements thereto and, (y) the receipt of any comments from the
Commission or any state securities law authorities or any other governmental
authorities with respect to any such registration statement or prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto.

5.1.2 Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
post-effective amendments to the registration statement as may be necessary to
keep the registration statement effective for a period of not less than 180
DAYS (or such shorter period which will terminate when all Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement have been sold or withdrawn,
but not prior to the expiration of the 90-day period referred to in Section 4(3)
of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder, if applicable); cause the
prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and as so
supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act; and
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act applicable to it with respect
to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement
during the applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of
disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement or
supplement to the prospectus; the Company shall not be deemed to have complied
with its obligations hereunder to keep a registration statement effective during
the applicable period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in
selling S&O Shareholders of the Registrable Securities being prevented from

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 14
<PAGE>

selling such Registrable Securities during that period whether or not such
action is required by applicable law.

5.1.3 Furnish to any S&O Shareholder holding Registrable
Securities included in such registration statement and the Underwriter, if any,
without charge, such number of conformed copies of the registration statement
and any post-effective amendment thereto and such number of copies of the
prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendments or
supplements thereto, and any documents incorporated by reference therein, as
such S&O Shareholder or Underwriter may request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities (it being understood that the Company
consents to the use of the prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by
each holder of Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement and
the Underwriter, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of the
Registrable Securities covered by the prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto); PROVIDED, that before filing a registration statement or prospectus
or any amendments or supplements thereto, the Company will furnish to one
counsel selected by S&O Shareholders holding a majority of the Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement, copies of all documents
proposed to be filed, which such documents will be subject to the reasonable
review of such counsel.

5.1.4 Notify each S&O Shareholder holding Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement, at any time when a
prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act, when the Company becomes aware of the happening of any event as a result of
which the prospectus included in such registration statement (as then in effect)
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and, as
promptly as practicable thereafter, prepare and file with the Commission and
furnish a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

5.1.5 Use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify
the Registrable Securities under the securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as S&O Shareholders may reasonably request
(including registration or qualification for resale and for secondary trading)
and do any and all other acts which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
enable S&O Shareholders to dispose of the Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions (including, without limitation, obtaining the

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 15
<PAGE>

withdrawal of any order suspending registration or qualification (or the
effectiveness thereof) or suspending or preventing the use of any related
prospectus in any such jurisdiction with respect thereto) and keep such
registration or qualification in effect for so long as the registration
statement remains effective under the Securities Act; PROVIDED, however, that
the Company shall not be required for any such purpose to (i) qualify generally
or use efforts to cause itself to qualify generally to do business as a foreign
corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not otherwise be required to
qualify but for the requirements of this Section 5.1.5 or (ii) consent generally
to service of process in any such jurisdiction.

5.1.6 Use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such
Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities exchange and included in
each established over-the-counter market on which or through which similar
securities of the Company are then listed or traded and, if not so listed or
traded, to be listed on the NASD automated quotation system ("NASDAQ") and if
listed on NASDAQ, use its reasonable efforts to secure designation of all such
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement as a NASDAQ
"NATIONAL MARKET SYSTEM SECURITY" within the meaning of Rule 11Aa2-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or, failing that, to secure NASDAQ
authorization for such Registrable Securities and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to arrange for at least two (2) market makers to
register as such with respect to such Registrable Securities with the NASD; and
provide a transfer agent, registrar and CUSIP number for all of such Registrable
Securities not later than the effective date of such registration statement.

5.1.7 Enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form
in connection with an underwritten offering referred to herein and take such
other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such underwritten
offering.

5.1.8 Make available for inspection, at reasonable times and
on such other reasonable terms and conditions as TJI may cause the Company to
specify, by the S&O Shareholders, by the Underwriters, if any, participating in
any disposition pursuant to the registration statement, and by not more than one
attorney and one accountant retained to represent the S&O Shareholders and not
more than one attorney and one accountant retained to represent all of such
Underwriters (collectively, "INSPECTORS"), such financial and other records,
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company (collectively,
"RECORDS") as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their
due diligence responsibility, if any. Any such Inspector retained by or on
behalf of the S&O Shareholders or such Underwriter shall certify to TJI that
such Inspector has been retained by or on behalf of the

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 16
<PAGE>

S&O Shareholders or such Underwriters, as the case may be. The S&O Shareholder
agree to use their reasonable best efforts, and to use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their agents (but not including the Underwriters or their
agents) who are Inspectors, to keep confidential and not to disclose the matters
contained in any Records which TJI or the Company determines, in good faith, to
be confidential and as to which TJI or the Company so notifies in writing the
Inspectors and which (i) are not publicly known or otherwise known to the
Inspectors at the time of disclosure, (ii) do not subsequently become public
through no act or omission by the Inspectors and (iii) do not otherwise become
known to the Inspectors other than through disclosure by TJI or the Company,
except that (A) the S&O Shareholders or the Inspectors may make such disclosures
as may be required by law or applicable legal process and (B) the S&O
Shareholders or the Inspectors may disclose such matters to officers, directors,
employees and other representatives of the S&O Shareholders in connection with
the due diligence relating to the registration statement.

5.1.9 Fully cooperate with the S&O Shareholders (and the
Underwriter, if any) to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold and not bearing any
restrictive legends and enable such Registrable Securities to be in such
denominations and registered in such names as S&O Shareholders and the
Underwriter may request at least two business days prior to any sale of
Registrable Securities.

5.1.10 Otherwise comply with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission and make generally available to the security
holders of the Company an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of
Section 11(a) of the Securities Act as soon as practicable (but in any event not
later than fifteen (15) months after the effectiveness of such registration
statement), which requirement will be deemed to be satisfied if the Company
timely files complete and accurate information on Forms 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K under
the Exchange Act and otherwise complies with Rule 158 under the Securities Act
as soon as feasible.

5.1.11 Furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities a
signed counterpart of (x) an opinion of counsel for the Company (which counsel
shall be reasonably acceptable to the holder of a majority of the Registrable
Securities being so registered) and (y) a "COMFORT" letter signed by the
independent public accountants who have certified the Company's financial
statements included or incorporated by reference in such registration statement
and, in the case of the accountants' comfort letter, with respect to events
subsequent to the date of such financial statements, as are customarily covered
in opinions of issuer's counsel and in accountants' comfort letters delivered to
the underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities for

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 17
<PAGE>

the account of, or on behalf of, an issuer of common stock, such opinion and
comfort letters to be dated the date such opinions and comfort letters are
customarily dated in such transactions.

5.1.12 Take all such other actions as the S&O Shareholders
holding a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold thereby reasonably
request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities.

SECTION 5.2 COOPERATION OF HOLDERS.

5.2.1 Each Holder, upon receipt of any notice from the Company
of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 5.1.4 above, will
forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable Securities until such
Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by Section 5.1.4 or until it is advised in writing (the "ADVICE")
by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and has received
copies of any additional or supplemental filings which are incorporated by
reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by the Company, each Holder
will, or will request the Underwriter, if any, to, deliver to the Company (at
the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such
Holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities
current at the time of receipt of such notice. In the event the Company shall
give any such notice, the time periods mentioned in Sections 2.5 and 5.1.2 above
shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and including the
date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when each seller of
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement shall have
received copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by
Section 5.1.4 or of the Advice.

SECTION 5.3 ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF HOLDERS.

If any registration statement refers to any Holder by name or
otherwise as the holder of any securities of the Company, then such Holder shall
have the right to require (i) the insertion therein of language, in form and
substance satisfactory to such Holder, to the effect that the holding by such
Holder of such securities is not to be construed as a recommendation of such
holder of the investment quality of the Company's securities covered thereby and
that such holding does not imply that such holder will assist in meeting any
future financial requirements of the Company, or (ii) in the event that such
reference to such Holder by name or otherwise is not required by the Securities
Act or any similar federal statute then in force, the deletion of the reference
to such Holder. In addition, if requested by the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters of any registration or by the S&O Shareholders holding a majority
of the Registrable Securities included thereby in a registration, the Company
shall, subject to

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 18
<PAGE>

approval of counsel to the Company in its reasonable judgment, promptly
incorporate in a prospectus, supplement or post-effective amendment to the
registration statement such information concerning underwriters and the plan of
distribution of the Registrable Securities as such managing underwriter or
underwriters or such holders reasonably shall furnish to the Company in writing
and request be included therein, including, without limitation, with respect to
the number of Registrable Securities being sold by such holders to such
underwriter or underwriters, the purchase price being paid therefor by such
underwriter or underwriters and with respect to any other terms of the
underwritten offering of the Registerable Securities to be sold in such
offering; and make all required filings of such prospectus, supplement or
post-effective amendment as soon as possible after being notified of the matters
to be incorporated in such prospectus, supplement or post-effective amendment.
In addition, TJI shall cause the Company to, and the Company shall, permit any
holder of Registrable Securities, which holder, in the opinion of counsel to
such holder (which counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Company), might be
deemed to be an underwriter or controlling person of the Company, to be
consulted in connection with the preparation of such registration statement.

ARTICLE 6

SALE OF THE BUSINESS

SECTION 6.1 GENERAL.

If, on or before the third anniversary of the date hereof, the S&O
Shareholders have not sold 80% of the Registrable Securities (other than
Excluded Registrable Securities (as defined below)) held by them as a result of
a public sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to one or more registration
statements under the Act or as a result of a public sale under Rule 144, then
the S&O Shareholders shall have the right, after consulting with an investment
banker or other valuation expert who possesses a high degree of professional
skill and expertise in valuation matters and who is reasonably acceptable to TJI
(the "VALUATION EXPERT"), to establish the value ("VALUE") of the entire
business of the Partnership (or the Company, as the case may be) as a going
concern. For purposes of this Section 6.1 "EXCLUDED REGISTRABLE SECURITIES"
shall mean Registrable Securities which an S&O Shareholder failed to seek to
include in a prior Demand Registration or a prior Piggyback Registration (or
sought to include, but withdrew) and which such Registrable Securities, if
sought to be included in such Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration,
would have been included in such Registration.

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 19
<PAGE>

SECTION 6.2 RIGHT OF FIRST OPTION.

6.2.1 Upon establishing the Value, the S&O Shareholders shall
give TJI written notice thereof ("VALUATION NOTICE"). TJI shall have the
option to purchase all of the Partnership interests (or shares of stock in the
Company, as the case may be) held by the S&O Shareholders at a cash price equal
to the pro rata portion of the value represented by the Partnership interests
held by SealRite and Oldach or shares of stock in the Company held by the S&O
Shareholders, as the case may be, by notifying the S&O Shareholders of the
exercise of such option within 30 days after service of the Valuation Notice.
If TJI exercises its option, the closing of the purchase shall occur at a
mutually satisfactory time and place within 30 days from the date on which TJI
exercises its option. At the closing, the parties shall execute and deliver
such documents as may be reasonably requested by the other party to consummate
the sale and the price shall be paid by wire transfer. The S&O Shareholders
will represent and warrant authority to sell their Partnership interests or
shares of stock and free and clear title to their Partnership interests or
shares of stock, but will not be required to make any other representation or
warranty.

6.2.2 If TJI does not exercise its option under Section 6.2.1
within the 30 day time period, the S&O Shareholders shall have the right to
cause the entire Partnership or the Company to be sold (in a stock, asset or
other form of transaction) at a price (which price, in the event of an asset or
other transaction, shall be appropriately and equitable adjusted to give effect
to any tax consequences with respect to the form of such transaction as compared
to a stock transaction) equal to or greater than the Value. The S&O
Shareholders shall give TJI written notice of any offer which the S&O
Shareholders receive ("OFFER NOTICE") along with copies of all documents
received in connection therewith. If the offered purchase price in any such
offer is not payable entirely in cash, the Valuation Expert shall determine
whether the value of the offered purchase price is equal to or greater than the
Value. The decision of the Valuation Expert shall be conclusive and binding on
all of the parties.

6.2.3 If the offered purchase price is less than the Value,
TJI shall have the right, exercisable by serving written notice on the S&O
Shareholders within 15 days from the service of the Offer Notice by the S&O
Shareholders on TJI, to purchase the interests of the S&O Shareholders for cash
at the lower offered price in the manner set forth in Section 6.2.1.

6.2.4 If TJI does not exercise such right within such 15 day
time period, the S&O Shareholders shall have the right to cause the entire
Partnership or Company to be sold (in a stock, asset or other form of
transaction) at the offered price (which

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 20
<PAGE>

price, in the event of an asset or other transaction, shall be appropriately and
equitable adjusted to give effect to any tax consequences with respect to the
form of such transaction as compared to a stock transaction).

6.2.5 TJI shall cooperate with the S&O Shareholders and take
all necessary actions in connection with the sale of the Partnership or the
Company and shall execute and deliver all documents and perform all acts
reasonably required in connection therewith and shall cause Norco and its other
Affiliates to execute and deliver all such documents and perform all such acts.

6.2.6 The Partnership (or the Company, as the case may be)
shall bear all of the costs and expenses of the Valuation Expert and all other
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the S&O Shareholders in connection
with this Article 6, including reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees.

6.2.7 If the sale referred to in either Sections 6.2.2 or
6.2.3 (other than a sale to TJI) is not consummated within 180 days of the date
of the Offer Notice, the procedure set forth in Sections 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.2.3 and
6.2.4 shall be repeated.

ARTICLE 7

INDEMNIFICATION; CONTRIBUTION

SECTION 7.1 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY.

7.1.1 TJI covenants and agrees to cause the Company to
indemnify and hold harmless each Holder who holds Registrable Securities, its
officers, directors and each Person who controls such holder (within the meaning
of the Securities Act), and any Agent (as hereinafter defined) or investment
advisor thereof against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable costs of investigation) (collectively, "LIABILITIES")
arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material
fact contained in any registration statement, any amendment or supplement
thereto, any prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as any
such Liabilities arise out of or are based upon untrue statements or omissions
based upon information with respect to such indemnified person furnished in
writing to the Company by such indemnified person expressly for use therein.

7.1.2 In connection with an underwritten offering, TJI will
cause the Company to indemnify the underwriters thereof, their officers and
directors and each Person who controls such

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 21
<PAGE>

underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of Holders holding
Registrable Securities or to such other extent as the Company and the
underwriters may agree. For purposes of this Section 7.1, an "AGENT" of an
Holder holding Registrable Securities is any person (other than an Underwriter
or placement or sales agent) acting for or on behalf of such Holder with respect
to the holding or sale of such Registrable Securities.

SECTION 7.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY HOLDERS.

7.2.1 In connection with any registration statement in which
an Holder holding Registrable Securities is participating, each such Holder will
furnish to the Company in writing such information with respect to the name and
address of such Holder and the amount of Registrable Securities held by such
Holder and such other information as the Company shall reasonably request for
use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus, and agrees
to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors and
officers and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) against all Liabilities and expenses resulting from any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of material fact or any omission of a material fact
required to be stated in the registration statement, any amendment or supplement
thereto, any prospectus or preliminary prospectus or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that
such untrue statement or omission is based upon any information with respect to
such Holder so furnished in writing by such Holder specifically for inclusion in
any registration statement or prospectus.

7.2.2 In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder
hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received
by such Holder upon the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such
indemnification obligation.

SECTION 7.3 CONDUCT OF INDEMNIFICATION PROCEEDINGS.

7.3.1 Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder
("INDEMNIFIED PARTY") agrees to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying
party ("INDEMNIFYING PARTY") after the receipt by such Indemnified Party of
any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such Indemnified Party
will claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Agreement and,
unless in the written opinion of counsel for such Indemnified Party a conflict
of interest may exist between such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
with respect to such claim, shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the
defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party. It is agreed that the failure to give notice

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 22
<PAGE>

required by this paragraph shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its
obligation under this Section, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
has been materially prejudiced by such failure to provide such notice.

7.3.2 Whether or not such defense is assumed by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party will not be subject to liability for
any settlement made without its consent. No Indemnifying Party will consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or
litigation.

7.3.3 If the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to, or elects
not to, assume the defense of a claim, it will not be obligated to pay the fees
and expenses of more than one counsel with respect to such claim, unless in the
opinion of counsel for any Indemnified Party a conflict of interest may exist
between such Indemnified Party and any other of such Indemnified Parties with
respect to such claim, in which event the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated
to pay the fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels.

SECTION 7.4 CONTRIBUTION.

7.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in this Article 7
from the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder in
respect of any Liabilities, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying
such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such Liabilities in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such
Liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Parties shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, has been
made by, or relates to information supplied by such Indemnifying Party or
Indemnified Parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of any Liabilities referred to above shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3, any
legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection
with any investigation or proceeding.

7.4.2 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7.4 were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 23
<PAGE>

allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to in Section 7.4.1 above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7.4,
no selling Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the
amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities of the
selling Holder were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages
which such selling Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue statement or omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

7.4.3 The obligations of the Company pursuant to this Article
7 shall be further subject to such additional express agreements of the Company
as may be required to facilitate an underwritten offering; PROVIDED, that no
such agreement shall in any way limit the rights of Holders holding Registrable
Securities under this Agreement, or create additional obligations of such
Holders not set forth herein, except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing by
any such Holders.

7.4.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or
on behalf of the indemnified Person and will survive the transfer of the
Registrable Securities.

ARTICLE 8

This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns, and is not intended to confer
upon any other Person any right or remedies hereunder; PROVIDED, however, that

or indirectly (including, without limitation, as part of a group), at least 50%
of the Company's common stock (or has the right, directly or indirectly, to
appoint a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company), such obligations
and actions to be taken shall continue to constitute obligations of TJI to cause
the Company to meet such obligations and carry out such actions. TJI shall
cause any purchaser from TJI of at least 51% of the Company's common stock to
assume such obligations.

SECTION 8.7 ACTIONS BY S&O SHAREHOLDERS.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any decision required

set forth after his name on the signature page hereof.

remedy of this Agreement or

LIQUIDITY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 26
<PAGE>

the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall, to any extent, be

provision, covenant or remedy shall be construed in a manner so as to permit its
enforceability under the applicable law to the fullest extent permitted by law.
In any case, the remaining provisions of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance other than those to which they have been
held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and effect.
