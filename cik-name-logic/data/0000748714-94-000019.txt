Notes to Pro Forma Consolidated
Condensed Income Statements
(Unaudited)

The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed income
statement illustrates the estimated effect of the asset
exchange between NPC International, Inc. (the Company) and
Pizza Hut, Inc. and Pizza Hut of San Diego, Inc.
(collectively, PHI) and the asset purchase between the Company
and selling stockholder's (collectively stockholder's) and the
financing as if the transaction occurred for income statement
purposes at the beginning of the periods presented.

The condensed pro forma consolidated income statements
give effect to the acquisition under the purchase method of
accounting subject to the assumptions and adjustments detailed
in these notes.

(1) Represents the cumulative affect on income and
expenses of all assets exchanged and purchased for
the period presented.

(A) As a result of the asset exchange with PHI, the
Company's operating areas were consolidated and
therefore operating efficiencies were achieved. As
such, general and administrative expenses were
reduced by the anticipated dollar savings of the
consolidation net of amortization of certain
acquisition costs ($250,000 amortized over five
years).

(B) Interest was recorded based upon the estimated
increase in debt resulting from the transactions
using the interest rate of 6.44%, the Company's
effective borrowing rate for the fiscal year ended
March 29, 1994.

(C) Income taxes were adjusted to reflect the income tax
effect of the adjustments contained in the condensed
pro forma consolidated income statements using the
Company's statutory tax rate in effect during the
periods presented.

Notes to Pro Forma Consolidated
Condensed Balance Sheet
(Unaudited)

The unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed balance
sheet was prepared assuming the asset exchange with PHI and
asset purchase with selling stockholders was consummated at
the end of the period for which the balance sheet is
presented.

The condensed pro forma consolidated balance sheet gives
effect to the acquisition under the purchase method of
accounting subject to the assumptions and adjustments detailed
in these notes.

(1) The Company signed a definitive asset exchange
agreement with PHI on June 7, 1994, where at that
time the first phase of the transaction was
completed. At that time, the Company exchanged 39
restaurants for one PHI restaurant, and the Company
received a new Pizza Hut franchise agreement for all
operating areas effective March 30, 1994 through
2010. As such, the June 28, 1994, balances include
the reclassification of approximately $10,000,000 in
facilities and equipment to franchise rights.

(2) Represents the balance sheet impact of the asset
exchange between PHI and the Company.

(3) Represents the balance sheet impact of the asset
purchase from selling stockholders of 17 Pizza Hut
restaurants.

(A) Represents the cash differential of the value of the
Company's real estate as compared to that of PHI's
real estate, net of purchase price adjustments. All
cash received by the Company as a result of the
exchange is assumed to reduce corporate
indebtedness.

(B) Estimated costs associated with the PHI asset
exchange were accrued.

(C) Allocation of asset purchase price of $10,120,000 as
follows:
- $4,081,000 Facilities and equipment
- $5,989,000 Acquired franchise rights
- $ 50,000 Five year non-compete agreement

(c) Operation of the Restaurant Locations on or
prior to the date of Closing; and

(d) All liabilities of Sellers not expressly
assumed by Buyer hereunder including, but not limited to,
obligations arising with regard to Sellers' responsibilities
under the Franchise Agreements, assigned Leases, and Assumed
Contracts on or prior to the date of Closing.

Section 9.2 Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer agrees to
defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sellers against and in
respect of any and all loss, liability, lien, damage, costs

nonfulfillment of any covenant on the part of Buyer in
connection with this Agreement;

(b) Operation of the Restaurant Locations after the
date of Closing; and

(c) Obligations arising with regard to Buyer's

Section 9.3 Indemnification Procedure. Promptly but
in any event within ten (10) days after the receipt by an
indemnified party hereunder of notice of any action or the
making of any claim indemnifiable hereunder, such indemnified
party, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an
indemnifying party under this Article, shall notify the
indemnifying party of the assertion of the claim or the
commencement of the action, and the indemnifying party shall
thereafter assume the costs and liability of the defense of
such claim; provided, however, that the indemnified party
shall be entitled, to the extent it wishes and at its own
expense, to participate in the defense of the action. If
requested by either party, the other party hereby shall
provide reasonable assistance to the requesting party, with
reasonable expenses of such assistance to be paid by the
requesting party. If, however, the indemnifying party, after

breaches its obligation to defend the indemnified party, said
indemnified party shall be entitled to defend itself, and the
indemnifying party shall remain liable for breach of this
indemnity agreement including all costs associated therewith.

party's responsibility to indemnify the other pursuant to
Section 9.1 or 9.2 hereof shall be limited to the extent that
claims for indemnity must total Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars

reimbursement for such Claims from the other. Once the
$25,000 threshold is met, the Indemnified Party may seek
reimbursement for all additional indemnity Claims from the
Indemnifying Party for any dollar amount.
