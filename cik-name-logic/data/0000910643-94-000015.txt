and Brentwood Plaza from Western Southern Life Insurance Company.

Western Village Shopping Center is located in
Cincinnati, Ohio and consists of approximately 139,000 square
feet of gross leasable area on approximately 13.0 acres. Western
Village Shopping Center has space for 15 tenants and is currently
100% occupied. The major tenants are: Big Lots and Furrows
Hardware.

Brentwood Plaza is located in Cincinnati, Ohio and
consists of approximately 234,000 square feet of gross leasable
area on approximately 20 acres. Brentwood Plaza has space for 34
tenants and is currently 93.2% occupied. The major tenants are:
TJ Maxx, IGA Supermarket and a Hader Home Improvement Center.

On May 12, 1994 the Company acquired the Hamilton Plaza
Shopping Center from Hamilton Plaza Associates and the Albany
Plaza Shopping Center from AmberJack, Ltd.

Hamilton Plaza is located in Hamilton, New Jersey and
consists of approximately 149,000 square feet of gross leasable
area on approximately 18 acres. The center has space for eight
tenants and is currently 97% occupied. The major tenants are:
Kmart and Acme Supermarket.

Albany Plaza is located in Albany, Georgia and consists

Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Statements 
and Exhibits.

(a) and (b) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired 
and Pro Forma Financial Information.

The aggregate purchase price of the four acquired properties
described in Item 2 above (collectively, the "Properties") was
approximately $26,000,000, all of which was paid by the Company
in cash. The purchase price of the Properties individually
represent less than 10% of the total unaudited assets of the
Company.

However, because the Properties when added to prior
unaudited acquisitions exceeds 10% of the unaudited assets of the
Company, audited statements of revenues and certain operating
expenses relative to the Properties and pro forma condensed
financial information reflecting the acquisition of the
Properties will be filed under cover of Form 8-K/A as soon as
practicable, but not later than 60 days after this report on Form
8-K.

(c) Exhibits.

None.
