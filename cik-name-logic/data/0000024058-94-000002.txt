Item 5. Other Events.

Continental Bank Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Continental" or the "registrant"), and BankAmerica Corporation,
a Delaware corporation ("BankAmerica"), have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 27, 1994 (the
"Agreement"), pursuant to which Continental will be merged with and
into BankAmerica in a transaction in which BankAmerica will be the
surviving entity (such transaction, the "Merger").

As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of
common stock of Continental (the "Common Stock") will be converted
either all into common stock of BankAmerica or all into cash. To
the extent BankAmerica stock is received, the Merger is expected to
be tax free to the Continental shareholders, although such receipt
of stock could become taxable under certain circumstances.
However, it is a condition to the Merger closing that counsel to
Continental renders an opinion for Continental that the Merger
qualifies as a tax free reorganization under the Internal Revenue
Code, except for cash payments. Some of the basic terms of the
Merger are summarized below and in the joint press release issued
January 28, 1994 and attached hereto as Exhibit 99. The Agreement
itself is attached hereto as Exhibit 2, and this summary is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full Agreement.

The number of shares or fractions thereof of BankAmerica
common stock to be issued in the Merger is subject to adjustment,
pursuant to an exchange ratio contained in the Agreement. The
final exchange ratio will be based on the average of the closing
prices of BankAmerica common stock during the 10 consecutive days
on which shares of BankAmerica common stock are traded on the New
York Stock Exchange ending on the 10th calendar day immediately
prior to the anticipated effective time of the Merger (the "Final
BAC Stock Price"). Subject to the floor and ceiling on the Final
BAC Stock Price discussed below, each share of Common Stock is, at
the election of the holder, converted into either:

(i) BankAmerica common stock equal to .4158
plus the ratio of $18.375 to the Final
BAC Stock Price; or

(ii) cash equal to $18.375 plus the product
of .4158 and the Final BAC Stock Price;

except that, so long as the Final BAC Stock Price does not exceed
$55.84 per BankAmerica share and is not less than $36.16 per
BankAmerica share and so long as the number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock does not increase as a result of the exercise of
employee stock options outstanding at the date of the Agreement,
the amount of BankAmerica common shares to be issued in the Merger
will remain the same (approximately 21.25 million shares). Such
amount is herein referred to as the "Stock Amount." As of
January 26, 1994, there were 51,103,022 shares of Common Stock
outstanding, other than treasury shares.

If the Final BAC Stock Price is in excess of $55.84, then
the Stock Amount and the per share cash and stock consideration
will decline so that the amount to be received (whether all in
stock or all in cash) will be the same as if the Final BAC Stock
Price had been equal to $55.84. If the Final BAC Stock Price is
less than $36.16, Continental may terminate the Agreement unless:
(i) BankAmerica agrees to increase the number of common shares to
be issued and to increase the Stock Amount and to increase the per
share stock and cash consideration to be received in the Merger to
an amount equal to the amounts which would have been received by
the Continental common shareholders under the Agreement (whether
all in stock or all in cash) if the Final BAC Stock Price had been
equal to $36.16; and (ii) counsel to Continental renders an opinion
for Continental that the merger qualifies as a tax free
reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, except for cash
payments.

Continental shareholders may elect, at their option, to
receive cash in the Merger, or to receive BankAmerica common stock
in the Merger or to make no election under the Agreement. The per
share stock and cash amounts received per share of Common Stock
will be equal in value to each other based on valuing the
BankAmerica common stock at the Final BAC Stock Price. The
aggregate amount of cash to be paid to Continental shareholders is
fixed at approximately $939 million so long as the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock does not increase as a result of
the exercise of employee stock options outstanding at the date of
the Agreement. The Agreement provides for a random allocation
procedure (as determined by Continental and BankAmerica) in the
event of an oversubscription in respect of stock or cash.
Fractional shares will not be issued but the value of such shares
will be paid to the holders thereof in cash.

The Agreement also provides for the termination of the
Agreement by BankAmerica, in its sole discretion, during the 10
business day period beginning after the date of receipt by
BankAmerica of certain Continental disclosure schedules in form and
detail of presentation reasonably satisfactory to BankAmerica. In
addition, the disclosure schedule receipt date also begins a 30
calendar day period (10 business days of which overlap the sole
discretion termination period described in the preceding sentence)
during which period BankAmerica may terminate the Agreement if
BankAmerica identifies any circumstances which, in the reasonable
judgment of BankAmerica's Board of Directors (including a committee
thereof), acting in good faith and with due regard for principles
of fair dealing, could: (i) materially and adversely impact the
reasonably expected financial or business benefits to BankAmerica
of the Merger; (ii) be inconsistent in any material and adverse
respect with any of the representations and warranties of
Continental contained in the Agreement; (iii) materially and
adversely affect the business, operations, properties, financial
condition, results of operations or prospects of Continental and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; or (iv) deviate
materially and adversely from Continental's financial statements
for the year or quarter ended December 31, 1993. The timing of
such dates cannot be determined with certainty since the point-in-
time that satisfactory disclosure schedules will be received by
BankAmerica cannot presently be determined. In addition, under
certain circumstances BankAmerica or Continental may terminate the
Agreement, as specified therein.

In addition, each share of the Continental's Adjustable
Rate Preferred Stock, Series 1 and 2 (collectively, "Continental
Preferred Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger (excluding shares held by dissenting holders of
the Series 2 stock, if any, exercising appraisal rights) will be
converted, respectively, into one share of Adjustable Rate
Preferred Stock, Series 1 and 2, of BankAmerica the respective
terms of which will be essentially the same as the correlative
series of Continental Preferred Stock.

As a result of the Merger and upon effectiveness of the
Merger, all shares of Continental's Common Stock and Preferred
Stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, will not
be listed on any national securities exchange or quoted in any
inter-dealer quotation system, and will be eligible for termination
of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the holders of Continental's
Common and Preferred Stock will become stockholders of BankAmerica
to the extent they receive BankAmerica stock in the Merger.

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement, Continental has entered into a Stock Option
Agreement (the "Stock Option Agreement") with BankAmerica pursuant
to which Continental has granted to BankAmerica an option to
purchase up to 10,169,000 shares of the Common Stock at a price of
$37.50 per share. BankAmerica or any other holder or holders of
the stock option (collectively, the "Holder") may exercise the
stock option, in whole or in part, subject to regulatory approval,
at any time within 30 days (subject to extension as provided in the
Stock Option Agreement) after both an "Initial Triggering Event"
(as defined in the Stock Option Agreement) and a "Subsequent
Triggering Event" occurring prior to termination of the stock
option. "Subsequent Triggering Event" is defined as either: (A)
the acquisition by any person or group of beneficial ownership of
20% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock, or (B)
Continental or any Continental subsidiary, without BankAmerica's
prior written consent, entering into an agreement with any person
or group (other than BankAmerica or any BankAmerica subsidiary) to
engage in, or Continental's Board of Directors recommending that
Continental's stockholders approve or accept (other than as
contemplated by the Agreement), any (x) merger or consolidation, or
similar transaction, involving Continental or any significant
Continental subsidiary, (y) purchase, lease or other acquisition
representing 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Continental
or any significant Continental subsidiary, or (z) purchase or other
acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share
exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 20% or more of
the voting power of Continental or any significant Continental
subsidiary.

The Stock Option Agreement also provides that BankAmerica
has the right, in certain circumstances, to require Continental to
repurchase the option and any shares acquired by exercise of the
option, and that BankAmerica has the right to require Continental
to register the Common Stock acquired by or issuable upon exercise
of the option under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In
addition, if Continental enters into an alternative transaction
with a third party within 18 months after the termination of the
Agreement, it would be obligated under certain circumstances to pay
BankAmerica the greater of $60 million or 3% of the transaction's
value.

The closing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions, including the approval of the transaction by
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
and the obtaining of certain regulatory approvals. While the
precise time of the Merger closing cannot be determined with
certainty, the parties presently anticipate that (assuming the
normal approval process is not impeded) the closing will take place
in the third quarter of 1994.

In connection with the Agreement and the Stock Option
Agreement, Continental has amended its Rights Agreement, dated as
of July 22, 1991 (the "Rights Agreement"), between Continental and
Continental Bank, National Association, as Rights Agent (such
amendment, the "Rights Agreement Amendment"), to exempt the
Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby from the application of the Rights Agreement.

The Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement, the Rights
Agreement Amendment and the joint press release of BankAmerica and
Continental are attached as exhibits to this report and are
incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summaries of the
Merger Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement and the Rights
Agreement Amendment do not purport to be complete and are qualified
in their entirety by reference to such exhibits.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of January 27,
1994, between BANKAMERICA CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("BAC"), and
-----------------------
CONTINENTAL BANK CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Continental").
- ----------------------------
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
thereto in Article II.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, BAC and Continental are registered bank holding companies under
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"); and

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of BAC and Continental have concluded that
there would be substantial long-term benefits to both organizations and their
respective stockholders arising from a business combination resulting in a
strategic alliance between the equity owners of BAC and Continental, including
without limitation, the opening of important new geographic markets for both BAC
and Continental; and

WHEREAS, BAC believes that it would be advantageous to the future
operations of BAC and Continental that the headquarters of the United States
corporate banking division of BAC be located in the City of Chicago, State of
Illinois, following the business combination so that substantially all of the
administrative operations of such division as now conducted would be
headquartered in Chicago in combination with the similar operations of
Continental, and BAC intends to so relocate such operations of BAC after the
business combination; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to BAC's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Continental and BAC are entering into immediately after the
execution and delivery hereof a Stock Option Agreement dated as of the date
hereof (the "Stock Option Agreement") pursuant to which Continental shall grant
to BAC an option to purchase shares of the Common Stock, par value $4 per share,
of Continental (the "Continental Common Stock"); and

WHEREAS, BAC and Continental desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions hereby
contemplated and to prescribe various conditions thereto; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, BAC shall have the option to effect a business combination with
Continental by way of a merger of Continental with and into BAC, or by such
other means as are provided for herein (the "Merger"); and

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of BAC and Continental have
resolved that the transactions described herein are in the best interests of the
parties and their respective stockholders and have approved the transactions
described herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE III

MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

3.1 Conversion.
----------

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article III and of Article I, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, the shares of the Constituent Corporations shall be
converted as follows:

(i) Each of the shares of capital stock of BAC issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one
share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation;

(ii) Each share of Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock, Series 1, $50
stated value, of Continental ("Continental Series 1 Preferred Stock"),
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock, Series 1, $50 stated value,
of BAC ("BAC Series 1 Preferred Stock"). Each share of the Adjustable Rate
Preferred Stock, Series 2, $100 stated value, of Continental ("Continental
Series 2 Preferred Stock" and, together with Continental Series 1 Preferred
Stock, the "Continental Preferred Stock") outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except shares held by persons who demand appraisal in
compliance with all provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of such
holders to dissent from the Merger and demand appraisal of their shares
("Dissenting Series 2 Holders") but only if holders of such shares are then
entitled to so dissent and demand appraisal pursuant to the DGCL) shall be
converted into one share of Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock, Series 2, $100
stated value, of BAC ("BAC Series 2 Preferred Stock" and, together with BAC
Series 1 Preferred Stock, the "BAC Mirror Preferred Stock"). The BAC Series
1 Preferred Stock and BAC Series 2 Preferred Stock shall have the terms
substantially as set forth in the forms of Certificate of Designation,
Preferences and Rights attached hereto as Exhibits 3.1(a)(ii)-1 and
3.1(a)(ii)-2, respectively. All such shares of Continental Preferred
Stock, other than shares held by Dissenting Series 2 Holders (if such
holders are then entitled to dissent and demand appraisal as set forth
above), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously
representing any such shares of Continental Preferred Stock shall
thereafter represent the shares of BAC Series 1 Preferred Stock or BAC
Series 2 Preferred Stock, as the case may be, into which such Continental
Preferred Stock has been converted. Certificates previously representing
shares

-7-
<PAGE>

of Continental Preferred Stock shall be exchanged for certificates
representing whole shares of BAC Series 1 Preferred Stock or BAC Series 2
Preferred Stock to be issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender
of such certificates in accordance with Section 4.1. If holders of shares
of Continental Series 2 Preferred Stock are entitled to dissent from the
Merger and demand appraisal of their shares under the DGCL, any issued and
outstanding shares of Continental Series 2 Preferred Stock held by a
Dissenting Series 2 Holder shall not be converted as described in this
Section 3.1(a)(ii) but shall from and after the Effective Time represent
only the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
to such Dissenting Series 2 Holder pursuant to section 262 of the DGCL;

provided, however, that each share of Continental Series 2 Preferred Stock
-----------------
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
Dissenting Series 2 Holder who shall, after the Effective Time, withdraw
his or her demand for appraisal or lose his or her right of appraisal, in
either case pursuant to the DGCL, shall be deemed to be converted, as of
the Effective Time, into one share of BAC Series 2 Preferred Stock;

(iii) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.5, each share of
Continental Common Stock (including the related rights issued under the
Continental Rights Agreement) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time which under the terms of Section 3.2 is to be converted
into cash shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration (as defined in Section 3.2);

(iv) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.5, each share of
Continental Common Stock (including the related rights issued under the
Continental Rights Agreement) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time which under the terms of Section 3.2 is to be converted
into BAC Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration (as defined in Section 3.2);

(v) Each Continental Option outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.9; and

(vi) Each outstanding share of Continental Stock as to which a
written demand for appraisal is filed in accordance with section 262 of the
DGCL at or prior to the Stockholders' Meeting and not withdrawn at or prior
to the Stockholders' Meeting and which is not voted in favor of the Merger
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive BAC Common
Stock or cash hereunder unless and until the holder shall have failed to
perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to
appraisal of and payment for his or her Continental Common Stock under such
section 262, at which time his or her shares shall either be converted into
BAC Common Stock or cash as set forth in Section 3.1(a)(iii) or (iv) in
accordance with Section 3.7. All such shares of Continental Common Stock
as to which such a written demand for appraisal is so filed and not
withdrawn at or prior to the time of such vote and which are not voted in
favor of the Merger, except any such shares of Continental Common Stock the
holder of which, prior to the Effective Time, shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal of payment for his or her
shares of Continental Common Stock under such section 262 are herein called
"Dissenting Continental Stock." Continental shall give BAC prompt notice
upon receipt by Continental of any written demands for appraisal rights,
withdrawal of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
section 262 of the DGCL and Continental shall give BAC the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Continental shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal rights and shall not, except with the prior written
consent of BAC, settle or offer to settle any such demands. Each holder of
Continental Common Stock who becomes entitled, pursuant to provisions of
said section 262, to payment for his or her shares of Continental Common
Stock under the provisions of said section shall receive

-8-
<PAGE>

payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation and such shares of
Continental Common Stock shall be canceled.

(b) The calculations of the computations required by this Article III
shall be prepared by BAC prior to the Closing Date and shall be set forth in a
statement furnished to Continental showing in reasonable detail the manner of
calculation.

(c) Each of the shares of Continental capital stock held by BAC or any of
its wholly owned Subsidiaries or Continental or any of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries, other than shares held by BAC or any of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries or Continental or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries in a
fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted, shall be
canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued
in exchange therefor.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Continental Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of BAC Common
Stock (after taking into account all certificates delivered by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of BAC Common Stock multiplied by the Market
Price of one share of BAC Common Stock at the close of business on the trading
day next preceding the Closing Date. No such holder will be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights as a stockholder in respect of any
fractional share.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Continental shall
be closed as to holders of Continental capital stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and no transfer of Continental capital stock by any such holder
shall thereafter be made or recognized. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates are properly presented in accordance with Article IV of this
Agreement to the exchange agent, Chemical Trust Company of California (the
"Exchange Agent"), such certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for
certificates representing the number of whole shares of BAC or BAC Mirror
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and a check representing the amount of
cash, if any, into which the Continental capital stock represented thereby was
converted in the Merger. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding,
neither BAC, Continental, the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to a holder of Continental capital stock for any amount paid or
property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat, or similar law.

3.2 Conversion of Continental Common Stock. Subject to Sections 3.4 and
--------------------------------------
3.5, each share of Continental Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder
thereof as provided in Section 3.3, either:

(i) a number of shares of BAC Common Stock equal to the sum of (A)
.4158 and (B) the ratio of $18.375 to the Final BAC Stock Price (such sum,
the "Per Share Stock Consideration"), or

(ii) cash equal to the sum of (A) $18.375 and (B) the product of
.4158 and the Final BAC Stock Price (such sum, the "Per Share Cash
Consideration");

provided that, subject to Section 3.4, the aggregate number of shares of BAC
Common Stock that shall be issued in the Merger (the "Stock Amount") shall equal
the number obtained by multiplying (x) 0.8152 and (y) 51% of the total number of
shares of Continental Common Stock outstanding (other than treasury shares) at
the Determination Date.

3.3 Election Procedures. An election form and other appropriate and
-------------------
customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing shares of Continental Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as BAC and
Continental shall mutually agree ("Election Form") shall be mailed twenty-five
days prior to the anticipated Effective Date or on such other date as
Continental and BAC shall mutually agree

-9-
<PAGE>

("Mailing Date") to each holder of record of Continental Common Stock as of five
business days prior to the Mailing Date ("Election Form Record Date").

Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through
appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to elect to receive
only BAC Common Stock with respect to such holder's Continental Common Stock
("Stock Election Shares"), to elect to receive only cash with respect to such
holder's Continental Common Stock ("Cash Election Shares") or to indicate that
such holder makes no election ("No Election Shares").

Any Continental Common Stock with respect to which the holder (or the
beneficial owner, as the case may be) shall not have submitted to the Exchange
Agent, an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., on
the 20th day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as BAC and
Continental may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline") shall also be deemed
to be "No Election Shares."

BAC shall make available one or more Election Forms as may be reasonably
requested by all persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of
Continental Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and close of
business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and Continental
shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it
to perform as specified herein.

Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election
Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of Continental
Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form at or prior to
the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the
Election Deadline, the shares of Continental Common Stock represented by such
Election Form shall become No Election Shares and BAC shall cause the
certificates representing Continental Common Stock to be promptly returned
without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form upon written request
to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of BAC regarding such matters shall
be binding and conclusive. Neither BAC nor the Exchange Agent shall be under
any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Form.

Within five business days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective
Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as practicable, BAC
shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of
Continental Common Stock of rights to receive BAC Common Stock or cash in the
Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

(i) Stock Elections Less Than Stock Amount. If the number of shares
--------------------------------------
of BAC Common Stock that would be issued upon conversion in the Merger of
the Stock Election Shares is less than the Stock Amount, then:

(A) all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive BAC Common Stock,

(B) the Exchange Agent shall select first from among the holders
of No Election Shares and then (if necessary) from among holders of
Cash Election Shares, by random selection (as described below), a
sufficient number of such holders ("Stock Designees") such that the
number of shares of BAC Common Stock that will be issued in the Merger
equals as closely as practicable the Stock Amount, and all shares

-10-
<PAGE>

held by the Stock Designees shall be converted into the right to
receive BAC Common Stock, provided that no particular holder of Cash
Election Shares shall be deemed to be a Stock Designee if such
designation would prevent the satisfaction of any of the conditions
set forth in Article IX, and

(C) the Cash Election Shares and the No Election Shares not held
by Stock Designees shall be converted into the right to receive cash;
or

(ii) Stock Elections More Than Stock Amount. If the number of shares
--------------------------------------
of BAC Common Stock that would be issued upon the conversion into BAC
Common Stock of the Stock Election Shares is greater than the Stock Amount,
then:

(A) all Cash Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive cash,

(B) the Exchange Agent shall select from among the holders of
Stock Election Shares (other than restricted shares), by random
selection (as described below), a sufficient number of such holders
("Cash Designees") such that the number of shares of BAC Common Stock
that will be issued in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the
Stock Amount, and all shares held by the Cash Designees shall be
converted into the right to receive cash, provided that no particular
holder of Stock Election Shares shall be deemed to be a Cash Designee
if such designation would prevent the satisfaction of any of the
conditions set forth in Article IX, and

(C) the Stock Election shares not held by Cash Designees shall
be converted into the right to receive BAC Common Stock; or

(iii) Stock Elections Equal to Stock Amount. If the number of shares
-------------------------------------
of BAC Common Stock that would be issued upon conversion into BAC Common
Stock of the Stock Election Shares is equal or nearly equal (as determined
by the Exchange Agent) to the Stock Amount, then subparagraphs (i) and (ii)
above and subparagraph (iv) below shall not apply and all Stock Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive BAC Common Stock and
all Cash Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive cash; or

(iv) Stock Elections and No Elections Equal to Stock Amount. If the
------------------------------------------------------
number of shares of BAC Common Stock that would be issued upon the
conversion into BAC Common Stock of the Stock Election Shares and No
Election Shares would equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange
Agent) the Stock Amount, then subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall
not apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive cash and all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive BAC Common Stock.

The random selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist
of such processes as shall be mutually determined by BAC and Continental.

3.4 Continental Termination Right; BAC Adjustment Right; Cap on Final BAC
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stock Price for Calculation of Per Share Stock and Cash Consideration.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) Continental Termination Right. Continental shall have the right to
-----------------------------
elect to abandon the Merger and terminate this Agreement, if its Board of
Directors so determines, following the Determination Date but prior to the
Effective Time if the Final BAC Stock Price shall be less than $36.16 (the
"Floor Price") subject, however, to the following subparagraph (b).

-11-
<PAGE>

(b) BAC Adjustment Right. If Continental makes an election to abandon the
--------------------
Merger under subparagraph (a) above, it shall give prompt written notice thereof
to BAC, provided that such notice may be withdrawn by Continental at any time
prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the Effective
Time. If Continental shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to subparagraph (a) above but shall not have done so, or at any time within five
days of Continental's having done so, BAC shall have the right but not the
obligation to elect to increase the Stock Amount and the per share value of the
cash and BAC Common Stock which would be delivered to the holders of the
Continental Common Stock such that (A) the per share value of the cash and BAC
Common Stock consideration (valued in the case of the BAC Common Stock at the
Final BAC Stock Price) is at least equal to the per share consideration that
would have been received if the Final BAC Stock Price had been equal to the
Floor Price and (B) in the opinion of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz the Merger
qualifies as a reorganization under section 368 of the Code, except for cash
payments (including cash in lieu of fractional shares), no gain or loss will be
recognized by any holder of Continental Common Stock upon conversion of such
stock into BAC Common Stock in the Merger, and the basis of such BAC Common
Stock will be the same as such holder's basis in the Continental Common Stock
exchanged therefor. If BAC elects to make the above-described adjustment within
such period, it shall give prompt written notice to Continental thereof (and the
Effective Time shall in such case be the fifth day following such election by
BAC) and of the increase in the cash and BAC Common Stock which will be
delivered to holders of Continental Common Stock and the per-share values
thereof, whereupon no abandonment or termination shall be deemed to have
occurred and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms
(except as the Per Share Cash Consideration, the Per Share Stock Consideration
and the Stock Amount shall have been so increased). If Continental shall not
have made the election to abandon the Merger under subparagraph (a) above and if
BAC shall not have elected to increase the Stock Amount and make the other
adjustments contemplated by the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (b),
then BAC, in its sole discretion, may elect to change the method of effecting
the business combination with Continental (including without limitation the
provisions as set forth in Article III and Article IV) if and to the extent that
it deems such a change to be desirable, including, without limitation, to
provide for (i) a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of BAC ("Merger
Corporation") with and into Continental, in which Continental is the surviving
corporation, (ii) a merger of Continental with and into Merger Corporation in
which Merger Corporation is the surviving corporation, or (iii) a sale of all
the assets of Continental, BAC or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however,
-----------------
that no such change shall alter or change the amount or the kind of the Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of Continental Common Stock or
Continental Preferred Stock, as provided for in this Agreement or shall
materially delay or impede satisfaction of the conditions (other than Section
9.2(e)) in Article IX.

(c) Cap on Final BAC Stock Price for Calculation of Per Share Stock and
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Cash Consideration. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in
- ------------------
the event that the Final BAC Stock Price shall be more than $55.84 (the "Ceiling
Price"), the Per Share Cash Consideration, the Per Share Stock Consideration and
the Stock Amount which would otherwise result from the application of the
provisions of Section 3.2 shall be deemed to be decreased appropriately so that
the per-share cash and stock consideration that will be receivable by the
holders of the Continental Common Stock shall be the same as if the Final BAC
Stock Price were equal to the Ceiling Price.

3.5 Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters. If prior to the Effective
------------------------------------------
Time, (i) Continental shall declare a stock dividend or distribution upon or
subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine the Continental Common Stock, or
declare a dividend, or make a distribution, on the Continental Common Stock in
any security convertible into Continental Common Stock (provided that no such
action may be taken by Continental without BAC's prior written consent as so
provided in Article VII), or (ii) BAC shall declare a stock dividend or
distribution upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine the BAC Common
Stock or declare a dividend, or make a distribution, on the BAC Common Stock in
any security convertible into BAC Common Stock, appropriate adjustment or
adjustments will be made to the Per Share Cash Consideration, the Per Share
Stock Consideration and the Stock Amount. If at the Effective Time, Continental
shall have outstanding more shares of Continental Common

-12-
<PAGE>

Stock than are contemplated to be outstanding or subject to option by the
representation and warranty in Section 5.2(a), then, at BAC's election and
notwithstanding other provisions hereof, and without limiting any of its other
rights hereunder, (i) the Stock Amount shall be adjusted so as to deduct from
the reference in the calculation of the Stock Amount to the total number of
shares of Continental Common Stock outstanding at the Determination Date that
number of additional shares of Continental Common Stock which are outstanding
over the amount contemplated by the representation and warranty in Section
5.2(a), and (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock
Consideration shall be adjusted downward to the number that would result in an
aggregate Merger Consideration equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration that
would have resulted if such representation and warranty had been strictly
complied with at the Effective Time.

3.6 Illustrative Cases. Appendix A hereto illustrates, among other
------------------
things, the value to be received per share of Continental Common Stock, whether
in cash or in BAC Common Stock, at varying Final BAC Stock Prices, as well as
the resulting exchange ratios (assuming that the adjustment contemplated by
Section 3.4(b) above is made in certain cases and assuming that the cap
contemplated by Section 3.4(c) above shall be operative in a given case).

3.7 Conversion of Dissenting Continental Stock. If prior to the Effective
------------------------------------------
Time any stockholder of Continental shall fail to perfect, or shall effectively

ARTICLE IV

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

4.1 Exchange Procedures. Upon the latest to occur of the Effective Time
-------------------
and the completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 3.3, BAC
shall issue to the Exchange Agent the number of shares of BAC Common Stock and
the BAC Mirror Preferred Stock issuable in the Merger and the amount of cash
payable in the Merger; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other
-----------------
provision of this Agreement, BAC shall not issue to the Exchange Agent BAC
Common Stock, BAC Mirror Preferred Stock or cash payable with respect to shares
of Continental Common Stock or Continental Preferred Stock unless and until
share certificates and the required transmittal materials pursuant to Article
III and Article IV have been received in proper form by the Exchange Agent. The
Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership
with respect to BAC Common Stock and BAC Mirror Preferred Stock held by it from
time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or
other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the
account of the persons entitled thereto.

Promptly after the Effective Time, BAC and Continental shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates theretofore representing shares of Continental Preferred Stock
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange
Agent) to the former holders of Continental Preferred Stock. After completion
of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 3.3, each holder of a
certificate formerly representing Continental Common Stock or Continental
Preferred Stock who surrenders or has surrendered such certificate (or customary
affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
certificate), together with duly executed transmittal materials included in the
Election Form, to the Exchange Agent shall, upon acceptance thereof, be entitled
to a certificate

-13-
<PAGE>

representing the BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror Preferred Stock or cash into
which the shares of Continental capital stock shall have been converted pursuant
hereto. BAC shall cause the Exchange Agent to accept such certificate upon
compliance with such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.1,
each certificate representing Continental capital stock shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration.

To the extent provided by Section 3.1(d) of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Continental Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
also shall receive, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of BAC Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. BAC shall not be
obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former holder of Continental
capital stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders
his certificate or certificates representing shares of Continental capital stock
for exchange as provided in this Article IV. In addition, certificates
surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an "affiliate" of
Continental for purposes of Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), shall not be exchanged for certificates
representing whole shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror Preferred Stock
until BAC has received a written agreement from such person as provided in
Section 8.18. If any certificate for shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror
Preferred Stock, or any check representing cash and/or declared but unpaid
dividends, is to be issued in a name other than that in which a certificate
surrendered for exchange is issued, the certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such exchange shall affix any requisite stock transfer tax stamps to
the certificate surrendered or provide funds for their purchase or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes are not payable.

4.2 Voting and Dividends. Former stockholders of record of Continental
--------------------
shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of BAC
stockholders the number of whole shares of BAC Common Stock into which their
respective shares of Continental Common Stock are converted, regardless of
whether such holders have exchanged their certificates representing Continental
Common Stock for certificates representing BAC Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance
with the provisions of Section 4.1 of this Agreement, each certificate
theretofore representing shares of Continental capital stock (other than shares
to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) of this Agreement) shall from and
after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive
shares of BAC Common Stock and BAC Mirror Preferred Stock, and/or cash, as set
forth in this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
after the Effective Time with respect to BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror
Preferred Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered certificate of Continental capital stock with
respect to the shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror Preferred Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.1(d) until the holder of such
certificate of Continental capital stock shall surrender such certificate.
Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
certificate of Continental capital stock, there shall be paid to the holder of
the certificates representing whole shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror
Preferred Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount of
any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of BAC Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(d) and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror
Preferred Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror Preferred Stock.

4.3 No Liability. Neither BAC nor Continental shall be liable to any
------------
holder of shares of Continental Common Stock or Continental Preferred Stock for
any such shares of BAC

-14-
<PAGE>

Common Stock or BAC Mirror Preferred Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

4.4 Withholding Rights. BAC or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
------------------
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Continental Common Stock or Continental
Preferred Stock such amounts as BAC or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by BAC or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Continental Common Stock or Continental Preferred Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by BAC or the Exchange Agent.

in the ordinary course of Plan administration for which Plan administrative
review procedures have not been exhausted) are pending, threatened or
imminent against or with respect to the Plan, any employer who is

(a) At the Effective Time, all rights with respect to Continental Common
Stock pursuant to the Continental Options, except stock appreciation rights
granted under Continental's 1991 Performance Unit Plan (the "Continental 1991
Plan"), which are outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable, shall be converted into and become rights with respect to BAC
Common Stock, and BAC shall assume each such Continental Option, in accordance
with the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. From and after the
Effective Time, (i) each such Continental Option assumed by BAC may be exercised
solely for shares of BAC Common Stock, or cash to the extent permitted for stock
appreciation rights, (ii) the number of shares of BAC Common Stock subject to
each such Continental Option shall be equal to the number of shares of
Continental Common Stock subject to such Continental Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share Stock Consideration and (iii) the
per share exercise price under each such Continental Option shall be adjusted by
dividing the per share exercise price under each such option by the Per Share
Stock Consideration and rounding down to the nearest cent; provided, however,
that the terms of each such Continental Option shall, in accordance with its
terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction subsequent
to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, no Continental Option may be
exercised for fractional shares. It is intended that the foregoing assumption
shall be undertaken in a manner that will not constitute a "modification," as
defined in section 425 of the Code, as to any stock option which is an
"incentive stock option," as defined in section 422 of the Code. At the
Effective Time, all rights with respect to Continental Common Stock pursuant to
stock appreciation rights granted by Continental under the Continental 1991
Plan, which are outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable, shall be settled for cash provided that the amount payable for each
stock appreciation right granted in March 1991 shall not exceed $2.62 and the
amount payable for each stock appreciation right granted in May 1991 shall not
exceed $0.435.

(b) All restrictions or limitations on transfer with respect to
Continental Common Stock awarded under a Continental Stock Plan or any other
plan, program or arrangement ("Restricted Stock"), to the extent that such
restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed, shall remain in full
force and effect with respect to the BAC Common Stock into which such Restricted
Stock is converted pursuant to Article III.

(c) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties,
(i) the provisions of the Continental Stock Plans and any other plan, program or
arrangement pursuant to which Continental may, or may be required to, issue
Continental Common Stock or compensation based on Continental Common Stock,
shall be amended or deleted as of the Effective Time, and (ii) Continental shall
ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of Continental Options or any
participant in any Continental Stock Plan shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any equity securities of Continental or any of its Subsidiaries.

8.10 Certain Change of Control Matters.
---------------------------------

(a) From and after the date hereof, as generally or specifically
designated in writing by BAC, Continental shall take all action necessary to the
extent permitted under any Plan so that the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement and the

-37-
<PAGE>

consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will not (i) result in any
payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation,
golden parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any employees under any Plan or
otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Plan or (iii)
result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits; provided, however, that to the extent Continental has entered into
agreements with respect to stock option awards or stock appreciation rights
which provide for acceleration of vesting upon a change in control, or with
respect to the termination agreements referenced in Section 8.20 of this
Agreement, such agreements may remain in effect notwithstanding this section of
the Agreement. Any action taken by Continental pursuant to this Section 8.10
shall not constitute a failure of condition to the obligations of BAC hereunder
or give rise to any right of termination on the part of BAC hereunder.

(b) Each of BAC and Continental shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock
Option Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability
of, any applicable State Takeover Law.

8.11 Termination Payment and Other Matters. If this Agreement is
-------------------------------------
terminated pursuant to its terms other than by BAC pursuant to Section 10.2, or
other than by either party pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or other than by
Continental pursuant to Section 10.1(d), and an Acquisition Event shall occur
after the date hereof and within 18 months after the date of such termination,
Continental shall pay promptly, but in no event later than two business days
after the occurrence of such Acquisition Event, by wire transfer of immediately
available Federal Funds to such account as BAC shall designate, the greater of
(i) $60 million and (ii) if applicable, an amount equal to the sum of (A) BAC's
out-of-pocket expenses (and the allocated cost of its in-house legal and
accounting departments) in connection with the transactions hereby contemplated
and (B) 3% of the Aggregate Value of the Acquisition Event (less, however, any
payments received by BAC as a result of section 2.1 of that certain Agreement
dated January 20, 1994 between BAC and Continental or as a result of this
Section 8.11). For purposes of this subsection, the "Aggregate Value" of the
Acquisition Event shall be the sum of (a) the product of (1) the average
consideration paid per share of Continental Common Stock and (2) the sum of (a)
the number of such shares outstanding plus (b) the number of such shares
issuable upon exercise of options, warrants or other rights for conversion or
exchange of securities at exercise, conversion or exchange prices per share
lower than the consideration described in (1) above; (b) the product of (1) the
average consideration paid (other than pursuant to clause (c) of this section)
per share of non-convertible preferred stock of Continental and (2) the number
of such shares outstanding; (c) the value of any preferred stock of Continental
assumed or any preferred or common stock redeemed or repurchased in the
transactions involving the Acquisition Event; and (d) the value of any
consideration received by Continental in exchange for any shares of its capital
stock or other securities. For purposes of this subsection, the term
"Acquisition Event" shall mean any of the following: (i) any Person (other than
BAC or any Subsidiary thereof) shall have acquired pursuant to a tender offer or
otherwise beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
Continental Common Stock; (ii) Continental or CB shall have authorized,
recommended, proposed or publicly announced an intention to authorize, recommend
or propose, or entered into, an agreement with any Person (other than BAC or a
Subsidiary thereof) to (A) effect a merger, consolidation or similar transaction
involving Continental or CB, (B) sell, lease or otherwise dispose of assets of
Continental or its Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the consolidated
assets of Continental and its Subsidiaries, or (C) issue, sell or otherwise
dispose of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any
similar transaction) securities representing 20% or more of the voting power of
Continental or any Subsidiaries thereof.

8.12 Letter of Continental's Accountants. Continental shall use all
-----------------------------------
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to BAC letters of Price Waterhouse,
Continental's independent auditors, dated a date within two business days before
the date on which the S-4 shall become effective and two business days before
the Closing Date and addressed to BAC, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to BAC, and in scope and substance consistent with applicable
professional standards for letters delivered by independent public accountants
in connection with registration statements similar to the S-4.

-38-
<PAGE>

8.13 Letter of BAC's Accountants. BAC shall use all reasonable efforts to
---------------------------
cause to be delivered to Continental letters of Ernst & Young, BAC's independent
auditors, dated a date within two business days before the date on which the S-4
shall become effective and two business days before the Closing Date and
addressed to Continental, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Continental, and in scope and substance consistent with applicable professional
standards for letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the S-4.

8.14 Advice of Changes; Government Filings. Each party shall confer on a
-------------------------------------
regular and frequent basis with the other, report on operational matters and
promptly advise the other orally and in writing of any change or event
(including, without limitation, knowledge of any circumstance involving a
potential unasserted claim) having, or which, insofar as can reasonably be
foreseen, could have, a Material Adverse Effect on such party or which would
cause or constitute a material breach of any of the representations, warranties
or covenants of such party contained herein. BAC and Continental shall file all
reports required to be filed by each of them with the SEC between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time and shall deliver to the other party
copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed (other than reports
filed under section 13(d) or 13(g) of the Exchange Act). BAC, Continental, each
Subsidiary of Continental that is a bank and Bank of America National Trust and
Savings Association ("BofA") shall file all Call Reports with the appropriate
Bank Regulators and all other reports required to be filed with the Federal
Reserve Board between the date hereof and the Effective Time and shall make
available to the other party copies of all such reports promptly after the same
are filed. Except where prohibited by applicable statutes and regulations, each
party shall promptly provide the other (or its counsel) with copies of all other
filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

8.15 Accounting Methods. Continental shall not change its methods of
------------------
accounting in effect at December 31, 1993, except as required by changes in GAAP
as concurred in by its independent auditors. Continental shall not change its
fiscal year.

8.16 Coordination of Dividends. Each of BAC and Continental shall
-------------------------
coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of BAC
Common Stock and Continental Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates
relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that holders of BAC
Common Stock or Continental Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or
fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to
their shares of BAC Common Stock and/or Continental Common Stock and any shares
of BAC Common Stock any such holder received in exchange therefor in the Merger.

8.17 Continental Accruals and Reserves. Prior to the Closing Date,
---------------------------------
Continental shall review and, to the extent determined necessary or advisable,
consistent with GAAP and the accounting rules, regulations and interpretations
of the SEC and its staff, modify and change its loan, accrual and reserve
policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves
and accruals and reserves to (i) reflect the Surviving Corporation's plans with
respect to the conduct of Continental's business following the Merger and (ii)
make adequate provision for the costs and expenses relating thereto) so as to be
applied consistently on a mutually satisfactory basis with those of BAC. Prior
to the Closing, Continental also will adjust loan loss and OREO reserves as may
be appropriate, consistent with GAAP and the accounting rules, regulations and
interpretations of the SEC and its staff, in light of the then anticipated
post-Closing disposition of certain Continental assets. The parties agree to
cooperate in preparing for the implementation of the adjustments contemplated by
this Section 8.17. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Continental shall not be
obligated to take in any respect any such action pursuant to this Section 8.17
(other than pursuant to the preceding sentence) unless and until BAC
acknowledges that all conditions to its obligations to consummate the Merger
have been satisfied.

8.18 Affiliates. At least 40 days prior to the Closing Date, Continental
----------
shall deliver to BAC a letter identifying all persons who are, at the time this
Agreement is submitted for approval to the stockholders of Continental,
"affiliates" of Continental for purposes of Rule 145

-39-
<PAGE>

under the Securities Act. Continental shall use all reasonable efforts to cause
each person named in the letter delivered by it to deliver to BAC prior to the
Closing Date a written "Affiliates" agreement, in customary form, providing that
such person shall dispose of the BAC Common Stock and BAC Mirror Preferred Stock
to be received by such person in the Merger only in accordance with applicable
law and, in addition, in such agreement, such Affiliate shall represent that
they have no present plan or intention to dispose of any such shares of BAC
capital stock.

8.19 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time
---------------------
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either BAC
or Continental, the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement shall take all such necessary or appropriate action.

8.20 Modification of Continental Options. BAC agrees that Continental
-----------------------------------
Options held by each Continental employee who is a party to a termination
agreement with Continental (not more than seven individuals) may be modified
before the Effective Time to provide that such employees may exercise such
Continental Options, to the extent vested as of the Effective Time, within one
year following a termination of employment entitling such employees to
termination benefits under such agreements.

8.21 BAC Severance Benefits. BAC shall adopt, effective as of the
----------------------
Effective Time, a severance program for Continental employees which is similar
in all material respects to BAC's Merger Transition Program and U.S. Senior
Management Transition Program (which are described in the previously used
brochures attached hereto as Exhibit 8.21) with respect to severance pay and
stock treatment and similar in all material respects to BAC's Employee
Transition Program (as described in the current brochure attached hereto as
Exhibit 8.21) with respect to all other benefits. BAC shall maintain such
severance program in effect for not less than 12 months following the Effective
Time; provided that benefits under such program may be modified or eliminated
earlier if they are of little financial consequence to recipients. Such
severance program shall not apply to Continental employees who are party to
termination agreements with Continental.

8.22 Continental Benefit Plans. Continental employee benefit plans will
-------------------------
remain in effect temporarily after the Effective Time. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Continental employee benefit plans will be
discontinued or merged into BAC plans and employees of Continental shall become
eligible for the employee benefit plans of BAC on the same terms as such plans
and benefits are generally offered from time to time to employees of BofA in
comparable positions with BofA. Such employees shall be credited for the years
of service with Continental and its affiliates under the employee benefit plans
to be provided by BAC to such employees, to the same extent such service was
recognized for similar plans of Continental. However, with respect to any
pension benefit plan of BAC, such service will be counted only for purposes of
vesting, eligibility for participation and early retirement and the rate of
prospective benefit accrual. Following the Effective Time, BAC shall have the
same legal rights and legal obligations, which it shall honor, subject to the
terms thereof, as Continental arising under all employment, severance and other
compensation contracts disclosed in the Continental Disclosure Schedule,
including without limitation the obligations arising under the termination
agreements with the seven individuals referred to in Section 8.20.

8.23 Continental Internal Audit Function; Peer Review. As soon as
------------------------------------------------
practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than 90
days after such date, Continental shall cause to be completed (and a written
report thereon furnished to BAC) a peer review with respect to the internal
audit function of Continental (which function has been outsourced to
Continental's independent accounting firm). Such peer review shall be conducted
in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Institute of Internal
Auditors.

8.24 Continental Dividend Reinvestment Plan. As soon as practicable after
--------------------------------------
the date hereof, Continental shall terminate its dividend reinvestment plan.

(d) By Continental (if it is not in material breach of any of its
obligations hereunder) pursuant to notice in the event of (A) a breach or

outstanding shares of Continental Common Stock.

10.2 Special BAC Rights of Termination. Continental shall deliver to BAC
---------------------------------
all remaining portions of the Continental Disclosure Schedule not heretofore
delivered to BAC as promptly as practicable after the date hereof.
Notwithstanding any investigation made by or information known to BAC prior to
the date hereof and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, and in
recognition of the fact that BAC, as of the date hereof, has not had an
opportunity to complete its due diligence review of Continental and that
Continental has not, as of the date hereof, delivered to BAC all portions of the
Continental Disclosure Schedule, in addition to the termination rights set forth
in Section 10.1, BAC shall have the following rights (the "Special Termination
Rights"): (i) for 10 business days after the date of receipt by BAC of all such
remaining portions of the Continental Disclosure Schedule in form and detail of
presentation reasonably satisfactory to BAC, to terminate this Agreement in its
sole discretion; and (ii) at any time after the date of this Agreement through
and including the date that is 30 days after the date Continental delivers to
BAC all remaining portions of the Continental Disclosure Schedule in form and
detail of presentation reasonably satisfactory to BAC, to terminate this
Agreement if BAC shall identify any circumstance which, in the reasonable
business judgment of the Board of Directors (which includes a committee thereof)
of BAC, acting in good faith and with due regard for principles of fair dealing,
could (w) materially and adversely impact the reasonably expected financial or
business benefits to BAC of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (x)
be inconsistent in any material and adverse respect with any of the
representations and warranties of Continental contained in this Agreement, (y)

---------
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time

GENERAL PROVISIONS

11.1 Expenses. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing or as
--------
otherwise provided herein, each party hereto shall bear its own expenses
incident to preparing, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and to

11.2 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and
----------------
except for that certain Agreement dated January 20, 1994 between BAC and

-46-
<PAGE>

Continental, this Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement contain the entire
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereunder and thereunder, and such agreements supersede all prior
arrangements or understandings with respect thereto, written or oral. The terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors. Other than Sections
8.8, 8.20, 8.21 and 8.22, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any individual, corporation or other entity, other than
BAC, Continental, Merger Corporation or their respective successors, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

11.3 Amendments. To the extent permitted by law, this Agreement may be
----------
amended by a subsequent writing signed by each of BAC and Continental, provided,
---------
however, that the provisions hereof relating to the manner or basis in which
- -------
shares of Continental capital stock will be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration shall not be amended after the Stockholders' Meeting without any
requisite approval of the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of
Continental capital stock entitled to vote thereon.

11.4 Waivers. Prior to or at the Effective Time, each of BAC and
-------
Continental shall have the right to waive any default in the performance of any
term of this Agreement by the other, to waive or extend the time for the
compliance or fulfillment by the other of any and all of the other's obligations
under this Agreement and to waive any or all of the conditions precedent to its
obligations under this Agreement, except any condition which, if not satisfied,
would result in the violation of any law or applicable governmental regulation.
No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising any right, remedy or power
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy or power provided
herein or by law or in equity. The waiver by any party of the time for
performance of any act or condition hereunder does not constitute a waiver of
the act or condition itself.

11.5 No Assignment. Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its
-------------
rights or delegate any of its obligations (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) under this Agreement to any other person or entity. Any such
purported assignment or delegation that is made without the prior written
consent of the other parties to this Agreement shall be void and of no effect.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.5, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

11.6 Notices. All notices or other communications which are required or
-------
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by overnight

11.7 Specific Performance. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
--------------------
the failure of Continental to fulfill any of its covenants and agreements
hereunder, including the failure to take all such actions as are necessary on
its part to cause the consummation of the Merger, will cause irreparable injury
to BAC for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, Continental hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by
any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of Continental's
obligations and to the granting by any such court of the remedy of the specific
performance by Continental of its obligations hereunder.

11.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by

-----------------------
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and the

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement,
and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or
proceeding for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Stock
Option Agreement, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the
Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement may not be enforced in or by said
courts or that its property is exempt or immune from execution, that the suit,
action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the venue of
the suit, action or proceeding is improper.

11.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
------------
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

as of January 27, 1994, between the Company and
BankAmerica or by virtue of any of the transactions
contemplated thereby."

fied and amended to add the following sentence at the end

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, dated January 27, 1994, between BANKAMERICA
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Grantee"), and CONTINENTAL BANK
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Issuer").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement"), which agreement has been
executed by the parties hereto immediately prior to this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, as a condition to Grantee's entering into the Merger Agreement
and in consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee the Option (as
hereinafter defined):

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

1. (a) Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional, irrevocable
option (the "Option") to purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up to 10,169,000
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Issuer's Common Stock, par value $4 per
share ("Common Stock"), at a price of $37.50 per share; provided, however, that
-----------------
in the event Issuer issues or agrees to issue any shares of Common Stock (other
than as permitted under the Merger Agreement) at a price less than $37.50 per
share (as adjusted pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 5), such price shall be
equal to such lesser price (such price, as adjusted if applicable, the "Option
Price"); provided further that in no event shall the number of shares for which
----------------
this Option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the Issuer's issued and outstanding
common shares. The number of shares of Common Stock that may be received upon
the exercise of the Option and the Option Price are subject to adjustment as
herein set forth.

(b) In the event that any additional shares of Common Stock are issued
or otherwise become outstanding after the date hereof (or any treasury shares
held by Issuer have been or are sold after January 26, 1994) (other than
pursuant to this Agreement), the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the
Option shall be increased so that, after such issuance, its equals 19.9% of the
number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding without giving
effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Option. Nothing
contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to
authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Merger Agreement.

2. (a) The Holder (as hereinafter defined) may exercise the Option, in
whole or part, and from time to time, if, but only if, both an Initial
Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as
hereinafter defined) shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise
Termination Event (as hereinafter defined), provided that the Holder shall have
--------
sent the written notice of such exercise (as provided in subsection (e) of this
Section 2) within 30 days following such Subsequent Triggering Event. Each of
the following shall be an Exercise Termination Event: (i) the Effective Time of
the Merger; (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the
provisions thereof if such termination occurs prior to the occurrence of an
Initial Triggering Event; or (iii) the passage of 12 months after termination of
the Merger Agreement if such termination follows the occurrence of an Initial
Triggering Event (provided that if an Initial Triggering Event continues or
--------
occurs beyond such termination, the Exercise Termination Event shall be 12
months from the expiration of the Last Triggering Event but in no event more
than 18 months after such termination). The "Last Triggering Event" shall mean
the last Initial Triggering Event to occur. The term "Holder" shall mean the
holder or holders of the Option.

(b) The term "Initial Triggering Event" shall mean any of the following
events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:

-1-
<PAGE>

(i) Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "Issuer Subsidiary"),
without having received Grantee's prior written consent, shall have entered
into an agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter
defined) with any person (the term "person" for purposes of this Agreement
having the meaning assigned thereto in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder) other than Grantee
or any of its Subsidiaries (each a "Grantee Subsidiary") or the Board of
Directors of Issuer shall have recommended that the stockholders of Issuer
approve or accept any Acquisition Transaction other than as contemplated by
the Merger Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition
Transaction" shall mean (x) a merger or consolidation, or any similar
transaction, involving Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC) of Issuer, (y) a
purchase, lease or other acquisition representing 15% or more of the
consolidated assets of Issuer and its Subsidiaries, or (z) a purchase or
other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share
exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or more of the voting
power of Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of Issuer;

(ii) Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary, without having received
Grantee's prior written consent, shall have authorized, recommended,
proposed or publicly announced its intention to authorize, recommend or
propose, an agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction with any
person other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, or the Board of
Directors of Issuer shall have publicly withdrawn or modified, or publicly
announced its interest to withdraw or modify, its recommendation that the
stockholders of Issuer approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement;

(iii) Any person other than Grantee, any Grantee Subsidiary or any
Issuer Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity shall have acquired
beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or
more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the term "beneficial
ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned
thereto in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder);

(iv) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary shall
have made a bona fide proposal to Issuer or its stockholders by public
announcement or written communication that is or becomes the subject of
public disclosure to engage in an Acquisition Transaction;

(v) After a proposal is made by a third party to Issuer or its
stockholders to engage in an Acquisition Transaction, Issuer shall have
breached any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger Agreement and
such breach (x) would entitle Grantee to terminate the Merger Agreement and
(y) shall not have been cured prior to the Notice Date (as defined below);
or

(vi) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary, other
than in connection with a transaction to which Grantee has given its prior
written consent, shall have filed an application or notice with the Federal
Reserve Board, or other federal or state bank regulatory authority, which
application or notice has been accepted for processing, for approval to
engage in an Acquisition Transaction.

(c) The term "Subsequent Triggering Event" shall mean either of the
following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:

(i) The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 20% or
more of the then outstanding Common Stock; or

-2-
<PAGE>

(ii) The occurrence of the Initial Triggering Event described in
clause (i) of subsection (b) of this Section 2, except that the percentage
referred to in clause (z) shall be 20%.

(d) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of
any Initial Triggering Event or Subsequent Triggering Event (together, a
"Triggering Event"), it being understood that the giving of such notice by
Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the Holder to exercise the
Option.

(e) In the event the Holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise the
Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein
referred to as the "Notice Date") specifying (i) the total number of shares it
will purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier
than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date
for the closing of such purchase (the "Closing Date"); provided, that if the
--------
closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Option (the "Closing") cannot
be consummated by reason of any applicable judgment, decree, order, law or
regulation, the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this
sentence shall run instead from the date on which such restriction on
consummation has expired or been terminated; and provided further, without
----------------
limiting the foregoing, that if prior notification to or approval of the Federal
Reserve Board or any other regulatory agency is required in connection with such
purchase, the Holder shall promptly file the required notice or application for
approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that
otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on
which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such
approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall
have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice
Date relating thereto. Notwithstanding this subsection (e), in no event shall
any Closing Date be more than 18 months after the related Notice Date, and if
the Closing Date shall not have occurred within 18 months after the related
Notice Date due to the failure to obtain any such required approval, the
exercise of the Option effected on the Notice Date shall be deemed to have
expired. In the event (i) Grantee receives official notice that an approval of
the Federal Reserve Board or any other regulatory authority required for the
purchase of Option Shares (as hereinafter defined) would not be issued or
granted, (ii) a Closing Date shall not have occurred within 18 months after the
related Notice Date due to the failure to obtain any such required approval or
(iii) Holder (or Substitute Holder) shall have the right pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 7 (or Section 9) to exercise the Option (or Substitute
Option), Grantee shall nevertheless be entitled to exercise its right as set
forth in Section 7 and Grantee or Holder (or Substitute Holder) shall be
entitled to exercise the Option (or Substitute Option) in connection with the
resale of Issuer Common Stock or other securities pursuant to a registration
statement as provided in Section 6.

(f) At the Closing referred to in subsection (e) of this Section 2, the
Holder shall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common
Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately available
funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer, provided that
--------
failure or refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude
the Holder from exercising the Option.

(g) At such Closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately
available funds as provided in subsection (f) of this Section 2, Issuer shall
deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of
shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder and, if the Option should be
exercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof
to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and the Holder
shall deliver to Issuer a copy of this Agreement and a letter agreeing that the
Holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation
of applicable law or the provisions of this Agreement. If at the time of
issuance of any Option Shares pursuant to an exercise of all or part of the
Option hereunder, Issuer shall not have redeemed the Rights (as defined in the
Stockholders' Rights Plan adopted by Issuer on July 22, 1991, as amended (the
"Rights Agreement")), or shall have issued any similar securities, then each
Option Share issued pursuant to such exercise shall also represent rights or new
rights with terms substantially the same as and

-3-
<PAGE>

at least as favorable to Grantee as are provided under the Rights Agreement or
any similar agreement then in effect.

(h) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing hereunder may be
endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows:

"The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to
certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof and
Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of
Issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon
receipt by Issuer of a written request therefor."

It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions
of the Securities Act in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of
substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the Holder shall have
delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion
of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the
effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act; (ii)
the reference to the provisions of this Agreement in the above legend shall be
removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the
shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such
reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the
conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In
addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by
law.

(i) Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice of
exercise of the Option provided for under subsection (e) of this Section 2 and
the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, the
Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of
Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of
Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder or the Issuer
shall have failed or refused to designate the bank account described in
subsection (f) of this Section 2. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and
all United States federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be
payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock
certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee,
transferee or designee.

3. Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from
preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of
Common Stock (and other securities issuable pursuant to Section 5(a)) so that
the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock (or
such other securities) after giving effect to all other options, warrants,
convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common Stock (or such other
securities); (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through
reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any
other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any
of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed
hereunder by Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time
be required (including (x) complying with all premerger notification, reporting
and waiting period requirements specified in 15 U.S.C. (S) 18a and regulations
promulgated thereunder and (y) in the event, under the Bank Holding Company Act
of 1956, as amended ("BHCA"), or the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as
amended, or any state banking law, prior approval of or notice to the Federal
Reserve Board or to any state regulatory authority is necessary before the
Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such
applications or notices and providing such information to the Federal Reserve
Board or such state regulatory authority as they may require) in order to permit
the Holder to exercise the Option and the Issuer duly and effectively to issue
shares of Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (iv) promptly to take all action
provided herein to protect the rights of the Holder against dilution.

4. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable,
without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of
this Agreement at the

-4-
<PAGE>

principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for Options of
different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same
terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the
aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The
terms "Agreement" and "Option" as used herein include any Stock Option
Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted
hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this
Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably
satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this
Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of like
tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute
an additional contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the
Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be
enforceable by anyone.

5. In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock
that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this
Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of
the Option shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this
Section 5.

(a) In the event of any change in Common Stock by reason of stock
dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations,
subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares or the like, the type and
number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof shall be
appropriately adjusted so that Grantee shall receive upon exercise of the
Option and payment of the aggregate Option Price hereunder the number and
class of shares or other securities or property that Grantee would have
received in respect of Common Stock if the Option had been exercised in
full immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as
applicable.

(b) Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon
exercise hereof is adjusted as provided in this Section 5, the Option Price
shall be adjusted by multiplying the Option Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock
purchasable prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable after the
adjustment.

6. Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs prior
to an Exercise Termination Event (or as otherwise provided in the last sentence
of Section 2(e)), Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee delivered within 30
days after such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such trigger date as is provided
in the last sentence of Section 2(e)) (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of
any subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of
Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a
shelf registration statement under the Securities Act covering any shares issued
and issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its best efforts to cause
such registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to
permit the sale or other disposition of any shares of Common Stock issued upon
total or partial exercise of this Option ("Option Shares") in accordance with
any plan of disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its best efforts
to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to
remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such
registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be
reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee for a
period of 18 months following such first request shall have the right to demand
a second such registration if reasonably necessary to effect such sales or
dispositions. The foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by
Grantee for registration of Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in
registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of Common
Stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing
underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such
offering the inclusion of the Holder's Option or Option Shares would interfere
with the successful marketing of the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer,
the number of Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration
statement contemplated hereby may be reduced; and provided, however, that after
-----------------
any such required reduction the number of Option

-5-
<PAGE>

Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the Holder shall
constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by the Holder
and Issuer in the aggregate; and provided further, however, that if such
----------------
reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a registration statement for the
balance as promptly as practical and no reduction shall thereafter occur (and
such registration shall not be charged against the Holder). Each such Holder
shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in
any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by any such
Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any
underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the
extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties,
indemnities and other agreements customarily included in such underwriting
agreements for the Issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from
any Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to
Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in each case
by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the
persons entitled to receive such copies.

7. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs
prior to an Exercise Termination Event, (i) at the request of the Holder,
delivered within 30 days after such occurrence (or such later period as provided
in Section 10 or the last sentence of Section 2(e)), Issuer (or any successor
thereto) shall repurchase the Option from the Holder at a price (the "Option
Repurchase Price") equal to (x) the amount by which (A) the market/offer price
(as defined below) exceeds (B) the Option Price, multiplied by the number of
shares for which this Option may then be exercised plus (y) Grantee's
Out-of-Pocket Expenses (as defined below) (to the extent not previously
reimbursed) and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares from time to
time (the "Owner"), delivered within 30 days after such occurrence (or such
later period as provided in Section 10), Issuer shall repurchase such number of
the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the
"Option Share Repurchase Price") equal to (x) the market/offer price multiplied
by the number of Option Shares so designated plus (y) Grantee's Out-of-Pocket
Expenses (to the extent not previously reimbursed). The term "Out-of-Pocket
Expenses" shall mean Grantee's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including, without limitation, legal, accounting and investment banking fees.
The term "market/offer price" shall mean the highest of (i) the highest price
per share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has
been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third
party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest closing price for
shares of Common Stock quoted in the New York Stock Exchange (or if Common
Stock is not quoted in the New York Stock Exchange, the highest bid price per
share as quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation Systems, or, if the shares of Common Stock are not quoted thereon, on
the principal trading market on which such shares are traded as reported by a
recognized source) within the six-month period immediately preceding the date
the Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case
may be, or (iv) in the event of a sale of assets representing 15% or more of the
consolidated assets of Issuer and its Subsidiaries, the sum of the price paid in
such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets
of Issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm
selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, divided by the number
of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. In
determining the market/offer price, the value of consideration other than cash
shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected
by the Holder or Owner, as the case may be.

(b) The Holder and the Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right
to require Issuer to repurchase the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to
this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal
office, a copy of this Agreement or certificates for Option Shares, as
applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Holder
or the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase this
Option and/or the Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 7. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business
days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates representing Option
Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, Issuer shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price
and/or to the Owner the Option Share Repurchase Price therefor or the

-6-
<PAGE>

portion thereof that Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and
regulation from so delivering.

(c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or
regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, from repurchasing the
Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify the
Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from
time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the
Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively,
that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after
the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if
-----------------
Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this Section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or
regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, from delivering to the
Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and the
Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby
undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal
approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as practicable in order
to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or Owner may revoke its notice of
repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either in whole or to the extent
of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, Issuer shall promptly (i)
deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the
Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price that Issuer is not
prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the
Holder, a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to
purchase that number of shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the
number of shares of Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option
Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Option Repurchase Price less the
portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Holder and the denominator of which
is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Owner, a certificate for the
Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. If an Exercise
Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the date of the notice by Issuer
described in the first sentence of this subsection (c), or shall be scheduled to
occur at any time before the expiration of a period ending on the thirtieth day
after such date, the Holder shall nonetheless have the right to exercise the
Option until the expiration of such 30 day period.

8. (a) In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer
shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person,
other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any
person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and
Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with
such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into
or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any
other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after such
merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents
of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any person, other than Grantee or one of its
Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such
transaction shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon the
consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute
Option"), at the election of the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation
(as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring
Corporation.

(b) The following terms have the meanings indicated:

(1) "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing or
surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other
than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or
surviving person, and (iii) the transferee of all or substantially all of
Issuer's assets.

(2) "Substitute Common Stock" shall mean the common stock issued by
the issuer of the Substitute Option upon exercise of the Substitute Option.

-7-
<PAGE>

(3) "Assigned Value" shall mean the market/offer price, as defined in
Section 7.

(4) "Average Price" shall mean the average closing price of a share
of the Substitute Common Stock for the one year immediately preceding the
consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the
closing price of the shares of Substitute Common Stock on the day preceding
such consolidation, merger or sale; provided that if Issuer is the issuer
--------
of the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect
to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into Issuer or by
any company which controls or is controlled by such person, as the Holder
may elect.

(c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option,

provided, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons,
- --------
be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no
event less advantageous to the Holder. The issuer of the Substitute Option
shall also enter into an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the
Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this Agreement (after giving
effect for such purpose to the provisions of Section 9), which agreement shall
be applicable to the Substitute Option.

(d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares
of Substitute Common Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value multiplied by the
number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable,
divided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute Option per
share of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option Price
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the
Substitute Option is exercisable.

(e) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the
Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute
Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the
event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the
shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise but for this
clause (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option Issuer")
shall make a cash payment to Holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the
Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e)
over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving effect to the
limitation in this clause (e). This difference in value shall be determined by a
nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder.

(f) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in subsection
(a) of this Section 8 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that
controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of
Issuer hereunder.

9. (a) At the request of the holder of the Substitute Option (the
Substitute Option Holder"), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute
Option Issuer") shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the Substitute
Option Holder at a price (the "Substitute Option Repurchase Price") equal to (x)
the amount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter defined)
exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by the
number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option may
then be exercised plus (y) Grantee's Out-of-Pocket Expenses (to the extent not
previously reimbursed), and at the request of the owner (the "Substitute Share
Owner") of shares of Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute Shares"), the
Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price (the
"Substitute Share Repurchase Price") equal to (x) the Highest Closing Price
multiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated plus (y) Grantee's
Out-of-Pocket Expenses (to the extent not previously reimbursed). The term
"Highest Closing Price" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of
Substitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the
date the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required

-8-
<PAGE>

repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice
of the required repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable.

(b) The Substitute Option Holder and the Substitute Share Owner, as the
case may be, may exercise its respective right to require the Substitute Option
Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and the Substitute Shares pursuant to
this Section 9 by surrendering for such purpose to the Substitute Option Issuer,
at its principal office, the agreement for such Substitute Option (or, in the
absence of such an agreement, a copy of this Agreement) and certificates for
Substitute Shares accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the
Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be,
elects to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute
Option and/or the Substitute Shares in accordance with the provision of this
Section 9. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business
days after the surrender of the Substitute Option and/or certificates
representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices
relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute Option Repurchase Price
and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute Share Repurchase Price
therefor or the portion thereof which the Substitute Option Issuer is not then
prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.

(c) To the extent that the Substitute Option Issuer is prohibited under
applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, from
repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in part or in
full, the Substitute Option Issuer shall immediately so notify the Substitute
Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and thereafter deliver or cause
to be delivered, from time to time, to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the
Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Substitute Share
Repurchase Price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from
delivering, within five business days after the date on which the Substitute
Option Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if the
-----------------
Substitute Option Issuer is at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase
pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 9 prohibited under applicable law or
regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, from delivering to the
Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the
Substitute Option Repurchase Price and the Substitute Share Repurchase Price,
respectively, in full (and the Substitute Option Issuer shall use its best
efforts to receive all required regulatory and legal approvals as promptly as
practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Substitute Option
Holder or Substitute Share Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the
Substitute Option or the Substitute Shares either in whole or to the extent of
the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, the Substitute Option Issuer
shall promptly (i) deliver to the Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share
Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Substitute Option Repurchase Price or
the Substitute Share Repurchase Price that the Substitute Option Issuer is not
prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the
Substitute Option Holder, a new Substitute Option evidencing the right of the
Substitute Option Holder to purchase that number of shares of the Substitute
Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of the Substitute
Common Stock for which the surrendered Substitute Option was exercisable at the
time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof
theretofore delivered to the Substitute Option Holder and the denominator of
which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Substitute Share
Owner, a certificate for the Substitute Option Shares it is then so prohibited
from repurchasing. If an Exercise Termination Event shall have occurred prior
to the date of the notice by the Substitute Option Issuer described in the first
sentence of this subsection (c), or shall be scheduled to occur at any time
before the expiration of a period ending on the thirtieth day after such date,
the Substitute Option Holder shall nevertheless have the right to exercise the
Substitute Option until the expiration of such 30 day period.

10. The 30-day period for exercise of certain rights under Sections 2, 6,
7, 9 and 12 shall be extended: (i) to the extent necessary to obtain all
regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights, and for the expiration of
all statutory waiting periods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to avoid
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act by reason of such exercise.

11. Issuer hereby represents and warrants to Grantee as follows:

(a) Issuer has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Board of Directors of Issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Issuer are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions so contemplated. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by Issuer. This Agreement is the valid and legally binding
obligation of Issuer, enforceable against Issuer in accordance with its terms.

(b) Issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and
reserve and to permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms will have
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the Option, that number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock at any time
and from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance
pursuant hereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens,
encumbrance and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights.

(c) Issuer has taken all action (including if required redeeming all of
the Rights or amending or terminating the Rights Agreement) so that the entering
into of this Option Agreement, the acquisition of shares of Common Stock
hereunder and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not
result in the grant of any rights to any person under the Rights Agreement or
enable or require the Rights to be exercised, distributed or triggered.

(d) Except as disclosed pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or result in any
Violation pursuant to any provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or
by-laws of Issuer or any Subsidiary of Issuer or, subject to obtaining any
approvals or consents contemplated hereby, result in any Violation of any loan
or credit agreement, note, mortgage, indenture, lease, Plan or other agreement,
obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order,
decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Issuer or any
Subsidiary of Issuer or their respective properties or assets which Violation
would have a Material Adverse Effect on Issuer.

(e) Issuer reaffirms with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby the representation and warranty contained in Section 5.16 of
the Merger Agreement.

12. Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its rights or
obligations under this Option Agreement or the Option created hereunder to any
other person, without the express written consent of the other party, except
that in the event a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to an
Exercise Termination Event, Grantee, subject to the express provisions hereof,
may assign in whole or in part its rights and obligations hereunder within 30
days following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such later period as
provided in Section 10); provided, however, that until the date 30 days
-----------------
following the date on which the Federal Reserve Board approves an application by
Grantee under the BHCA to acquire the shares of Common Stock subject to the
Option, Grantee may not assign its rights under the Option except in (i) a
widely dispersed public distribution, (ii) a private placement in which no one
party acquires the right to purchase in excess of 2% of the voting shares of
Issuer, (iii) an assignment to a single party (e.g., a broker or investment
banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public distribution on
Grantee's behalf, or (iv) any other manner approved by the Federal Reserve
Board.

13. Each of Grantee and Issuer will use its best efforts to make all
filings with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and governmental
authorities necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including without limitation making application to list the
shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder on the New York

-10-
<PAGE>

Stock Exchange upon official notice of issuance and applying to the Federal
Reserve Board under the BHCA for approval to acquire the shares issuable
hereunder, but Grantee shall not be obligated to apply to state banking
authorities for approval to acquire the shares of Common Stock issuable
hereunder until such time, if ever, as it deems appropriate to do so.

14. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that the
Holder or Owner or any Related Person thereof is a person making without the
prior written consent of Issuer an offer or proposal to engage in an Acquisition
Transaction (other than the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement),
then (i) in the case of a Holder or any Related Person thereof, the Option held
by it shall immediately terminate and be of no further force or effect, and (ii)
in the case of an Owner or any Related Person thereof, the Option Shares held by
it shall be immediately repurchasable by Issuer at the Option Price. A Related
Person of a Holder or Owner means any Affiliate (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the
rules and regulations under the Exchange Act) of the Holder or Owner and any
person that is the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the voting power of the
Holder or Owner, as the case may be.

15. The parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an inadequate
remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party hereto and that the
obligations of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party hereto
through injunctive or other equitable relief.

16. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this
Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired
or invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines
that the Holder or Substitute Option Holder is not permitted to acquire, or
Issuer or Substitute Option Issuer is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to
Section 7 or Section 9, as the case may be, the full number of shares of Common
Stock provided in Section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1(b) or
Section 5 hereof), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow the Holder to
acquire or to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may
be permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof.

17. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by
cable, telegram, telecopy or telex, or by registered or certified mail (postage
prepaid, return receipt requested) at the respective addresses of the parties
set forth in the Merger Agreement.

18. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

19. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one
and the same agreement.

20. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Merger
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses
incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants,
investment bankers, accountants and counsel.

21. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Merger
Agreement, this Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior
arrangements or understandings with respect thereof, written or oral. The terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Grantee shall execute and deliver all other documents and instruments and take

BANKAMERICA TO ACQUIRE CONTINENTAL FOR ABOUT $1.9 BILLION

BANKAMERICA WILL BUY BACK $500 MILLION OF OWN STOCK;
EXPECTS NO DILUTION IN EARNINGS PER SHARE IN FIRST YEAR
______________________________________________________________________

SAN FRANCISCO AND CHICAGO, JANUARY 28, 1994 -- BankAmerica Corporation
(NYSE: BAC) and Continental Bank Corporation (NYSE: CBK) today announced they
have signed a definitive agreement for BankAmerica to acquire Continental for
21.25 million shares of BankAmerica common stock and $939 million in cash,
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Based on BankAmerica's closing
price yesterday of $45.75 per share, the transaction is currently valued at
approximately $1.9 billion.

The combination with Continental will enable BankAmerica to solidify its
position as one of the nation's leading wholesale banks, while expanding its
relationships with both large and medium size companies in the midwestern United
States.

BankAmerica also said that before completing the acquisition it will buy
back approximately $500 million of its common stock, approximately half the
value of the shares to be issued in the merger. After giving effect to the
share repurchase, the transaction is expected to be non-dilutive to BankAmerica
shareholders from the first year of the merger.

The transaction will be structured as a cash-election merger, in which
Continental shareholders may elect to receive either cash or BankAmerica common
stock. It is expected to be tax-free to the extent stock is received, but may
become taxable in certain circumstances. The acquisition is expected to close
in the third quarter of 1994 and is subject to completion of due diligence and
approval by regulators and Continental shareholders.

BankAmerica Chairman Richard M. Rosenberg said, "There is a superb fit
between the two organizations. We complement each other remarkably well in
terms of business lines,

(more)

balance sheets, and geographic presence. Continental is a strong, focused
wholesale bank which will enable us to achieve important strategic objectives --
increasing relationships with large corporations nationwide and especially
expanding our presence among both large and medium-size companies in the
Midwest. Continental has unusually strong customer relationships and we have
the size, financial strength, and management depth to make this combination work
without straining us or distracting from our other priorities. In addition, we
have an extensive global network and array of products that will become
available to Continental customers."

"Continental's customers, shareholders, and employees are all winners in
this combination," said Thomas C. Theobald, Continental Chairman. "Our customers
benefit from BankAmerica's far greater financial capacity, and it's clear that
better marketing opportunities brighten career prospects for Continental
bankers. With this transaction, our shareholders will realize substantial
appreciation in value, in addition to the gains of previous years. In the
circumstances, I have decided to move on, very proud of what our talented team
has accomplished, and very confident about the future of this business."

Rosenberg said: "In addition to its strong market position in the Chicago
area, Continental has deep relationships with corporations across the country,
especially among privately held companies. However, there is no significant
overlap with our customer base. This is true even though we both have strong
operations in many of the same locations, including Chicago, where we have run a
very successful corporate banking office since 1974."

The acquisition is also expected to result in modest cost savings, which
will come from consolidation of Continental domestic and foreign offices with
those of BankAmerica and the elimination of duplicative corporate and
administrative expenses. In addition to Chicago, Continental has corporate
banking offices in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Atlanta and Dallas, as well as
operations in London, Tokyo, and five Latin American cities. These
consolidations are estimated to eliminate 500-800 full-time equivalent
positions, coming from both companies and from the U.S. and overseas, within two
years. At the end of 1993, Continental had approximately 4,200 employees and
BankAmerica had approximately 96,400 employees.

Following the merger, the headquarters of BankAmerica's U.S. Corporate
Group will be moved to Chicago and the combined domestic corporate banking
business will be headed by Continental Vice Chairman Michael J. Murray, who will
report to BankAmerica Vice

(more)

Chairman David Coulter, head of its United States and International Group.
Continental will be renamed Bank of America Illinois and be headed by
Continental Vice Chairman William M. Goodyear, who will continue to be
responsible for middle-market and private banking businesses, reporting to
BankAmerica Vice Chairman Michael Rossi, head of its Commercial Business Group
and several other major investment and wholesale products units.

John Richman, a Continental outside director since 1980, will join
BankAmerica's Board of Directors upon completion of the transaction. Richman is
a former chairman and chief executive officer of Kraft General Foods, Inc.

The amount of BankAmerica stock to be issued in the merger is subject to
adjustment if its average stock price during a 10-day period ending 10 days
prior to closing is above $55.84 per share or below $36.16 per share.
Continental has granted BankAmerica an option to purchase shares of Continental
common stock representing 19.9% of its outstanding common shares, at a price of
$37.50 per share. The option is exercisable in certain circumstances, including
the purchase by a third party of more than 20% of Continental shares or
Continental's completion of an alternative transaction with a third party at a
higher price. In addition, if Continental enters into such an alternative
transaction, it would be obligated to pay BankAmerica the greater of $60 million
or 3% of the transaction's value.

Continental's Board of Directors has unanimously approved the merger
agreement and has agreed to recommend the transaction to Continental
shareholders at a meeting to be held following the clearance of a proxy
statement by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Lazard Freres and Montgomery Securities are serving as financial advisors
to BankAmerica. Goldman Sachs is serving as financial advisor to Continental.

As reported, Continental's 1993 earnings were $258 million, or $4.12 per
share. The earnings were not taxed due to the utilization of tax benefits.
Continental's assets were $22.6 billion and loans were $11.7 billion at
year-end.

With assets of $187 billion at year-end 1993, BankAmerica is the second
largest banking company in the United States.
