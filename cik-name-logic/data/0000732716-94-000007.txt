Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
- ---------------------------------------------

On April 1, 1994, the spin-off by Pacific Telesis Group ("Telesis") of
AirTouch Communications ("AirTouch") became effective. On that date, the
Telesis shareowners of record on March 21, 1994 received a distribution
of one share of AirTouch common stock for each share of Telesis common
stock owned. AirTouch principally includes the cellular, paging and
radiolocation operations of Telesis. Telesis will continue to own its
telephone companies, Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell, along with several
smaller units including Pacific Bell Directory and certain real estate
assets. Immediately prior to the spin-off, approximately 86% of AirTouch
was owned by Telesis. The distribution is being accounted for as a
liquidating stock dividend.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
- -------------------------------------------

(b)(1) Pro Forma Financial Information.

The following information is incorporated by reference from Pacific
Telesis Group's 1994 Proxy Statement, including Pacific Telesis
Group's 1993 Consolidated Financial Statements (Filed March 11, 1994,
and amended March 14 and March 25, 1994, File No. 1-8609), and also
from Pacific Telesis Group's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 1993:

to the documents as filed electronically with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the EDGAR program))

Financial Condition

o Financial Statement Schedules:

Pacific Telesis Group and Subsidiaries

- Schedule II - Amounts Receivable From Related Parties And
Underwriters, Promoters, And Employees Other Than Related
Parties

- Schedule V - Property, Plant, and Equipment

- Schedule VI - Accumulated Depreciation

- Schedule VIII - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts

- Schedule IX - Short-Term Borrowings

(Pages 44-58 of Form 10-K for 1993)

The financial statements for Telesis listed above present AirTouch as
discontinued operations. The distribution of AirTouch stock is being
accounted for as a liquidating dividend. This accounting treatment
eliminates "Net receivable from spin-off operations" and "Net assets
of spin-off operations" from the Telesis consolidated balance sheets
and reduces "Additional paid-in-capital" by an offsetting amount.
