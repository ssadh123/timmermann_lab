Item 5. Other Events.

On December 29, 1993, Hecla Mining Company (the "Company"), two wholly
owned Canadian subsidiaries of the Company, and Equinox Resources Ltd., a
company incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and
headquartered in Vancouver, Canada ("Equinox"), executed an Acquisition
Agreement providing for the Company's acquisition of Equinox. Pursuant to the
Acquisition Agreement and related Plan of Arrangement, upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, (i) Equinox common shareholders will receive
0.3 Company common shares, par value $0.25 ("Company Common Shares"), for each
outstanding Equinox common share, (ii) holders of Equinox's Series "A"
production participating preferred shares will receive newly issued production
notes of the Company with the same material terms and conditions, and (iii)
outstanding Equinox options and warrants will become exercisable for Company
Common Shares. In connection with the acquisition of Equinox, the Company
expects to issue approximately 5.7 million Company Common Shares.

The Board of Directors of the Company and Equinox have each approved
the Acquisition Agreement. However, the transactions contemplated by the
Acquisition Agreement are subject to a number of conditions including, without
limitation, approval by Equinox shareholders, and approval by a Canadian court
of the Plan of Arrangement.
