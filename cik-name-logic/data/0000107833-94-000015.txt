ARTICLE 3

MANNER AND BASIS OF EXCHANGING SHARES
OF CAPITAL STOCK IN THE EXCHANGE

Section 3.1 Exchange of WPS Common Stock for WPS Resources Common
Stock. At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Exchange and
without further action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of WPS
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
exchanged for one share of WPS Resources Common Stock, which shall thereupon
be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable except for liability which may
be imposed on the holders thereof under Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL.

Section 3.2 Cancellation of WPS Resources Common Stock. Each share
of WPS Resources Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and restored to the status of authorized and
unissued WPS Resources Common Stock.

Section 3.3 WPS Preferred Stock. The Exchange shall not affect, or
cause any change in, WPS Preferred Stock. Each share of WPS Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
immediately following the Effective Time, be issued and outstanding as a
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of WPS Preferred Stock.

transfer, and each such holder or transferee will be entitled to receive a
certificate or certificates representing the same number of shares of WPS
Resources Common Stock as the number of shares of WPS Common Stock previously
represented by such stock certificates so surrendered. Until so surrendered
or presented for transfer, each outstanding certificate which prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of WPS Common Stock shall be deemed for all
corporate purposes to represent the ownership of the same number of shares of
WPS Resources Common Stock as though such surrender and transfer had taken
place. If any certificate representing shares of WPS Resources Common Stock
is to be issued in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate formerly representing shares of WPS Common Stock presented for
transfer, it shall be a condition of issuance that (i) the certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by a stock power and
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the person requesting
such issuance shall pay to WPS Resources' transfer agent any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of issuance of certificates representing WPS
Resources Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of
the certificate presented, or establish to the satisfaction of WPS Resources
or its transfer agent that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable;
(b) immediately following the Effective Time, WPS shall cause to be delivered
to WPS Resources, a certificate registered in the name of WPS Resources for
the number of shares of WPS Common Stock issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time.
