Board of Directors
Designed Traffic Installation Co. 
Fort Lauderdale, Florida

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Designed Traffic
Installation Co. as at December 31, 1993 and March 31, 1993 and the related
statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the nine months
and twelve months then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material aspects, the financial position of Designed Traffic
Installation Co., as at December 31, 1993 and March 31, 1993, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the nine months and twelve
months then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION BASIS)
DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND MARCH 31, 1993

NOTE 1-SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Recognition of Income

The company reports income for financial statement purposes on the
percentage of completion basis and on the completed job basis for tax
purposes. Income on contracts in process for statement purposes is
recorded on the basis of the management's estimates of the percentage of
job completion to date.

Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those
indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor,
payroll taxes and insurance. Selling, general and administrative costs are
charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on
uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated
profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and
final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income and
are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

The asset, "Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on
uncompleted contracts", represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts
billed. The liability, "Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings
on uncompleted contracts", represents billings in excess of revenues
recognized.

Depreciation

The company records depreciation on its fixed assets using the straight
line, double declining balance, and A.C.R.S. methods at rates intended to
prorate costs over estimated useful lives as follows:

Assets Estimated Useful Life
----------------------- ---------------------
Machinery and equipment 3 to 8 years
Automotive 3 to 8 years
Computer 5 years
Office furniture & equipment 5 to 8 years
Building and improvements 19 years

Pension and Profit Sharing Plans

In 1972, the Board of Directors approved pension and profit sharing plans
for the benefit of company employees. These plans were subsequently
amended to conform to current law. Qualifications for employee
participation in these plans are based upon an attained age and length of
service with the company. Pension and profit sharing costs are charged to
income on a current basis. The company's policy is to fund the costs
accrued.

Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
on the first-in-first-out method. Maintenance, operating and office
supplies of nominal value are not inventoried.

Self Insurance

The company maintains a policy of self insurance on a portion of material
and supplies purchased for inventory and contracts. As purchases are made,
they are warehoused until convenient to move to job sites. This temporary
warehousing at times exceeds insurance coverage. Management states that
every effort is made to move these goods to job sites as quickly as
possible.

The Company is in the process of refinancing its 
first mortgage on the land and building with Sun 
Bank. The original mortgage ballooned in October
1993 and a temporary loan was signed at that time
to bridge the time period until negotiations could 
be completed on a permanent note. The "bridge-loan"
was due to balloon on March 8, 1994 with a payment of 
$342,400. As of March 21, a tentative agreement has 
been reached, but not signed, which calls for principal
payments of $1,600 per month plus interest at prime 
plus 1% floating. The mortgage will be amortized 
over 25 years and will balloon in 2001. 345,600

NOTE 6-PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS

Contributions to both plans are based on the annual salary of qualified
employees and are limited to a required 1% for the pension plan and an
optional contribution to the profit sharing plan based upon a formula
integrated with social security. For the nine months ended December 31 and
twelve months ended March 31, the contributions to the pension plan were
$14,701 and $17,143. The contributions to the profit sharing plan were
$102,907 and $68,570. All costs are currently funded and there is no
unfunded liability for past service costs.

NOTE 7-NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT

Other assets include a five year non-compete agreement entered into January
1991, with a former officer/shareholder. Amortization for the periods
ending December 31, and March 31 was $54,750 and $73,000, leaving remaining
balances of $146,000 and $200,750 respectively.

(PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION BASIS)
DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND MARCH 31, 1993

NOTE 8-CHANGE OF ACCOUNTING YEAR

For the period beginning April 1, 1993, the Company elected to be taxed as
an "S" corporation pursuant to IRS regulation 1361. Concurrent with this
election, the corporation's year-end changed from a fiscal year ending
March 31 to a calendar year-end. This change resulted in a nine month year
ending December 31, 1993. Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation
terminated the "S" election and reverted to a "C" Corporation retaining the
December year-end.

NOTE 9 -INCOME TAXES

Construction contracts are reported on the percentage of completion method
for financial statement purposes and on the completed contract method for
tax purposes.

The Corporation elected to be taxed as an "S" Corporation for the nine
months period ended December 31, 1993 (See Note 8). As such, corporate
profits are including and taxed on the shareholders' personal income tax
returns. In addition, a corporate tax is levied on the disposal of assets
with an appreciated value (built-in gains tax). For the nine months ended
December 31, 1993, this tax amounted to $13,000. For the periods ended
December 31, 1993 and March 31, 1993, accruals for income taxes were
$13,000 and $88,000. An over-accrual from prior years resulted in a net
tax benefit on the income statement of $6,673 and $26,123 respectively.

For the year ended March 31, 1993, election of the "S" status eliminated
the need for deferred income prior year taxes. Accordingly, the deferred
tax asset and liability on the balance sheet have been eliminated resulting
in a deferred tax benefit on the income statement of $154,800.

NOTE 10-LINE OF CREDIT

The company has maintained a $250,000 line of credit with Sun Bank for the
past four years at prime plus 1% floating, and guaranteed by the principals
with a lien on equipment and inventories. This amount has been increased
by the bank to $500,000, maturing June 30, 1994. As of the date of this
report, the company has not drawn on this line of credit.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 22, 1994

NOTE 1-SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation

The accompanying financial statements of Designed Traffic Installation
Co.("DTI") have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles for interim financial information. They do not
include all information and notes required by generally accepted accounting
principles for complete financial statements and should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements for the nine month period
ended December 31, 1993. The financial information furnished reflects all
adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring accruals which are, in the
opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position and results of operations for the periods presented. The results
of operations are not necessarily indicative of future results of operation
or financial position of DTI.

Recognition of Income

The Company reports income for financial statement purposes on the
percentage of completion basis and on the completed job basis for tax
purposes. Income on contracts in process for statement purposes is
recorded on the basis of the management's estimates of the percentage of
job completion to date.

Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those
indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor,
payroll taxes and insurance. Selling, general and administrative costs are
charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on
uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated
profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and
final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income and
are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

The asset, "Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on
uncompleted contracts", represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts
billed. The liability, "Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings
on uncompleted contracts", represents billings in excess of revenues
recognized.

JUNE 22, 1994 (continued)

Depreciation

The company records depreciation on its fixed assets using the straight
line, double declining balance, and A.C.R.S. methods at rates intended to
prorate costs over estimated useful lives as follows:

Assets Estimated Useful Life
----------------------- ---------------------
Machinery and equipment 3 to 8 years
Automotive 3 to 8 years
Computer 5 years
Office furniture & equipment 5 to 8 years
Building and improvements 19 years

Pension and Profit Sharing Plans

In 1972, the Board of Directors approved pension and profit sharing plans
for the benefit of company employees. These plans were subsequently
amended to conform to current law. Qualifications for employee
participation in these plans are based upon an attained age and length of
service with the company. Pension and profit sharing costs are charged to
income on a current basis. The company's policy is to fund the costs
accrued.

Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
on the first-in-first-out method. Maintenance, operating and office
supplies of nominal value are not inventoried.

Self Insurance

The company maintains a policy of self insurance on a portion of material
and supplies purchased for inventory and contracts. As purchases are made,
they are warehoused until convenient to move to job sites. This temporary
warehousing at times exceeds insurance coverage. Management states that
every effort is made to move these goods to job sites as quickly as
possible.

NOTE 2-CHANGE OF ACCOUNTING YEAR

For the period beginning April 1, 1993, the Company elected to be taxed as
an "S" corporation pursuant to IRS regulation 1361. Concurrent with this
election, the corporation's year-end changed from a fiscal year ending
March 31 to a calendar year-end. This change resulted in a nine month year
ending December 31, 1993. Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation
terminated the "S" election and reverted to a "C" Corporation retaining the
December year-end.

NOTE 3-LINE OF CREDIT

The company has maintained a $250,000 line of credit with Sun Bank for the
past four years at prime plus 1% floating, and guaranteed by the principals
with a lien on equipment and inventories. This amount has been increased
by the bank to $500,000, maturing June 30, 1994. As of the date of this
report, the company has not drawn on this line of credit.

CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED):

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income of
MasTec and DTI for the year ended December 31, 1993 and six months ended
June 30, 1994 are presented as if the acquisition had occurred on January
1, 1993. The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet is presented
as if the acquisition had occurred on June 22, 1994. Because of DTI's
change in fiscal year, data was only available for nine months ended
December 31, 1993.

The pro forma data is presented for informational purposes only and may not
be indicative of the future results of operations or financial position of
MasTec, or what the results of operations or financial position of MasTec

These pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the historical combined financial statements and notes
thereto of DTI included herein and MasTec as included by reference.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are derived from
the historical financial statements of MasTec and DTI. The pro forma
consolidated balance sheet combines MasTec's June 30, 1994 balance sheet
with DTI June 22, 1994 balance sheet. The pro forma consolidated
statements of income combine MasTec's pro forma statements of operations
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1993, as reported in MasTec's FORM
8-K filed May 17, 1994 which is hereby included by reference and for the
six months ended June 30, 1994 as reported in MasTec's 10-Q filed August 8,
