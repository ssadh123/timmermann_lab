FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ZENITH REPORTS HIGHER REVENUES, 

IMPROVED FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS 

GLENVIEW, Ill., April 20, 1994 -- First-quarter 1994 revenues for Zenith 
Electronics Corporation's core business increased significantly, and the 
company reported a $10 million improvement in operating results, compared 
with the same period of 1993.

Total revenues in the quarter were $297 million in 1994, compared with 
$290 million in 1993. Core business revenues increased by $29 million, 
even after absorbing $8 million of lower color television selling prices 
from the first quarter of 1993. Sales for non-core business areas decreased 
by $22 million in the quarter. 

The increase in core business sales, primarily higher color television 
unit shipments, reflects the excellent acceptance of Zenith's color TV 
product line and the continued strength of the Zenith brand name, the 
company said. 

The first-quarter 1994 net loss narrowed to $11.9 million, or 32 cents 
per share, from a first-quarter 1993 net loss of $21.8 million, or 72 cents 
per share.

Cost reductions achieved in the quarter were on plan as the company 
continued to implement major re-engineering actions in the core Consumer 
Electronics and Cable/Network Systems business. These actions should 
continue to benefit future quarters. 

First-quarter financing activities included the continuation of programs 
launched in 1993 to sell equity and debt. The company sold senior 
subordinated convertible debentures in a private placement and, pursuant 
to shelf offerings, sold common stock to investors. The company had no 
short-term debt at the end of the first quarter, compared with $23 million 
of short-term debt a year ago.
