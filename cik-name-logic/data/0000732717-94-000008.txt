REVERSE OF GLOBAL FLOATING RATE NOTE

SOUTHWESTERN BELL CAPITAL CORPORATION
MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES D

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of
Capital Corporation (the "Securities") of the series specified
on the face hereof (hereinafter called the "Notes") limited in
aggregate principal amount to U.S. $1,000,000,000 (or the
equivalent thereof in one or more currencies or currency
units), issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an
indenture dated as of February 1, 1987, and supplemented by a
First Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 1, 1990 among
Capital Corporation, Southwestern Bell Corporation ("SBC") and
The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term
includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which
indenture and First Supplemental Indenture and all indentures
supplemental thereto (collectively, the "Indenture") reference
is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of
rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the
Trustee, Capital Corporation, SBC and the holders of the
Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more
series, which different series may be issued in various
aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times,
may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject
to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise
vary as provided in the Indenture.

Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the authorized
denominations of Notes denominated in U.S. dollars will be
U.S. $1,000 and any larger amount that is an integral multiple
of U.S. $1,000. 

References herein to "U.S. dollars" or to "U.S.$" are to the
currency of the United States of America.

Holders of Notes and the Trustee are entitled to the benefits
of the Support Agreement dated as of November 10, 1986 (the
"Support Agreement") between Capital Corporation and SBC, in
which SBC has agreed to ensure the timely payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest owed on certain
obligations of Capital Corporation, including the Notes;
however, no Holders of Notes or the Trustee will have recourse
to or against the stock or assets of Southwestern Bell
Telephone Company (the "Telephone Company") or any interest of
Capital Corporation or SBC in the Telephone Company.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting Capital
Corporation, SBC and the Trustee with the written consent of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding Securities of each series affected by a
supplemental indenture (with each series voting as a class),
to enter into a supplemental indenture to add any provisions
<PAGE>

to or to change or eliminate any provisions of the Indenture
or to modify, in each case in any manner not covered by
provisions in the Indenture relating to amendments and waivers
without the consent of Holders, the rights of the Holders of
each such series. The Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding Securities of each series affected
by such waiver (with each series voting as a class), by notice
to the Trustee, may waive compliance by Capital Corporation or
SBC with any provisions of the Indenture, any supplemental
indenture or the Securities of any such series except a
default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any
Security. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this
Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon
all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon
the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or
in lieu hereof, whether or not a notation of such waiver is
made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the respective
obligations of Capital Corporation or SBC, which are absolute
and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on
this Note (in the case of Capital Corporation) or make
payments in respect thereof under the Support Agreement (in
the case of SBC), at the times, place and rate, and in the
coin or currency, herein prescribed.

The Notes are issued in registered form without coupons.

When Notes are presented to the Registrar with a request to
register their transfer or to exchange them for an equal
principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations
and like tenor, the Registrar shall register the transfer or
make the exchange if its requirements for such transactions
are met. Capital Corporation will not make any charge for any
registration of transfer or exchange but may require the
payment by the party requesting such registration of transfer
or exchange of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Ownership of Notes shall be proved by the register for the
Notes kept by the Registrar. Capital Corporation, SBC, the
Trustee and any agent of Capital Corporation may treat the
person in whose name a Note is registered as the absolute
owner thereof for all purposes.

No director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of
Capital Corporation or SBC shall have any liability for any
obligations of Capital Corporation or SBC under this Note, the
Indenture or the Support Agreement or for any claim based on,
in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting this Note waives and
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for the issue of this Note.
<PAGE>

All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

The Indenture and this Note shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the law of the State of New York.
