NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Quarter ended September 30, 1994
(Unaudited; in millions)

The Company's press release on the results of operations for the third quarter 
of 1994 was released to the public on October 18, 1994. This condensed 
financial information is prepared for the purpose of filing a summary of third- 
quarter 1994 financial information, which was included in the Company's press 
release on October 18, 1994, with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1) On June 30, 1993, the Company acquired from The Coca-Cola Company: 
(i) Coca-Cola Beverages Nederland B.V. in the Netherlands; (ii) Roddy 
Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Inc.; and (iii) Coca-Cola Bottling of 
Johnson City, Tennessee. The results of operations of these companies 
are included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from
the beginning of third-quarter 1993. 

(2) Per share data calculated prior to rounding to millions.

(3) Reported nine-month 1994 cash operating profit includes the effect of the 
acquisitions referred to in note (1) above. After appropriate 
adjustments to eliminate the effects of these acquisitions, comparable 
nine-month 1994 cash operating profit increased approximately 8% as 
compared to the same prior year period.

(4) After adjusting third-quarter and nine-month 1993 results for the effect 
of acquisitions, comparable physical case, bottle and can volume 
increased approximately 7% and 4%, respectively, as compared to the same 
prior year periods.
