Item 2. Disposition of Assets
- - ------- ---------------------

Proler International Corp., (the "Company") disposed of
substantially all of its assets, including real property,
improvements, fixtures, equipment, and inventory, used in
connection with the operation of a scrap metal processing
facility located in Vinton (El Paso), Texas, effective April
29, 1994. The disposition was effected pursuant to an Asset
Sale and Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") by and between
the Company and Commercial Metals Company (the "Purchaser"),
a Delaware corporation unrelated Company or the officers,
directors or other affiliates of the Company or their
associates. The Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2(a) to
this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

The purchase price for the assets and the agreement not to
compete was determined by negotiation between the parties,
aggregated approximately $2.6 million and was paid to the
Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits
- - ------- ---------------------------------

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information
-------------------------------
The following pro forma financial statements have been
prepared to give effect to the disposition of assets
described in Item 2 above and to a disposition of similar
assets located in Kansas City, Kansas on February 28, 1994
as previously reported by the Company on Form 8-K, filed
on March 14, 1994. In the prior transaction, Prolerized
Steel Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
sold assets to Kaw River Shredding, Inc., a Kansas
corporation, for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $5.1 million. The Pro Forma Condensed Balance
Sheet set forth below gives effect to both transactions as
if they occurred on January 31, 1994. The Pro Forma
Condensed Statement of Operations for the year ended
January 31, 1994 gives effect to the transactions as if 
they occurred as of the beginning of the year presented as
more fully explained in notes (a), (b) and (c) thereto.

This pro forma presentation does not purport to represent
what the Company's results of operations or financial
position would actually have been if such transactions had
taken place on such dates or to project the Company's
results of operations or financial position for any
future period or date.

The adjustments for the pro forma presentation are based on
available information and on certain assumptions which
management believes are reasonable. The pro forma condensed
financial statements and the accompanying notes should be
read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year
ended January 31, 1994.

-------

(a) Time and Place. The closing ("Closing") of the

Mayor, Day, Caldwell & Keeton, L.L.P., 700 Louisiana, 19th Floor,
Houston, Texas 77002 at 9:00 a.m. on April 29, 1994; provided,
that if the Closing does not take place on such date it shall take
place on such other date, at such other place, or at such other
time as the parties may mutually agree upon; and provided further,
that neither party shall be obliged to agree to a later date for 
the Closing. The date of the Closing determined as provided herein
is referred to as the Closing Date. The parties agree that time is
of the essence with respect to the Closing. The transactions contemplated 
by this Agreement shall be effective as of the close of business on the 
Closing Date. 

(b) Risk of Loss. Title, possession and risk of loss
------------
for destruction or damage to the Assets shall pass to Purchaser as
of the effective time of the Closing; provided, however, that this
Section 6(b) shall not diminish, limit or otherwise impair in any 
manner Purchaser's or Seller's rights under the other provisions of
this Agreement that apportion liability among the parties with
respect to events, occurrences or omissions arising or occurring
during specified periods. If, prior to the Closing, all or any
material part of the Assets are (a) materially damaged so as to be
unfit for their intended purpose, (b) destroyed or lost through
fire, flood, vandalism, theft or act of God or (c) Sellers'
possession and use thereof is otherwise interfered with as a result
of expropriation, condemnation or other taking or as a result of
any accident or other casualty, Purchaser shall have the option
either to: (i) accept title to the Assets, including any affected 
Assets, without any abatement of the Purchase Price whatsoever, in
which event, on the Closing Date, all of the insurance proceeds and
other monies paid or due Seller from the insurance carrier or
rights arising in connection with such damage shall be assigned by 
the Seller to Purchaser and any deductible or self insurance
retention amount maintained by Seller with regard to such insurance
shall be paid by Seller to Purchaser; or (ii) terminate this
Agreement. 

7. Property and Environmental Inspection; Environmental
Indemnity. 
---------------------------------------------------------

(a) Right of Inspection. (i) Prior to the date hereof,
-------------------
and subject to the Site Access Agreement, Seller has made the
Property available to Purchaser and Purchaser's environmental
consultant (collectively with any other party or parties assisting
Purchaser in its inspection of the Property, the "Consultant") for
inspection. Such inspection has included the right to take soil
and water samples, to inspect the IFE and Inventory and to conduct
appropriate environmental tests relating thereto. For purposes of
this inspection, the Property has been divided into two parcels: 
the "Business parcel," on which the IFE are principally located,
and the "agricultural parcel." 

(ii) The Consultant has delivered its draft report on the
Business parcel to Purchaser. Purchaser provided a copy thereof to
Seller, and Seller has reviewed such draft report and provided
Purchaser with Seller's comments upon such draft report. Seller
has received splits of certain soil samples for analysis. Seller
and Purchaser will continue to work together in good faith to agree
upon the results and conclusions to be set forth in such
environmental due diligence report prior to the Consultant making
such report final.

(iii)No environmental due diligence report has yet been
prepared or delivered by the Consultant with respect to the
agricultural parcel. Purchaser and Seller agree that such report
will also be first issued in draft form and Seller shall be given
the opportunity to review the draft and to correct factual
inaccuracies therein. Upon Seller's request, splits of any soil or
water samples relating to the agricultural parcel shall be
immediately delivered to Seller. Seller and Purchaser will work
together in good faith to agree upon the results and conclusions to
be set forth in such environmental due diligence report prior to
the Consultant making such report final.

(iv) No subsurface testing or drilling shall be performed
by Purchaser, the Consultant or any other party on behalf of
Purchaser without the prior written consent of Seller. Purchaser
agrees that Seller shall have the right to pre-approve any 
subcontractors to be hired by any Consultant, and that the
Consultant and any subcontractor hired by the Consultant shall have
liability insurance coverage of a type and amount acceptable to
Seller and that Purchaser will require any consultant retained to
name Seller as an additional insured on consultant's policies. 

(v) Seller agrees to make available to Consultant all
information including results of prior environmental audits,
samples, tests or other data gathered in regard to the Property or
Seller's operations which are in the possession of Seller. Seller
further agrees to permit and assist the Consultant in reviewing
such documents as are in Seller's possession or provided to Seller
by Purchaser, including permits, permit applications and other
books and records as may be necessary to evaluate the Property and
Seller's compliance with environmental laws and regulations. 
Seller agrees to permit Purchaser and Purchaser's consultants to
interview, should the same be necessary, Seller's employees
concerning the history of operations as conducted on the Property. 
Purchaser shall make all inspections in good faith and with due
diligence, and splits of any further samples taken for analysis
shall be made available to Seller immediately upon Seller's
request. 

(vi) If the Consultant determines that any remediation or
clean up action is required by applicable law to be taken with
regard to removal or treatment of any contaminated soil, water, or
other materials found on or in the Property, Purchaser shall notify
Seller of such determination no later than three (3) business days
prior to the Closing Date and request that Seller perform the
necessary remediation or clean up (a "Remediation Request"). In
the event that Purchaser makes such a Remediation Request, Seller
may, if necessary, extend the Closing Date of this Agreement in
order to fulfill such Remediation Request. If Seller's good faith
estimate of the cost to fulfill such Remediation Request exceeds
the difference (the "Difference") of (A) One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000.00) minus (B) the sum of all amounts spent by
Seller (exclusive of the amount estimated to fulfill such
Remediation Request) subsequent to April 1, 1994 to remediate any
portion of the Property, to fill and plug any abandoned wells on
the Property or to perform at the request of Purchaser any other
clean up or similar actions on the Property (an "Optional
Request"), then Seller shall have the option of fulfilling such
Optional Request or terminating this Agreement. If Seller's good
faith estimate of the cost to fulfill such Remediation Request does
not exceed the Difference (a "Binding Request"), Seller shall be
obligated to fulfill such Binding Request. In the event that
Seller declines to fulfill a Binding Request or an Optional
Request, Purchaser may elect to terminate this Agreement by
delivering written notice of such termination to Seller on or prior
to the Closing Date. Purchaser's failure to deliver written notice 
of termination of this Agreement to Seller as provided in Section
7(a)(vi) or Section 7(a)(vii), below, shall constitute Purchaser's
agreement that Purchaser accepts the Property in accordance with
subsection (b) below.

(vii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to making any
Remediation Request pursuant to Section 7(a)(vi), if Purchaser
determines, in good faith and based upon Consultant's environmental
due diligence reports, that the Environmental Condition of the
Property is not satisfactory, Purchaser may terminate this
Agreement by delivering written notice of such termination to
Seller no later than three (3) business days prior to the Closing
Date, which notice shall specify the reason or reasons that
Purchaser believes the Property to be unsatisfactory. Failure to
specify such reason or reasons shall render the notice void and
without effect.

(viii) All inspection fees, appraisal fees, engineering

reserves the right to have a representative present at the time of
making any such inspection. Purchaser shall notify Seller not less

persons who will conduct such inspection. Purchaser agrees (A) to
return the Property to the same condition in which the Property was
prior to Purchaser's making any inspection and (B) to comply with
all applicable laws and regulations regarding installation,
plugging and abandonment of any well or boring. Such obligation
shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

(b) Condition of the Property. Except as expressly set
-------------------------
forth herein, it is understood and agreed that with respect to the
physical condition and Environmental Condition of the Property, the
Property is being sold and conveyed hereunder and, unless Purchaser
terminates this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Purchaser agrees to accept the Property "AS IS," "WHERE
IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS" and subject to any Environmental
Condition which may exist, without any representation or warranty
by Seller of any kind except as expressly provided in Section 14
(including without limitation any representation or warranty as to
the condition of the Property, the availability of utilities or
other services, the suitability of the Property for purchaser's
use, workmanship and materials used in any improvements, or
otherwise). Purchaser hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees
that (i) Purchaser has or will have, prior to the Closing Date,
thoroughly inspected and examined the Property to the extent deemed
necessary by Purchaser in order to enable Purchaser to evaluate the
purchase of the Property and (ii) Purchaser is relying solely upon
such inspections, examination, and evaluation by Purchaser in
accepting the Property on an "AS IS," "WHERE IS" and "WITH ALL
FAULTS" basis, without representations (other than the limited
representations set forth in Section 14), warranties or covenants,
(other than the indemnity set forth in the letter delivered by
Seller to Purchaser at the Closing (the "Closing Letter")), express
or implied, of any kind of nature. Purchaser hereby assumes the
risk that Environmental Conditions may exist on the Property and
except with respect to the obligations of Seller expressly set
forth in the Closing Letter hereby releases Seller of and from any
and all claims, actions, demands, rights, damages, costs or
expenses which might arise out of or in connection with the
Environmental Condition of the Property.

(c) Transfer of Property. The Property shall be
--------------------
conveyed to Purchaser pursuant to a special warranty deed (the
"Deed") substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, which Deed
shall be subject to the permitted exceptions as described in
Section 17(e) below. 

8. Inventory.
---------

(a) Purchase and Valuation of Unprepared Inventory. 
Seller agrees to sell and Purchaser agrees to buy all unprepared
ferrous Inventory. Prior to the Closing a representative of
Purchaser and Seller shall conduct a joint inspection and appraisal
of the Inventory. Seller shall make available such personnel and
equipment as may be necessary to move and weigh the unprepared
ferrous Inventory in order to assure Purchaser and Seller that an
accurate and complete physical inspection has been taken in order
to properly value the unprepared ferrous Inventory. Following the
joint inspection and appraisal, Purchaser and Seller shall endeavor
to agree upon a mutually acceptable price for the unprepared
ferrous Inventory.

(b) Resolution of Inventory Disputes. In the event the
--------------------------------
parties are unable to agree upon a mutually acceptable price for
all or any part of the unprepared ferrous Inventory prior to the
Closing Date, the parties shall submit the valuation of the
unprepared ferrous Inventory or unprepared ferrous Inventory items
in dispute to a neutral third party familiar with the scrap
processing industry and acceptable to both parties (hereinafter the
"Arbitrator"). In the event the parties are unable to agree on the 
Arbitrator, either party may ask the Executive Director of the
Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries to designate the
Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall, within forty eight hours after
designation, inspect together with a representative of each of
Seller and Purchaser, the unprepared ferrous Inventory. Prior to
the Arbitrator's inspection the representatives of Seller and the
Purchaser shall inform the Arbitrator and each other in writing of
the value placed on the unprepared ferrous Inventory by that party. 
Following the inspection the Arbitrator shall select the valuation
of either Seller or Purchaser which, in the sole opinion of the
Arbitrator, most closely approximates the value of the unprepared
ferrous Inventory. The valuation selected by the Arbitrator shall
be the price to be paid by Purchaser and received by Seller for the
unprepared ferrous Inventory at closing. All travel and out of
pocket expenses incurred by the Arbitrator and a fee of Three
Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) which the parties agree is appropriate
should the services of the Arbitrator be needed, shall be charged
at the Closing to the party whose valuation is not selected by the
Arbitrator. The Closing Date shall be postponed until the receipt
of the Arbitrator's decision which shall be rendered within
twenty-four hours of the inspection.

(c) Retained Inventory. Seller will retain all
------------------
Inventory other than the unprepared ferrous Inventory and will
remove such Inventory from the Property at its expense as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date and no later than close of 
business May 9, 1994. Purchaser will load such Inventory at a cost
to Seller of $2.00 per short ton onto rail car or trucks or other
means of transport provided by Seller at Seller's expense. 
Purchaser shall provide Seller and its employees and agents with
full access to the Property and reasonable use of its facilities in
connection with removal of such Inventory, including the use of
Purchaser's scales to weigh such Inventory; provided that such
removal will not unreasonably interfere with Purchaser's operations
at the facility; and provided further that such removal shall not
be deemed to violate the non-competition agreement set forth in
Section 17(b). Seller will bear the risk of loss for all such
Inventory after the Closing Date. Any Inventory retained by Seller
which is not removed from the Property by close of business May 9,
1994 shall become the property of Purchaser without additional
payment to Seller.

9. Accounts Receivable. Seller will deliver to Purchaser
-------------------
within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date a complete listing
of all of the Accounts Receivable and will notify in writing each
customer with an Account Receivable that remittances in payment
thereof should be directed to Seller at a stated address. 
Notwithstanding such notice, if after the Closing Date, (i)
Purchaser receives any monies from a customer that are designated
to be applied to an Account Receivable, it will immediately forward
to Seller such monies in the form received and (ii) Purchaser
receives any monies from a customer with an Account Receivable not
designated to an Account Receivable or to payments for scrap
purchased from Purchaser, it shall inquire of the customer how the
customer desires to have the payment applied and immediately
forward to Seller such monies the customer desires to be applied to
Seller's Account Receivable. In the event the amount so forwarded
exceeds the amount of such Account Receivable, Seller shall
promptly remit such excess to Purchaser. 

10. Employees. It is understood that Seller's employees
---------
directly involved in the operation of the Assets will be terminated
as of the Closing Date. Seller shall give any notice required
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act of 1988, as amended,
and shall be responsible for payments, if any, to Seller's
employees pursuant to said Act. Purchaser shall have the
opportunity to interview and consider Seller's employees for
employment in connection with its operation of the Assets and
Seller shall make appropriate premises on the Property reasonably
available during times mutually convenient for the parties to
conduct such interviews and Seller shall permit any employee to
attend such an interview during normal working hours. Purchaser
shall not be under any obligation to employ, and Seller shall not
be under any obligation to attempt to cause Purchaser to employ,
those persons who are interviewed by Purchaser. The employees of
Seller shall not be deemed to be third party beneficiaries of the
provisions of this Section and no such employee shall acquire any
right hereunder.

11. Prorations; Taxes. Seller and Purchaser agree that
-----------------
utility expenses in connection with the Assets and ad valorem,
property and other taxes based on the value of the Assets shall be

owed under any contract assigned pursuant to this Agreement shall
be prorated to the Closing Date based on services provided or
equipment used thereunder before and after the Closing Date. All
sums owing to a party hereunder shall be paid to such party within
twenty (20) days of delivery of a written accounting of the
prorated items. Purchaser shall pay for the cost of all other
transfer and sales taxes, if any, tax certificates and fees payable
as a result of the sale, transfer, conveyance and assignment of
Assets provided for herein and shall furnish to Seller receipts,
certificates or other evidence of such payment satisfactory to

indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless against and from any all
taxes, claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and other
expenses of defending any actions or claims, amounts of judgments
and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, all of the foregoing
being called "Costs"), incurred by Purchaser and arising out of or
attributable to (i) any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant made by Seller herein or in any certificate or writing
furnished by Seller pursuant hereto, (ii) any nonfulfillment of any
agreement hereunder or entered into in connection herewith by
Seller, (iii) Seller's performance or non-performance prior to the

to the Closing, in each case other than to the extent expressly
assumed by Purchaser or released pursuant to Sections 5 and 7
hereof. Purchaser shall, within ten (10) days after the service of
process in a lawsuit, or promptly after it receives notice from any
third party that such party intends to assert a claim which could
result in indemnification hereunder, give Seller written notice of
such claim and provide Seller with a copy of such process or claim. 
"Promptly" for purposes of this Section 16(a) shall mean giving
notice within thirty (30) days. Seller shall have the right to
assume the defense of any such claim or lawsuit asserted against
Purchaser by a third party, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, and in such event, Seller will not be liable to
Purchaser for any further legal or other expenses incurred by
Purchaser in connection with the defense thereof, other than the
reasonable cost of investigation or assistance required by
Purchaser. Purchaser may, however, participate actively, at its
sole expense, in any such lawsuit. If Seller so assumes the
defense of any such claim or lawsuit all costs of the defense
thereof shall thereafter be borne by Seller and it shall have the 
authority to compromise and settle such claim or lawsuit or to
appeal (or cause Purchaser to appeal) any adverse judgment or
ruling with the cost of such appeal to be paid by Seller; provided,
however, that if any such compromise or settlement would divest
Purchaser of any Asset transferred pursuant to this Agreement or if
Purchaser may have any unindemnified liability arising out of such
claim or lawsuit, Seller shall have the authority to compromise or
settle such claim or lawsuit only with the written consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
Seller shall have the right to approve any out of court settlement
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of any claim or
lawsuit for which it does not assume the defense, if Seller is to
be liable to Purchaser hereunder for indemnification with respect
thereto. Purchaser and Seller will cooperate fully with each other
with respect to discovery, inquiries or investigations in
connection with any claim or lawsuit for which indemnity is sought 
hereunder. Purchaser shall not have the right to offset any sums
due Purchaser under this provision against any payments of whatever

----------------------------
indemnify and hold Seller harmless against any and all Costs, as
defined in Section 16(a), incurred by Seller and arising out of or
attributable to (i) any breach of any representation, warranty or 
covenant made by Purchaser herein or in any certificate or writing
furnished by Purchaser pursuant hereto, (ii) any nonfulfillment of
any agreement hereunder or entered into in connection herewith by
Purchaser; (iii) the failure of Purchaser to fulfill the
obligations specifically assumed by it pursuant to this Agreement
or (iv) any claim arising out of or by virtue of or based upon any
act of Purchaser in connection with Purchaser's hiring of any of
Seller's current employees or Purchaser's operation of the Assets
or conduct of any of its businesses after the Closing Date. Seller
shall, within ten (10) days after the service of process in a
lawsuit, or promptly after it receives notice from any third party
that such party intends to assert a claim which could result in
indemnification hereunder, give Purchaser written notice of such
claim and provide Purchaser with a copy of such process or claim. 
"Promptly" for purposes of this Section 16(b) shall mean giving
notice within thirty (30) days. Purchaser shall have the right to 
assume the defense of any such claim or lawsuit asserted against
Seller by a third party, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, and in such event, Purchaser will not be liable to
Seller for any further legal or other expenses incurred by
Purchaser in connection with the defense thereof, other than the
reasonable cost of investigation or assistance required by Seller. 
Seller may, however, participate actively, at its sole expense, in
any such lawsuit. If Purchaser assumes the defense of any such
claim or lawsuit, all costs of the defense thereof shall thereafter
be borne by Purchaser and it shall have the authority to compromise
and settle such claim or lawsuit or to appeal (or cause Seller to
appeal) any adverse judgment or ruling with the cost of such appeal
to be paid by Purchaser; provided, however, that if Seller may have
any unindemnified liability arising out of such claim or lawsuit,
Purchaser shall have the authority to compromise or settle such
claim or lawsuit only with the written consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser shall have
the right to approve any out of court settlement (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld) of any claim or lawsuit for
which it does not assume the defense, if Purchaser is to be liable
to Seller for indemnification hereunder with respect thereto. 
Seller and Purchaser will cooperate fully with each other with
respect to discovery, inquiries or investigations in connection
with any claim or lawsuit for which indemnity is sought hereunder. 
Seller shall not have the right to offset any sums due Seller under
this provision against any payments of whatever kind due to
Purchaser from Seller.

(c) Limitation Periods. The rights of Purchaser and
------------------
Seller to make claims for indemnification under this Section shall
be limited as follows:

(i) With respect to any claims for breaches of the
representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser set forth in
Sections 14 and 15, such claims shall be limited to those of which
Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, is notified pursuant to 
this Agreement within eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date;
provided, that there shall be no contractual limitation period with
respect to any breach of any such representation or warranty
arising out of an intentional misstatement or an intentional
failure to disclose a material fact and the only limitation on when
such claims may be asserted shall be that imposed by any applicable
statutes of limitation.

(ii) With respect to a breach of the non-competition
covenant set forth in Section 17(b) or claims relating to taxes
payable by either party, or leases, contracts or agreements which
either party is or will be obligated to perform or discharge
pursuant to this Agreement, there shall be no contractual
limitation period and the only limitation on when such claims may
be asserted shall be that imposed by any applicable statutes of
limitation; and

(iii)With respect to Costs incurred as a result of
claims by third parties, there shall be no contractual limitation
period and the only limitation on when such claims may be asserted
shall be that imposed by any applicable statutes of limitation.

(d) Limitation of Liability. Except with respect to
-----------------------
Costs incurred as a result of claims by third parties (as to which
there shall be no limit on liability) the aggregate amount of the
liability of Seller hereunder shall not exceed an amount equal to
one-half the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no party shall be entitled to make
claims for indemnification under this Section until the aggregate 
amount of such claims made shall exceed $30,000.

17. Further Covenants of Seller. Seller hereby covenants and
---------------------------
agrees as follows:

(a) Best Efforts. Seller will use its best efforts, as
------------
applicable, to cause to be fulfilled the conditions to Closing set
out in Sections 19 and 20.

(b) Non-Competition Agreement. As a material inducement
-------------------------
to Purchaser to purchase the Assets, Seller agrees that for a
period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date, neither
Seller nor any affiliate of Seller (which term for purposes of this 
clause (b) shall mean any corporation, partnership or other entity
controlled directly or indirectly by Seller) will directly or
indirectly: 

(i) own, manage, operate, control or participate in
the ownership, management, operation or control of, or otherwise
engage in the business of processing, recycling or salvaging
automobiles or household appliances (each a "Restricted Metal") at
a yard, plant, or office located within a distance of 250 miles of
El Paso County, Texas; or

(ii) engage in the business of processing, recycling
or salvaging a Restricted Metal at Seller's facility located near
Randolph, Arizona;

(iii)buy, either as a principal or as a broker, any
Restricted Metal located at a yard, plant or office located within
250 miles of El Paso County, Texas; or

(iv) sell, either as a principal or as a broker, any
ferrous scrap processed from a Restricted Metal for delivery to a
yard, plant or office located within 250 miles of El Paso County,
Texas; 

provided, however, that clauses (ii) and (iii) of this
Section 17(b) shall not, and shall not be interpreted to, apply to
any of the joint ventures or partnerships in which Seller or an
affiliate of Seller is a joint venturer or partner as of the date
hereof, but Seller will not recommend to, or encourage, any such
joint venture, partnership or any party engaged therein to effect
the types of transactions restricted by said clauses (i) and (ii)
within the area there specified; and provided further that this
Section 17(b) shall not, and shall not be interpreted to, prevent
Seller or any affiliate of Seller from (i) purchasing, shredding 
or otherwise processing tin cans, tin-coated steel, tin-free
thin-gauge steel, light-gauge iron or other materials not expressly
restricted by the foregoing provisions or (ii) purchasing or
processing automobile shredder residue or other materials in
connection with Proler's thermal conversion technology and (iii)
selling any scrap so purchased or any products produced from any
such process. The parties agree that in the case of a breach by
Seller of any of the foregoing covenants, damages would be
difficult, if not impossible, to prove, and Purchaser shall be
entitled to injunctive relief as its primary but not exclusive
remedy against Seller. If Seller is found to have violated any of
the foregoing covenants, the parties agree that the duration of the
non-competition period set forth above shall be automatically
extended by the same period of time that Seller is determined to be
in violation of the foregoing covenants. The parties hereby
further agree that the restrictions and obligations herein set
forth are reasonably necessary for the protection of the value of
the substantial assets Purchaser is acquiring from Seller pursuant
to this Agreement. If any of the foregoing restrictions should be
finally determined by any court to be unenforceable in any
particular area or jurisdiction or enforceable in such area or
jurisdiction only if modified in duration or scope, then the
parties agree that this Agreement shall be amended and modified so
as to eliminate therefrom the particular area or jurisdiction as to
which such restriction is so held to be unenforceable or deemed
amended or modified in duration or scope to comply with such court
order; and as to all other areas and jurisdictions, the terms and
provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect as
originally written. The provisions of this Section and the rights
and remedies to enforce such provisions shall be assignable in
favor of any successor of Purchaser.

(c) Conduct of Business Pending Closing. Seller agrees
-----------------------------------
that pending the Closing and except as otherwise consented to or
approved by Purchaser in writing: Seller (i) shall carry on the
Business in the normal course and substantially in the same manner
as heretofore, (ii) will continue all normal repairs, servicing,
replacement, maintenance and upkeep of the IFE and the Inventory in
substantially the same manner as heretofore, (iii) will not make
any sale or gift of any IFE without the prior written consent of
Purchaser; (iv) will not make any capital addition to the IFE
without the prior written consent of Purchaser and (v) will
maintain all insurance now in force covering the Assets.

(d) Access to Information, Premises. Pending the
-------------------------------
Closing, Seller shall give to Purchaser, its counsel, accountants,
employees, and other representatives, reasonable access, after
reasonable notice, during normal business hours, to all of Seller's 
properties, contracts, and commitments which relate to the Assets. 
Pending the Closing, Seller shall cause its employees and counsel,
after reasonable notice, to be reasonably available to assist
Purchaser with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) Title Commitment. Seller has delivered to Purchaser
----------------
a title commitment ("Title Commitment") issued by Partners Title
Company (the "Title Company"), along with copies of the title
exceptions affecting the Property and which are referred to in the 
Title Commitment. Seller, at its cost, has delivered to Purchaser
a current, on-the-ground survey of the Property (the "Survey")
prepared by a licensed professional surveyor which includes field
notes with metes and bounds description showing (i) the actual
dimension of the area within the Property, (ii) the outside
boundary lines of all improvements, (iii) the location of any
easements, set back lines, encroachments, overlaps, roadways or
waterways, and (iv) all easements or other matters referred to in 
the Title Commitment. If the Survey or the Title Commitment makes
reference to any title exceptions or encumbrances other than those
listed on Schedule E, then Purchaser may give notice to Seller and
the Title Company which describes in detail its objection to any of
such exceptions or encumbrances (the "objectionable exceptions" )
not later than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date. 
If notice of objection is not given to Seller and the Title Company
within such period, then any objection to the exceptions or
encumbrances shall be deemed to have been waived by Purchaser, and
all such exceptions or encumbrances shall be permitted exceptions. 
Seller shall have the right (including without limitation the right
to use all or any part of the Purchase Price for this purpose), but
not the obligation, up to the Closing to cure or remove any
objectionable exceptions, so that the owner policy of title
insurance can be issued to Purchaser at the Closing, without making
exception to the objectionable exceptions; provided, further, that 
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any such objectionable
exceptions and Seller will be deemed to have satisfied the
requirements of this Section 17(e), if despite the failure by
Seller to cure or remove those objectionable exceptions, the Title
Company is willing to issue an owner policy of title insurance
without making exception to the objectionable exceptions. If at or
prior to the Closing Seller notifies Purchaser that Seller is
unable or unwilling to cure or remove any such objectionable
exceptions, then Purchaser shall have the option of giving notice
to Seller within ten (10) days after receipt of Seller's notice or
on the date of the Closing, whichever date first occurs, either to
terminate this Agreement or to waive any such objections, in which
case the objectionable exceptions shall be permitted exceptions;
and if no such notice is given by Purchaser, then Purchaser will be
deemed to have elected to waive any such objections.
