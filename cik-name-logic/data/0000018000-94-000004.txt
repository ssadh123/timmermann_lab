Item 5 - Other Events

Carter-Wallace, Inc. announced on August 1, 1994 that it had sent
a letter to approximately 240,000 physicians recommending, in
conjunction with the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the
immediate withdrawal of patients from treatment with Felbatol
(felbamate), unless, in the physician's judgment, an abrupt
withdrawal would be deemed to pose a more serious risk to the
patient. Patients on Felbatol are advised to consult their
physicians and not to discontinue the use of Felbatol on their
own.

Carter-Wallace's recommendation was prompted by ten cases (nine
domestic and one foreign) of aplastic anemia in association with
the use of Felbatol. No such cases were observed during the
premarketing, clinical testing and development of Felbatol.

Carter-Wallace introduced Felbatol in September of 1993 for the
treatment of partial seizures with and without secondary
generalization in adults and for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a
serious form of childhood epilepsy.
