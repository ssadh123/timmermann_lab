SNET ANNOUNCES FLAT 1993 EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
WITH WEAK ECONOMY AND INCREASING COMPETITION

Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation (NYSE: SNG) 
today announced essentially flat earnings of $2.53 per share for 
1993 compared with $2.56 for 1992 from continuing operations before 
the extraordinary charge and accounting changes and excluding a 
restructuring charge. With those charges, the company recorded a 
net loss for 1993 of $318.1 million compared with net income for 
1992 of $151.4 million or ($4.99) versus $2.44 per share.
The net loss and net income figures include these previously 
announced after-tax charges:

"The weak economy and the impact of increasing competition 
continue to pressure earnings. In spite of the difficult year, we 
are holding our own and taking key steps such as our restructuring 
efforts to position SNET for growth over the long term," said Daniel 
J. Miglio, SNET chairman, president, and chief executive officer.
"I am excited about our recently announced plan to invest $4.5 
billion over the next 15 years to transform our statewide 
telecommunications network into an information superhighway called 
I-SNET. It represents our vision of the future. In a complementary 
initiative, we launched one of the first video-on-demand trials in 
the nation. We also started up SNET America, which offers a full 
range of interstate and international long-distance services. We 
will continue to pursue new opportunities for growth and offer new 
services that make us the information-age company of choice for 
customers," he added. 
Consolidated revenues and sales for 1993 were up 2.4 percent to 
$1,653.6 million compared with $1,614.4 million for 1992. The 
telephone company's revenues reflect a 5.6 percent drop for in-state 
toll revenue due mainly to competitive price reductions. Revenue 
from network-access charges increased 4.4 percent to $342.8 
million. Revenue from the company's directory-publishing business 
decreased 3.8 percent.
Sales from other businesses declined 6.1 percent, mainly because 
of our planned withdrawal from the PBX-systems market in favor of 
concentration on our own network-based centrex services. Sales from 
the company's cellular operations were up 23.2 percent on a growing 
customer base.

Costs and expenses for 1993, excluding the restructuring charge 
and interest were up 3.8 percent to $1,295.0 million compared with 
$1,247.5 million for 1992. This includes a 16.6 percent increase 
in depreciation and amortization expense, due primarily to higher 
depreciation rates authorized by state and federal regulators.
Interest expense declined 6.3 percent because of less short-term 
borrowing, lower rates compared with 1992, and savings from previous 
refinancings of high-coupon debt.
For the fourth quarter of 1993, earnings from continuing 
operations before the extraordinary charge and without the 
restructuring charge, were $0.55 per share versus $0.64 per share 
for 1992. The net loss for the quarter was $224.0 million compared 
with net income for 1992 of $40.0 million, or ($3.51) versus $0.64 
per share.
"Higher revenues for the quarter were offset primarily by the 
higher depreciation rates now in effect," said Mr. Miglio.
Fourth quarter 1993 revenues and sales were $426.5 million 
compared with $405.9 million. Costs and expenses, excluding the 
restructuring charge and interest, were $348.1 million compared with 
$312.7 million.
Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation is an 
independent telecommunications company that offers through its 
subsidiaries network and information-management services and 
communications systems; long-distance service; directory publishing 
and advertising services; and cellular mobile phone and paging 
services.
