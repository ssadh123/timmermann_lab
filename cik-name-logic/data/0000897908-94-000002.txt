ELGIN, IL January 31, 1994 -- Katy Industries, Inc. (NYSE: KT)

The Board of Directors took further action appointing
Charles W. Sahlman, Philip E. Johnson and William F. Andrews as a
committee to evaluate and recommend to the Board of Directors at a
March 8, 1994 Board of Directors meeting which of the following, a
self tender at a fixed price, a Dutch auction or a dividend of not
less than $10 per share (any one or combination of the foregoing)
that the Company should take to maximize shareholder values. No
assurance can be given as to whether or when any such action may be
taken.

Both of the foregoing actions were recommended to the
Board of Directors by the Special Committee that had been
evaluating the Steinhardt/Pensler proposal.
