ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On August 9, 1994 the Registrant, Summit Health Ltd. ("Summit"), acquired
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center ("Fountain Valley"), a
provider of tertiary care hospital services, from an unrelated seller, Fountain
Valley Medical Development Co., a California limited partnership ("FVMDC") with
principal offices at 11180 Warner Avenue, Fountain Valley, California 92708.
Fountain Valley, located on a 38-acre campus in Fountain Valley, California,
contains a 413-bed acute care hospital, a surgery center, an imaging center and
four medical office buildings aggregating approximately 250,000 square feet of
office space. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 1993, Fountain Valley's
total revenues, EBITDA (as defined below) and net income from continuing
operations were approximately $120.8 million, $21.6 million and $8.0 million,
respectively. Summit intends to continue the use of Fountain Valley as a
provider of hospital services. Fountain Valley's "EBITDA" refers to Fountain
Valley's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and
non-recurring items.

Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement")
dated as of July 20, 1994, on August 9, 1994 FVMDC sold to Summit all of the
outstanding shares and partnership interests of certain corporations and
partnerships relating to Fountain Valley. Pursuant to an Agreement of Sale and
Purchase (the "Real Estate Purchase Agreement") dated as of July 21, 1994, on
August 9, 1994 an unrelated real estate investment trust ("REIT") purchased and
is leasing to a subsidiary of the Registrant certain of Fountain Valley's real
estate, including the four medical office buildings. The aggregate consideration
paid for Fountain Valley was approximately $145 million (the "Purchase Price"),
subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Approximately $104 million of the
Purchase Price was paid in cash by Summit under the Stock Purchase Agreement and
the balance of the Purchase Price, approximately $41 million, was paid in cash
by the REIT pursuant to the Real Estate Purchase Agreement.

The source of the funds utilized by Summit to consummate its acquisition of
Fountain Valley was a borrowing under the $700 million bank credit facility of
Summit and its parent corporation, OrNda HealthCorp ("OrNda") (the Credit,
Security, Guaranty and Pledge Agreement (the "Bank Credit Facility") dated as of
April 19, 1994, among OrNda, Summit and AHM Acquisition Co., Inc., as borrowers,
the lenders named therein and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as administrative agent
for the lenders). OrNda and Summit will refinance this borrowing with some of
the net proceeds of their issuance of $125 million principal amount of their
11 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2004 (the "Notes"). The Notes were issued
on August 23, 1994 in an underwritten public offering managed by Merrill Lynch &
Co. and co-managed by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation,
Salomon Brothers Inc. and Citicorp Securities, Inc.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY MEDICAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
APRIL 30, 1994

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Fountain Valley
Medical Development Company (the "Partnership") have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair
presentation have been included. Operating results for the fiscal year 1994
interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the twelve months ended October 31, 1994. The balance sheet at
October 31, 1993, was derived from the audited financial statements of the
Partnership.

2. INCOME TAXES

The Partnership is not subject to federal or state income taxes. The
results of the Partnership's operations are allocated to and included in the tax
returns of the partners. Accordingly, no income tax provision is reflected in
the accompanying financial statements. Net income for financial reporting
purposes differs from taxable income to be reported by the partners due to
differences between tax accounting methods and generally accepted accounting
principles which are used for financial reporting.

3. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On May 5, 1994, the Partnership entered into a letter of intent to be
acquired by OrNda HealthCorp for $145 million. The transaction is subject to
execution of a definitive agreement, consent of certain of OrNda HealthCorp's
lenders and other customary closing conditions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Executive Committee and Partners
Fountain Valley Medical Development Company
and Subsidiaries
Fountain Valley, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fountain Valley
Medical Development Company and Subsidiaries as of October 31, 1993 and 1992,
and the related consolidated statements of income, partners' equity and cash
flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated 1993 and 1992 financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Fountain Valley Medical Development Company and Subsidiaries at October 31, 1993
and 1992, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years
then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for income taxes in 1993.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY MEDICAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY
AND SUBSIDIARIES

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the parent, Fountain Valley Medical Development Company (the
"Company"), a California limited partnership and its wholly owned California
corporate subsidiaries, Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center
(the "Hospital"), MCS Administrative Services, Inc. ("MCS"), Fountain Valley
Health Care ("FVHC"), and Fountain Valley Imaging Corporation ("FVI Corp."),
Fountain Valley Outpatient Surgery Center ("FVOSC"), a California limited
partnership, and Fountain Valley Imaging Center ("FVIC"), a California limited
partnership. FVHC was formed in January 1992 and FVI Corp. was formed in June
1993. FVOSC was an operating division of the Company and on January 1, 1992
became a separate legal entity and is now included as a subsidiary. The Company
owns a 99% limited partnership interest in FVOSC and FVHC owns the sole 1%
general partnership interest in FVOSC. The Company was a 50% partner in FVIC and
accounted for this joint venture under the equity method of accounting through
March 31, 1992. Effective April 1, 1992, the Company purchased the remaining 50%
ownership in FVIC and includes FVIC in consolidation. The Company owns a 99%
limited partnership interest in FVIC and FVI Corp. owns the sole 1% general
partnership interest in FVIC. All significant intercompany transactions and
stockholdings have been eliminated.

Third-Party Reimbursement Programs. Approximately 47% and 44% of the gross
revenue of the Hospital is derived from patient charges under the Medicare and
Medi-Cal programs for 1993 and 1992. The provisions of these agreements
stipulate that services are to be reimbursed at prospective rates, daily rates
or costs rather than regular rates. The estimated rates or costs are paid to the
Hospital at a tentative rate, and final reimbursement for these services is
determined after submission of annual cost reports by the Hospital and audits by
the program intermediaries. Provision for estimated final reimbursement has been
provided for in the financial statements. The Hospital also provides, as an
adjustment to its provision for contractual allowances, for the results of prior
year audits by agencies administering the programs and agreed upon by the
Hospital in the year of the audit. Cost reports have been filed through the 1992
fiscal year and audited through the 1991 fiscal year.

Allowances and Uncollectibles. The Hospital records its accounts
receivable at their gross amount with an appropriate allowance until collection.

Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
basis) or market.

Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost and are
depreciated using accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated
useful lives as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
ESTIMATED
CLASSIFICATION USEFUL LIVES
----------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------
<S> <C>
Land improvements...................................................... 5 to 15 years
Buildings and improvements............................................. 3 to 30 years
Equipment.............................................................. 3 to 15 years
Equipment under capital leases......................................... 5 to 10 years
</TABLE>

Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures which
materially increase the value of properties or extend useful lives are
capitalized.

Deferred Charges. Deferred charges consist primarily of deferred loan fees
which are amortized over the life of the related loans. Also included are
capitalized costs incurred for the start-up of additional operating units. These
costs are amortized over five years.

Excess Purchase Price and Intangibles. The excess purchase price of FVIC
which is amortized over two years for medical records portion and forty years
for excess purchase price over book value relates to the purchase of the
remaining 50% ownership purchased in 1992.

14
<PAGE> 15

Net Patient Service Revenue. Net patient service revenue is reported at
the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payors, and
others for services rendered, including estimated retroactive adjustments under
reimbursement agreements with third-party payors. Retroactive adjustments are
accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered
and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined.

Income Taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file separate federal and
California income tax returns. Investment and job tax credits are recorded by
the subsidiaries under the flow-through method of accounting as a reduction of
the provision for income taxes when the credits are realized.

Related party receivables/payables relating to rent, which eliminate on a
consolidated basis, are accounted for on a cash basis for income tax purposes.

Employee Savings Plan. Under the Employee Savings Plan (the "Plan"),
eligible participating employees of the Company may elect to contribute up to
10% of their prior calendar year compensation to a trust for investment in
marketable securities. The Company contributes amounts equal to 50% of up to 6%
of their respective participants' contributions, which are also invested in the
trust fund.

The contributions are fully vested to the participants after seven years of
credited service. The Company's contribution to the Plan was $576,000 and
$445,000 for the years ended October 31, 1993 and 1992.

Self-Insurance. The Company provides certain benefits to its employees and
others under health and other insurance programs and is self-insured for certain
benefits under such programs. In the opinion of management, adequate provision
has been made in the financial statements for losses relating to all known and
estimated claims as of October 31, 1993 and 1992. MCS Administrative Services,
Inc. is the administrator of the program.

Reclassifications. Certain amounts in 1992 have been reclassified to
conform to current year presentation. The reclassifications have no effect upon
net income as previously reported in 1992.

Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company invests excess cash in treasury
bills, short term commercial paper and a money market account, all of which
mature within 90 days. These are stated at cost, which approximates market.

On August 20, 1990, the Company obtained a $50,000,000 senior secured
revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"), of which $40,000,000
converted to a term loan (the "Term Loan") upon the execution of a Second
Amendment to the Credit Agreement dated October 31, 1991, with monthly principal
payments commencing November 1, 1991 through July 31, 1998. The Revolving
Commitment increased from $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 and is due November 1,
1995. The Company must pay a commitment fee on any unused portion of the
revolving commitment at a rate of 1/2 of 1% per annum.

As part of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to maintain
certain financial and other covenants including a restriction on the amount of
distributions made to the partners. As of October 31, 1993 and for the year then
ended, the Company was not in compliance with two of these covenants.

The Company received a bank waiver for the two covenants they were not in
compliance with at October 31, 1993 and for the year then ended.

The Company is currently leasing various pieces of equipment under capital
leases due on various dates through 1998. Approximately $11,840,000 and
$9,200,000 of equipment has been capitalized, and $6,980,000 and $5,690,000 of
amortization has been taken as of October 31, 1993 and 1992.

4. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

Effective November 1, 1992, the Company changed its method of accounting
for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." As permitted under the new rule, prior years' financial statements have
not been restated. The adoption of the new standard had no effect on the tax
provision for 1993. (The cumulative effect of this adoption was a $1,368,000
decrease in net income.)

The variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and
pretax accounting income arises because the Company consists of partnerships and
corporations and therefore income taxes are paid by the individual partners and
corporations.

The tax effects of the significant temporary differences which comprise the
deferred tax assets and liabilities at October 31, 1993 are as follows:

5. PARTNERSHIP UNITS HELD FOR RESALE AND NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM PARTNERS FOR SALE
OF UNITS

In February 1985, the Partnership purchased certain partnership units from
existing partners. The Partnership initially paid $4,431,000 in February 1985
for approximately 5% of the units then outstanding. Through October 31, 1993,
the Company purchased a total of approximately $6,131,000 partnership units and
resold a total of approximately $3,545,000 partnership units. All resales have
been at the same per unit price as the Partnership paid in February 1985. The
majority of the units were sold in exchange for notes receivable from the
partners. The notes receivable from partners were approximately $2,162,000 and
$2,361,000 as of October 31, 1993 and 1992 and are recorded as a reduction of
equity.

6. CONTINGENCIES

The Company and Hospital maintain a $500,000 per occurrence medical
malpractice insurance policy. Occurrence basis insurance covers claims that
occur during the policy term regardless of when the claim was reported.

18
<PAGE> 19

FOUNTAIN VALLEY MEDICAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Additionally, the Company and Hospital have claims-made medical malpractice
insurance policies which cover the Company and Hospital for claims from $500,000
to $20,000,000 with 7-year prepaid discovery. Claims-made insurance covers only
those claims covered by the policy and reported to the insurance carrier during
the policy term.

As of October 31, 1993, the Hospital has no malpractice loss accruals. The
Hospital and the Company have a deductible reserve exposure of up to $247,000
for deductible liability on claims made, but not settled as of October 31, 1993.

During a prior year, the Company was joined by 118 other hospitals, as well
as another organization, in an action which was originally against four workers'
compensation insurance carriers and three other defendants alleging conspiracy
to suppress prices paid by workers' compensation insurance companies.

The action and a subsequent counterclaim between the defendants were
settled in December 1993. The settlement resulted in no liability to the
Company.

7. LEASE REVENUE

The Company's principle leasing activities consist of renting suites in
four medical office buildings. Lease terms for the medical office buildings
range from 1 to 5 years. Rental income for the years ended October 31, 1993 and
1992 was approximately $5,144,000 and $6,048,000. This rental income includes
the rent from the regional care center ("RCC") whose lease was terminated
effective June 1, 1992.

The following is a schedule of future minimum lease revenue for the four
medical office building leases:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Year ending October 31, (IN THOUSANDS)

1997........................................................ 1,554
1998........................................................ 621
-----------
Total............................................. $ 11,804
===========
</TABLE>

The Company leased to the RCC under a long-term lease agreement which the
tenant terminated effective June 1, 1992. An agreement was arrived at in which
the tenant agreed to 1) pay thirteen months additional rent and expenses from
the date of termination, 2) leave all the equipment valued at $206,000 to the
Company, and 3) leave all the leasehold improvements valued at $1,135,000 to the
Company. The Company agreed to return to the lessee any rents paid on the RCC
during the thirteen month period if a nonrelated party rented the facility, as
adjusted for various expenses to the Company. Additionally, a restricted cash
account of approximately $583,000 was established with a portion of the cash
paid by the lessee in the settlement in the event the facility was leased during
the thirteen month period. As the RCC was not leased during the thirteen month
period, the restricted cash became unrestricted during the year ended October
31, 1993. The Company recorded deferred revenue and recognized the rent and
value of the leasehold improvements ratably on a monthly basis over the thirteen
month period which expired during the year ended October 31, 1993. Rent is
included in medical building rent and other revenue. The leasehold improvements
and equipment value is included in nonoperating income.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED BALANCE SHEET

The pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the Mergers,
the acquisition of Fountain Valley, the Offering and the use of proceeds
therefrom and assumes the repurchase of 100% of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the 10 1/4% Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer by
combining (i) the balance sheet of the Company at May 31, 1994; and (ii) the
balance sheet of Fountain Valley at April 30, 1994. The pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet gives effect to the Summit Merger at April 19, 1994 and
all other transactions as if they had been consummated on May 31, 1994. Because
the Company accounted for the AHM Merger as a pooling-of-interests transaction,
the Company's historical financial data include AHM's balance sheet data and
results of operations for all periods presented. The pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet is presented for comparative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of what the combined financial position would have been
had the transactions assumed therein in fact occurred at the times assumed. The
pro forma condensed combined balance sheet should be read in conjunction with
the respective historical financial statements of the Company, Summit and
Fountain Valley incorporated by reference or included herein.

NOTE 5

As of May 31, 1994, the Company had 1.3 million shares of $.01 par value
Payable In Kind Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the "PIK
Preferred Stock") outstanding with an aggregate liquidation value of $19.3
million. Although the Company has received a financing commitment to enable the
Company to redeem the PIK Preferred Stock, the Company has not decided whether
to redeem the PIK Preferred Stock. Moreover, the PIK Preferred Stock is
convertible into the Company's Common Stock on a share for share basis.
Accordingly, because the PIK Preferred Stock redemption price is $15 per share,
the Company believes that if the Company's Common Stock price exceeds $15 per
share on the redemption date the holders of PIK Preferred Stock will convert
into the Company's Common Stock rather than accept the redemption price.

If the financing commitment were utilized, pro forma long-term debt would
increase approximately $19.3 million and shareholders' equity would be reduced
$19.3 million. If the holders of PIK Preferred Stock convert to the Company's
Common Stock, the components of shareholders' equity change but total pro forma
shareholders' equity would not change. The redemption of the PIK Preferred Stock
or the conversion of the PIK Preferred Stock into the Company's Common Stock
would not have a material impact on pro forma income.

The pro forma condensed combined income statement for the nine months ended
May 31, 1994 gives effect to the acquisition of Fountain Valley, the Mergers,
the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom and assumes the repurchase of
100% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 10 1/4% Notes pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer as if such transactions had occurred on September
1, 1992 by combining (i) the results of operations of the Company for the nine
months ended May 31, 1994 (which, because the Company accounted for the AHM
Merger as a pooling-of-interests transaction, includes the results of operations
of AHM); (ii) the results of operations of Summit for the nine months ended
March 31, 1994 (as adjusted to exclude the 43 days included in the results of
operations for OrNda), applying the purchase method of accounting; and (iii) the
results of operations of the Company for the nine months ended May 31, 1994 and
the results of operations of Fountain Valley for the nine months ended April 30,
1994, applying the purchase method of accounting. This pro forma condensed
combined income statement is presented for comparative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations in the future or of
what the combined results of operations would have been had the transactions
assumed therein been consummated during the period for which this statement is
presented. Pro forma earnings per common and common equivalent share and pro
forma weighted average shares outstanding give effect to the exchange of AHM and
Summit shares of common stock and common stock equivalents for the Company's
Common Stock and Common Stock equivalents as described by the respective merger
agreements. In addition, the pro forma condensed combined income statement does
not give effect to the cost savings, if any, which may be realized by the
Company after consummation of the Mergers or the acquisition of Fountain Valley.
This pro forma condensed combined income statement should be read in conjunction
with the historical financial statements and notes thereto of the Company and
Summit incorporated by reference herein, and those of Fountain Valley included
herein.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED INCOME STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 1993

The pro forma condensed combined income statement for the fiscal year ended
August 31, 1993 gives effect to the acquisition of Fountain Valley, the Mergers,
the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom and assumes the repurchase of
100% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 10 1/4% Notes pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer as if such transactions had occurred on September
1, 1992 by combining (i) the results of operations of the Company for the fiscal
year ended August 31, 1993 (adjusted on the pro forma basis to include the
acquisition of Florida Medical Center as described below)) (ii) the results of
operations of the Company for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1993 (adjusted as
described below) and the results of operations of Summit for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1993, applying the purchase method of accounting; and, (iii) the
results of operations of the Company for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1993
(adjusted as described below) and the results of operations of Fountain Valley
for the fiscal year ended October 31, 1993, applying the purchase method of
accounting. Because the Company accounted for the AHM Merger as a pooling-of-
interests transaction, the historical financial data of the Company includes the
results of operations of AHM for all periods presented. This pro forma condensed
combined income statement is presented for comparative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations in the future or of
what the combined results of operations would have been had the transaction
assumed therein been consummated during the period for which this statement is
presented. Pro forma earnings per common and common equivalent share and pro
forma weighted average shares outstanding give effect to the exchange of AHM and
Summit shares of common stock and common stock equivalents for the Company's
Common Stock and Common Stock equivalents as described by the respective merger
agreements. In addition, the pro forma condensed combined income statement does
not give effect to the cost savings, if any, which may be realized by the
Company after consummation of the Mergers or the acquisition of Fountain Valley.

The Company acquired Florida Medical Center on June 30, 1993 in a
transaction accounted for as a purchase. The Company's pro forma condensed
combined income statement for the year ended August 31, 1993 reflects the
operating results of the Company for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1993 as if
the acquisition of Florida Medical Center had occurred on September 1, 1992.

This pro forma condensed combined income statement should be read in
conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto of the
Company and Summit incorporated by reference herein, and those of Fountain
Valley included herein.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
CONDENSED COMBINED INCOME STATEMENT

NOTE 1

The Company will continue to report its financial information on a fiscal
year basis ending on August 31. The Summit and Fountain Valley results of
operations, which are included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed
combined income statement, have been presented on a fiscal year basis ending on
June 30 and October 31, respectively.

The pro forma condensed combined income statement assumes the Company's
repurchase of 100% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 10 1/4%
Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer. As of July 18, 1994, the
expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, 99.3% of the 10 1/4% Notes have
been tendered and were purchased by the Company on July 19, 1994 pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer. The difference between the amount tendered and the
amount assumed in the pro forma adjustment has an immaterial impact on the pro
forma condensed combined income statement.

The Company acquired Florida Medical Center on June 30, 1993, for an
aggregate purchase price of $113.1 million. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined income statement for the year ended August 31, 1993, reflects the pro
forma operations of the Company as if its acquisition of Florida Medical Center
had occurred on September 1, 1992. The historical results of Florida Medical
Center have been adjusted using purchase accounting to give effect to the
acquisition by the Company and to eliminate the effect of significant
nonrecurring transactions.

The following combined unaudited pro forma condensed income statement for
the year ended August 31, 1993 presents the historical operations of the
Company, and the incremental pro forma operations of Florida Medical Center as
if the acquisition of Florida Medical Center by the Company had occurred on
September 1, 1992.
