UNION CAMP SAVANNAH LINERBOARD MACHINE
SUFFERS EXTENSIVE DAMAGE
IN DRYER SECTION FAILURE

WAYNE, NJ, August 9, 1994--One of the six paper machines at
Union Camp's Savannah, Ga., kraft paper and board mill was
extensively damaged by a dryer section failure on Sunday night.
There were no injuries in the 10:00 p.m. incident.
The 700-tons-per-day No. 6 machine, which was installed in
the mid-1950s, produces heavyweight linerboard for the
manufacture of corrugated boxes. While the machine is expected
to be down for an extended period, the company is exploring
alternative production options.
Company engineers are still working to determine the
precise cause of the accident and to specify the scope, cost
and time frame of the repairs. The company is covered by
business interruption insurance.
Company officials caution against premature projections of
lost production time and tonnage until the repair program and
alternative production options are fully explored.
The company is notifying its customers that this
unforeseen incident could make it impracticable to fulfill all
of their needs and is working on an allocation process that
will be fair and reasonable to all.
Union Camp is a Wayne-based forest products company that
produces paper, packaging, chemicals and wood products. With $3
billion in annual sales, it ranks among America's top 200
industrial corporations.
