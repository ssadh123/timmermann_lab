Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
------------------------------------
On June 1, 1994, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
purchased all of the capital stock of American Capital Leasing Corporation
("ACL"), whose principal business consists of financing and leasing equipment,
from Mitchell Jacobson and Marjorie Gershwind. 

The Company intends to operate the acquired business as a separate
subsidiary. The Company has retained all five employees of ACL. 

The Company paid the estimated purchase price of $3,936,000 in cash on
June 1, 1994. The final purchase price is to be determined by a post-closing
audit within 90 days, based principally on the book value of the common stock
multiplied by a factor of 109.5%, less a credit on account of ACL's deferred
tax liability. The Company funded the purchase price and refinanced all
outstanding bank debt of ACL ($7,000,000) by borrowing under one of its
existing long-term credit lines from PNC Bank. ACL's two shareholders have
agreed not to compete with the Company in the business of equipment leasing
and equipment financing for a period of two years.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
American Capital Leasing Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of American Capital Leasing
Corporation as of December 31, 1993, and the related statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of American Capital Leasing
Corporation as of December 31, 1993, and the results of its operations, and
its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted

AMERICAN CAPITAL LEASING CORPORATION

Notes to Financial Statements

December 31, 1993

(1) Summary of Accounting Policies

(a) Nature of Business

American Capital Leasing Corporation (the Company) was incorporated
in the State of Oregon on September 5, 1989. The Company leases
diversified types of equipment, generally for a period of three to
five years which represents a substantial portion of the estimated
economic life of the equipment. 

(b) Accounting for Unearned Lease Income

The Company accounts for its leases as direct financing leases
under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 13, and accordingly, the aggregate lease payments to be received
over the term of the leases plus the estimated residual value are
capitalized as the Company's net investment in the leases. The
excess of the investment in the leases over the cost of the
equipment (unearned lease income) is recognized as income over the
term of the leases on the interest method to reflect a constant
periodic rate of return on the net investment in the leases. 

(c) Furniture and Equipment

The Company records all furniture and equipment at cost. 
Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets on the straight-line basis (generally five to ten
years). 

(d) Income Taxes

The Company and its stockholders have elected treatment as an
S Corporation under Federal income tax regulations whereby the
Company is not subject to corporate income taxes. Accordingly,
there is no provision for income taxes included in the accompanying
financial statements.

(e) Earnings Per Share

Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. The weighted
average number of common shares used in the earnings per common
share computation for the year ended December 31, 1993 was 10,000
shares.

(2) Net Investment in Direct Financing Leases

The following lists the components of the net investment in direct
financing leases as of December 31, 1993:

Total minimum lease payments receivable $13,484,084
Less allowance for uncollectibles 178,912
-----------
13,305,172

Add estimated unguaranteed residual values 
of leased equipment 1,766,689
-----------
15,071,861

Less unearned income 3,579,901
-----------
Net investment in direct financing
leases $11,491,960
===========
Net investment classified as:
Current 3,622,736
Noncurrent 7,869,224
-----------
$11,491,960
===========

Future minimum lease payments to be received on direct financing leases are as
follows:

Year ended December 31:
1994 $ 5,535,197
1995 4,117,533
1996 2,180,242
1997 1,135,889
1998 515,223
-----------
Total $13,484,084
===========

The realization of the estimated residual value of leased property depends on
the ultimate sale of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. The
residual value is not a part of the contractual agreement with the lessee but
is based on values that have been realized in the past by the principals in
the Company and their history with similar businesses.

========
(4) Leases

The Company leases office facilities under a month-to-month agreement and
equipment under a long-term lease agreement. The equipment lease is
classified as an operating lease and expired in November 1993. Rental
expense for all leases was $16,470 for the year ended December 31, 1993. 

(5) Note Payable to Bank

Note payable at December 31, 1993 of $6,100,000 consists of draws upon
the Company's loan and security agreement (hereinafter referred to as the
agreement) with First Interstate Bank of Oregon. If the bank declines
the Company's request to renew the agreement upon its expiration
(June 30, 1994) or any subsequent expiration date, the Company shall be
entitled to convert the then outstanding principle balance to an
installment term loan (due 48 months from such expiration date). 
Borrowings under the agreement are secured by a continuing security
interest in all goods of the Company (including receivables, intangible
assets, furniture and equipment and cash) currently owned or hereinafter
acquired by the Company. The agreement contains certain restrictive
covenants with which the Company was in compliance as of December 31,
1993. 

(6) Related Party Transactions

During the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company made equipment
purchases from an affiliated company, in the amount of $678,578. Amounts
due to such affiliated company of $101,856 related to these transactions
are reflected as amount due to affiliated company in the accompanying
balance sheet.

HORRIGAN AMERICAN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED

CONDENSED BALANCE SHEET 
AND
CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

The attached pro forma financial information gives effect to the acquisition
of ACL by the Company. The pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet
reflects the fair value of the assets acquired and the debt incurred to fund
the acquisition as of March 31, 1994. The pro forma consolidated condensed
statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 and for the
three months ended March 31, 1994 reflect the operations of the combined
entities as though the acquisition had been made at the beginning of the
period presented. The pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet and
statements of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company and ACL as
of and for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the three months ended March
31, 1994.

The pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the
actual results of operations that would have occurred if the acquisition had
been consummated on the date indicated or that may be obtained in the future.
Adjustments in anticipation of cost savings through consolidation of the
Company and ACL are not included. 

The pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma balance sheet include
adjustments to record the assets acquired at estimated fair value; to record
the incremental borrowings to fund the purchase; to eliminate ACL's historical
stockholders' equity; and to record ACL's deferred tax liability. It is
anticipated that no goodwill will result from this transaction. The pro forma
balance sheet and the statements of operations do not reflect the two year
covenant not to compete since it was estimated to have a nominal value.

The pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma statements of operations
include adjustments to amortize the premium on the acquired net investment in
finance receivables; to record the interest incurred on funds borrowed to fund
the purchase and to refinance all outstanding debt of ACL, and to remove ACL's
historical interest expense; and to apply Horrigan's estimated incremental
income tax rate.

ACL operated at an estimated pre-tax profit of $304,000 for the five months
ended May 31, 1994. In addition, ACL will record a pre-tax charge of
approximately $400,000 for an expense accrual in conjunction with this
transaction. This adjustment is not reflected in the following pro formas
because it is considered to be non-recurring.

COVENANTS,INDEMNIFICATIONS
10.1. Tax Matters.
a) General. Sellers shall use their best efforts to provide Buyer
with appropriate tax and accounting workpapers necessary to file on a timely
basis any and all federal, state and local tax returns of the Company that
shall come due subsequent to the Closing. Buyer must obtain the consent of
Sellers with regard to any agreement with any taxing jurisdiction to extend
the Statute of Limitations, to agree to proposed audit adjustments or
determinations for any tax periods prior to and including the Closing Date.
Such consent will not be unreasonably withheld. In addition Sellers, at their
own expense, reserve the right to participate in any tax examination,
including any and all discussions and conferences with respect to tax
examinations for all periods up to and including the date of Closing. Buyer
agrees to provide Sellers with notice ofthe occurrence of any audit. Sellers
also reserve the right to be involved with responding to inquiries from tax
authorities that may impact the liability for those periods. Failure to notify
Sellers of the occurrence of the audit will be cause for damages to the extent
that Sellers can demonstrate actual damages incurred as a result of such
failure. 

b). Purchase Accounting Entries. Sellers acknowledge that Buyer
shall make an accounting entry reflecting purchase accounting, and that these
will be included in the May 31, 1994 general ledger of the Company, regarding
a change in allowance for bad debts, which change shall not be considered in
determining the Closing Date Book Value. It is further agreed that Sellers
shall prepare the final short form federal tax return of the Company and shall
permit Buyer a reasonable time to review and approve said return prior to
filing (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). It is further
agreed that Sellers shall prepare any final short form state tax return of the
Company and shall permit Buyer a reasonable time to review and approve said
returns prior to filing (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).
The parties agree to cooperate in all such matters following Closing and each
agrees to allow reasonable access to their books and records to the other
party to effect this provision.

10.2. Actions Post Closing. 
Sellers shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate the
Company's status as a participating employer in the Company Plans and any and
all other Benefit Plans maintained by the controlled group of corporations of
which the Company is a member, and to terminate any and all other Benefit
Plans maintained by the Company, including making all filings necessary
thereto. In addition, Buyer shall grant Sellers reasonable access to the books
and records of Company to the extent necessary for preparation of tax returns
and audits regarding matters prior to Closing. Buyer shall provide Sellers
with access to or copies of such documents and such other cooperation as may
be necessary thereto. Sellers shall bear all filing fees and legal,
accounting, actuarial and other expenses in connection with all of the
foregoing actions.

10.3. Sellers's Purchase of Leases. 
Under certain circumstances, Sellers agrees to purchase Leases from
Company following the Closing in those instances where warranties, agreements,
representations and covenants with regard to any such Leases are breached.
Sellers are not, by this provision, accepting credit risks with regard to any
Leases. Without limiting the amount of indemnification to which Buyer may be
entitled under section 10.4 hereof, in the event that any agreements,
representations, warranties, and covenants made by Sellers herein contained
shall be or become untrue or unperformed with respect to any Leases, and
further that such occurrence shall cause the loss of Buyer under the Lease (or
underlying guaranty or other instrument), then, (in addition to all payment
obligations with regard to indemnification that Sellers shall have to Buyer)
Sellers shall, upon ten (10) days' written notice from Buyer, purchase such
Leases and take assignment of each such Lease and any rights held by Buyer in
the Property, at a purchase price determined by multiplying the sum of (i) the
<PAGE>
book value of the Lease at that time as shown on the books and records of the
Buyer (as book value is determined consistent with accounting procedures
formerly employed by Company in determining book value prior to Closing, plus
(ii) any amount charged off by Buyer with respect to that Lease if said Lease
has no value on the books and records of the Buyer at that time, times a
factor of one hundred eight and seventy one hundredths per cent (108.71%) (the
"Assignment Price"). Concurrently with the receipt of the Assignment Price,
Buyer shall assign the subject Lease to Sellers along with any and all related
documentation including Buyer's interest in the property covered by the Lease
and any security deposit, and shall release its interest upon assignment. In
any event, even if the Sellers shall not be obligated to purchase a contract
under the above described circumstances where such that agreements,
representations, warranties, and covenants made by Sellers herein contained
shall be or become untrue or unperformed with respect to such Lease, Sellers
agree to indemnify Buyer in the amount of the fair market value of the subject
Equipment in the event that the Equipment is not able to be recovered as a
result of such breach. In no event shall Seller be obligated to purchase a
Lease or otherwise pay funds until the aggregate book value of Leases which
would be subject of this repurchase obligation plus all indemnity payments
required to be paid under section 10.3 shall exceed the aggregate sum of
$50,000, then in such event only to the extent that such amount shall exceed
$50,000.

10.4. Indemnification

each of its directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and
all Damages of any kind or character, arising out of or in any manner relating

agreement shall occur subsequent to Closing or (iv) arising from any
other statute or regulation governing such employees, officers and
directors and any other matter related to the employment or termination
(or constructive termination) of employment of any employee of the
Company, unless the breach of such statute or regulation shall occur, or
such matter shall otherwise arise, subsequent to Closing; and/or 
(C) any failure by the Sellers to perform or comply in full with any
covenant or agreement to be performed by the Sellers under this
Agreement or any other agreement or document executed by the Sellers in
connection with this Agreement including tax liability; and/or 
(D) any claim for a broker's fee or finder's fee brought against Buyer,

indemnified party, including any reimbursement to which the indemnified party
is entitled, shall be paid promptly. For the purposes of administering the
indemnification provisions of this Paragraph 10.5, the following procedures
shall apply from and after the Closing Date:

(i) Each indemnified party shall notify the Indemnitor of any
Indemnification Event in writing within 15 days following the receipt of
notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any tax
audit) or within 30 days of (A) the assertion of any claim against such 
indemnified party or (B) the discovery by such indemnified party of any
loss, giving rise to indemnity pursuant to this Paragraph 10.5 (any 15 or 30
day notification requirement shall begin to run, in the case of a claim which
is amended so as to give rise to an amended Indemnification Event, from the
first day such claim is amended to include any claim which is an
Indemnification Event hereunder) and shall indicate in such 
notification whether such indemnified party is requesting 
indemnification with respect to such Indemnification Event and the
amount of indemnification initially anticipated. The failure to give 
notice as required by this subparagraph 10.5(i) in a timely fashion 
shall not result in a waiver of any right to indemnification hereunder,
except to the extent that the Indemnitor's ability to defend against the 
event with respect to which indemnification is sought is adversely affected by
the failure of the indemnified party to give notice in a timely fashion 
as required by this subparagraph 10.5(i).

(ii) The Indemnitor shall be entitled (but not obligated) to assume the
defense or settlement of any such action or proceeding (including any
tax audit), or to participate in any negotiations or proceedings to settle
or otherwise eliminate any claim; provided, however, that in the event the
Indemnitor assumes any such defense or settlement or any such negotiations, it
shall pursue such defense, settlement or negotiations in good faith. If
the Indemnitor fails to elect in writing within 10 business days of
the notification referred to above to assume the defense, settlement or 
negotiations, the indemnified party may engage counsel to defend, settle or
otherwise dispose of such action or proceeding, which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor.

(iii) In cases where the Indemnitor has assumed the defense or
settlement with respect to an Indemnification Event, the Indemnitor shall be
entitled to assume the defense or settlement thereof with counsel of 
its own choosing, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to 
the indemnified party, provided that: (A) the indemnified party (and its
counsel) shall be entitled to continue to participate at its own cost in
<PAGE>
any such action or proceeding or in any negotiations or proceedings 
to settle or otherwise eliminate any claim for which indemnification 
is being sought, provided that the indemnified party shall not be
entitled to settle without the prior written approval of the Indemnitor; and
(B) the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to settle, compromise, decline to 
appeal, or otherwise dispose of any such action, proceeding or claim 
without prior notice to the indemnified party.

(iv) In the event indemnification is requested, the relevant Indemnitor, 
its representatives and agents shall have access to the premises, 
books and records of the indemnified party or parties seeking such
indemnification to the extent reasonably necessary to assist it in
defending or settling any action, proceeding or claim; provided, however,
that such access shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere 
unreasonably with the operation of the business of the indemnified party
or parties and shall only take place in the presence of a representative of
the indemnified party or parties unless otherwise so agreed. Except as 
provided above, the indemnified party shall not be required to disclose any
information with respect to itself or any of its Affiliates, and
shall not be required to participate in the defense of any claim to be 
indemnified hereunder (except as otherwise expressly set forth herein),
unless otherwise required or reasonably necessary in the defense of any claim
to be indemnified hereunder.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in section 10.4:
(i) Sellers shall not be required to make an indemnity payment to Buyer under
section 10.4 until the aggregate amount of all Damages incurred by Buyer and
its directors, officers, employees and agents as a result of all breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by Seller in this
Agreement and the amount of Leases required to be repurchased under section
10.3 exceeds the total sum of $50,000.

Miscellaneous
11.1 Governing Law and Modifications to Agreement. The Agreement will be
construed and governed under the domestic internal law (but not the law of
conflicts of law) of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This Agreement may not
be changed or modified except by a writing duly executed by all of the parties
hereto. 

11.2 Arbitration. Except as provided in subparagraph 3.2.b, any dispute
arising out of this Agreement or the breach thereof shall, at the election of
either Buyer or Seller, by notice to the other, be referred to the American
Arbitration Association, to be settled by arbitration under the then existing
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any
arbitration conducted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall be
conducted by a recognized independent and impartial arbitrator mutually agreed
to by Buyer and Sellers or, if they cannot agree, by three arbitrators, one
chosen by Buyer, one chosen by Sellers and the third (who shall be a
recognized independent and impartial arbitrator and who shall act as
chairperson and will be compensated at a rate generally equivalent to his or
her normal billing rate or compensation) selected by the two so chosen;
provided that if either Sellers or Buyer fails to appoint an arbitrator within
20 days of written notice by the other that it has appointed an arbitrator,
then the arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator selected by the
American Arbitration Association. If the arbitrators selected by Sellers and
Buyer fail to agree on the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be
selected by the American Arbitration Association. All costs of each
arbitration pursuant to this subparagraph 11.2 (including, without limitation,
all fees of the arbitrator(s) and attorneys' fees), shall be borne by the
party whose last offer of settlement (or claim if no offer of settlement has
been made) differed by a greater amount from the arbitrators' award than did 
<PAGE>
the last offer of settlement or claim of the other party (or, in the case of
an arbitration to determine other than a dollar amount or percentage, by the
party against which the arbitrators' decision shall be rendered, as such issue
is determined by the arbitrators); provided, however, that no offer of
settlement shall be disclosed by Sellers or Buyer to the arbitrator(s) until
after the arbitrators render an award on the merits. Any dispute solely
involving the calculation of an amount or percentage or application of
accounting principles shall be exclusively subject to the dispute settlement
provisions of paragraph 3.2.b. Such arbitration shall be conducted in
Reading, Pennsylvania. The written decision of the arbitrators shall be dated
and shall be signed by a majority of the arbitrators. Such decision shall be
final and binding upon the parties hereto, their respective shareholders,
successors, and assigns. Judgment upon the award granted by the Arbitrators
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, or application may be
made to such court for judicial acceptance of the award and an order of
enforcement, as the case may be. 

11.3. Costs and Expenses. Regardless of whether the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, the Buyer and the Sellers
shall each bear their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, including without
limitation all legal and accounting costs and expenses. The costs and
expenses, as described above, relating to the sale (as opposed to the
purchase) of the Stock are acknowledged to be those of the Sellers and not the
Company, and such costs shall be borne by the Sellers exclusively.

11.4. Nature and Survival of Representations. All statements
contained in the Exhibits and in any other certificate, instrument, document
or agreement delivered by or on behalf of the Sellers pursuant hereto, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be deemed
representations and warranties by the Sellers hereunder. All representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Sellers and the Buyer
hereunder shall survive the Closing; provided however that with respect to
certain warranties and representations as are set forth below, following the
expiration of certain periods following the Closing Date and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in subparagraphs 10.3 and/or 10.4, there
shall be no obligation of Sellers to purchase Leases under secton 10.3, or
right to indemnification under section 10.4 with respect to a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to the following
paragraphs unless a claim with respect thereto is asserted in writing against

benefit of the successors and assigns of the Sellers and the respective
