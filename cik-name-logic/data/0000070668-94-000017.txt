FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE EXHIBIT 99

NUI CORPORATION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

BEDMINSTER, N.J. -- July 21, 1994 -- NUI Corporation (NYSE: NUI) today
reported a third quarter loss of $2.2 million, or $0.25 per share, for the
quarter ended June 30, 1994, compared with a net loss of $1.0 million, or
$0.12 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 1993. The third quarter is
historically a period of seasonally low demand for natural gas for heating.
The $1.2 million increased net loss from year-ago levels reflects a
$400,000 net loss from the addition of Pennsylvania & Southern Gas Company,
which was acquired in a merger in April 1994, following the conclusion of
the heating season. In addition, there was $1.1 million of additional costs
associated with a net increase in interest expense, operation and
maintenance expense, and depreciation expenses, all associated with
increased plant investment and workforce, as well as higher general taxes.
These losses were offset, in part, by a $500,000 net increase in operating
margins. The 1994 third quarter results also include the benefit of a
$220,000 reversal in tax reserves. 

"The addition of Pennsylvania & Southern provided excellent balance
to our overall customer base. This merger, as expected, coming after the
heating season, was dilutive in the third quarter," said John Kean,
President and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, we had expected higher
margin growth in New Jersey, which did not materialize in the third quarter
because of lower than expected sales to commercial and residential
customers. In Florida, the Company is investing in a growing infrastructure
that will reap rewards as our customer base continues to expand. However,
growth of this kind may create short term earnings pressure," Mr. Kean
added.

For the nine months ended June 30, 1994, net income totalled $15.4
million, or $1.83 per share, compared with net income of $18.5 million, or
$2.28 per share, a year ago. 

NUI's Florida division, City Gas Company of Florida, filed a request
in May 1994 for an increase in base rates with the Florida Public Service
Commission (FPSC). The FPSC on Tuesday awarded City Gas interim rate relief
of $260,000 in additional annual revenues, effective August 20, 1994. The
full base rate case is continuing through the regulatory process.

Total throughput for the first nine months increased 6 percent to 62.8
bcf, from 59.0 bcf a year ago. 

On Tuesday, the Company received final regulatory approval to issue
$66 million of tax-exempt debt in New Jersey and Florida. These issuances,
$46 million of which will be used to refinance higher cost debt and the
balance to finance certain capital expenditures, are expected to be offered
later this month. 

NUI Corporation (NYSE: NUI), or National Utility Investors, is a gas
utility serving over 347,000 customers in six states. The Company's
operating divisions include Elizabethtown Gas Company (NJ), City Gas
Company of Florida, as well as Pennsylvania & Southern Gas Company, which
does business as North Carolina Gas Service, Elkton Gas Service (MD),
Valley Cities Gas Service (PA) and Waverly Gas Service (NY). <PAGE>
