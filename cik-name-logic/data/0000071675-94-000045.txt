The Company's Form 8-K dated June 9, 1994 is amended to read as
follows:

Item 5. Other Events

In September 1993, the Company reached a three-year electric
and natural gas rate settlement agreement (Agreement) with the
Public Service Commission of the State of New York. The
Agreement provides for an allowed return on equity of 10.8% in
year one, 11.4% in year two, and 11.4% (subject to an indexing
mechanism) in year three. The Agreement also includes incentives
(rewards or penalties) for customer service, production cost, and
demand-side management, which could increase the allowed return
to 12.3% or decrease it to 9.95% in year one, increase it to
13.05% or decrease it to 10.4% in year two, and increase it to
13.25% or decrease it to 10.2% in year three. 

In June 1994, the Company estimated and recorded a $13
million, or 12 cents per share, production cost penalty for 1993,
which is the maximum provided by the Agreement. 

This penalty is based on a comparison of the relative
changes in the Company's production costs per megawatt-hour of
retail sales from a base period (1989-1992) to 1993 versus the
same comparison for a 19-company peer group, which includes the
Company. The Company calculated the penalty based on financial
information that was reported in the peer group's Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Form 1 Reports, which were received in May
1994. The Company's production cost penalty for 1993 was
primarily due to a significant increase in retail sales for the
peer group as compared to the Company's retail sales. This
penalty also resulted from higher cost increases for the Company
as compared to the peer group.

Except for this penalty, the Company believes that it can
earn its allowed return on common equity in 1994. Although the
Company cannot currently estimate the results of future
production cost incentives, the Company implemented a significant
cost reduction program in early 1994 which will reduce its
production costs in 1994 and beyond.
