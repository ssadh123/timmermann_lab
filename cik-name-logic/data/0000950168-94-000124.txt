ARTICLE II
PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES; MERGER OF THE ASSOCIATION

Section 2.1. Acquisition of Shares

(a) At the Closing, upon satisfaction of the conditions
contained in Article VI hereof, (i) the
Seller shall sell and deliver the Shares to SCBC, and (ii) in exchange
therefor, SCBC shall pay the
Purchase Price, as defined and calculated in accordance with Section 2.1(b)
below, to the Seller as
follows: the Deferred Payment Amount shall be paid by SCBC at the times set
forth in, upon satisfaction
of the conditions contained in, and in accordance with the other terms of
Section 2.4 hereof, and an
amount (the "Cash Payment Amount") equal to the excess of the Purchase Price
over the Deferred
Payment Amount shall be paid to the Seller by SCBC in immediately available
funds; provided that, the
Seller may elect pursuant to Section 2.2(d) hereof to cause SCBC to pay all
or a portion of the Cash
Payment Amount to the Association or a Retained Association Subsidiary as an
offset to, and a credit
against, the Seller's Payment. The Purchase Price shall constitute the
entire purchase price to be paid
by SCBC for the Shares.

(b) The "Purchase Price" for the Shares means Forty Million
Three Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($40,350,000), plus the excess, if any, of the Earnings Adjustment,
as defined and calculated in
accordance with Section 2.1(c) below over the aggregate of payments for
Taxes on taxable income earned
during the Interim Period made by the Association during the Interim Period
in accordance with the Tax
Sharing Agreement or by the Association or SCBC pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.3(a) hereof,
regardless of whether such payments are cash payments made by the
Association to the Seller or credits
(by way of provisions, allocations or otherwise) made by the Association to
the Timeshare and Lot
Reserves. The Seller understands that the Earnings Adjustment could be a
negative number which, under
the foregoing formula, would have the effect of reducing the Purchase Price
by the absolute value of such
negative number.

(c) The "Earnings Adjustment" means and shall be the amount
determined either under clause
(i), (ii) or (iii) below, whichever applies:

(i) If the Interim Period Earnings are
an amount less than $2,625,000, then the
Earnings Adjustment shall be an amount
(which may be a negative number) equal
to (a) the Capped Interim Period Earnings
Amount, minus (B) the amount of the
Effects of Extraordinary Items.

(ii) If the Interim Period Earnings
minus the amount of the Effects of Extraordinary
Items are an amount equal to or more than
$2,625,000, then the Earnings
Adjustment shall be the Capped Interim
Period Earnings Amount.

(iii) If (A) Interim Period Earnings are
an amount more than $2,625,000, and (B)
Interim Period Earnings minus the amount of
the Effects of Extraordinary Items
are an amount (the "Clause (iii) Amount")
that is less than $2,625,000, then the
Earnings Adjustment shall be an amount equal
to the Capped Interim Period
Earnings Amount, minus an amount equal to
(C) $2,625,000 minus (D) the
Clause (iii) Amount.

(d) The amount of the Interim Period Earnings, the Post-
Target Date Interim Period Earnings,
if necessary, the Effects of Extraordinary Items and the Earnings Adjustment
shall be estimated in the
Ordinary Course of Business of the Association as of the Effective Time, and
such estimated amount shall
be used in calculating the Purchase Price. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective
Time, the actual amount of the Interim Period Earnings, the Post-Target Date
Interim Period Earnings,
if necessary, the Effects of Extraordinary Items and the Earnings Adjustment
shall be determined by the
Seller and SCBC, and any difference between the Purchase Price calculated
using the actual amount of
the Interim Period Earnings, the Post-Target Date Interim Period Earnings,
if necessary, the Effects of
Extraordinary Items and the Earnings Adjustment and the Purchase Price
calculated at the Closing by
using the estimated amount of the Interim Period Earnings, the Post-Target
Date Interim Period Earnings,
if necessary, the Effects of Extraordinary Items and the Earnings Adjustment
shall be paid by the
appropriate party hereto within ten (10) days after such determination.

Section 2.2 Purchase of Excluded Assets.

(a) At the Closing and immediately prior to the Effective
Time, upon satisfaction of the
conditions contained in Article VI hereof other than Section 6.3(m), the
Seller shall purchase from the
Association or the applicable Retained Association Subsidiary, and the
Association or the applicable
Retained Association Subsidiary shall transfer and assign to the Seller, all
of the Excluded Assets and,
in exchange therefor, the Seller shall pay an amount equal to the Seller's
Payment, as defined and
calculated in accordance with Section 2.2(b) below, to the Association or
the applicable Retained
Association Subsidiary in immediately available funds and shall assume the
Excluded Liabilities. The
Seller's Payment and the assumption by the Seller of the Excluded
Liabilities shall constitute the entire
purchase price to be paid by Seller for the Excluded Assets.

(b) The "Seller's Payment" means the sum of the amounts
determined in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
below:

(i) the Net Book Value of the Excluded
Loans (A) minus all New Reserves in
respect of Excluded Loans and (B) minus all
Cash and Cash Equivalents received
by the Association in respect of Excluded
Loans, but only to the extent such
Cash and Cash Equivalents received did not
increase Interim Period Earnings;

(ii) the Net Book Value of the Excluded
Real Estate and JV Interests and, to the
extent they are not included within the term
"Excluded Real Estate and JV
Interests," the Association Subsidiaries
other than the Retained Association
Subsidiaries (A) minus all New Reserves in
respect of Excluded Real Estate and
JV Interests and (B) minus all Cash and Cash
Equivalents received by the
Association in respect of Excluded Real
Estate and JV Interests and, to the extent
they are not included within the term
"Excluded Real Estate and JV Interests,"
the Association Subsidiaries other than the
Retained Association Subsidiaries, but
only to the extent such Cash and Cash
Equivalents received did not increase
Interim Period Earnings; and

(iii) the Net Book Value of the
Repurchased Timeshare and Lot Assets, (A) minus all
New Reserves in respect of Repurchased
Timeshare and Lot Assets, including all
New Reserves attributable to Timeshare and
Lot Reserves, and (B) minus all
Cash and Cash Equivalents received by the
Association in respect of Repurchased
Timeshare and Lot Assets, but only to the
extent such Cash and Cash Equivalents
received did not increase Interim Period
Earnings.

(c) Notwithstanding the definitions of the terms "Excluded
Assets" and "Proceeds" and the
provisions of Section 2.2(a) above, SCBC shall have the right to identify
Excluded Loans and Excluded
Real Estate and JV Interests, and Proceeds therefrom (but not Repurchased
Timeshare and Lot Assets and
Proceeds therefrom), to be retained by the Association or a Retained
Association Subsidiary, which right
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.2(c). SCBC
shall identify to Seller all
Excluded Loans and Excluded Real Estate and JV Interests, and Proceeds
therefrom, to be retained by
the Association or a Retained Association Subsidiary by delivery of written
notice on or before the date
five (5) days before the Closing Date. Any Excluded Asset or Proceeds
therefrom so identified by SCBC
shall continue to be considered Excluded Assets for all other purposes of
this Agreement other than for
Seller's obligation to acquire such assets as Excluded Assets under Section
2.2(a) hereof.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2.1(a) and
2.2(a) hereof, the Seller shall have the
right to elect to cause SCBC to pay all or a portion of the Cash Payment
Amount to the Association
and/or any Retained Association Subsidiary from which Excluded Assets are to
be transferred, as an
offset to, and a credit against, the Seller's Payment (the portion of the
Cash Payment Amount to be paid
to any Retained Association Subsidiary shall not exceed the portion of the
Seller's Payment otherwise to
be paid to such Retained Association Subsidiary), and the Seller shall have
the option to acquire the stock
of Carolina Financial Services Corporation, a Retained Association
Subsidiary ("CFSC"), and any and
all loans from the Association or any Retained Association Subsidiary (other
than CFSC) to CFSC at an
aggregate purchase price equal to the sum of the Net Book Value of such
shares and the Net Book Value
of all such loans at the Closing Date, in lieu of acquiring from CFSC the
Excluded Assets owned by
CFSC. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the definition of "Net Book
Value" shall be deemed to
refer to the Closing Date rather than to September 30, 1993. The Seller
shall exercise the right and the
option described in the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2(d) by
delivering written notice to SCBC
on or before the date five (5) days before the Closing Date and by causing
the Association and CFSC to
transfer all of the assets of CFSC that are not Excluded Assets to the
Association immediately prior to
the Closing.

Section 2.3. Tax Sharing Liability.

(a) At the Closing, upon satisfaction of the conditions in
Article VI hereof, other than Section
6.3(m), and immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Association shall
pay to the Seller the Tax
Sharing Liability. In the event that the Association is not permitted to
make such payment to the Seller
by the OTS, SCBC shall make such payment on behalf of the Association. The
parties hereto do not
intend any such payment of the amount of the Tax Sharing Liability to
constitute a portion of the
Purchase Price.

(b) The "Tax Sharing Liability" shall mean any unpaid amount
for Taxes the Association is
obligated to advance to the Seller for taxable income earned during the
Interim Period pursuant to
Sections 4 and 6 of the Tax Sharing Agreement, dated August 17, 1990, among
the Seller and certain
of its subsidiaries, including the Association and certain of the
Association Subsidiaries, as amended
November 14, 1990 and September 14, 1992 (the "Tax Sharing Agreement"),
excluding any Tax
Liabilities arising from or in connection with the Section 338(g) Election
or the Section 338(h) Election
described in Section 5.3, and less the amount, if any, of prior overpayments
as reflected on the
Association's books and records.

(c) The amount of the Tax Sharing Liability shall
be estimated in the Ordinary Course of
Business of the Association as of the Closing Date. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the
Effective Time, the actual amount of the Tax Sharing Liability as of the
Closing Date shall be determined
by the Seller and SCBC and any difference between the Tax Sharing Liability
as estimated and the actual
Tax Sharing Liability shall be paid by the Seller to the Association or by
the Association to the Seller,
as the case may be, within ten (10) days after such determination.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.2(a) and
2.3(a) hereof, the Seller shall have the
right to cause all or a portion of the amount of the Tax Sharing Liability,
as estimated as of the Closing
Date, to be retained by the Association or paid to any Retained Association
Subsidiary from which
Excluded Assets are to be transferred as an offset to, and a credit against,
the Seller's Payment. The
Seller shall exercise this right by delivering written notice to SCBC and
the Association on or before the
date five (5) days prior to the Closing Date.

Section 2.4. Deferred Payment Amount - Interest Accrual and Payments.

(a) In order to induce SCBC to agree to consummate the
Acquisition before Termination of the
Litigation, Seller and SCBC agree to defer payment of the Deferred Payment
Amount until after Closing
and to pay the Deferred Payment Amount in accordance with, as and when
provided in this Section 2.4.
Except as provided in this Section 2.4, SCBC shall have no right or
authority or claim to the Deferred
Payment Amount and shall have no right or authority to set off against
payment(s) of the Deferred
Payment Amount any amounts due and owing by Seller to SCBC, the Association
or the Retained
Association Subsidiaries in respect of matters other than the Litigation or
to delay the payment(s) of the
Deferred Payment Amount pending the final resolution of any such other
matters. The unpaid part of
the Deferred Payment Amount shall accrue interest at an adjusting annual
rate equal to the annual rate
of interest paid by Security Bank and Trust Company, an SCBC Subsidiary, on
certificates of deposit
having principal of $100,000 or more and a term of five (5) years (the "CD
Rate"), with such rate being
adjusted and re-set at such times, and in tandem with, changes in the CD
Rate (the "Interest Rate"), until
the earlier of the time (i) the Deferred Payment Amount has been paid in
full by SCBC in accordance
with, as and when provided in Section 2.4(b) or (ii) cash in an amount equal
to the unpaid balance of the
Deferred Payment Amount shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent as
provided in Section 2.4(d).
Accrued interest shall be added to the balance of the Deferred Payment
Amount at the end of each
calendar month and shall thereafter be a part of the Deferred Payment
Amount.

(b) As soon as practicable but in no event later than 15 days
after the Termination of the relevant
Litigation (or at Closing in the event Termination of the relevant
litigation has occurred at least 15 days
prior to the Closing Date), SCBC shall make one or more installment payments
(the "Deferred
Payments") of the Deferred Payment Amount as follows:

(i) After Termination of the Class
Action Litigation, SCBC shall pay to the Seller
or, to the extent the Seller has not made
adequate provision for the full
satisfaction of such Liability by means
satisfactory to SCBC, to such Persons
other than the Seller as necessary to
satisfy and pay in full any Liability of
SCBC, the Association and the Retained
Association Subsidiaries created by such
Termination, an amount equal to Percentage A
on Appendix 1 times the initial
Deferred Payment Amount, plus all or the
applicable portion of the amounts
retained by SCBC pursuant to the provisions
of clauses (ii) and (v) of this Section
2.4(b) plus interest accrued at the Interest
Rate on such amounts from the Closing
Date.

(ii) After Termination of the Bankruptcy
Litigation, SCBC shall pay to the Seller or,
to the extent the Seller has not made
adequate provision for the full satisfaction
of such Liability by means satisfactory to
SCBC, to such Persons other than the
Seller as necessary to satisfy and pay in
full any Liability of SCBC, the
Association and the Retained Association
Subsidiaries created by such
Termination, an amount equal to (A) if the
Class Action Litigation previously has
been Terminated, Percentage B on Appendix 1
times the initial Deferred Payment
Amount plus interest accrued at the Interest
Rate on such amount from the
Closing Date, or (B) if the Class Action
Litigation has not been Terminated,
Percentage C on Appendix 1 times the initial
Deferred Payment Amount plus
interest accrued at the Interest Rate on
such amount from the Closing Date.

(iii) After Termination of the
Homeowners' Litigation, SCBC shall pay to 
the Seller or, to the extent the Seller 
has not made adequate provision for the full
satisfaction of such Liability by means
satisfactory to SCBC, to such Persons
other than Seller as necessary to satisfy
and pay in full any Liability of SCBC,
the Association and the Retained Association
Subsidiaries created by such
Termination, an amount equal to Percentage D
on Appendix 1 times the initial
Deferred Payment Amount plus interest
accrued at the Interest Rate on such
amount from the Closing Date.

(iv) After Termination of all
Litigation, SCBC shall pay to the Seller the 
remaining balance of the Deferred Payment 
Amount provided that all Liabilities of SCBC,
the Association and the Retained Association
Subsidiaries created by all
Terminations of all Litigation have been
fully satisfied and paid.

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.4(b), SCBC may
withhold any Deferred Payment which it would
otherwise be obligated to pay
under the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.4(b) if and only if SCBC in its
good faith and reasonable judgment, based on
information made available to the
Seller (by way of example, and not
limitation, assertions of new claims or new
theories of liability in the Class Action
Litigation, information indicating
inaccuracies in the estimates of potential
Liability from Litigation contained in
letters of the Seller's independent auditors
provided to SCBC in advance of the
execution of this Agreement, and assertions
of fraudulent conveyance claims in
the Bankruptcy Litigation) and supported by
a written opinion of legal counsel
selected by SCBC and reasonably acceptable
to the Seller, determines that for the
sole purpose of securing Seller's obligation
to indemnify SCBC, the Association
and the Retained Association Subsidiaries
for Indemnifiable Losses suffered by
reason of the Litigation, the balance of the
Deferred Payment Amount that would
remain after such payment would not be
sufficient to fully pay and satisfy the
potential Liabilities of SCBC, the
Association and the Retained Association
Subsidiaries from Litigation for which there
has not been a Termination.

(c) The Seller shall grant to SCBC, as collateral agent for
its benefit and the benefit of the
Association and each of the Retained Association Subsidiaries (the
"Collateral Agent"), perfected first
liens and security interests on and in the Deferred Payment Amount and
interest accrued thereon
("Deferred Payment Security Interests"), which Deferred Payment Security
Interests shall be released in
proportion to and to the same extent as the Deferred Payment Amount is paid
to the Seller, or to other
Persons, as provided in Section 2.4(b).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
2.4, upon the first to occur of (A)
SCBC's failure to make a Deferred Payment in accordance with, as and when
provided in Section 2.4(b)
hereof, which failure is determined to have been in bad faith as provided in
Section 2.4(e) hereof, (B)
a "change-in-control" of SCBC (which term shall mean (i) the adoption of a
plan of merger or share
exchange by SCBC pursuant to which the holders of SCBC's voting capital
stock as of the Closing Date
as a group would receive less than 50% of the voting capital stock of the
surviving corporation, (ii) the
acquisition of more than 25% of SCBC's outstanding voting capital stock by
any Person pursuant to a
transaction or series of transactions not approved by a formal resolution
adopted by a majority of the
members of SCBC's Board of Directors in office prior to such Person's
acquisition of more than 10%
of such voting capital stock and continuing in office at the time of such
vote, or (iii) the adoption of an
agreement by SCBC pursuant to which it would sell to a Person (other than an
SCBC Subsidiary) the
capital stock or assets of one or more SCBC Subsidiaries which, in the
aggregate, constitute more than
40% of SCBC's then existing consolidated total assets), and (C) a decline in
the ratio (expressed as a
percentage) of consolidated tangible capital to consolidated total assets of
SCBC to less than three and
one-half percent (3.5%), SCBC shall deposit with Wachovia Bank of North
Carolina, N.A. or any other
bank acceptable to SCBC and the Seller (the "Escrow Agent") cash in an
amount equal to the unpaid
balance of the Deferred Payment Amount plus interest accrued at the Interest
Rate on such amount from
the end of the prior calendar month, which cash shall be held, invested and
administered by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to an escrow agreement the form and substance of which shall
be mutually acceptable to
the Seller, SCBC and the Escrow Agent.

(e) If SCBC fails to make a Deferred Payment in accordance
with, as and when provided in
either Section 2.4(b) or Section 2.4(d) hereof (the "Defaulted Deferred
Payment"), and such failure is
determined to have been in bad faith (as hereafter defined), SCBC shall pay
and the Seller shall be
entitled to receive, in addition to the Defaulted Deferred Payment and
interest accrued thereon, an amount
(the "Penalty") equal to twenty percent (20%) of the sum of the amount of
the Defaulted Deferred
Payment plus interest accrued thereon at the Interest Rate from the end of
the prior calendar month. The
term "bad faith" shall mean the failure to make a Deferred Payment for any
reason other than (i) SCBC's
honest, good faith and reasonable belief that Termination of the relevant
Litigation has not occurred, or
(ii) SCBC's honest, good faith and reasonable determination pursuant to
Section 2.4(b)(v) that it may
withhold the Deferred Payment.

Section 2.5. Merger of the Association

It is anticipated that SCBC will, as soon as practicable
following the Acquisition and after certain
necessary interim steps, cause the Association to be merged with and into an
SCBC Subsidiary (the
"Merger"). All references in this Agreement to the Association pertaining
to any time or event occurring
at or after the effectiveness of the Merger shall be deemed to be references
to the SCBC Subsidiary which
is the successor of the Association resulting from the Merger.

bargaining agreement or other understanding with a labor union.

(b) Neither the Association nor any Association Subsidiary is
in default, which default would
constitute a Material Adverse Event with respect to the Association and the
Retained Association
Subsidiaries under any Significant Contract or any agreement, commitment,
arrangement or other
indenture described in Section 3.16(a), whether written or oral, and there
has not occurred any event that,
with the lapse of time or giving of notice or both, would constitute such a
default.

Section 3.17. Legal Proceedings; Regulatory Approvals

party, and (ii) no actions, suits,
claims, governmental investigations or proceedings have been instituted, are
pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Seller, are threatened (or unasserted but considered by the

outcome) against the Association or any Association Subsidiary or against
any asset, interest, or right of

the Seller, there are no
actual or threatened actions, suits or proceedings against the Association,
any Association Subsidiary, or
the Seller which present a claim to restrain or which would have the effect
of prohibiting the transactions
contemplated herein. Except as Previously Disclosed, there is no fact or
condition (including, but not
limited to, compliance with the CRA and HMDA), relating to the Association
or any Association
Subsidiary of which the Seller has Knowledge that would prevent the Seller,
the Association or SCBC

To the Knowledge of the Seller, except as Previously
Disclosed, each of the Association and the
Association Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with all

applicable and material to the conduct of its business (except for any
violations that do not constitute a
Material Adverse Event with respect to the Association and the Retained
Association Subsidiaries), and
neither the Association nor any Association Subsidiary has received
notification from any agency or
department of federal, state or local government (i) asserting a violation
or possible violation of any such
statute or regulation and which violation would constitute a Material
Adverse Event with respect to the
Association and the Retained Association Subsidiaries, (ii) threatening to
revoke any license, franchise,
permit or government authorization, or (iii) restricting or in any way
limiting its operations. Except as
Previously Disclosed, neither the Association nor any Association Subsidiary

the foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the
Knowledge of the Seller, the
Association and each Association Subsidiary has timely filed all currency

With respect to each such policy, to the Knowledge of the Seller the policy
is legal, binding, enforceable
and in full force and effect; neither the Association nor any Retained
Association Subsidiary is in breach
or default thereof, and to the Knowledge of the Seller, no event has
occurred which, with the lapse of
time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute such a breach or
default, or permit termination,
modification, or acceleration, under that policy. Except as Previously
Disclosed, neither the Association
nor any Retained Association Subsidiary has received any notice of a premium
increase or cancellation
with respect to any insurance policy or bond, and within the last three
years, neither the Association nor
any Retained Association Subsidiary has been refused or received any notice
of termination with respect
to any insurance coverage sought or applied for.

and records of the Association
or any Association Subsidiary have been originated and administered in
accordance with the terms of the
underlying notes related thereto. To the Knowledge of the Seller, neither

the Association or any Retained

Section 3.25. Representations and Warranties of the Association

The Seller acknowledges that SCBC has received and relied upon
the Association Letter. The
Seller represents and warrants that the representations and warranties
contained in the Association Letter
are, to the best of its Knowledge, correct in all material respects, such
Association Letter being a material
inducement to SCBC's execution of this Agreement and SCBC's willingness to
consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SCBC

SCBC represents and warrants to the Seller as follows:

Section 4.1. Organization, Standing and Authority of SCBC

SCBC is a general business corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing
under the laws of the state of North Carolina with full corporate power and
authority to carry on its
business as now conducted and is duly qualified to do business in the states
of the United States and
foreign jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires
such qualification and where failure to so qualify would constitute a
Material Adverse Event with respect
to SCBC and the SCBC Subsidiaries. SCBC is registered as a bank holding
company under the Bank
Holding Company Act.

Section 4.2. Authorized and Effective Agreement

(a) SCBC has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into and perform all of its
obligations under this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary corporate
action in respect thereof on the part of SCBC. This Agreement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding
obligation of SCBC, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms
subject, as to enforceability, to
bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws of general applicability relating to
or affecting creditors' rights
and to general equity principles.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor
consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by SCBC with any of the provisions
hereof shall (i) conflict with
or result in a breach of any provision of the articles of incorporation (or,
as applicable the charter) or
bylaws of SCBC or any SCBC Subsidiary, (ii) constitute or result in a breach
of any term, condition or
provision of, or constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or
acceleration with respect to, or result in the creation of any lien, charge
or encumbrance upon any
property or asset of SCBC or any SCBC Subsidiary pursuant to, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture,
license, agreement or other instrument or obligation, or (iii) subject to
receipt of all required
governmental approvals set forth in Section 5.1, violate any order, ruling,
decree, charge, writ,
injunction, regulatory agreement or memorandum of understanding,
constitution, statute, rule or
regulation applicable to SCBC or any SCBC Subsidiary.

Section 4.3. Legal Proceedings; Regulatory Approvals

There are no actual or, to the best knowledge of SCBC,
threatened actions, suits or proceedings
which present a claim or restrain or prohibit the transactions contemplated
herein. No fact or condition
(including, but not limited to, CRA and HMDA compliance) relating to SCBC or
any SCBC Subsidiary
known to SCBC exists that would prevent SCBC from obtaining all of the
federal and state regulatory
approvals contemplated herein.

Section 4.4. Representations of the Designated Subsidiary

Should SCBC designate a Designated Subsidiary as provided in
Section 8.7, by a certificate of
the President of the Designated Subsidiary delivered to the Seller at the
Closing, the Designated
Subsidiary shall represent and warrant to the Seller matters of the type set
forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and
4.3 to the extent applicable to the Designated Subsidiary.

ARTICLE V
COVENANTS

Section 5.1. Applications

As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, SCBC and the
Seller (if and to the extent
required) shall (and the Seller shall, to the extent required, cause the
Association to) submit applications
for prior approval of the transactions contemplated herein to the Federal
Reserve Board, the OTS, the
FDIC and the Commissioner of Banks of North Carolina ("Commissioner") and
any other federal, state
or local government agency, department or body the approval of which is
required for consummation of
the Seller's purchase of the Repurchased Timeshare and Lot Assets as
provided herein, the Acquisition
and the Merger. SCBC, the Association and the Seller promptly shall furnish
one another with copies
after filing of applications made by it with these or any other regulatory
agencies. The Seller and SCBC
each represent and warrant to the other that all information concerning it
and its directors, officers and
shareholders (and concerning, in the case of the Seller, the Association and
the Association Subsidiaries,
and, in the case of SCBC, the SCBC Subsidiaries), included (or submitted for
inclusion) in any such
application shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects.
Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Section 5.1 or in Section 5.2 below, the Seller shall use
its best efforts in good faith
(and shall cause the Association and the Association Subsidiaries to use
their best efforts in good faith)
to (i) submit, not later than April 22, 1994, to the appropriate regulatory
authorities all applications, if
any, that the Seller, the Association or the Association Subsidiaries may be
required under this Section
5.1 to submit, and (ii) deliver, not later than April 15, 1994 (or such
later date that is 15 days after the
Seller's receipt of SCBC's written request hereunder, if such request is not
received by April 1, 1994),
all information concerning it, the Association and the Association
Subsidiaries, and their respective
directors, officers and shareholders, that SCBC may request in writing for
inclusion in any regulatory
applications that SCBC or the SCBC Subsidiaries may be required to submit
under this Section 5.1, and
(iii) deliver, within six (6) days after receipt of written request
therefor, all additional information
requested either by SCBC or a regulatory authority, as the case may be, to
supplement any applications
submitted by the Seller as contemplated by clause (i) hereof or to
supplement any information delivered
to SCBC as contemplated by clause (ii) hereof for inclusion in responses to
requests for additional
information to supplement any such applications. If the Seller, the
Association or any of the Association
Subsidiaries is delayed in submitting any applications beyond April 22, 1994
as contemplated by clause
(i) of the immediately preceding sentence, or is delayed in submitting
information in response to requests
from SCBC or regulatory authorities beyond the date contemplated by clause
(ii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, or is delayed in delivering additional information in
response to requests therefor
from SCBC or any regulatory authorities beyond six (6) days as contemplated
by clause (iii) of the
immediately preceding sentence, then each day that such delivery or
submission is delayed shall be
considered a "Late Day," notwithstanding the use by the Seller, the
Association and the Association
Subsidiaries of best efforts in good faith to make such delivery or
submission within the required time
period. By way of example, if the Seller does not submit a required
application until April 27, 1994 and
the Association does not deliver information requested by SCBC until April
19, 1994, the Seller, having
received the request therefor on April 1, 1994, then the total number of
Late Days is nine (five Late Days
for the delay associated with the Seller's submission of its application and
four Late Days for the delay
associated with the Association's delivery of the information requested by
SCBC). For purposes of the
foregoing, any submission or delivery or notice which would otherwise be
required to be made on a day
which is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday shall be extended until the next day
which is not a Saturday,
Sunday or holiday and such extension shall not be considered a delay and no
Late Days shall accrue
solely as a result of such extension.

Section 5.2. Best Efforts

SCBC and the Seller shall each use its best efforts in good
faith (and, in the case of the Seller,
the Seller shall cause the Association and the Association Subsidiaries to
use, and, in the case of SCBC,
SCBC shall cause the SCBC Subsidiaries to use, their best efforts in good
faith) to (i) furnish such
information as may be required in connection with and otherwise cooperate in
the preparation and filing
of the documents referred to in Section 5.1 above, and (ii) take or cause to
be taken all action necessary
or desirable on its or their part so as to permit consummation of the
Acquisition and the Merger at the
earliest possible date, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of
all third-party consents; provided,
however, that neither SCBC nor the Seller shall be required to expend other
than nominal amounts of
money to acquire third-party consents under contracts or leases to which the
Association or any Retained
Association Subsidiary is a party. Neither SCBC nor the Seller shall take,
or cause or to the best of its
ability permit to be taken, any action that would substantially delay or
impair the prospects of completing
the Acquisition or the Merger.

Section 5.3. Certain Accounting and Tax Matters

(a) The Seller and SCBC shall consult and cooperate on a
mutually satisfactory basis with each
other concerning such accounting and financial matters, including, but not
limited to, the Section 338(g)
Election and the Section 338(h) Election, each as described below, as may be
necessary, appropriate or
required to facilitate the Acquisition and the Merger (taking into account
SCBC's policies, practices and
procedures), including, without limitation, issues arising in connection
with the Association's record
keeping, loan classification, valuation adjustments, levels of loan loss
reserves and other accounting
practices; provided, however, that the Association shall not be required to
make any material change to
its loan, investment, business or accounting practices unless SCBC shall
have notified the Seller that all
conditions to SCBC's obligations to effect the Acquisition, other than those
set forth in Section 6.3(a),
(d), (e), (h)(ii), (k), (l) and (m), have been satisfied; and, provided
further, that should any such
requested change have an effect on the amounts of the Purchase Price, the
Seller's Payment and/or the
Tax Sharing Liability, SCBC and the Seller shall increase or decrease, as
applicable, the Purchase Price,
the Seller's Payment and the Tax Sharing Liability, as applicable, to
compensate (i.e., factor out) for such
effect. Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall require the Association to make
any material change in its loan,
investment, business or accounting practices other than in accordance with
HOLA and OTS' regulations.

(b) The Tax Sharing Agreement between the Seller and the
Association will be terminated as of
the Effective Time and will have no further effect for any taxable year
(whether the current year, a future
year or a past year); provided that, such termination will not affect any
right of the Seller or SCBC under
this Agreement, including, but not limited to, under Section 2.3.

(c) Except as provided in Sections 5.3(d) and
(e), SCBC will prepare and file or cause to be
prepared or filed all Tax Returns relating to the Association or any of the
Retained Association
Subsidiaries which are required to be filed after the Effective Time.
Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, SCBC will pay or cause to be paid all Taxes required to be
paid with respect to such
Tax Returns, but payment of such Taxes will not be treated as a waiver of
any rights of SCBC under
Section 2.3 or to indemnification under this Agreement.

(d) The Seller will file its consolidated federal income Tax
Return for its taxable year which
includes the Closing Date, and will report thereon the income of the
Association and the Association
Subsidiaries through the Effective Time as required by applicable law. The
Seller will pay all Taxes
required to be paid with respect to such consolidated federal income Tax
Return, but payment of such
Taxes will not be treated as a waiver of any rights of the Seller under this
Agreement, including without
limitation rights pursuant to Section 2.3. In order to assist the Seller in
preparation of such consolidated
federal income Tax Returns, SCBC will prepare and deliver to (or cause to be
prepared and delivered
to) the Seller the information which the Association and the Retained
Association Subsidiaries have
customarily provided to the Seller and other information necessary for
preparation of such Tax Return
within 60 days of the Seller's request therefor, and shall also provide
additional information and access
as provided in Section 5.3(j).

(e) The Seller will prepare or will cause to be prepared any
(i) Tax Returns required by law to
be filed by the Association or the Association Subsidiaries for taxable
years ending at or before the
Effective Time, taking into account any extensions which have been
customarily taken or requested in
prior years; and (ii) any North Carolina income Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Association or
the Association Subsidiaries for taxable years ending at or before the
Effective Time, regardless of when
filing is required. Except for Taxes required to be paid with respect to
all federal income Tax Returns
described in the preceding sentence, which the Seller shall pay, the Seller,
the Association or the Retained
Association Subsidiaries will pay all Taxes required to be paid with respect
to the income Tax Returns
described in the preceding sentence consistent with past practices and in
the Ordinary Course of Business.
To the extent any Tax Return prepared by the Seller pursuant to this Section
5.3(e) has not been filed as
of the Effective Time, SCBC will provide any additional information or
assistance as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the finalization of such Tax Return and will
cause the appropriate persons
to sign and file such Tax Return, provided that the Seller represents and
warrants in writing that such Tax
Return has been prepared in good faith with all due care and is correct and
complete in all material
respects.

(f) In accordance with Section 8.2 hereof, the Seller agrees
to indemnify SCBC from and against
any Adverse Consequences that SCBC may suffer resulting from, arising out
of, relating to, in the nature
of, or caused by any Liability of the Association or any of the Association
Subsidiaries under Section
1.1502-6 of the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury under the Tax Code (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign law or regulations).

(g) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.3, SCBC
will control all audits, refund claims
and other proceedings involving any Tax Return filed by the Association or
any Retained Association
Subsidiary. SCBC will give prompt notice to the Seller of any audit, refund
claim or other proceeding
involving any Tax Return relating (in whole or in part) to periods or
transactions prior to the Effective
Time, and will consult with the Seller and give due regard to the Seller's
interests in any negotiations or
discussions unless SCBC reasonably concludes that the Seller will not be
required to make any payment
under this Agreement by reason of the subject of the negotiation or
discussion, in which case the Seller
will have no further liability under this Agreement with respect to such
periods or transactions. SCBC
and its Affiliates and agents will not concede, settle or compromise any
claim or deficiency related to
such Tax Returns without the prior written consent of the Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; failure to obtain such consent will be treated as a waiver by SCBC
of any right to
indemnification with respect to Adverse Consequences related to the matter
conceded, settled or
compromised.

(h) The Seller will control all audits, refund claims and
other proceedings related to (i) the
federal consolidated income Tax Return of the Seller and (ii) any North
Carolina income Tax Return filed
by the Association or any Association Subsidiary with respect to periods
ended at or prior to the Effective
Time. SCBC and the Seller will give prompt notice to the other party of any
audit, refund claim or other
proceeding involving any such income Tax Return, and will cooperate with
each other in good faith in
the conduct of such audit, claim or proceeding.

(i) SCBC is eligible to, and will, make a timely election
under the Tax Code Section 338(g) (the
"Section 338(g) Election"), and both the Seller and SCBC are eligible to
make, and will join in making,
a timely election under Tax Code Section 338(h)(10) (the "Section 338(h)
Election"), with respect to the
purchase of the Shares under this Agreement. The parties will make
corresponding elections with respect
to each Retained Association Subsidiary unless, after consultation with the
Seller, (A) SCBC determines,
in good faith and in its reasonable judgment, that such elections would
increase its overall federal and
state income Tax Liabilities on a consolidated basis and that the present
value of such increase exceeds
the present value of any compensating payments to SCBC offered by the
Seller, or (B) the Seller requests
in writing that such elections not be made and SCBC does not determine, in
good faith and in its
reasonable judgment, that (x) such elections would decrease its overall
federal and state income Tax
Liabilities on a consolidated basis and (y) the present value of such
decrease exceeds the present value
of any compensating payments to SCBC offered by the Seller. SCBC will
deliver to the Seller a duly
executed and completed Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 as well as drafts
of any required
attachments (collectively, the "Section 338 Forms"), no later than 60
calendar days prior to the date the
Section 338 Forms are required to be filed. In the event of any dispute
with regard to the content of any
Section 338 Form, the parties will diligently attempt to resolve such
dispute. Once finalized, the Seller
will promptly cause the Section 338 Forms to be duly executed by an officer
of the Seller, and will return
such Section 338 Forms to SCBC. SCBC will duly and timely file the Section
338 Forms in accordance
with applicable Tax laws, and will provide written evidence to the Seller
that it has done so. Neither
SCBC nor the Seller will, and each will cause their Affiliates not to, take
any action to modify or revoke
the Section 338(g) Election or the Section 338(h) Election contained in, or
the content of, any Section
338 Form (or any comparable state or local form) without the express written
consent of the other party.
SCBC and the Seller agree to report the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in a manner
consistent with the Section 338(g) Election and the Section 338(h) Election
(and, where applicable, similar
non-federal elections) and not to take any position contrary thereto. The
obligations and procedures set
forth in this Section 5.3(i) will apply for purposes of making elections for
purposes of the North Carolina
state and local income Tax laws and regulations which are similar to
elections under Tax Code Section
338(g) or Tax Code Section 338(h)(10). The Seller will pay any Tax
attributable to the making of a
Section 338(h) Election and, subject to Section 8.2 hereof, will indemnify
SCBC, the Association and the
Retained Association Subsidiaries against any Adverse Consequences arising
out of any failure to pay
such Tax.

(j) To facilitate the performance of obligations and exercise
of rights pursuant to this Agreement,
without limiting the generality of any obligations hereunder, each party
will provide or cause its Affiliates
to provide to the other party and its agents reasonable access during normal
business hours to any
records, files or other materials relating to any Tax Returns of the
Association and the Association
Subsidiaries, and with reasonable access to any employees or agents having
knowledge relating to such
Tax Returns. Each of the parties hereto shall reimburse the other party for
all out-of-pocket
disbursements and expenditures (but not rents, utilities, internal
duplication costs, employee salaries or
other overhead) reasonably incurred by the other party in preparing and
delivering information pursuant
to the foregoing items of this Section 5.3.

(k) During the Interim Period, the Seller shall use its best
efforts, consistent with GAAP and
accounting standards imposed by the OTS, to cause the Association to
establish Budgeted Reserves by
the Closing Date. As a means of creating Budgeted Reserves for purposes of
complying with the
requirements set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the
Association may reallocate to its general
reserves in respect of Other Assets up to $1.25 million of the valuation
allowances (general or specific)
existing on the Association's books at September 30, 1993 in respect of
Excluded Assets and all such
reallocated reserves shall be considered Budgeted Reserves.

Section 5.4. Investigation and Confidentiality

The Seller will keep SCBC advised of all material developments
relevant to the business of the
Association and the Association Subsidiaries and to consummation of the
transactions contemplated
herein, and SCBC will advise the Seller of any Material Adverse Event with
respect to SCBC and the
SCBC Subsidiaries that is likely adversely to affect consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein.
SCBC may make or cause to be made such continuing investigation of the
financial and legal condition
of the Association and the Association Subsidiaries as SCBC reasonably deems
necessary or advisable
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein; provided, however,
that such continuing
investigation shall be reasonably related to such transactions and shall not
interfere unnecessarily with
normal operations. The Seller agrees to furnish SCBC and its advisors with
such financial data and other
information with respect to its business, financial condition and Tax
matters as SCBC shall, from time
to time, reasonably request. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4
shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by, or the conditions to the
obligations hereunder of, either
party hereto. SCBC shall, and shall cause its directors, officers,
employees, attorneys and advisors to,
maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained in such
investigation or pursuant to the letter
agreement, dated August 31, 1993, between the Seller and SCBC which is not
otherwise publicly
disclosed by the Seller, said undertaking with respect to confidentiality to
survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof.

Section 5.5. Press Releases

SCBC and the Seller shall agree with each other as to the form
and substance of any press release
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
consult with each other as to the
form and substance of other public disclosures related thereto; provided,
however, that nothing contained
herein shall prohibit either party, following notification to the other
party, from making any disclosure
which its counsel deems necessary under applicable securities laws.

Section 5.6. Forbearances of the Association

Section 5.8. Closing; Effective Time

(a) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other
than the Merger) shall be
consummated at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at the offices of SCBC's
counsel, Brooks, Pierce,
McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard, L.L.P., Suite 2000, Renaissance Plaza, 230
North Elm Street,
Greensboro, North Carolina, or such other place as shall be agreed to by
SCBC and the Seller, on the
fifth business day following satisfaction of the conditions to consummation
of the Acquisition set forth
in Article VI hereof or such later date as the parties may otherwise agree
(the "Closing Date"). The
Acquisition shall be effective as of the Closing on the Closing Date or at
such other time and date
specified by the parties at the Closing (the "Effective Time"); provided,
however, that solely for financial
accounting and Tax reporting purposes, the Seller's purchase of the Excluded
Assets, the Association's
payment of the Tax Sharing Liability and the Acquisition, in that order,
shall be deemed effective as of
11:59:59 o'clock p.m., Greensboro, North Carolina time, on the Closing Date.
The Merger shall occur
at such time as may be specified by SCBC, which may be either at the
Effective Time or thereafter.

(b) The Closing shall be conducted pursuant to and in
accordance with a closing escrow
agreement to be executed by the Seller, SCBC, the Association and an escrow
agent to be selected by
mutual agreement of the Seller and SCBC (the "Closing Escrow Agent"). The
form and substance of the
closing escrow agreement shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Seller and
SCBC and shall obligate the
Closing Escrow Agent to hold all documents and funds deposited with it
pursuant to the closing escrow
agreement until it has received all such documents and funds and until it
has been authorized to deliver
and, if necessary, record such documents and release such funds by joint
instructions of the Seller, SCBC
and the Association. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the
contrary, the Seller and SCBC
contemplate that the closing escrow agreement will require the Association
to deliver to the Closing
Escrow Agent all executed transfer documents pertaining to the Excluded
Assets and to require the Seller
to deposit with the Closing Escrow Agent the Seller's Payment, subject to
such credits and offsets as are
provided in this Agreement.
At the Closing: (i) the Seller shall deliver to
SCBC (A) the various certificates, instruments and
documents described in Section 6.3, (B) in executed forms, the
Responsibilities Agreement and
Appropriate security documents and Intercreditor Agreements, all as
described in Section 8.4, (C) in
executed form, a security agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to
SCBC and its counsel,
granting the Deferred Payment Security Interests and, if necessary to
establish the first priority of such
Deferred Payment Security Interests, Intercreditor Agreement(s), (D) stock
certificates representing
ownership of the Shares, endorsed for transfer, at SCBC's election to SCBC
or the Designated
Subsidiary, and (E) evidence of the revocation of all proxies in respect of
the Shares granted to the OTS
and of the termination of all agreements between the OTS and the Seller with
regard to the Shares and/or
the Association, which revocation and termination may be conditioned upon
the consummation of the
Acquisition; (ii) the Seller shall deliver the Seller's Payment to the
Association and/or to any Retained
Association Subsidiary from which Excluded Assets are to be transferred,
except as provided in the
following clauses (iii) and (iv); (iii) SCBC shall deliver to the Seller the
Cash Payment Amount, subject
to the Seller's right under Section 2.2(d) to cause all or a portion of the
Cash Payment Amount to be paid
to the Association and/or to any Retained Association Subsidiary as an
offset to, and as a credit against,
the Seller's Payment; and (iv) the Association, or SCBC on behalf of the
Association, shall deliver to the
Seller the amount of the estimated Tax Sharing Liability as of the Effective
Time, subject to the Seller's
right under Section 2.3(d) to cause all or a portion of such estimated Tax
Sharing Liability to be retained
by the Association and/or paid to any Retained Association Subsidiary as an
offset to, and credit against,
the Seller's Payment; and, (v) the Association shall deliver to the Seller
the License and Services
Agreement described in Section 5.9.

(c) In the case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Seller and SCBC will take such
further action (including the
execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the
other may reasonably request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party (unless the request
is made in connection with a
claim for indemnity pursuant to Article VIII and the requesting party is
SCBC and is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Section 8.2). The Seller acknowledges and
agrees that from and after the
Effective Time the original records (including Tax records), agreements, and
financial data of any sort
of the Association and the Retained Association Subsidiaries (except to the
extent such records constitute
Excluded Assets), wherever now located, shall be located at the main offices
of the Association or at such
other location as SCBC shall determine, and shall be the property of the
Association; provided, however,
that SCBC shall provide the Seller access to certain of such records as
provided in Section 5.3(j).

Section 5.9. Employees and Employee Benefit Plans

(a) As of the Effective Time the employees of the Association
and the Retained Association
Subsidiaries (other than Robert T. Waugh who shall remain employed under his
Previously Disclosed
employment agreement with the Association) shall remain employees of the
Association and the Retained
Association Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") with only such rights
as to continued employment
as exist under North Carolina law with respect to persons not parties to
employment agreements with
their employer. SCBC, the Association or the Retained Association
Subsidiaries may terminate any such
Continuing Employee in accordance with SCBC's employment policies and
practices at any time
thereafter; provided, that M.L. Beall, a current employee of the
Association, will be employed by the
Seller as of the Effective Time on terms acceptable to Mr. Beall and the
Seller, and will be permitted to
conduct his activities for the Seller from the premises of the Association
as provided in a License and
Services Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit E. During the period
following the Acquisition, if a
Continuing Employee remains in the employ of the Association or a Retained
Association Subsidiary, he
or she shall be eligible to receive group hospitalization, medical, life,
disability and other benefits
comparable to those provided to the present employees of the SCBC
Subsidiaries. With respect to
Continuing Employees, SCBC shall waive "pre-existing conditions" provisions
under its health care
insurance plan in connection with the admission of such Continuing Employees
to such Plan. Following
the Merger, the Association's Money Purchase Pension Plan (the "MPP Plan")
shall be terminated, and
the rights and interests of the Continuing Employees of the Association and
the Retained Association
Subsidiaries in such plan shall become fully vested, with each participating
employee having the right or
option either to receive the benefits to which they are entitled as a result
of the termination of the MPP
Plan or to have such benefits "rolled" into the 401(k) Plan maintained by
SCBC and the SCBC
Subsidiaries for the benefit of their employees, and on the same basis and
applying the eligibility
standards as would apply to employees of SCBC and the SCBC Subsidiaries,
recognizing the past service
of those Continuing Employees of the Association and the Retained
Association Subsidiaries as if such
service had been performed on behalf of SCBC and the SCBC Subsidiaries for
vesting and qualification,
but not for funding, purposes. Following the Merger, the Continuing
Employees of the Association and
the Retained Association Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate, to
the same extent and on the same
terms as the employees of SCBC, in any retirement, pension, medical
insurance or similar plans in effect
for the benefit of the employees of SCBC and the SCBC Subsidiaries (but not
in deferred compensation,
split-dollar insurance, incentive bonus, stock option, stock appreciation
rights, stock ownership or long
term incentive compensation plans or arrangements established for the
benefit of certain of SCBC's
employees) which when considered as a whole shall be no less favorable than
the benefits currently
provided to the employees of the Association. For purposes of participating
in all plans and benefits of
SCBC, such Continuing Employees shall receive credit for their period of
service to the Association and
the Retained Association Subsidiaries for participation and vesting purposes
only. The foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.9(a) are not intended to confer, and should not
be construed to confer, any
right upon or contract in favor of any employee of the Association or any
Retained Association
Subsidiary.

(b) The Association shall make all required contributions to
the MPP Plan in a manner consistent
with its past practices and in a percentage amount no higher than that made
over the past two (2) fiscal
years. Contributions made to the MPP Plan in previous periods which were
forfeited by former
participants in the MPP Plan, which are currently credited to a deferred
forfeiture account and which are
currently being accreted into income (approximately $199,000) shall not be
allocated to the MPP Plan
participants and shall remain credited to the deferred forfeiture account,
except to the extent they are
accreted into income prior to the Effective Time in a manner consistent with
past practices.

Section 5.10. Consent of Lender and Other Necessary Consents.

At the earliest practicable time after the date of this
Agreement, the Seller shall advise The First
National Bank of Boston (the "Lender") and each other Person identified on
Appendix 2 hereto of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein, and diligently shall seek
(a) all approvals of, and consents to, this Agreement and such transactions
from the Lender (the
"Lender's Approval") and from each such other Person (collectively, the
"Other Necessary Approvals")
as are required or necessary under all agreements, instruments and other
understandings between or
among the Seller, its Affiliates and the Lender or each such other Person,
as the case may be, for the
Acquisition to be effected, upon the terms and conditions described herein,
at the Closing, (b) the
Lender's written confirmation of its acceptance of the terms and conditions
of, and of its intent to execute
and deliver at the Closing, the FNBB Intercreditor Agreement, the form and
substance of which shall be
satisfactory to SCBC and its legal counsel (the "Lender's Confirmation"),
and (c) the Lender's written
commitment to fund the Seller's purchase of the Excluded Assets to the
extent the cash proceeds of the
Acquisition to the Seller are not sufficient to do so (the "Lender's
Commitment").

Section 5.11. Designated Loans.

SCBC and the Seller have agreed that the Loans listed on
Exhibit H hereto (the "Designated
Loans") will be retained by the Association and will not be Excluded Loans.
Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if (i) there occurs a default under the terms of any document
evidencing or securing a
Designated Loan and such default has not been cured within any applicable
cure period set forth in such
document(s) after delivery of any required notice of such default, or (ii)
any representation or warranty
pertaining to a Designated Loan set forth in this Agreement is determined to
be inaccurate or untrue, then
the Seller shall purchase such Designated Loan either (A) at the Closing and
as an Excluded Loan, if the
events described in clauses (i) or (ii) hereof shall occur prior to the
Closing Date, or (B) within ten (10)
days after the Seller's receipt of written demand from SCBC setting forth
the circumstances requiring
such purchase, in which case the Seller shall pay SCBC a cash purchase price
equal to the unpaid
principal balance and accrued interest due on such Designated Loan on the
date of the Seller's purchase
thereof minus the amount of any specific valuation allowances in respect of
such Designated Loan existing
on the books of the Association as of the Closing Date. The purchase of
such Designated Loan by the
Seller shall be SCBC's sole remedy and recourse for the borrower's default
on a Designated Loan or the
inaccuracy or untruthfulness of any representation or warranty of the Seller
pertaining to such Designated
Loan set forth in this Agreement.

(m) The Seller (or its designated Affiliate) (i) shall have
purchased the Excluded Assets and
assumed the Excluded Liabilities pursuant to one or more purchase and
assumption agreements with the
Association and the Retained Association Subsidiaries, and shall have
executed and delivered, or executed
and received, all necessary related documents and instruments, all of which
agreements, documents and
instruments shall be in form, substance, and effect reasonably satisfactory
to SCBC and its counsel, and
(ii) shall have advised SCBC of whether (A) it has paid the Seller's Payment
to the Association and/or
any Retained Association Subsidiary in immediately available funds, or (B)
it desires to cause SCBC to
deliver all or a portion of the Cash Payment Amount to the Association
and/or to any Retained
Association Subsidiaries as an offset to, and as a credit against, the
Seller's Payment, and/or (C) it desires
to cause the Association to retain, and/or to pay to any Retained
Association Subsidiary, all or a portion
of the amount of the estimated Tax Sharing Liability as an offset to, and as
a credit against, the Seller's
Payment.

(h) at any time, by either party hereto in writing, if such

Section 7.2. Effect of Termination

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1 hereof, this Agreement shall
become void and have no further effect, except that (i) the provisions
relating to confidentiality and
expenses set forth in Sections 5.4 and 8.1, respectively, and (ii) the
provisions relating to the
consequences of termination set forth in Section 7.2(b), shall survive any
such termination, and (ii) a
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b) shall not, except as otherwise may be
provided pursuant to Section
7.2(b), relieve the breaching party from liability for an uncured breach of
the covenant, undertaking,
representation, or warranty giving rise to such termination. Without
affecting any right, claim, or cause
of action against the Seller, SCBC agrees not to assert any right, claim or
cause of action against the
Association in the event of the termination of this Agreement for any
reason.

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by SCBC

Dollars ($925,000)
within 30 days of written notice to SCBC by the Seller following such
termination. Any amount paid
pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) shall represent the liquidated damages of
the party receiving such amount
and shall constitute such party's sole and exclusive remedy for such
termination.

Section 7.3. Waiver

Except with respect to any required regulatory approval, each
party hereto by written instrument
signed by the chief executive officer of such party, may at any time extend
the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto and may
waive (i) any inaccuracies of the
other party in the representations and warranties contained in this

agreements of the other party,
or satisfaction of any of the conditions precedent to its obligations,
contained herein or (iii) the

waiver by either such party
of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or
not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence.

ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS

Section 8.1. Expenses

Each party hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses
incurred by it in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including fees and expenses of
its own financial consultants,
accountants and counsel, except (a) as otherwise provided for pursuant to
Section 7.2(b), and (b) as
otherwise provided in Sections 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5; provided, however, if
the Seller shall terminate this
Agreement in compliance with Section 7.1(g)(ii) or (iii), then within ten
(10) days of the date of such
termination, the Seller shall reimburse SCBC, in immediately available
funds, an amount equal to the sum
of (i) all fees paid or payable, and all expenses reimbursed or
reimbursable, by SCBC to its outside
attorneys, independent accountants, investment advisors, loan review
consultants, computer consultants
and other outside advisors and consultants in connection with services,
analyses, considerations or
activities undertaken in connection with the Acquisition, the Merger and/or
this Agreement, (ii) all
application and similar fees paid by SCBC or any SCBC Subsidiary to
governmental agencies or
departments in connection with the Acquisition or the Merger, and (iii) the
sum of $20,000 as full
reimbursement to SCBC and the SCBC Subsidiaries for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them for
travel, copying, telephone tolls and similar matters.

Section 8.2. Indemnification

SCBC and the Seller agree that upon consummation of the
Acquisition at the Closing, the
provisions of this Section 8.2 shall become and be in full force and effect.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 8.2(a) and in Section 8.2(c) hereof, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8.3 hereof and, if
applicable, the Responsibilities
Agreement, the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless SCBC, the
Association and/or each of the
Retained Association Subsidiaries from and against all Indemnifiable Losses
suffered by it or them by
reasons of:

(i) the untruthfulness or the inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty of the
Seller or the breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Seller contained in this
Agreement, other than the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements
set forth in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 5.3(f),
5.3(i) and 5.11 hereof;

(ii) the untruthfulness or the
inaccuracy of any representations or 
warranties of the
Seller set forth in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of
this Agreement;

(iii) the breach of any agreement or
covenant of the Seller set forth in Sections 
5.3(f) and 5.3(i) of this Agreement;

(iv) the Class Action Litigation;

(v) the Homeowners Litigation;

(vi) the Bankruptcy Litigation;

(vii) any "Excess Severance Benefit"
claimed against the Association or its 
successor after the Merger by any hereafter
named employee of the Association if he or she
is involuntarily terminated by the
Association or by its successor after the Merger
within twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time: Betty Allison; Rick Downey;
Sandy Harlan; John Johns; Barry Lesley;
Sandra Lully; and Anelson Watkins
(the "Named Employees"). The term "Excess
Severance Benefit" means an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
lump sum benefit a Named Employee
claims he or she is entitled to receive from
the Association or its successor after
the Merger over the amount of the lump sum
severance benefit that would have
been paid to that Named Employee pursuant to
the severance policy of the
Association entitled "First Federal
Severance and Separation Plan," as in effect
on March 1, 1994 (the "Policy"), if he or
she had been eligible for a lump sum
severance benefit under the Policy and if he
or she had been involuntarily
terminated on such date of termination; and

(viii) the breach of any agreement or
covenant of the Seller set forth in Section 5.11
of this Agreement.

A claim for indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of this
Section 8.2(a) may be made at any time
on or before 11:59:59 o'clock, p.m., Greensboro, North Carolina time on the
nine hundred thirteenth
(913th) day after the Closing Date (the "Period End"). A claim for
indemnification pursuant to clause
(iii) of this Section 8.2(a) may be made at any time on or before the date
which is the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date. A claim for indemnification under clauses
(ii) and (vii) of this Section
8.2(a) may be made at any time prior to 30 days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of
limitations governing actions which could be brought arising out of the
matters for which indemnification
is provided in such clauses. Any claim for indemnification under clauses
(iv), (v) and (vi) may be made
at any time prior to 15 days after the Termination of the Litigation giving
rise to such claim. Any claim
for indemnification under clause (viii) of this Section 8.2(a) shall be made
within 15 days after the
Seller's failure to purchase a Designated Loan in respect of which SCBC has
made demand in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5.11 hereof. Any claim for indemnification
under clause (i) or (iii) of this
Section 8.2(a) that is not made within the time period provided herein shall
be forever barred,
notwithstanding any longer period provided in any otherwise applicable
statute of limitations or any other
rule or law to the contrary.

With respect to claims for indemnification under clauses (i)
of this Section 8.2(a) (but no other
claims for indemnification under this Section 8.2(a) which shall be payable
without limitation), the Seller
shall not be required to make an Indemnity Payment for a single claim unless
and until the amount of
Indemnifiable Losses arising from that claim exceed $50,000 (the "single-
loss deductible"), after which
amount the Seller shall pay all Indemnifiable Losses arising from that claim
to the extent such
Indemnifiable Losses exceed the single-loss deductible. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Seller shall
make an Indemnity Payment of all Indemnifiable Losses arising from a claim
under clause (i) of this
Section 8.2(a), without regard to the single-loss deductible of $50,000, if
and when the aggregate amount
of Indemnifiable Losses for which the Seller has not made Indemnity Payments
as a result of the single-
loss deductible equals $225,000 (the "aggregate-loss deductible") to the
extent such Indemnifiable Losses
exceed the aggregate-loss deductible. For purposes of determining whether
or not the $50,000 single-loss
deductible and/or any part of the $225,000 aggregate-loss deductible is
available with respect to a claim
for indemnification under clause (i) of this Section 8.2(a), the
Indemnifiable Losses of SCBC, the
Association and the Retained Association Subsidiaries arising from a single
claim shall be aggregated,
and each dollar of Indemnifiable Loss of SCBC, the Association and/or a
Retained Association Subsidiary
from a claim (taking into consideration requirements imposed in the specific
representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement alleged to have been violated, such as a "materiality"
or "Material Adverse Event"
threshold, which must be satisfied before such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement can be
violated and a corresponding claim for indemnification may be made) shall be
charged against the single-
loss and aggregate-loss deductibles; provided, however, each dollar of
Indemnifiable Losses recovered
by SCBC, the Association and/or any of the Retained Association Subsidiaries
from any Person that is
not an Affiliate of any of them prior to the making of such a claim for
indemnification shall not be
charged against the single-loss deductible or the aggregate-loss deductible.
By way of example only, if
the first six claims for indemnification under clause (i) of this Section
8.2(a) are separate and are made
by SCBC in the following order and for Indemnifiable Losses in the amounts
of $49,900, $49,900,
$49,900, $49,900 $25,000 and $500 (determined in each instance after taking
into consideration any
"materiality," Material Adverse Event" or similar threshold applicable to
the specific representation,
warranty, agreement or covenant that SCBC asserts the Seller has breached),
the Seller would not be
obligated to make Indemnity Payments to SCBC for the first four claims for
$49,900 each nor the fifth
claim for $25,000, because each of these claims is for Indemnifiable Losses
in an amount less than the
$50,000 single-loss deductible and the aggregate of these five claims (i.e.,
$224,600) is less than the
$225,000 aggregate-loss deductible; the Seller would be obligated to make an
Indemnity Payment for
Indemnifiable Losses of $100 to SCBC in respect of the sixth claim for $500,
even though it is for an
amount less than the $50,000 single-loss deductible, because the sum of the
six claims (i.e., $225,100)
exceeds the $225,000 aggregate-loss deductible by this amount; and,
thereafter, the Seller would be
obligated to make Indemnity Payments for all claims under clause (i) of this
Section 8.2(a) without regard
to the $50,000 single-loss deductible.

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section
8.2(b) and in Section 8.2(c) hereof, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8.3 hereof, SCBC shall
indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller from and against all Indemnifiable Losses suffered by the Seller
by reason of the inaccuracy
or untruthfulness of a representation or warranty of SCBC or the breach of
any covenant or agreement
of SCBC contained in this Agreement. A claim for indemnification pursuant
to this Section 8.2(b) that
is not made on or before the Period End shall be forever barred,
notwithstanding any longer period
provided in any otherwise applicable statute of limitations or any other
rule of law to the contrary.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 8.2(a) hereof to the
contrary, the Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify SCBC, the Association and/or any of the Retained
Association Subsidiaries for
Indemnifiable Losses suffered by it or them by reason of the inaccuracy or
untruthfulness of any
representation or warranty of the Seller or the breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Seller of which
SCBC has actual, conscious awareness prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that the preceding
provision of this sentence does not apply to the Indemnifiable Losses
arising from or incurred in
connection with Indemnifiable Losses under Sections 8.2(a)(iv), (v), (vi),
and (vii). Notwithstanding
anything in Section 8.2(b) hereof to the contrary, SCBC shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Seller
for Indemnifiable Losses suffered by the Seller by reason of the inaccuracy
of a representation or
warranty or the breach of a covenant or an agreement of which the Seller has
actual, conscious awareness
prior to the Effective Time. The sole remedy and recourse for the
inaccuracy or untruthfulness of a
representation or warranty or the breach of a covenant or an agreement of
which SCBC or the Seller, as
the case may be, has actual, conscious awareness prior to the Effective Time
(except, as provided above,
this provision shall not apply to SCBC's awareness of the Litigation) shall
be, in the case of the Seller,
to refuse to waive the condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.2(a)
hereof and to terminate this
Agreement under Section 7.1(b) hereof, and, in the case of SCBC, to refuse
to waive the condition to
Closing set forth in Section 6.3(a) hereof and to terminate this Agreement
under Section 7.1(b) hereof.

Section 8.3. Indemnification Procedures.

(a) With respect to indemnification under clauses (iv), (v)
and (vi) of Section 8.2(a) for the Class
Action Litigation, the Homeowners Litigation and the Bankruptcy Litigation,
respectively, the Seller and
SCBC shall execute and deliver at the Closing the Responsibilities
Agreement, pursuant to which the
Seller shall assume the defense of each such Litigation matter that has not
been Terminated as of the
Closing and SCBC shall undertake to cooperate in good faith in the defense
of each such Litigation
matter, all upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Responsibilities
Agreement;

(b) With respect to claims for indemnification under Section
8.2(a) hereof (other than clauses
(iv), (v) and (vi) thereof) and under Section 8.2(b) hereof:

(i) If any Indemnified Party receives
notice of the assertion or commencement of
any Third Party Claim against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which any
Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide
indemnification under Section 8.2
(including any claim concerning a Named
Employee with respect to the matters
described in Section 8.2(a)(vii)), the
Indemnified Party will deliver to such
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written
notice thereof, which in no event
will be later than 15 calendar days after
receipt of such notice of the assertion or
commencement of such Third Party Claim.
Such notice will describe the Third
Party Claim in reasonable detail, will
include copies of all materials written in
evidence thereof and will indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Indemnifiable Losses
that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
will have the right to participate in,
or, by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume, the defense of
any Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying
Party's own expense and by such
Indemnifying Party's own counsel (reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party), and the Indemnified Party will
cooperate in good faith in such defense.

(ii) If, within ten (10) calendar days
after the date of deliver of notice of a Third
Party Claim to an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i), an
Indemnified Party receives written notice
from the Indemnifying Party that the
Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim
as provided in the last sentence of Section
8.3(b)(i), the Indemnifying Party will
not be liable to indemnify the Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense
thereof, notwithstanding the definition of
the term "Adverse Consequences;"
provided, however, that if the Indemnifying
Party fails to take reasonable steps
necessary to defend diligently such Third
Party Claim within 15 calendar days
after the delivery by the Indemnified Party
of written notice that the Indemnified
Party believes the Indemnifying Party has
failed to take such steps or if the
Indemnifying Party has not undertaken fully
to indemnify the Indemnified Party
in respect of all Indemnifiable Losses
relating to the matter, the Indemnified
Party may assume its own defense, and the
Indemnifying Party will be liable for
all reasonable costs or expenses paid or
incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection therewith; and, provided further,
that if the Indemnifying Party is also
a party or party-in-interest to such Third
Party Claim and the Indemnified Party
receives a written opinion of counsel that,
as a result of such status of the
Indemnifying Party, counsel for the
Indemnifying Party (the "Indemnifying
Party's Counsel") has, or reasonably will
have, a conflict of interest in
representing both the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party with respect
to such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party, upon notice to the
Indemnifying Party, may employ separate
counsel to represent the Indemnified
Party in such Third Party Claim (the
"Indemnified Party's Counsel"), with the
expense of Indemnified Party's Counsel to be
Indemnifiable Losses. In such
events, the participation of the Indemnified
Party's Counsel in any Third Party
Claim shall not preclude (a) continuing
representation of the Indemnifying Party
in such Third Party Claim by the
Indemnifying Party's Counsel, or (b)
continuing representation of the Indemnified
Party by the Indemnified Party's
Counsel in connection with matters related
to or arising under the Agreement or
the other agreements referenced herein.
Without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
will not enter into any settlement of
any Third Party Claim that would lead to
Liability or create any financial or
other obligation on the part of the
Indemnified Party. If a firm offer is made to
settle a Third Party Claim without leading
to Liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and
agree to such offer, the Indemnifying
Party will deliver written notice to the
Indemnified Party to such effect. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such
firm offer with ten (10) calendar days
after the delivery of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest
or defend such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, the maximum amount of
Indemnifiable Losses for such Third Party
Claim may not exceed the amount of
Indemnifiable Losses incurred through the
end of such ten (10) calendar day
period, plus the amount of such settlement
offer. In the event that (a) the
Indemnifying Party ceases to take reasonable
steps to defend any Third Party
Claim after expiration of the fifteen (15)
day notice period prescribed in the first
sentence of this clause (ii) of Section
8.3(b), or (b) the Indemnified Party elects
to continue to contest or defend a Third
Party Claim as described in the
immediately preceding sentence, the
Indemnified Party may elect to retain the
Indemnifying Party's Counsel to continue to
contest or defend such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party, after
consulting with and receiving the advise
of its own counsel about this provision,
agrees and consents, and waives all
objections and assertions of conflicts of
interest, to the continuing representation
of the Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying
Party's Counsel and/or the
Indemnified Party's Counsel in the
circumstances and as described in the
immediately preceding sentence.

(iii) Any Direct Claim will be asserted
by delivery to the Indemnifying Party of
reasonably prompt written notice thereof,
which, except as otherwise specifically
provided in Section 8.2(a), in no event will
be later than 30 calendar days after
the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such
Direct Claim, and the Indemnifying
Party will have a period of 15 calendar days
within which to respond in writing
to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not so respond within such
15 calendar day period, the Indemnifying
Party will be deemed to have rejected
such claim, in which event the Indemnified
Party will be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Party on the terms and subject
to the provisions of this Agreement.

(iv) A failure to give timely notice or
to include any specified information in any
notices as provided in Sections 8.3(c)(i),
8.3(c)(ii) or 8.3(c)(iii) will not affect the
rights or obligations of any party hereto
except and only to the extent that, as a
result of such failure, any party hereto
that was entitled to receive such notice
was deprived of its right to recover any
payment under its applicable insurance
coverage or was otherwise damaged as a
result of such failure. The Indemnified
Party shall use its best reasonable efforts
to cooperate and assist the Indemnifying
Party in defending any Third Party Claim,
which shall include, but not be limited
to, the pursuit of all cross-claims and
counterclaims associated therewith (other
than any such claim by the Indemnified Party
against an Affiliate thereof) and
reasonable access to all records and
employees of the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that all reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Indemnified Party thereby incurred shall be
reimbursed by the Indemnifying
Party within ten (10) days of written demand
therefor.

(v) If the amount of any Indemnifiable
Losses, at any time subsequent to the making
of an Indemnity Payment or charge against
the single-loss deductible and the
aggregate-loss deductible, is reduced by
recovery, settlement or otherwise under
or pursuant to any insurance coverage, other
than a recovery, settlement or other
reduction from any Person that is an
Affiliate of the Indemnified Party, or
pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement
or payment by or against any Person
that is not an Affiliate of the Indemnified
Party, then the amount of such
reduction, less any costs, expenses,
premiums or taxes incurred in connection
therewith, will promptly be repaid by the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying
Party up to the amount of any Indemnity
Payment made in respect of such
Indemnifiable Losses, and any amount in
excess of such Indemnity Payment shall
be retained by the Indemnified Party, and
the amount of any charge against the
single-loss deductible and the aggregate
loss deductible in respect of such
Indemnifiable Losses shall be reversed and
the deductibles restored up to the
amount of such excess. Upon making any
Indemnity Payment the Indemnifying
Party will, to the extent of such Indemnity
Payment and/or the amount of the
single-loss deductible and the aggregate-
loss deductible charged against the claim
associated with such Indemnity Payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party against any third party
that is not an Affiliate of the
Indemnified Party in respect of the
Indemnifiable Losses to which the Indemnity
Payment relates; provided, however, that (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall then
be in compliance with its obligations under
this Agreement in respect of such
Indemnifiable Losses, and (ii) until the
Indemnified Party recovers full payment
of its Indemnifiable Losses (other than the
amount of the single-loss deductible
and the amount of the aggregate-loss
deductible charged against a Direct Claim
or Third Party Claim or associated with the
Indemnity Payment), any and all
claims of the Indemnifying Party against
such third party on account of said
Indemnity Payment will be subrogated and
subordinated in right of payment to
the Indemnified Party's rights against such
third party. Without limiting the
generality or effect of any other provision
of this Agreement, each such
Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party
will duly execute upon request all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence
and perfect the above-described
subrogation and subordination rights.

(c) If a dispute arises with respect to Section 8.2 of this
Agreement, the parties agree to resolve
any such dispute by seeking a fair and prompt negotiated resolution, but if
this is not successful, all
disputes shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to Section 8.5 of this
Agreement.

Section 8.4. Indemnification Collateral.

(a) In order to secure the Seller's indemnification
obligations under Section 8.2(a) hereof (the
"General Indemnity"), the Seller shall, at the Closing, grant, transfer and
deliver to SCBC, as Collateral
Agent, perfected first liens and security interests ("Indemnification
Security Interests") on and in Eligible
Collateral having a General Indemnity Value in an amount (the "Required
General Indemnity Amount")
of at least $1,500,000 (the "General Indemnity Collateral Pool"). In order
to further secure the Seller's
indemnification obligations under clause (iv) of Section 8.2(a) for the
Class Action Litigation, but for no
other purposes (the "Litigation Indemnity"), the Seller shall, at the
Closing, grant, transfer and deliver
to SCBC, as Collateral Agent, perfected first liens and security interests
("Litigation Security Interests")
on and in Eligible Collateral having a Litigation Indemnity Value in an
amount (the "Required Litigation
Indemnity Amount") of at least $244,000 (the "Litigation Indemnity
Collateral Pool").

(b) The term "General Indemnity Value" means: (i) in the case
of Eligible Excluded Assets, 60%
of the Net Book Value on the books of the Association or the applicable
Retained Association Subsidiary
as of the Closing Date minus the aggregate amount of principal repayments
received by the Seller during
the period of time from the Closing Date through the last day of the
calendar month immediately
preceding the date upon which the Indemnification Security Interests are
granted in or on the Eligible
Excluded Asset (the "General Indemnity Security Interest Date"); and (ii) in
the case of Other Eligible
Collateral, face value. The term "Litigation Indemnity Value" means (i) in
the case of Eligible Excluded
Assets, 70% of the Net Book Value on the books of the Association or the
applicable Retained
Association Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, minus, in the case of
Eligible Excluded Assets, until the
twelfth (12th) Monthly Adjustment (as defined below) 50% of the provisions
for losses taken by the Seller
and other write-downs in value on the Seller's books at or after the
Effective Time in respect of such
Eligible Excluded Assets (and thereafter such reserves and write-downs shall
be disregarded), and minus
the aggregate amount of principal repayments received by the Seller during
the period of time from the
Closing Date through the last day of the calendar month immediately
preceding the date upon which the
Litigation Security Interests are granted in or on the Eligible Excluded
Asset (the "Litigation Indemnity
Security Interest Date"), and (ii) in the case of Other Eligible Collateral,
face value. After the Closing,
the General Indemnity Value and the Litigation Indemnity Value of the actual
collateral from time to time
(the "Collateral") will be reviewed at the end of each calendar month, and
Indemnification Security
Interests and/or Litigation Security Interests in any additional Eligible
Collateral necessary to meet each
of the Required General Indemnity Amount and the Required Litigation
Indemnity Amount will be
granted, transferred and delivered by the Seller to SCBC, as Collateral
Agent (the "Monthly
Adjustment"), within ten (10) business days thereafter. For purposes of the
Monthly Adjustment, the
General Indemnity Value and the Litigation Indemnity Value each will be
calculated as of the last day
of that month (rather than the General Indemnity Security Interest Date or
the Litigation Indemnity
Security Interest Date, as applicable) and will also reflect any adjustments
required by reason of any
principal repayments received by the Seller in respect of Collateral during
such month, unrepaired
damage, destruction or condemnation. The Required General Indemnity Value
of the General Indemnity
Collateral Pool will be reduced from time to time by the amount of any
Indemnifiable Losses paid by the
Seller on indemnification claims under clause (i) of Section 8.2(a), whether
on Direct Claims or Third
Party Claims, and a corresponding amount of the Collateral in the General
Indemnity Collateral Pool shall
be immediately released by SCBC, as Collateral Agent, from the
Indemnification Security Interests.

(c) The term "Eligible Collateral" means (i) Excluded Loans
and Excluded Real Estate and JV
Interests (collectively, the "Eligible Excluded Assets"), and (ii) Cash,
U.S. government obligations and
other security of similar credit standing and liquidity mutually agreed upon
by the Seller and SCBC
(collectively, the "Other Eligible Collateral").

(d) The Seller may from time to time and at any time remove
Collateral from the General
Indemnity Collateral Pool or the Litigation Indemnity Collateral Pool and
SCBC, as Collateral Agent,
shall release the Indemnification Security Interests or Litigation Security
Interests, as applicable, on such
Collateral, provided that (i) Eligible Collateral having a General Indemnity
Value or a Litigation
Indemnity Value, as applicable, equal to the Collateral to be removed and
released shall be substituted
immediately prior to the time of such removal and release, and (ii) the
Seller shall give SCBC at least
five (5) business days' prior notice of its intention to make a removal,
release and substitution.

(e) At the Closing (and at the time of the granting of any
Indemnification Security Interests or
Litigation Security Interests after the Closing) the Seller and SCBC will
enter into security documents
which shall: (i) be Appropriate for the type of Eligible Collateral
involved; (ii) be in form and substance
identical (except for necessary changes) to those which will be agreed upon
prior to the Closing; (iii)
provide that the only obligations secured thereby are the Seller's
obligations under the General Indemnity,
in the case of security documents relating to any of the General Indemnity
Collateral Pool, or the Seller's
obligations under the Litigation Indemnity, in the case of security
documents relating to any of the
Litigation Indemnity Collateral Pool; (iv) permit all receipts from the
Collateral, including, without
limitation, principal, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, insurance
proceeds, condemnation awards, sale
proceeds and the like to continue to be paid to the Seller, unless an event
of default has occurred under
the security documents which relate to such Collateral, except that receipts
of principal other than regular
installment payments of principal, insurance proceeds, condemnation awards
and sales proceeds shall be
payable to the Seller only if the Required General Indemnity Amount or
Required Litigation Indemnity
Amount, as applicable, of Collateral will remain in the General Indemnity
Collateral Pool or the
Litigation Indemnity Collateral Pool, as applicable, after the payment
thereof and after the addition
thereto of any new Collateral by the Seller; (v) provide that any Collateral
then remaining in the General
Indemnity Collateral Pool shall be released on the first business day which
follows the Period End;
provided, however, if there then exists any unresolved Direct Claims or
Third Party Claims made in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, Collateral having a
General Indemnity Value not
less than the aggregate amount of such claim(s) shall be retained and
released upon the final resolution
of such claim(s) or partially released as multiple claims are finally
resolved; (vi) provide that any
Collateral remaining in the Litigation Indemnity Collateral Pool upon
Termination of the Class Action
Litigation shall be released on the 16th day following such Termination, and
(vii) provide, with respect
to Collateral in the General Indemnity Collateral Pool, that the Seller
shall not be deemed to be in default
of its obligations while the Seller is disputing its obligations to
indemnify SCBC, the Association and/or
the Retained Association Subsidiaries for any claims under clauses (i),
(ii), and (iii) of Section 8.2(a) of
this Agreement in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in this Agreement. The
term "Appropriate" shall mean a document satisfactory in form and substance
to SCBC and when used
in respect of any Eligible Collateral which is: (A) an Excluded Loan, shall
mean a security agreement,
UCC-1 financing statements, a collateral assignment of the promissory note
representing such Excluded
Loan, and a collateral assignment of the related mortgage or deed of trust;
(B) Excluded Real Estate, shall
mean a mortgage (or deed of trust), an assignment of rents and security
agreement, and UCC-1 financing
statements; (C) an Excluded JV Interest, shall mean a security agreement, a
collateral assignment of the
JV Interest of the Seller, and UCC-1 financing statements; (D) Cash or U.S.
government obligations,
shall mean a security agreement; and (E) subject to one or more prior third
party liens or Security
Interests, shall mean Intercreditor Agreements which shall provide for the
subordination of all such prior
liens or Security Interests to the Indemnification Security Interests and/or
the Litigation Security Interest
being granted by the Seller to SCBC, as Collateral Agent.

(f) any Collateral which is Cash, a U.S. government
obligation, a note (including a note
evidencing an Excluded Loan) or other asset the possession of which must be
delivered to the creditor
or an agent in order to perfect Indemnification Security Interests or
Litigation Indemnification Security
Interests therein shall be held by SCBC as Collateral Agent or, at the
Seller's election and at the Seller's
expense, by another collateral escrow agent, who shall act as the agent and
for the benefit of SCBC, the
Association, the Successor and the Retained Association Subsidiaries and who
shall be acceptable to
SCBC, pursuant to an escrow agent agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to SCBC.

Section 8.5. Arbitration

Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall
be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American
Arbitration Association at a site located in the State of North Carolina,
and, absent fraud, collusion or
willful misconduct by the arbitrator(s) shown by clear and convincing
evidence (rather than by a
preponderance of the evidence), judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator(s) may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) may award
injunctive relief or any other
remedy available from a judge, including liquidated damages as set forth in
Section 7.2(b), the Penalty
as provided in Section 2.4(d), and reimbursement of expenses as provided in
Section 8.1, and shall award
costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party, but
shall not have the power to
award punitive or exemplary damages other than the Penalty. The fees and
expenses of the arbitrator(s)
shall be paid by the non-prevailing party (in the event one party prevails
on all matters arbitrated) or by
the parties in proportion to the monetary damages awarded to the other party
as compared to the sum of
all monetary damages awarded (in the event neither party prevails on all
matters arbitrated). For
example, a party awarded 60% of the sum of damages awarded to the parties
would pay 40% of the fees
and expenses of the arbitrator(s). The parties confirm that by agreeing to
this alternate dispute resolution
process, they intend to give up their right to have any dispute decided in a
civil court by a judge or jury.

Section 8.6. Entire Agreement

This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior arrangements or
understandings with respect thereto,
written or oral, including the Letter of Intent, dated December 15, 1993, as
amended, other than
documents referred to herein that are to be executed at or in connection
with the Closing. The terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto, and their
respective successors and permissible assignees. Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties hereto, and their
successors, any rights,
remedies, obligations or Liabilities.

Section 8.7. Assignment

Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement to
any other Person; provided, however, that SCBC may assign its rights and
obligations to any SCBC
Subsidiary designated by it (herein, the "Designated Subsidiary") upon
notice to the Seller, accompanied
by a written assumption agreement executed by the Designated Subsidiary;
provided, further, that
notwithstanding such assignment to a Designated Subsidiary, SCBC shall
remain, and jointly and severally
with the Designated Subsidiary be, obligated with regard to all such
obligations assigned. In the event
that SCBC shall make such an assignment, each reference to SCBC herein shall
be deemed to be a
reference to both SCBC and the Designated Subsidiary, unless the context of
such reference clearly
requires otherwise. Notwithstanding any such assignment, SCBC shall be
entitled to enforce, in its own
name and on behalf of the Designated Subsidiary, its and the Designated
Subsidiary's rights hereunder.

writing and signed by duly authorized executive officers of SCBC and the
Seller.

Section 8.11. Severability

negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises,

liquidated damages under
Section 7.2(b) hereof and seek to enforce specific performance of this
Agreement.

Section 8.15. Counterparts

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
and each such counterpart shall
be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of
North Carolina applicable to agreements made and entirely to be performed
within such jurisdiction
except to the extent federal law may be applicable.

assumes the obligation to defend as described in Section 2(a) and
Section 2(b) (collectively, the "Assumed
Litigation") at its own expense, including, but not limited to, the
payment of all legal, investigatory,
expert and similar fees and expenses, witness fees, transcript costs,
court costs, appeal bonds, appeal
bond premiums and printing costs.

Retained Association Subsidiaries
with respect to the relevant Assumed Litigation matter for all
purposes other than the payment of the
foregoing legal and other fees, expenses and costs.

Notwithstanding the attorney-client relationship that shall be
deemed to exist between FCI's

retained the law firm of Bell, Davis
& Pitt, P.A. of Winston-Salem, North Carolina as FCI's Counsel to
defend the Class Action Litigation
and that SCBC is reasonably satisfied with FCI's Counsel in this
matter. SCBC further acknowledges
that FCI has retained the law firm of Perry, Patrick, Farmer & Michaux
of Charlotte, North Carolina
as FCI's Counsel to defend the Homeowners' Litigation and the
Bankruptcy Litigation and that SCBC
is reasonably satisfied with FCI's Counsel in these matters.

Retained Association Subsidiaries
(i) shall provide to FCI and FCI's Counsel at mutually agreeable times

FCI's Counsel in locating and maintaining those of the Records that
would be necessary or useful in
preparing to defend and/or in defending the Assumed Litigation, (iii)
shall provide work space on the
premises of the Association or the Successor when necessary to
interview the aforesaid employees or to
review the Records, and (iv) shall designate officers of SCBC, the
Association, the Successor and the
Retained Association Subsidiaries to execute on behalf thereof such
pleadings, discovery responses and
similar documents ("Litigation Papers") as are necessary in the
conduct of the defense of the Assumed
Litigation, in each case, however, after review and approval (which
approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of such Litigation Papers by SCBC's Counsel.

(b) To the extent employees of SCBC, the Association, the
Successor or any Retained
Association Subsidiary incur out-of-pocket expenses in connection with
the matters set forth in Section
4(a) that are reimbursed by his or her employer, SCBC shall provide
written evidence of such
reimbursement to FCI and FCI shall pay the amount thereof to the
applicable employer within ten (10)
days of FCI's receipt of such written evidence.

fees and expenses of SCBC's
Counsel shall be borne by SCBC, the Association, the Successor and/or
one or more of the Retained
Association Subsidiaries as determined by SCBC.

(b) SCBC's Counsel and FCI's Counsel shall enter into a joint
defense agreement in each
Assumed Litigation matter (i) recognizing their joint representation
of SCBC, the Association, the
Successor and/or the Retained Association Subsidiaries, as applicable,
in the Assumed Litigation matter,
(ii) providing that FCI's Counsel shall have primary responsibility
for the conduct of all such Assumed
Litigation matter, (iii) providing that FCI's Counsel shall advise
SCBC's Counsel of all material factual
and legal aspects of such Assumed Litigation matter and all
discussions between FCI (and its officers,
agents and Affiliates) and FCI's Counsel, and all discussions between
FCI's Counsel and investigators,
expert witnesses and consultants employed by FCI or FCI's Counsel,
concerning any material aspect of
the conduct of such Assumed Litigation matter, and (iv) containing
such other provisions concerning
privileged communications and work product as are addressed
customarily in such agreements.

(c) FCI and FCI's Counsel in an Assumed Litigation matter will
keep SCBC's Counsel fully
advised in a timely manner of all settlement proposals, discussions

Section 8.2(a) of the Purchase
Agreement.

(b) Any monetary damages awarded to, and received by, SCBC, the

SECURITY CAPITAL BANCORP ANNOUNCES
AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE
FIRST FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION OF CHARLOTTE

Salisbury, North Carolina (April 6, 1994) - Security Capital Bancorp 
(NASDAQ/NMS-SCBC), today announced that it and Fairfield Communities, Inc., 
an Arkansas developer of resort communities, vacation ownership interests, 
lots, homes and condominiums ("FCI"), have executed a Stock Purchase Agreement
concerning Security Capital's acquisition of First Federal Savings and Loan 
Association of Charlotte, North Carolina, a subsidiary of FCI ("First Federal").
First Federal operates seven banking offices in Charlotte, a total of three
banking offices in Rockingham, Troy and Biscoe, North Carolina, and a loan
production office in Greensboro, North Carolina. At March 1, 1994, First 
Federal's total assets were approximately $327 million. The proposed 
transactions are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the 
approval of applicable regulatory authorities.

Under the terms of the Agreement, Security Capital will acquire all of 
the capital stock of First Federal for a cash payment of approximately $40 
million plus an interim earnings adjustment, with an offsetting payment by 
FCI from the conveyance by First Federal to FCI of certain real estate owned,
classified loans and other assets, which, at March 28, 1994, aggregated 
approximately $19.8 million, net of certain reserves. FCI will also purchase
First Federal's lot and timeshare contract receivables, including the
underlying real estate assets (in the case of cancellations or foreclosures
under such contracts), which, at December 31, 1993, totalled approximately
$53.5 million. Approximately $1.4 million of Security Capital's cash payment
will be deferred pending the resolution of certain litigation involving 
FCI and First Federal. The purchase price will be increased by the adjusted
earnings of First Federal from October 1, 1993 through August 1, 1994 or 
the date of closing, whichever is earlier, subject to a cap of $1.825 million.
Assuming all conditions are satisfied, the parties currently expect the 
acquisition to occur by August 1, 1994. If the acquisition is not closed
by August 1, 1994, the purchase price may be further increased to account
for First Federal's adjusted earnings after that date.

In announcing the Agreement, David B. Jordan, Vice-Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Security Capital, commented: "We are very pleased with 
this acquisition. Security Capital is one of the best capitalized and 
strongest companies in the Southeast, and the acquisition of First Federal 
offers us another opportunity to effectively utilize our capital. The 
acquisition also allows us to expand our operations and customer base in 
the Charlotte area as well as establish a presence in Rockingham, Troy and 
Biscoe."

Security Capital, a bank holding company, operates 40 offices in 28 
communities located in 11 counties in the south central and western 
Piedmont regions of North Carolina through its four banking subsidiaires:
Security Bank and Trust Company and OMNIBANK, SSB/Salisbury, North 
Carolina; Citizens Savings, SSB/Concord, North Carolina; and Home Savings
Bank, SSB/Kings Mountain, North Carolina. At March 1, 1994, Security
Capital's total assets were approximately $929 million.
