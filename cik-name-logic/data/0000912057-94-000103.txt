ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

On December 31, 1993, Merrill Acquisition Corp., a Minnesota
corporation (the "Purchaser") and wholly owned subsidiary of
Merrill Corporation (the "Registrant") acquired substantially all
of the assets of May Printing Company, a Minnesota corporation
(the "Company") (the "Purchase") pursuant to an Asset Purchase
Agreement dated as of December 31, 1993 by and among the
Purchaser, the Registrant, the Company and the Shareholders of
the Company (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"). In the acquisition,
the Purchaser acquired substantially all of the business, assets,
properties, goodwill and rights of the Company (the "Purchased
Assets"), including real and personal property owned or leased by
Company; the Company's corporate name; the goodwill of Company's
business; leaseholds and other interests in land, inventory
(materials, work in process, finished goods), equipment,
machinery, furniture, fixtures, motor vehicles and supplies;
cash; accounts receivables; contracts, purchase orders,
customers, lists of customers and suppliers, sales representative
agreements, and all favorable business relationships, causes of
action; employment contracts; and substantially all other assets
reflected on the balance sheet of the Company.

The purchase price for the Purchased Assets was approximately
$24.9 million consisting of $15.4 million cash, $7.0 million in
assumed current and long-term liabilities and Purchaser's
non-negotiable promissory note in the principal amount of $2.5
million. The purchase price for the Purchased Assets is subject to
adjustment based on a closing balance sheet as of December 31, 1993,
to be prepared within 90 days of the closing (with any adjustments to
be paid with interest at the prime rate). In addition to the amounts
payable at closing, the Purchaser has agreed to pay the Company an
additional sum, not to exceed $2.0 million (an "earn-out") based on
the level of pre-tax earnings generated by the Purchased Assets during
the 12-month period ending January 31, 1995. The above-described
consideration was arrived at through arm's-length negotiations with
the Company, but was primarily based on the value and future earnings
potential of the assets purchased.

There were no prior material relationships between Purchaser,
Registrant, or any of Registrant's affiliates, any director or
officer of Registrant, or any associate of any such director or
officer, on the one hand, and the Company or its Shareholders, on

2

<PAGE>

the other hand. Approximately $1.7 million of the funds for the
acquisition were provided through the Registrant's revolving
credit agreement with First Bank National Association and the
balance of the purchase price was paid using funds available in
the Registrant's operating account. The Registrant anticipates
that the payments under the assumed liabilities, promissory note
and earn-out will be paid out of Registrant's operations and the
revolving credit agreement.

The Purchased Assets purchased were previously used by the
Company to provide demand printing and distribution services
relating to corporate identity and direct marketing programs for
nationwide companies. The Registrant intends to continue such
use.

Additional information concerning the Purchase is also
contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement, which document is an
exhibit hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

A. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED.

The registrant has determined that it is impracticable to provide
the required financial statements of May Printing Company at this
time. The registrant will file the required financial statements under
an amendment on Form 8-K/A as soon as practicable but in any event
within 60 days after the date hereof.

B. PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

The registrant has determined that it is impracticable to
provide the required pro forma financial information regarding
the acquisition of May Printing Company at this time. The
registrant will file the required pro forma financial information
under an amendment on Form 8-K/A as soon as practicable, but in any
event within 60 days after the date hereof.

or May Development Company, which shall be included) or any
Retained Liabilities (other than accrued profit sharing, accrued
401(k) incentive and withholding liability for hospital and group
insurance, which shall be included). All inventory and supplies
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet shall be so reflected on
the basis of a complete physical count taken beginning December
31, 1993 and shall be valued at the lower of cost or market in
accordance with Company's prior practices as reflected in the
Latest Audited Balance Sheet. Representatives of both Company and
Merrill shall have the right to participate in the taking of such
physical inventory and the valuation thereof. Coopers & Lybrand
("AUDITOR") will apply certain agreed upon procedures to
specific accounts and/or items on the Closing Balance Sheet.
Company, Purchaser and the Shareholders shall provide each other
with full cooperation in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet (provided that normal operations of business
of Purchaser and Merrill are not interfered with), and each shall
have the right to review Auditor's work papers in connection with
the agreed upon procedures performed on the Closing Balance Sheet.

(C) The Closing Balance Sheet shall not include (1)
deferred compensation in excess of $289,560, or (2) up to $75,000
of attorneys' fees incurred by Company related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with corporate
"clean up" matters necessary in connection therewith.

(D) Within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Balance
Sheet, Company shall notify Purchaser if it disagrees with any of
the amounts included in the Closing Balance Sheet. If such notice
is not given, the Closing Balance Sheet will be final and
conclusive for all purposes. If the parties are unable to resolve
the differences within 60 days of the receipt of the Closing
Balance Sheet, Company and Purchaser agree to retain the
accounting firm of Ernst & Young to arbitrate the dispute and
render a decision within 30 days of such retention, which decision
shall be final and binding for all purposes. Any award pursuant
to this Section 1(c)(iii) may be entered in and enforced by any
court having

6
<PAGE>

jurisdiction over the matter and the parties hereby consent and
commit themselves to the jurisdiction of the courts of Minnesota
for the purposes of the enforcement of any such award. Purchaser
and the Shareholders will each pay one-half of the costs of
services rendered by said accounting firm.

(E) Within five days after the expiration of the 30-day
period for giving notice of disagreement with the accountants'
finding, if no such notice is given, or within five days after the
resolution of disputes, if any, pursuant to subsection (iii)(cc)
above, the Final Basic Purchase Price shall be determined (using
the formula set forth in Section 1(c)(i)) based on the amounts
shown in the Closing Balance Sheet. Purchaser or Company, as
appropriate, will by wire transfer in immediately available funds
make payment to the other of any appropriate amounts, such that
after such payment, and taking into account amounts previously
received by Company pursuant to Section 1(c)(ii) hereof, Purchaser
shall have paid Company the Final Basic Purchase Price. Either
party making a payment pursuant to this paragraph, whether
Purchaser or Company, shall, in addition to such payment, pay the
other party interest on the amount of such payment, for the time
period between the Closing Date and the date of such payment, at
an annual rate equal to the Reference Rate as publicly announced
from time to time by First Bank National Association.

(iv) The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Assets in
the manner required by Section 1060 of the Code. In making such
allocation, the allocations set forth in Exhibit 1(c)(3) attached hereto
shall apply, which exhibit shall be completed based on the amounts shown
on the Closing Balance Sheet. In preparing Exhibit 1(c)(3), Purchaser
and the Shareholders shall negotiate in good faith the values of the
Assets and the resulting allocation of the Purchase Price among the
various Assets; it being understood that such determination shall be
binding on Purchaser and the Shareholders only for the purposes of U.S.
Federal, state and local taxation. The Shareholders and Purchaser shall
file all Tax Returns and tax reports (including IRS Form 8594) in
accordance with and based upon such allocation and shall take no
position in any Tax Return, tax proceeding or tax audit which is
inconsistent with such allocation.

(d) CONTINGENT PURCHASE PRICE. If the Assets earn Pre-Tax Earnings
of at least $3,750,000 for the 12 months beginning February 1, 1994 and ending
January 31, 1995, the Purchaser will pay an additional amount (the
"CONTINGENT PURCHASE PRICE") equal to a percentage of Purchaser's Pre-Tax
Earnings generated from the

7

Assets according to the following schedule (but in no event will the
Contingent Purchase Price exceed $2,000,000):

goods in an arms'-length transaction;

Purchaser and Merrill, exclusive of such accounts representing
advances of operating funds as provided in (F) above, at the end
of each month shall be settled on the 20th day of the following
month;

(P) No deduction shall be made for any expense incurred in
connection with the employment of any personnel in excess of the
number of employees on the Closing Date multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the amount of revenues from the business
during the period of February 1, 1994 through and including
January 31, 1995 and the denominator of which is the total
revenues of the Company for the year ending December 31, 1993; and

amount of the Contingent Purchase Price, if any, to be paid to Company
pursuant to this Section 1(d) (the "CONTINGENT PURCHASE PRICE
STATEMENT").

(iii) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contingent
Purchase Price Statement, Company shall notify Purchaser if it disagrees
with the calculation of the Contingent Purchase Price. If such notice
is not given (or at such time as Company provides written notice to
Purchaser that it has no objection to such calculation), the Contingent
Purchase Price Statement provided by Purchaser will be final and
conclusive for all purposes and Purchaser shall thereafter have no
further liability to Company pursuant to this Section 1(d). If the
parties are unable to resolve their differences within 60 days of the
receipt of the Contingent Purchase Price Statement, Company and
Purchaser agree to retain the accounting firm of Ernst & Young to
arbitrate the dispute and render a decision within 30 days of such
retention, which decision shall be final and binding for all purposes.
Any award pursuant to this Section 1(d)(iii) may be entered in and
enforced by any court having jurisdiction over the matter and the
parties hereby consent and commit themselves to the jurisdiction of the
courts of Minnesota for the purposes of the enforcement of any such
award. Purchaser and the Shareholders will each pay one-half of the
costs of services rendered by said accounting firms.

1993 (the "CLOSING DATE"); provided, however, that if any of the conditions
provided for in Sections 5 and 6 hereof shall not have been satisfied or
waived by such date, then the party to this Agreement which is unable to
satisfy such condition or conditions, despite the best efforts of such party,

11
<PAGE>

shall be entitled to postpone the Closing by notice to the other parties until
such condition or conditions shall have been satisfied (which such notifying
party will seek to cause to happen at the earliest practicable date) or
waived, but in no event shall the Closing occur later than the "TERMINATION
DATE" which shall be on January 31, 1994, unless the parties hereto shall
agree in writing to extend the date of such Closing. The parties shall use

responsible for and shall pay all Taxes attributable to or arising from
the business and operations of Company conducted on or before the
Closing Date and shall be responsible for their own income and franchise
Taxes, if any, arising from the transactions contemplated by this

and accrued by Company with a reserve established therefor on the
Closing Balance Sheet.

(ii) FILING OF TAX RETURNS. There have been properly completed
and duly filed on a timely basis and in correct form all Tax Returns
required to be filed on or prior to the date hereof by Company or the
Shareholders with respect to Taxes of Company. As of the time of

regarding the income, business, assets, operations, activities, status

misstatement or misrepresentation, whether innocent, intentional or
fraudulent, in any Tax Return filed by Company for any period. Any Tax
Returns filed after the date hereof, but on or before the Closing Date,
will conform with the provisions of this subsection 2(p)(ii).

(iii) PAYMENT OF TAXES. With respect to all amounts in
respect of Taxes imposed upon Company or the Shareholders, or for which
Company or the Shareholders are or could be liable, whether to taxing

taxable periods or portions of periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, all applicable Tax Laws and agreements have been or will be fully
complied with, and all such amounts of Taxes required to be paid by
Company or the Shareholders to taxing Authorities or others on or before

Company has withheld and remitted all amounts required to be withheld
and remitted by it in respect of Taxes.

(iv) AUDITS AND EXTENSIONS. The federal income Tax Returns of

25
<PAGE>

operations of the Company are reflected in the Shareholders' Tax
Returns) have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service for all
periods to and including those expressly set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, and, except to the extent shown therein, all deficiencies
asserted as a result of such examinations have been paid or finally
settled and no issue has been raised by the Internal Revenue Service in
any such examination which, by application of similar principles,
reasonably could be expected to result in a proposed deficiency for any
other period not so examined. Except as set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, all deficiencies and assessments of Taxes of Company (or any
of the Shareholders to the extent attributable to the business or
operations of Company) resulting from an examination of any Tax Returns
by any Authority have been paid and there are no pending examinations
currently being made by any Authority nor has there been any written or
oral notification to Company or any Shareholder of any intention to make

election under Code Section 1362 to be treated as an "S corporation" for
each of its taxable years ended after the date set forth in the

that would permit the Internal Revenue Service to revoke that election
for any period prior to the Closing Date. Except as described on the
Disclosure Schedule, since the effective date of its election as an S
corporation to and including the Closing Date, Company will not have
incurred or become liable for the payment of any corporate-level income
tax, or any related penalties or interest.

amended ("ERISA") (an "AFFILIATED ORGANIZATION") sponsors,
maintains, contributes to, is required to contribute to or has or could
have any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown, fixed or
contingent, with respect to, any "employee pension benefit plan"
("PENSION PLAN") as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA,
including without limitation, any such plan that is excluded from
coverage by Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA or is a "Multiemployer Plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. Each such Pension
Plan has been operated in accordance with its terms and in compliance
with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other
applicable Law, other than where the failure to so operate or comply
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. All Pension Plans
which the Company operates as plans that are qualified under the
provisions of Section 401(a) of the Code satisfy in form and operation
the requirements of Section 401(a) and all other sections of the Code
incorporated therein, including without limitation Sections 401(k) and

meaning of Section 4043(b) of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any
Pension Plan. Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization has
been a party to a sale of assets to which Section 4204 of ERISA applied

any contingent or secondary withdrawal liability) to any Multiemployer
Plan. Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization has incurred
any withdrawal liability within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA or
suffered or otherwise caused a "complete withdrawal" or "partial
withdrawal," as such terms are defined respectively in Sections 4203 and
4205 of ERISA, with respect to a Multiemployer Plan, and nothing has
occurred that is reasonably likely to result in such a complete or
partial withdrawal.

or could have any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown,
fixed or contingent, with respect to, any "employee welfare benefit

ERISA, whether insured or otherwise. Each Welfare Plan has been
operated in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Law,
other than where the failure to so operate or

27
<PAGE>

comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Neither the
Company nor any Affiliated Organization has established or contributed
to, is required to contribute to or has or could have any liability of
any nature, whether known or unknown, fixed or contingent, with respect
to any "voluntary employees' beneficiary association" within the meaning

Company nor any Affiliated Organization maintains, contributes to or has
or could have any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown, or

welfare benefits for present or future terminated employees or their
spouses or dependents other than as required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA or any comparable state law.

(iv) Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization is a
party to, maintains, contributes to, is required to contribute to or has
or could have any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown,
fixed or contingent, with respect to, any bonus plan, incentive plan,
stock plan or any other current or deferred compensation, separation,
retention, severance or similar agreement, arrangement or policy, or any
individual employment agreement ("COMPENSATION PLANS"). Each
Compensation Plan has been operated in accordance with its terms and in
compliance with the applicable provisions of all applicable Law, other
than where the failure to so operate or comply would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(v) There are no facts or circumstances which could, directly or
indirectly, subject the Company or any Affiliated Organization to any
(1) excise tax or other liability under Chapters 43, 46 or 47 of
Subtitle D of the Code, (2) penalty tax or other liability under Chapter
68 of Subtitle F of the Code or (3) civil penalty arising under Section
502 of ERISA in excess of $10,000.

or any Affiliated Organization is required, under applicable Law, the
terms of any Pension Plan, Welfare Plan or Compensation Plan, or any
agreement relating to any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan or Compensation
Plan, to have paid as a contribution, premium or other remittance
thereto or benefit thereunder. No Pension Plan is subject to Part 3 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. The Company
and each Affiliated Organization has made adequate provisions for
reserves or accruals in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles to meet contribution benefit or funding

28
<PAGE>

obligations arising under applicable Law or the terms of any Pension
Plan or Welfare Plan or Compensation Plan or related agreement. There
will be no change on or before Closing in the operation of any Pension
Plan, Welfare Plan or Compensation Plan or any documents with respect
thereto which will result in an increase in the benefit liabilities
under such plans, except as may be required by law.

(vii) The Company and each Affiliated Organization has
timely complied with all reporting and disclosure obligations with
respect to the Pension Plans, Welfare Plans and Compensation Plans
imposed by Title I of ERISA or other applicable Law, other than where

Company.

threatened audits, investigations, claims, suits, grievances or other
proceedings, and there are no facts that could give rise thereto,
involving, directly or indirectly, any Pension Plan, Welfare Plan, or
Compensation Plan, or any rights or benefits thereunder, other than the
ordinary and usual claims for benefits by participants, dependents or
beneficiaries.

such Pension Plan: (i) nothing done or

29

omitted to be done has or could subject the Company or any Affiliated

expenditure of any nature or result in the imposition of any Lien in
favor of the PBGC or any other person; (ii) the Company has received a
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, based on

under Section 501(a) of the Code; (iii) all notices and other filings
required to be submitted to the PBGC were submitted in a timely manner

unrestricted manner from a person entitled to disclose such information. Each
party hereto also agrees to promptly return to the party from whom it
originally received such information all original and duplicate copies of

control thereof and to assist Purchaser in exercising all rights with
respect thereto.

Company and Shareholders will supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule with
respect to any event or development which, if existing or occurring at or
prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in the Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any
information in the Disclosure Schedule or in any representation and warranty
of Company or the Shareholders which has been rendered inaccurate by reason of
such event or development. For purposes of determining the accuracy as of the
date hereof of the representations and warranties of Company and Shareholders
contained in Section 2 hereof in order to determine the fulfillment of the
conditions set forth in subsection 5(a), the Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to exclude any information contained in any supplement or amendment
hereto delivered after the delivery of the Disclosure Schedule.

(i) PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. None of the parties hereto shall make any
public announcement with respect to the transactions contemplated herein
without the prior written consent of the other parties, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any of
the parties hereto may at any time make any announcements which are required

promptly upon learning of such requirement notifies the other parties of such

withhold any portion of the Purchase Price.

(iii) TRANSACTIONAL AND TRANSFER TAXES. In the event that

Purchaser shall provide proof reasonably satisfactory to Company (upon
Company's written request) that such Taxes or recording fees have been

(b) each retain and provide the other, and Company and

46
<PAGE>

Purchaser shall retain and provide the Shareholders, with any records or
other information which may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit or
examination, proceeding or determination, and (c) each provide the other
with any final determination of such audit or examination, proceeding or
determination that affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax
Return of the other for any period. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Company, Purchaser and the Shareholders shall, until the
applicable statutes of limitations (including all extensions) have
expired, (x) retain copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules
and other records or information which may be relevant to such Tax
Returns for all Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date, shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any such records
without first providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and copy the same, and (y) cause such Tax Returns, supporting
work schedules and other records or other information to be subject to
the confidentiality provisions of Section 4(e) hereof.

(vi) DIVIDENDS BY COMPANY TO SHAREHOLDERS. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 4(a)(xi) hereof, Company may declare
and pay a cash dividend to the Shareholders in an amount equal to their
liability for unpaid federal and state income taxes for the portion of
the 1993 taxable year up to and including the Closing Date for which the
Shareholders are liable (assuming the use of all deductions and credits
available to the Shareholders) by virtue of Company's status as an S
corporation under Section 1362 of the Code and for which the
Shareholders and Company are responsible pursuant to Section 2(p)(i)
hereof (the "PRIOR PERIOD S TAXES"); provided, however, that (A) the
amount of such dividend shall (1) be pro rated as to each of the
Shareholders, (2) be reduced by any prior dividends or distributions
paid by Company to the Shareholders in respect of such Prior Period S
Taxes, and (3) be reflected as a reduction in the Net Worth of Company
on the Closing Balance Sheet, (B) at least ten days prior to declaring
or paying such dividend the Shareholders shall have provided Merrill
with a certificate from the Shareholders and their accountants
certifying the accuracy and method of determining the amount of such tax
liability (which in no event shall be based on a combined federal and
state tax rate in excess of 45%) and Merrill shall be satisfied that
such certified amount is reasonably accurate, and (C) in no event shall
Company prior to Closing be entitled to declare and pay a dividend of
any amount attributable to Taxes, if any, that arise as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(k) BULK TRANSFERS. Company has requested that Purchaser waive, and
Purchaser hereby agrees to waive, the requirements of the Uniform Commercial
Code concerning bulk transfers, as in effect

47
<PAGE>

in the various states in which Company has assets, including without
limitation the requirement of notice to creditors. Company and the
Shareholders shall jointly indemnify Merrill and Purchaser in connection
herewith pursuant to Section 8(c)(i) hereof.

(l) STOCK OPTIONS.

(i) At Closing, Merrill will grant seven-year options to purchase
an aggregate of 28,000 shares of the Common Stock of Merrill (at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of such shares as of the
business day prior to the date of grant) to the Key Executives. Such
options will be fully exercisable for their term and shall be evidenced
by an option agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit 4(l).
Merrill will use its best efforts to register under the Securities Act
of 1933 on a registration statement on Form S-8 the shares to be issued
under such options.

(ii) On January 31, 1994, Merrill will grant to the Shareholders
seven-year options to purchase a number of shares of the Common Stock of
Merrill equal to the amount of Company's pre-tax earnings for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 1993 (determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles applied consistently with the principles,
practices and procedures used in the preparation of Company's audited
financial statements at and for the nine months ended September 30,
1993) which exceeds $2,638,000 divided by $8.00 (rounded to the next
lowest share), such number of shares not to exceed 85,000. In
determining Company's pre-tax earnings for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 1993 for the purposes of this paragraph, (A) profit-sharing
expense shall be calculated using a methodology consistent with that
used in Company's 1992 financial statements, (B) the accrual for
vacation pay shall be equal to the difference between such amount as of
the Closing Date and $105,380, (C) no charge for deferred compensation
for 1993 shall be made, (D) no interest income on notes receivable (or
charge for interest on notes payable) between Company and the
Shareholders or May Development Company shall be included, and (E) no
charge shall be made for up to $75,000 of attorneys' fees incurred by
Company related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in
connection with corporate "clean up" matters necessary in connection
therewith. The exercise price for such options will be equal to the
fair market value of the Common Stock of Merrill on the Closing Date.
Any options granted to the Shareholders (or any options that, as of the
Closing, do not qualify for registration on Form S-8) shall contain a
one-time "demand" registration right (at the expense of Merrill and only
during the term of the option) relating to the resale of the shares
underlying such options. Such options shall be evidenced by an option
agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit 4(l).

48
<PAGE>

(iii) Within 30 days after the Closing, Merrill will grant
seven-year options to purchase an aggregate of 42,000 shares of the
Common Stock of Merrill (at an exercise price equal to the fair market
value of such shares as of the business day prior to the date of grant)
to individuals who are employees of Company as of such date, in amounts
and to such employees as Merrill shall determine in its sole discretion.
Such options shall be granted pursuant to Merrill's 1993 Stock Incentive
Plan.

(m) NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENTS. At the Closing, Company, each of
the Shareholders and each of the Key Executives will enter into a
non-competition agreement with Merrill and Purchaser in substantially the form
of Exhibit 4(m) (the "NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which
Company, each Shareholder and each Key Executive will agree that it and its
Affiliates and Associates will not compete with Merrill, Purchaser or Company
for five years (three years in the case of the Key Executives) after the
Closing. Merrill or Purchaser shall pay each Shareholder $237,000 at Closing
under their respective Non-Competition Agreements.

(n) EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS. At the Closing, Merrill or Purchaser
and the Key Executives and such other employees as the Merrill or Purchaser
deems to be key-employees of Company will enter into employment agreements in
substantially the form of Exhibit 4(n) (the "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS").

(o) NON-COMPETITION OF MERRILL AND PURCHASER. From the date hereof
through October 4, 1995, neither Merrill nor Purchaser will provide telephone
or catalog order fulfillment services and related printing services as a
single source to the franchisees of (or to parties with a similar relationship
to) any of the entities listed in Exhibit B to the letter of intent, dated
October 4, 1993, among Merrill, Company and the Shareholders (the "LETTER OF
INTENT"). The foregoing provision shall terminate upon the Closing or if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7(a)(iv) hereof and the
Closing shall not have occurred.

(p) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

(i) OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT. On the Closing Date, Company shall
make available for employment and Purchaser shall offer to employ all
employees of Company who, on the Closing Date, are (A) at work or (B)
absent from work solely because of (1) holiday, (2) vacation, (3)
illness or disability which has prevented, or is expected to prevent,
the employee from working at his or her assigned job for no longer than
30 days in total duration (including time before and after the Closing
Date) or (4) leave of absence which has lasted or is expected to last no
longer than 60 days in total duration (including time before and after
the Closing Date) or which is for military duty; provided, that
Purchaser is not required to

49
<PAGE>

offer to employ any employee of Company with respect to whom Company has
given, prior to the Closing Date, notice of termination of employment.
Any employee of Company who accepts an offer of employment pursuant to
this subsection (i) and reports for work with the Purchaser on the first
date requested by the Purchaser is referred to in this Section 4(p) as a
"TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEE."

(ii) TERMS OF OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT. Purchaser will, in its
discretion, determine the terms of all offers of employment made
pursuant to subsection (i), subject to the following:

(A) Purchaser will adopt the Merrill Corporation 401(k)
Incentive Savings Plan (the "Merrill 401(k) Plan") effective as of
February 1, 1994 and Merrill will consent to such adoption.

(1) Each Transferred Employee who was eligible to
participate in Company's Profit Sharing and Incentive
Savings Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be
eligible to participate in the Merrill 401(k) Plan on the
first regular entry date following the Closing Date if he or
she remains employed as an employee who is eligible to
participate in the Merrill 401(k) Plan on such entry date.

(2) Each Transferred Employee who was not eligible
to participate in Company's Profit Sharing and Incentive
Savings Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date due
solely to minimum age or service requirements thereunder
will become eligible to participate in the Merrill 401(k)
Plan on the first regular entry date that falls on or first
follows his or her satisfaction of the minimum service
requirement of the Merrill 401(k) Plan if he or she remains
employed as an employee who is eligible to participate in
the Merrill 401(k) Plan on such entry date.

(3) Each Transferred Employee who becomes eligible
to participate in the Merrill 401(k) Plan will be permitted
to roll over any eligible rollover distributions from
Company's Profit Sharing and Incentive Savings Plan by way
of direct transfer pursuant to Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code if he or she remains employed as an employee who is
eligible to participate in the Merrill 401(k) Plan at the
time of the transfer.

50
<PAGE>

(B) Purchaser will adopt the Merrill Corporation
Retirement Plan effective as of February 1, 1994 and Merrill will
consent to such adoption. Each Transferred Employee will become
eligible to participate in the Merrill Corporation Retirement Plan
on the first regular entry date that falls on or first follows his
or her satisfaction of the Plan's minimum service requirement if
he or she remains employed as an employee who is eligible to
participate in such Plan on such entry date.

(C) Purchaser will provide each Transferred Employee with
an opportunity to elect to be covered under medical and dental
plans which provide benefits substantially similar to those
offered by Company's medical and dental benefit plans as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date in which such Transferred
Employee will be immediately eligible to participate subject to
any exclusions or limitations that were applicable to the
Transferred Employee (or any member of his or her family) under
Company's medical and dental benefit plans immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

(D) Effective as of the first business day after the
Closing Date, Purchaser will establish the following benefit plans
for Transferred Employees with terms, conditions, exclusions and
limitations substantially similar to those in effect under the
corresponding benefit plans of the Company immediately prior to
the Closing Date: cancer insurance; cafeteria plan (with premium
conversion and dependent care assistance features); group-term
life insurance; short-term disability; and employee assistance.

(E) Purchaser will recognize and assume liability for
accrued vacation of each Transferred Employee as of the Closing
Date to the extent (and only to the extent) such liability is both
properly accrued in accordance with the vacation policies and
practices of Company disclosed to Merrill and reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet.

(F) Purchaser and Merrill will credit Transferred
Employees with all years of service with Company and its
Affiliates as a common law employee thereof for all purposes other
than benefit accrual in connection with any benefit plan
maintained by Purchaser or Merrill which is generally available to
its employees and in which the Transferred Employees are otherwise
eligible to participate.

(iii) COBRA. Purchaser will provide for continued coverage
under the medical and dental plans referenced in

51
<PAGE>

subsection (ii)(C) or any other medical and dental plans maintained by
Merrill to each "qualified beneficiary" who is or becomes entitled to
"continuation coverage" under Company's medical or dental benefit plan
by reason of the occurrence of a "qualifying event" occurring before, on
or after the Closing Date for the maximum period required by Section
4980B(f)(2)(B) of the Code. For purposes of the foregoing sentence,
"group health plan," "qualified beneficiary," "continuation coverage"
and "qualifying event" have the meanings ascribed to them in Section
4980B of the Code.

(iv) RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. Except as otherwise provided in
any Employment Agreement or other Assumed Contract, it is the intention
of the parties that the employment relationship between Purchaser and
any Transferred Employee is at will and, consequently, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall prevent Purchaser or Merrill or any of their
Affiliates at any time after the Closing Date from terminating,
reassigning, promoting or demoting any such Transferred Employee or
changing adversely or favorably his or her titles, powers, duties,
responsibilities, functions, location, compensation or terms and
conditions of employment. Except as otherwise provided in any
Employment Agreement or other Assumed Contract, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall restrict in any way the right of Purchaser or
Merrill or any of their Affiliates to establish, amend or terminate any
employee benefit plan, policy or practice.

(v) NO ASSUMPTION. Except as provided in subsection (ii)(D)
with respect to accrued vacation, Purchaser has not agreed to assume any
obligation or liability under or arising, directly or indirectly, in
connection with any Pension Plan, Welfare Plan or Compensation Plan of
Company or any Affiliated Organization of Company which is not an
Assumed Contract and Company shall remain solely responsible for and
Company and the Shareholders shall indemnify and hold harmless Merrill
and Purchaser from and against any liability of any nature whatsoever
arising in connection with such Plans which are not Assumed Contracts.
To the extent liabilities assumed by Purchaser pursuant to Section 1(a)
of the Liability Undertaking relate to participation by Transferred
Employees on or before the Closing Date in any Pension, Welfare or
Compensation Plan of the Company or of any Affiliated Organization of
the Company, the Purchaser's satisfaction of such liabilities after the
Closing Date is not intended by the parties, and shall not be construed,
to constitute an assumption by the Purchaser of such Plan under which
such liabilities arose, but rather is an accommodation provided to the
Company by the Purchaser and, other than in the case of such liabilities
arising pursuant to an Assumed Contract, the Purchaser will provide
Company with written remittal or payment directions, which Purchaser
will follow.

52
<PAGE>

(q) DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS AUTHORIZATION; CHANGE OF CORPORATE
NAME.

(i) At or prior to the Closing, Company will deliver to Purchaser
a copy of the resolutions of the Board of Directors and all required
resolutions or consents of the shareholders of Company, approving the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of all of
the transactions contemplated hereby, duly certified by an officer of
Company.

(ii) On or before the Closing, Company will deliver to Purchaser
a duly executed and acknowledged certificate of amendment to Company's
articles of organization or other appropriate document which is required
to change Company's corporate name so as to make Company's present name
available to Purchaser. Purchaser is hereby authorized to file such
certificate or other document in order to effectuate such change of name
at or after the Closing as Purchaser shall elect.

(r) ADDITIONAL POST-CLOSING OBLIGATIONS OF COMPANY AND THE
SHAREHOLDERS.

(i) Company and the Shareholders acknowledge that Company has
been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to the
St. Augusta Sanitary Landfill/Engen Dump Site located in Stearns County,
Minnesota and the Seaboard Chemical Corporation Site in Jamestown, North
Carolina. Company, the Shareholders or any Affiliate or Associate of
Company or any Shareholder (a "COMPANY RELATED PARTY") identified as a
potentially responsible party shall provide copies to Merrill of any
written claims, complaints, notices and correspondence relating to the
site where such Company Related Party has been contacted as a
potentially responsible party. Should such Company Related Party fail
to perform or observe any of its obligations or agreements pertaining to
the above sites, or any other sites where such Company Related Party is
identified as a potentially responsible party, then Merrill or Purchaser
shall have the right, but not the duty, without limitation upon any of
the rights of Merrill or Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, to
perform those obligations or agreements. In that event, Merrill or
Purchaser shall be deemed to be acting as the agent of such Company
Related Party, and nothing in the exercise of its rights under this
provision should be interpreted as rendering Merrill or Purchaser as a
responsible party. Nothing in the foregoing shall diminish or in any
way affect the obligation of Company and the Shareholders to indemnify
Merrill and Purchase pursuant to Section 8 hereof.

(ii) Effective as of the Closing, Company appoints

53
<PAGE>

Purchaser its successors and assigns, the true and lawful attorney or
attorneys of Company, with full power of substitution, in the name of
Company but on behalf and for the benefit of and at the expense of
Purchaser: (A) to collect in the name of Company for the account of
Purchaser all receivables and other items to be sold and transferred to
Purchaser as provided herein; (B) to institute and prosecute, in the
name of Company or otherwise, all proceedings which Purchaser may deem
necessary or desirable in order to collect, assert or enforce any claim,
right or title of any kind in or to the Assets; (C) to defend and
compromise any and all actions, suits or proceedings in respect of the
Assets to the extent liability therefor has been assumed by Purchaser
hereunder; and (D) to do all such acts and things in relation to the
foregoing as is reasonably necessary to exercise such powers, as
Purchaser may deem advisable. The foregoing power is coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable by Company or by its dissolution in
any manner or for any reason. Purchaser shall retain for its own
account any amounts collected pursuant to the foregoing power, including
any sums payable as interest in respect thereof, and Company shall pay
to Purchaser, when received, any amounts which shall be received by
Company in respect of any receivables or other assets or properties
related to the Assets. Purchaser shall pay to Company, when received,
any amounts which shall be received by Purchaser in respect of any
receivables or other assets or properties of Company (other than those
related to the Assets).

SECTION 8

8. SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION.

(a) SURVIVAL. The representations and warranties of each of the
parties hereto (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 2(j)(i), (p) and (v)) shall survive until two (2) years after the
Closing Date. The representations and warranties set forth in Section 2(p)
shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations plus six months and
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2(j)(i) and (v) shall

respective "SURVIVAL PERIODS."

(b) INDEMNIFICATION BY MERRILL AND PURCHASER. Merrill and
Purchaser, jointly and severally, agree to save, defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Company and the Shareholders from and against (i) any and all loss,
liability or damage suffered or incurred by it arising out of or resulting
from (A) any untrue representation of,

59
<PAGE>

or breach of warranty by, Merrill or Purchaser in any part of this Agreement;
(B) any nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or undertaking of Merrill or
Purchaser in any part of this Agreement, including without limitation
Purchaser's Promissory Note and the Guaranty; (C) any failure to pay and
perform Assumed Liabilities; or (D) operation of the Assets or the business
associated with the Assets after the Closing Date; and (ii) any and all
actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands, assessments, judgments, costs
and expenses, including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses, incident
to any of the foregoing or incurred in investigating or attempting to avoid
the same or to oppose the imposition thereof, or in enforcing the
indemnification rights of Company pursuant to this subsection (b).

(c) INDEMNIFICATION BY COMPANY AND THE SHAREHOLDERS. Company and
each Shareholder, jointly and severally, agree to save, defend, indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser, Merrill and their respective agents, representatives,
employees, officers, directors, shareholders, controlling persons and
affiliates from and against:

(i) any and all loss, liability or damage suffered or incurred
by Merrill or Purchaser, arising out of or resulting from (A) any untrue
representation of, or breach of warranty by, Company or any Shareholder
in any part of this Agreement or any Non-Competition Agreement with
Company or the Shareholders; (B) any nonfulfillment of any covenant,
agreement or undertaking of Company or any Shareholder in any part of
this Agreement or any Non-Competition Agreement with Company or the
Shareholders; or (C) the failure of Company to comply with the
requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code concerning bulk transfers,
as in effect in the various states in which the Company has assets,
including, without limitation, the requirement of notice to creditors,
except that any liability arising out of Purchaser's failure to pay and

Company or any Shareholder pursuant hereto; or (D) any Retained
Liabilities; and

(ii) any and all actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands,
assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, legal fees and expenses, incident to any of the foregoing or

Merrill or Purchaser pursuant to this subsection 8(c).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company and Shareholders shall not be
liable to Purchaser or Merrill for any claim under this section related to
environmental contamination of a site after the completion of clean up and a
remediation plan as to that site, both of which have been approved by the
applicable regulatory authorities.

60
<PAGE>

(d) BASKET AMOUNT. Notwithstanding anything in subsection 8(c) to
the contrary, neither Merrill nor Purchaser shall be entitled to any
indemnification under subsection 8(c) if the aggregate amount of all claims
thereunder (other than those related to the Retained Liabilities related to
environmental matters described in subsection 1(b)(iii) ("ENVIRONMENTAL
INDEMNITY CLAIMS") is less than $100,000 or, in the case of Environmental
Indemnity Claims, the aggregate amount of all claims thereunder is less than
$50,000; provided, however, (i) no such limitation shall apply to any claim
for indemnification related to a breach of any of the representations and
warranties in Section 2(e)(ii) to the extent that the aggregate of all
previous claims by Merrill or Purchaser for indemnification under subsection
8(c) (other than Environmental Indemnity Claims) exceeds $50,000, and (ii)if
the aggregate amount of all claims equals or exceeds such amounts, then
Merrill and Purchaser shall be entitled to full indemnification of all claims
under subsection 8(c) in excess of such amounts. The foregoing provisions of
Section 8(d) (other than the basket related to Environmental Indemnity claims)
shall not apply to any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or Retained
Liability of which either Company or any Shareholder had Knowledge, or any
intentional failure to perform or comply with any agreement, and Company and
the Shareholder shall be liable for all claims with respect thereto. The
parties hereto do not intend that such exception amounts be deemed to be a
definition of what is "material" for any purpose in this Agreement.

(e) RIGHT OF SET-OFF. Upon notice to Company specifying in
reasonable detail the basis therefor, Purchaser may set off any amount to
which it may be entitled under this Section 8 against amounts otherwise
payable under the Purchaser's Promissory Note. The exercise of such right of
set-off by Purchaser shall not constitute an event of default under the
Purchaser's Promissory Note or any Non-Competition Agreement. Neither the
exercise of, nor the failure to exercise, such right of set-off shall
constitute an election of remedies nor limit Purchaser in any manner in the
enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it. In addition to
the foregoing, Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold payment of the last
installment under the Purchaser's Promissory Note and the last payment under
each Non-Competition Agreement if, on the date that such payment would
otherwise be due, any liability of Company and/or the Shareholders in
connection with the St. Augusta Sanitary Landfill/Engen Dump Site located in
Stearns County, Minnesota is not completely and finally resolved with no
liability on the part of Purchaser or Merrill, or Merrill and Purchaser
receive adequate assurances (in their sole discretion) that they are
completely and definitively released from any liability in connection with
such site. In the event of any permitted assignment of Purchaser's Promissory
Note, any set-off pursuant hereto shall be applied proportionately among all
assignees.

61
<PAGE>

(f) CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION. Whenever any claim shall arise for
indemnification hereunder, the party seeking indemnification (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly provide written notice to the party from
whom indemnification is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of the claim and,
when known, all of the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the
amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability arising therefrom.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 8(g), the failure so to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced
thereby. In the case of any such claim for indemnification hereunder
resulting from or in connection with any claim or legal proceedings of a third
party (a "PROCEEDING"), the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such legal proceedings by counsel of its own
choice and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in
writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against
all losses that may result from such Proceeding, then the Indemnifying Party
shall (unless (i) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Proceeding
and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation
would be inappropriate, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide
reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to
defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect thereto, or
(iii) the claim involves Taxes), be entitled to assume and control the defense
thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and,
after notice from Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election
so to control the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
to such the Indemnified Party under this Section for any fees of other counsel
or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each
case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If an
Indemnifying Party controls the defense of such a Proceeding, (a) no
compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by the Indemnifying Party
without the Indemnified Party's consent unless (i) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any person
and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified
Party and (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party and (b) the Indemnifying Party shall have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement thereof effected
without its consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a
Proceeding may adversely effect it or its affiliates other than as a result of
monetary damages, or the Proceeding involves Taxes, such Indemnified Party
may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to
defend, compromise or settle such Proceeding, but the Indemnifying Party shall
not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any
compromise or

62
<PAGE>

settlement thereof effected without its consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise
any claim by a third party for which it is entitled to indemnification
hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party has not, within ten (10) days after
notice is given of the commencement of a Proceeding, given notice to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so assume the defense of such Proceeding, the
Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any determination made in such action or
any compromise or settlement thereof effected by the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party is of the opinion that the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification, or is not entitled to indemnification in the
amount claimed in such notice, it shall deliver, within ten (10) days after
the receipt of such notice, a written objection to such claim and written
specifications in reasonable detail of the aspects or details objected to, and
the grounds for such objection. If the Indemnifying Party shall file timely
written notice of objection to any claim for indemnification, the validity and
amount of such claim shall be determined by arbitration pursuant to Section
9(n) hereof.

(g) LIMIT ON CLAIMS. Any claim under this Agreement, including but
not limited to any claim for damages, indemnification or right of set off,
shall not be enforceable unless the party against whom the claim is made
receives written notice of such claim in the manner set forth in Section 8(f)
hereof not later than (i) for claims made by Purchaser or Merrill pursuant to
Section 8(c)(i)(A) or Company or the Shareholders pursuant to Section
8(b)(i)(A), the last day of the applicable Survival Period; (ii) for claims
made by Purchaser or Merrill pursuant to Section 8(c)(i)(B) or Company or the
Shareholders pursuant to Section 8(b)(i)(B), one year after the date of such
breach; (iii) for claims made by Purchaser or Merrill pursuant to Section
8(c)(i)(C), the earlier of the date payment is made to a creditor or the date
which is two (2) years after the Closing Date; (iv) for claims made by
Purchaser or Merrill pursuant to Section 8(c)(i)(D) or Company or the
Shareholders pursuant to Section 8(b)(i)(C) or (D), the earlier of (A) the
expiration of the applicable underlying statute of limitations plus six months
or (B) the date which is four (4) years after the Closing Date, except for
claims made by Purchaser or Merrill related to the Retained Liabilities (I)
described in Section 1(b)(iii) hereto or (II) arising from the debt assumed by
Purchaser or Merrill pursuant to this Agreement and the Liabilities
Undertaking and the transactions contemplated thereby, as to which there shall
be no time limit.

(h) LIMIT ON DAMAGES. The aggregate amount payable by Company or
the Shareholders to Purchaser or Merrill hereunder shall not exceed the
Purchase Price (other than with respect to claims made pursuant to Section
8(c)(i)(D) related to the Retained

63
<PAGE>

Liabilities described in Section 1(b)(iii) hereto, as to which there shall be
no limit).

SECTION 9

9. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

(a) EXPENSES. Except as otherwise provided herein, Merrill,
Purchaser and the Shareholders (in the case of the Company) shall each bear
their own costs and expenses relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including without limitation, fees and expenses of legal counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, brokers or finders, printers, copiers, consultants or
other representatives for the services used, hired or connected with the

by the Shareholders related to the transactions contemplated hereby or on
behalf of the Company in connection with corporate "clean-up" matters
necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Merrill,
Purchaser and the Shareholders (in the case of the Company) shall each pay any
commission or finder's fee or similar amount incurred by them by agreement or
otherwise for retaining or consulting any broker, finder or investment banker
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) TOPPING FEES. In the event that the Closing does not occur
prior to January 31, 1994 or this Agreement is terminated other than pursuant
to Section 7(a)(i) or (a)(v) hereof and within 12 months after the later of
January 31, 1994 or the date of such termination Company or any of the
Shareholders close a transaction relating to the acquisition of a material
portion of Company, its assets or business, in whole or in part, whether
through direct purchase, merger, consolidation, or other business combination
(other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course), or more than 25% of
the outstanding voting securities of Company, for a consideration in excess of
the Purchase Price (pro rated to the extent that less than all of Company is
acquired), and Section 4(c) hereof or the first paragraph of Section 12 of the
Letter of Intent has been breached, then immediately upon such closing, the
Shareholders shall pay, or cause Company to pay, to Merrill or Purchaser the
sum of $1.0 million plus all of Merrill's and Purchaser's costs and expenses
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, including without
limitation, fees and expenses of legal counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, brokers or finders, printers, copiers, consultants or other

<PAGE>

any time prior to the Closing with respect to any of the terms contained
herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all such amendments and modifications must

(d) WAIVER OF COMPLIANCE; CONSENTS. Any failure of a party to
comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be
expressly waived in writing by the party entitled hereby to such compliance,
but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. No single or
partial exercise of a right or remedy shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right or remedy hereunder. Whenever this
Agreement requires or permits the consent by or on behalf of a party, such
consent shall be given in writing in the same manner as for waivers of
compliance.

(e) NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Nothing in this Agreement shall
entitle any person or entity (other than a party hereto and his, her or its
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby) to any claim, cause of
action, remedy or right of any kind.

respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
(whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise) by any

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Merrill may assign its rights (but not its
obligations) under this Agreement, in whole or in any part, and from time to
time, to a wholly owned, direct or indirect, subsidiary of Merrill and Company
may assign its right to receive payments (but not its obligations) under the
Purchaser's Promissory Note to the Shareholders subject to the terms thereof

66
<PAGE>

and the Shareholders may assign such rights to a revocable trust of which they
are the sole settlor, beneficiary and trustee. Purchaser shall pay the
amounts due and payable under the Purchaser's Promissory Note to such persons
or entities and in such amounts as holders of the Promissory Note shall direct
in writing provided to Purchaser at least 5 business days prior to the due
date of such payment (which payment shall be considered to be made pursuant to

(h) GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and the legal relations among the
parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal substantive laws of the State of Minnesota (without regard to the

remedies, except to the extent that the provisions of the Minnesota
Corporation Code may apply to the internal affairs of Company.

(i) COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

(j) HEADINGS. The table of contents and the headings of the
sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only
and shall not constitute a part hereof.

(k) ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule and
the exhibits and other writings referred to in this Agreement or in the
Disclosure Schedule or any such exhibit or other writing are part of this
Agreement, together they embody the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and together they are referred to as "this AGREEMENT" or the "AGREEMENT".
There are no restrictions, promises, warranties, agreements, covenants or
undertakings, other than those expressly set forth or referred to in this
Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
between the parties with respect to the transaction or transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Letter of
Intent. Provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted to be valid and
enforceable under applicable Law to the extent that such interpretation does
not materially alter this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any such
provision shall become invalid or unenforceable under applicable Law such
provision shall be stricken to the extent necessary and the remainder of such
provisions and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect.

(l) REMEDIES. It is expressly agreed among the parties hereto that
monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate a party hereto for any
breach by any other party of its covenants and agreements in subsections 4(c)
and 4(e) hereof. Accordingly, the

67
<PAGE>

parties agree and acknowledge that any such violation or threatened violation
will cause irreparable injury to the other and that, in addition to any other
remedies which may be available, such party shall be entitled to injunctive
relief against the threatened breach of subsections 4(c) and 4(e) hereof or
the continuation of any such breach without the necessity or proving actual
damages and may seek to specifically enforce the terms thereof.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Company and the Shareholders, on the one hand, and Merrill and Purchaser, on
the other hand, shall only have the right to make a claim against the other
for damages (other than a claim for sums owing pursuant to Sections 9(a) or
9(b) hereof, a claim by Merrill or Purchaser against Company or the
Shareholders for any breach by Company or the Shareholders of the Section 4(c)
hereof, or an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8 hereof) if the
non-claiming party has willfully and materially breached any of its
representations, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. For
purposes of this provision, a party shall be deemed to have willfully breached
any of its representations, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement if such party has intentionally and knowingly taken, or
intentionally and knowingly failed to take, any action which causes a breach
of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. The
remedies and rights of the parties hereto shall be cumulative. No party
hereto shall be entitled to rescind this Agreement after the Closing.

(m) CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Agreement, the term:

(i) "KNOWLEDGE" or "BEST KNOWLEDGE" of an entity means
knowledge actually possessed by any director or officer of the entity
(and, in the case of Company, any Shareholder) and such knowledge as
would have or should have come to the attention of any such person in
the course of due inquiry and the preparation and negotiation of this
Agreement and related Disclosure Schedule and in the course of
discharging such individual's duties as a director or officer (or, in
the case of Company, a Shareholder) of the entity in a reasonable and
prudent manner consistent with sound business practices.

(ii) "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT," in the case of Company or the
Shareholders, means any event, change or occurrence which has or could
reasonably be expected (in light of known circumstances) to have a
material negative impact on the condition (financial or otherwise),
business, results of operations, prospects or going concern value of
Company, or the ability of Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. For purposes hereof, a Material Adverse Effect on
Company shall be deemed to have taken place in the event that (A) after
consultation with any customer of Company

68
<PAGE>

which, including its franchises, accounted for sales greater than $1
million of sales in the fiscal year ended December 31, 1992, such
customer informs Company, Purchaser or Merrill that it and/or its
franchises will reduce the aggregate annual dollar amount of its
purchases from Company for calendar 1994 by more than 10% from the
totals for the first nine months of 1993 (on an annualized basis) or (B)
Purchaser will not be granted "preferred vendor" status with any such
customer and its franchisees who require such status in order for
Purchaser to do business with such customer or (C) such customer or its
franchisees will otherwise change in any way its relationship with
Company prior to the Closing or with Purchaser after the closing which
could reasonably be anticipated to result in a reduction of revenues
from such customer and its franchises for calendar 1994 by more than 10%
from the totals for the first nine months of 1993 (on an annualized
basis).

"MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT," in the case of Purchaser or Merrill,
means any event, change or occurrence which has or could reasonably be
expected (in light of known circumstances) to have a material negative
impact on the ability of Purchaser or Merrill to consummate the
transactions hereby, including without limitation, Purchaser's ability
to fulfill its obligations under Purchaser's Promissory Note.

(n) ARBITRATION. With the sole exception of the injunctive relief
contemplated by Section 9(l) hereof, any controversy or claim arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or the making, performance or interpretation
thereof, including without limitation alleged fraudulent inducement thereof,
shall be settled by binding arbitration in Minneapolis, Minnesota by a panel
of three arbitrators in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon any arbitration award may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof and the parties consent to
the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Minnesota for this purpose.

(o) PRESERVATION OF RECORDS AFTER CLOSING. After Closing Purchaser
shall preserve and maintain all books and records relating to the business
conducted with the Assets and the Assets sold hereunder for a period of not
less than the period that Merrill preserves similar records and grant Company
or the Shareholders (at their sole cost and expense) reasonable access at
reasonable times to the same for any reasonable purpose.
