PARK AT COUNTRYSIDE APARTMENTS

DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA
______________________________________

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. Carlyle Real Estate Limited Partnership - XV (the
"Partnership") through Daytona Park Associates, Ltd. (the "Venture"), a Florida
limited partnership, was the owner of the Park at Countryside Apartments (the
"Property") located in Daytona Beach, Florida. Effective May 5, 1994, due to 
the Venture's default in the payment of debt service, the mortgage lender (The
Travelers Insurance Company) concluded proceedings to realize upon its mortgage
security represented by the land, building and related improvements of the
Property. The property consists of a 120-unit apartment complex and was
approximately 98% occupied at the time of the transfer of title.

The Venture has recognized a gain of approximately $2,000,000 for financial
reporting purposes in 1994 and expects to recognize a gain of approximately
$1,200,000 for Federal income tax purposes (of which the Partnership's share is
approximately $1,300,000 and $800,000, respectively). The terms of the Venture
agreement provide that the gain on disposition of the Property be allocated to
the partners with negative capital balances immediately prior to disposition,
with such gain being allocated in the ratio of such negative balances.

Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the Carlyle Real Estate Limited
Partnership - XV Partnership Agreement, the gain on disposition in 1994 will be
allocated 1% to the General Partners and 99% to the Limited Partners. 
There will be no distributable proceeds as a result of this transaction.
