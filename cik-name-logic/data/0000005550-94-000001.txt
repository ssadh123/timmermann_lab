This FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT (The "Agreement") is made as of the
1st day of September, 1993, between AMERICAN NUCLEAR CORPORATION, a
Colorado corporation ("Borrower" or "ANC") and CYCLE RESOURCES
INVESTMENT CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Lender" or "CRIC").

RECITALS

A. Pursuant to a Loan Agreement dated May 16, 1991, (the
"Loan Agreement") between Borrower and Lender, Lender agreed to loan
Borrower up to $200,000 (the "First Loan"). The First Loan is
evidenced by a certain Promissory Note (Multiple Advance) dated as of
<PAGE>

May 16, 1991, in due principal amount of $200,000. The First Loan
was secured by an Assignment and Security Agreement dated as of May
16, 1991 (the "Security Agreement"), and a Mortgage, Assignment, 
Security Agreement and Financing Statement dated as of May 16, 1991
(the "Mortgage").

B. The Security Agreement and Mortgage were properly
perfected through the filing of appropriate financing statements and
the recording of the Mortgage.

C. The First Loan was amended on three separate occasions. 
On June 27, 1991, the Loan was increased to $650,000, with the
Borrower executing and delivering appropriate amending documents,
including an Amended Promissory Note (First), a First Amendment to
Mortgage, Assignment, Security Agreement and Financing Statement, the
Agreement and First Amendment to Loan Agreement and the appropriate
Uniform Commercial Code amendments, all dated as of June 27, 1991. 
The amendments were recorded and filed where appropriate.

D. The First Loan was again amended in December 1991, with
the Loan amount increased to $1,250,000. The Borrower executed and
delivered appropriate amending documents, including an Amended
Promissory Note (Second), a Second Amendment to Mortgage, Assignment,
Security Agreement and Financing Statement, the Agreement and Second
Amendment to Loan Agreement and the appropriate Uniform Commercial
Code amendments, all dated as of December 10, 1991. The amendments
were recorded and filed where appropriate.

E. The First Loan was again amended in August 1993, with the
Loan increased to $1,383,200. The Borrower executed and delivered
appropriate amending documents, including an Amended Promissory Note
(Third), a Third Amendment to Mortgage, Assignment, Security
Agreement and Financing Statement and the appropriate Uniform
Commercial Code amendments, all dated as of August 24, 1993. The
Amended Promissory Note (Third) shall be referred to as "Note One."

F. Lender made a second loan to Borrower in the amount of
$124,000 in August 1992 (the "Second Loan"). The Second Loan was
evidenced by a Promissory Note in favor of the Lender in the amount
of $124,000, and secured by a Security Agreement Covering Accounts
and Contract Rights dated as of August 24, 1992. The Second Loan was
amended on September 30, 1992, and March 23, 1993, with the amount of
the Second Loan increasing to $648,000. The Promissory Note, as
amended, shall be referred to as the "Second Note." In each
instance, the Borrower executed and delivered to Lender appropriate
amending documents, including amended promissory notes and mortgages. 
The amendments were recorded and filed where appropriate.

G. The First Loan and the Second Loan shall together be
referred to as the "Loans." All security agreements, financing
statements, assignments, mortgages and other collateral documents
executed in connection with the Loans shall be referred to as the
"Security Documents." Note One and Note Two shall be referred to as
the "Notes." All documents executed in connection with the Notes,
the Loans and the Security Documents shall be referred to as the
"Loan Documents."

H. Borrower and Lender have been negotiating further
revisions to the Loans during the past few months. The Loans both
matured as of August 31, 1993, and as of that date the outstanding
principal balance of the First Loan was $1,383,200 and the
outstanding principal balance of the Second Loan was $648,000.

I. The Borrower is in the process of attempting to sell
certain uranium claims which shall be referred to herein as the
"Peach Properties." The Peach Properties are encumbered by the
Security Documents in favor of Lender. Borrower expects that its
sale effort for such properties can be completed by June 30, 1994.

J. Borrower has requested that Lender agree to forbear from
enforcing any of Lender's rights or remedies against Borrower under
or in connection with the Loans and the Security Documents or any
existing defaults thereunder, and Lender is willing to do so upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Properties.
