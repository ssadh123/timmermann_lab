Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On December 2, 1994, The Mead Corporation, an Ohio corporation
(the "Registrant"), consummated the disposition of its Mead Data Central
division and certain related assets and subsidiaries (the "Business") to
Reed Elsevier plc, an English corporation, and certain of its affiliates
(collectively, "Reed") pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated as of
October 4, 1994 by and among the Registrant, Reed Elsevier plc and certain
affiliated entities, as amended by an Amendment dated as of December 2,
1994.

The purchase price paid by Reed for the Business was
approximately $1.5 billion, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. 
The purchase price was established through arms' length negotiations
following the solicitation, receipt and consideration of proposals from
various interested parties.

Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and
Exhibits

(a) Not Applicable

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information

The following unaudited pro forma condensed statements of earnings
for the three quarters ended October 2, 1994, and the year ended
December 31, 1993, set forth the results of operations of the
Registrant as reported and as adjusted as though the sale of the
Business had been completed at the beginning of the periods
presented. The unaudited condensed statements of earnings reflect
the elimination of interest expense on the debt that is anticipated
to be retired and the related tax benefit as well as the historical
operating results of the Business. No effect of possible uses of
the remaining proceeds is reflected.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet as of
October 2, 1994, reflects the financial position of the Registrant
as reported and as adjusted as though the sale of the Business had
been completed at October 2, 1994. The unaudited pro forma
condensed balance sheet reflects the elimination of the assets and
liabilities of the Business, the net proceeds of the sale, and the
redemption and/or repurchase of certain short and long-term debt of
the Registrant.

These unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements have been
prepared by the Registrant based upon assumptions deemed
appropriate. The accompanying pro forma condensed financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the historical
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Registrant's
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three quarters ended October
2, 1994 and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 1993.

These unaudited pro forma financial statements are presented for
illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the
financial position or results of operations which would actually
have been reported had the transactions been in effect during the
period reported or which may be reported in the future.

(All dollar amounts in millions)

A. The sale of Mead Data Central (MDC) will result in cash proceeds
of approximately $1,500 and a related after tax gain of
approximately $631. Adjustments have been recorded in the
unaudited pro forma balance sheet to reflect the receipt of the
proceeds, the recognition of the anticipated gain, payment of
related income taxes and other expenses and the disposition of the
net assets of MDC. The gain is not expected to change
significantly when the recording of the sale is finalized.

MDC was presented as a discontinued operation in the Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended October 2,
1994. As such, the only adjustment made to the historical results
presented in the pro forma historical statement of earnings is the
omission of earnings from discontinued operations. For the
historical statement of earnings for the year ended December 31,
1993, the results of MDC's operations have been removed. The
corresponding adjustments required are the following:

B. The Registrant has called its 6-3/4% convertible subordinated
debentures and 9% debentures. In addition, the company intends to
pay off all of its short term borrowings including those classified
as long term. Adjustments made to the pro forma balance sheet
reflect elimination of the debt and the recording of an
extraordinary loss on extinguishment of the debt, net of tax. 
Adjustments made to the pro forma statements of earnings reflect
elimination of interest expense on the debt and the related tax
benefit.

C. Due to the retirement of the debt in Note B, common stock
equivalents were excluded from the calculation of earnings per share
for the three quarters ended October 2, 1994, and year ended
December 31, 1993. For the three quarters ended October 2, 1994,
the retirement had the effect of decreasing average common and
common equivalent shares outstanding by approximately 2.6 million shares.
The retirement had no effect on the year ended December 31, 1993,
calculation as the common stock equivalents were anti-dilutive.
