Item 5. Other Events

On May 20, 1994, International Lease Finance Corporation ("ILFC")
announced that it had reached an agreement with VARIG, S.A. of Brazil to
restructure its lease agreements concerning eight aircraft. Under the
restructuring package, ILFC will accept the return from VARIG of three
new technology Boeing 747-400 aircraft, convert three Boeing 747-300
aircraft from finance to operating leases and extend the lease terms on
two Boeing 737-300 aircraft, with corresponding adjustments to lease
rentals and other payments. The restructuring package offers advantages
to each party. ILFC is currently attempting to lease the three returned
Boeing 747-400 aircraft to other international air carriers. Assuming
ILFC is able to lease the three Boeing 747-400 aircraft promptly, the
restructing is not expected to have a material adverse effect on ILFC.
