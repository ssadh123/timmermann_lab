HIBERNIA SIGNS MERGER AGREEMENT WITH STABA BANCSHARES
THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY BOOST SERVICE TO RIVER PARISHES

NEW ORLEANS -- Hibernia announced today it has signed a
definitive agreement to merge with STABA Bancshares, Inc.,
headquartered in Donaldsonville, a transaction that would make
Hibernia the leading bank in Ascension Parish in both number of
locations and deposits.

STABA operates State Bank of Donaldsonville, with $97 million
in assets. State Bank has two offices in Donaldsonville, one in
Gonzales and another targeted to open December 1 in Prairieville.

Combined with a pending merger with American Bank, the leading
bank in neighboring St. Charles Parish, the STABA merger will allow
Hibernia to significantly increase service to customers in the
River Parishes between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. It also will
give it another important West Bank location.

State Bank has 25% of deposits in Ascension; Hibernia, 4%,
with one office in Gonzales. Combined, they will account for 29%.

Based on Hibernia's November 3 closing price of $8.375 per
share, STABA shareholders would receive approximately 18 shares of
Hibernia stock for each STABA share in a tax-free pooling of
interests valued at approximately $18 million. The transaction is
subject to approvals by regulators and STABA shareholders and
should be completed in early 1995.

"With individuals and families holding more than two thirds of
State Bank's loans, it's obvious our employees have done a good job
serving the communities in which they live and work," said Kenneth
A. Bailey, chief executive officer. "I know State Bank customers
will enjoy the even wider variety of products and expanding office
network that Hibernia offers."

Bailey will continue as area president with Hibernia when the
merger is completed.

After the merger, Hibernia plans to consolidate its smaller
Gonzales location, which it leases at 2020 S. Burnside Ave., with
State Bank's larger and more attractive office at 1300 S. Burnside
Ave. Construction of State Bank's Prairieville office is
substantially complete.

"We're looking forward to continuing the long tradition of
service that State Bank has provided and introducing new financial
services that currently are not available to them, including
brokerage, annuities, trust and a lot more," said Stephen A.
Hansel, Hibernia's president and CEO.

State Bank customers should continue using their checks,
making loan payments and conducting other transactions just as
before. Only after the bank is converted to Hibernia's operating
systems would checks, signs and forms change.

Hibernia National Bank is Louisiana's largest statewide bank. 
When the STABA Bancshares merger and three other pending mergers
are complete, it will have approximately $6.4 billion in assets and
156 banking offices serving 20 parishes and 52 cities. They
include New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Lafayette and the Acadiana
region, Alexandria, Shreveport/Bossier City, Monroe, West Monroe,
Bastrop and Tallulah.
