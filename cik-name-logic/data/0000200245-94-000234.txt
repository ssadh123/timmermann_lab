SALOMON INC REPORTS QUARTERLY NET INCOME OF $66 MILLION

New York, April 25, 1994 - Salomon Inc today announced net income of
$66 million for the 1994 first quarter. Fully diluted earnings per
share were $0.48 and return on common equity was 4.9%. In the 1993
first quarter, Salomon Inc recorded a net loss of $102 million, which
included a $37 million aftertax charge to reflect the cumulative
impact of a change in accounting principles.

Salomon Brothers, the Company's global investment banking and
securities business, earned $39 million before taxes in the 1994 first
quarter. Pretax losses of $173 million for Client-Driven Businesses
were offset by earnings of $212 million for Proprietary Trading
Businesses. In the 1993 first quarter, Salomon Brothers had a loss
before taxes of $89 million.

The disappointing results for Salomon Brothers' Client-Driven
Businesses in the 1994 first quarter were attributable to losses in
foreign exchange and international secondary markets and a decline in
U.S. secondary market revenues. The Company's foreign exchange and
secondary markets businesses combine both client-related market making
activities and positioning activities in which views are expressed
about short-term changes in price and volatility. Revenues were
adversely affected by declines in the value of positions in these
businesses as well as an overall decline in customer trading volume in
the latter part of the quarter.

Proprietary Trading results for the 1994 quarter were strong, but are
better evaluated over longer term periods of at least one year. For
the four quarters ended March 31, 1994, Proprietary Trading
Businesses' pretax profits were $947 million.

The Phibro Division, which is the Company's commodities trading
business, had strong pretax earnings of $50 million in the first
quarter of 1994. The Division was able to take advantage of trading
opportunities in oil markets as prices rose and volatility increased.
In the comparable 1993 quarter, the Phibro Division had pretax
earnings of $6 million.

<PAGE>

Phibro USA, the Company's oil refining business, had pretax earnings
of $27 million in the 1994 first quarter, compared with a $13 million
pretax loss in last year's first quarter. Much of the improvement in
earnings was due to increased refining margins resulting primarily
from weather-related demand in the Northeast for refined products.
Phibro USA's recent expansion of storage and terminal capacity in the
Northeast enabled it to capitalize on these market opportunities. In
addition, Phibro USA had improved results in its petrochemicals, crude
oil gathering and marine fuels businesses.

During the 1994 first quarter, the Company repurchased 4.9 million of
its common shares for treasury at an aggregate cost of $237 million,
or $48.55 per share. Partly because common share repurchases were at
an average price above book value, book value per share declined
modestly from $38.57 at the end of 1993 to $38.23 at March 31, 1994.
Over the last year, book value per share has increased by 24%, from
$30.88 at March 31, 1993. Shares authorized for additional repurchase
by the Company's Board of Directors totaled 4.8 million at quarter
end.

The Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Robert E. Denham,
stated "First quarter results were disappointing as the sharp
downdraft in securities prices that occurred in the latter part of the
quarter brought losses in several of the trading businesses conducted
as part of Salomon Brothers' Client-Driven Businesses. Elsewhere, in
Salomon Brothers' Proprietary Trading Businesses, in Phibro Division's
commodities trading, and in Phibro USA's oil refining business,
results were more than satisfactory."
