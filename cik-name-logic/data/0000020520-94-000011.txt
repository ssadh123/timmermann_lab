CITIZENS UTILITIES ACQUIRES TELEPHONE PROPERTIES SERVING
270,000 SUBSCRIBERS IN NEW YORK STATE

Stamford, Connecticut, June 30, 1994 -- Citizens Utilities announced today
that it has completed the acquisition of 270,000 telephone access lines in
New York pursuant to an agreement to purchase a total of 500,000 telephone
access lines in nine states from GTE. 

In December 1993, Citizens acquired telephone properties with 190,000
access lines in Idaho, Tennessee, West Virginia and Utah as part of this
agreement. With the acquisition of the New York operations, the
transaction is now 90% complete. The remaining properties are expected
to be transferred to Citizens later this year. 

Leonard Tow, chairman and chief executive officer of Citizens, stated,
"This transaction is producing immediate increases in earnings, earnings
per share and cash flow for Citizens. The size and quality of the assets
acquired, combined with the strength of our existing operations, will
increase Citizens' revenues to more than $1 billion and boost earnings and
earnings per share." Mr. Tow added, "This acquisition assures Citizens of
a 50th successive year of increased earnings and earnings per share, a
record we believe unmatched by any other publicly traded company in the
nation."

Citizens Utilities (NYSE: CZNA, CZNB) is a diversified growth company
providing telecommunications, natural gas, electric, water and wastewater
treatment services in 17 states as of July 1, 1994. Citizens also has a
significant investment in Centennial Cellular Corp., a cellular telephone
company, and operates Electric Lightwave, Inc., a competitive telephone
access provider in Oregon and Washington.
