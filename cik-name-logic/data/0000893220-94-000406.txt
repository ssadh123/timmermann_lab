The following information may be of interest to investors:

On September 23, 1994, two consent orders were signed by Columbia Gas
Transmission Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant and a
debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Orders approve Columbia
Transmission's ongoing self-assessment and remediation program, which, as
previously disclosed, is expected to require the expenditure of approximately
$20 million each year over the next 10 to 12 years. Under the consent orders
Columbia Transmission has also agreed to pay a $4.9 million penalty for alleged
violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act and the PCB regulations at
various locations in West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia. Columbia
Transmission believes it has meritorious defenses to the alleged violations,
but chose not to pursue lengthy and expensive litigation of the issues that
gave rise to the penalty. The consent orders are not effective until approved
by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
