MATTEL FIRST QUARTER INCOME UP 30 PERCENT
-----------------------------------------

LOS ANGELES, April 20 -- Mattel, Inc. today reported record first quarter

net income of $24.1 million or $.13 per share, up 30 percent from

consolidated Mattel and Fisher-Price earnings of $18.5 million or $.10 per

share for the 1993 quarter before accounting changes.

Net sales for the quarter were a record $487 million, up 2 percent

from $477 million in 1993. First quarter toy sales increased 4 percent,

before the negative impact of foreign exchange translation.

"These sales and earnings results are in line with our expectations

and consistent with our long-term objective of delivering excellent

profitable growth," John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive

officer, said. "The ability to continue to report record results further

demonstrates Mattel's sustainable competitive advantages of core consumer

product franchises; an unsurpassed international marketing network; and

manufacturing efficiencies resulting from producing the majority of our

products in our own facilities.

"Our first quarter performance, coupled with the rapid integration

of Fisher-Price and the expected contribution from the Kransco acquisition,

puts us solidly on track to achieve or exceed our 1994 volume and income

objectives," Amerman said.

Mattel, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and

marketing of children's toys. Fisher-Price, a leader in infant and

preschool toys, became part of Mattel through a merger completed in

November, 1993. In addition, Mattel expects to complete its acquisition

of Kransco by May 31, 1994. Kransco's principal product lines include

Power Wheels battery-operated, ride-on vehicles; Hula Hoop and Frisbee

products marketed under the Wham-O trademark; and Morey Boogie boards

and other water sport toys.

With headquarters in El Segundo, California, Mattel has offices and

facilities in 34 foreign countries and sells its products in more than

140 nations throughout the world.
