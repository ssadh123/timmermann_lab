tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing;
and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become

and (subject to Section 10.01 ) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the
Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument
or writing may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other
officer of any jurisdiction authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds or
administer oaths that the Person executing such instrument acknowledged to him
the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution sworn
to before any such notary or other such officer and where such execution is by
an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership, on

Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the
Trustee deems sufficient.

instrument or writing as a Bondholder, and the numbers of such Bearer Bonds, and

<PAGE> 26

16
mentioned such Person had on deposit with such depository, or exhibited to it,
the Bearer Bonds therein described; or such facts may be proved by the
certificate or affidavit of the Person executing such instrument or writing as a
Bondholder, if such certificate or affidavit is satisfactory to the Trustee. The
Trustee and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Bond
continues until (1) another certificate bearing a later date issued in respect
of the same Bearer Bond is produced, or (2) such Bearer Bond is produced by some
other Person, or (3) such Bearer Bond is registered as to principal or is
surrendered in exchange for a Registered Bond, or (4) such Bearer Bond is no
longer Outstanding.

(d) The fact and date of execution of any such instrument or writing and

(e) The ownership of Registered Bonds shall be proved by the Bond Register.

(f) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other action by the Holder of any Bond shall bind the Holder of every Bond

reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Bond.

(g) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may,
at its option, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, fix a record date (which
shall be not more than 60 nor less than five days prior to the date upon which
such solicitation commences) for the determination of Holders entitled to give
such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is
fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders
of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be
Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite
proportion of Outstanding Bonds have authorized or agreed or consented to such
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act,
and for that
<PAGE> 27

17
purpose the Outstanding Bonds shall be computed as of such record date; provided
that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on such record
date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the
provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.

(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing
to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder if in writing and mailed, first-class postage

office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at any other
address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company for
such purpose.

SECTION 1.06. Notices to Holders; Waiver.

(unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed,
first-class postage prepaid, to each such Registered Holder, at his address as
it appears in the Bond Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier
than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice.

(2) such notice shall be sufficiently given to the Holders of Bearer Bonds
of any series if published in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place of Payment
for such Bonds (hereinafter referred to as "Notice by Publication").

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be
waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before
or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.
Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing
shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in
reliance upon such waiver. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail,
neither the
<PAGE> 28

18
failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any
particular Registered Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with
respect to other Registered Holders or the sufficiency of any Notice by
Publication to Holders of Bearer Bonds, and any notice which is mailed in the
manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given.

In case, by reason of suspension of publication or any other cause, it
shall be impossible to publish a notice in any Authorized Newspaper or
Authorized Newspapers as provided in any provision of this Indenture, then
(notwithstanding such provision) such other publication or notification as shall
be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient publication
of such notice. Neither failure to give Notice by Publication to Holders of
Bearer Bonds as provided above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall
affect the sufficiency of any notice mailed to Holders of Registered Bonds as
provided above, or of any effective Notice by Publication given to other Holders
of Bearer Bonds.

SECTION 1.07. Language of Notices, etc.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, election or waiver required or
permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that any
published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication.

If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with any provision
which is deemed to be included in this Indenture by Sections 310 to 317,
inclusive, of the TIA, such deemed included provision shall control.

SECTION 1.09. Effect of Heading and Table of Contents.

The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for

<PAGE> 29

19
SECTION 1.11. Separability Clause.

In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Bonds or coupons shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 1.12. Benefits of Indenture.

Nothing in this Indenture or in the Bonds or coupons, express or implied,
shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors
hereunder, and the Holders of Bonds and coupons, any benefit or any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

laws of the State of New York.

then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Bonds or
coupons) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made
on such date at such Place of Payment, but may be made on the next succeeding
Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made
on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date or at the Stated Maturity, and
no interest shall accrue on such payment for the period from and after such
Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be.

such additional amounts; and

(22) any other terms of the Bonds of such series, or any tranche
thereof (which terms shall conform to any applicable requirements of the
TIA, and shall not materially adversely affect the rights of the Holders of
Bonds then outstanding).

SECTION 2.04. Form and Denominations.

The Bonds of each series shall be either Registered Bonds or Bearer Bonds,
or both, and such Bonds (and the related coupons, if any) shall be in such form
as shall be established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or the supplemental
indenture creating such series, with such omissions, variations and insertions
as are permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other
marks of identification and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed
or engraved thereon, as may be required to comply with the rules of any
securities exchange or to conform to any usage in respect thereof, or as may,
consistently herewith, be prescribed by the Board of Directors or by the
officers executing such Bonds and coupons, such determination by said officers
to be evidenced by their signing the Bonds and coupons. The Bonds of each series
and coupons appertaining thereto, if any, shall be distinguished from the Bonds
and coupons of other series in such manner as may be prescribed in or pursuant
to
<PAGE> 34

24
the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture creating or authorizing the
creation of such series.

The definitive Bonds and coupons shall be printed, lithographed or engraved
or produced by any combination of these methods on steel engraved borders or may
be produced in any other manner permitted by the rules of any securities
exchange, all as determined by the officers executing such Bonds or coupons, as
evidenced by their execution of such Bonds or coupons.

The Bonds of each series shall be issued in such denominations as shall be
provided in or pursuant to the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture
creating or authorizing the creation of such series or as the Board of Directors
may determine. In the absence of any such provision with respect to the Bonds of
any particular series, the Bonds of such series shall be of the denominations of
$1,000 or multiples thereof.

SECTION 2.05. Execution, Authentication and Delivery and Dating.

The Bonds shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Governor, its
Chief Executive Officer, its Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its
Vice Presidents under its corporate seal reproduced thereon and attested by its
Treasurer, its Secretary or one of its Assistant Treasurers or its Assistant
Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Bonds may be manual
or facsimile. The coupons shall bear the facsimile signature of the Treasurer or
an Assistant Treasurer of the Company.

Bonds and coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals
who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Bonds and coupons or
did not hold such offices at the date of such Bonds and coupons.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this
Indenture, the Company may deliver Bonds with coupons, if any, appertaining
thereto executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication; and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Bonds as in this Indenture provided
and not otherwise.

All Registered Bonds shall be dated the date of their authentication. All
Bearer Bonds of each series shall be dated as of a single date specified in or
pursuant to the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture or indentures
creating or authorizing the creation of such series of Bearer Bonds.
<PAGE> 35

25
No Bond or coupon appertaining thereto shall be entitled to any benefit
under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there
appears on such Bond a certificate of authentication substantially in the form
provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such
certificate upon any Bond shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence,
that such Bond has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Except as
permitted by Sections 2.08 or 2.09, the Trustee shall not authenticate and
deliver any Bearer Bond unless all appurtenant coupons for interest then matured
and duly provided for or paid have been detached and cancelled.

If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 2.03 that the Bonds of a
series are to be issued in the form of one or more Global Bonds, then the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall in accordance with this Section
authenticate and deliver one or more Global Bonds that (i) shall represent and
shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all
of the Bonds of such series issued and not yet canceled, (ii) shall be
registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Bond or Bonds or the
nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such
Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instructions and (iv) shall bear a
legend substantially to the following effect (or such other legend as such
Depositary may require): "Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized
representative of the Depositary to the Company or its agent for registration of
transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the
name of the nominee of the Depositary or in such other name as is requested by
an authorized representative of the Depositary (and any payment made to the
nominee of the Depositary or to such other entity as is requested by an
authorized representative of the Depositary), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE
HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL, inasmuch as the
registered owner hereof, the nominee of the Depositary, has an interest herein."

Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 2.03 for a Global Bond in
registered form shall, at the time of its designation and at all times while it
serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

SECTION 2.06. Temporary Bonds.

Pending the preparation of definitive Bonds of any series, the Company may
execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and
<PAGE> 36

26
deliver, temporary Bonds which are printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any denomination, substantially of the
tenor of the definitive Bonds in lieu of which they are issued, in bearer or
registered form, with one or more coupons or without coupons, and with such
appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the
officers executing such Bonds may determine, as evidenced by their execution of
such Bonds.

If temporary Bonds of any series are issued, the Company will cause
definitive Bonds of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After
the preparation of definitive Bonds, the temporary Bonds shall be exchangeable
for definitive Bonds upon surrender of the temporary Bonds at the office or
agency of the Company in any Place of Payment for Bonds of such series, without
charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more
temporary Bonds (accompanied by any unmatured coupons appertaining thereto) the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Bonds of the same
series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged such temporary Bonds
shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as
definitive Bonds, and interest thereon, when and as payable, shall be paid to
the bearers of temporary Bonds upon presentation thereof for notation of such
payment thereon, unless such temporary Bonds shall be Registered Bonds or shall
bear coupons for such interest.

Anything in this Section 2.06 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Board
Resolution or supplemental indenture creating a series of Bonds may establish or
provide for establishing the requirements (which may vary from those set forth
in this Section 2.06 ) concerning the form of temporary Bonds and procedures for
exchanging them for definitive Bonds.

SECTION 2.07. Registration, Transfer and Exchange.

The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee a register (herein sometimes referred to as the "Bond Register") in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company
shall provide for the registration of Registered Bonds and of transfers of
Registered Bonds. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Bond Registrar" for the
purpose of registering Registered Bonds and transfers of Registered Bonds as
herein provided.
<PAGE> 37

27
Upon surrender for transfer of any Registered Bond of any series (except
any series of Global Bonds to the extent set forth in this Section) at the
office or agency of the Company in any Place of Payment for Registered Bonds of
such series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more
new Registered Bonds of the same series of any authorized denominations, of a
like aggregate principal amount.

At the option of the Holders, Registered Bonds may be exchanged for other
Registered Bonds of the same series of any authorized denominations, of a like
aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Registered Bonds to be
exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Registered Bonds are so
surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, the Registered Bonds which the Bondholder making the
exchange is entitled to receive.

Bearer Bonds and coupons appertaining thereto shall be transferable by
delivery.

At the option of the Holder, Bearer Bonds of any series (except any series
of Global Bonds to the extent set forth in this Section) may be exchanged for
Registered Bonds of the same series of any authorized denominations, of a like
aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Bearer Bonds to be exchanged
at any office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose with all
unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default appertaining thereto. If
the Holder of a Bearer Bond is unable to produce any such unmatured coupon or
coupons or matured coupon or coupons in default, such exchange may be effected
if the Bearer Bonds are accompanied by payment of funds acceptable to the
Company in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing coupon or coupons,
or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company
and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they
may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter
the Holder of such Bond shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing
coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder
shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; provided, however,
that, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.02 or in or pursuant to the
supplemental indenture or Board Resolution creating the series of Bonds to which
they relate, interest represented by coupons shall be payable only upon
presentation and surrender of those coupons at an office or agency
<PAGE> 38

28
located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a
Bearer Bond of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in
exchange for a Registered Bond of the same series after the close of business at
such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of
business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii)
any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or
agency on the related date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Bond
shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date
or such date for payment of Default Interest, as the case may be. Whenever any
Bearer Bonds are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Bonds which the Holder making the
exchange is entitled to receive.

All Bonds and coupons, if any, issued upon any transfer or exchange of
Bonds, and coupons, if any, shall be the valid obligations of the Company,
evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture, as the Bonds and coupons, if any, surrendered upon such transfer or
exchange.

Every Registered Bond presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange
shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Bond Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Bonds, but
the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or
exchange of Bonds, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.06 or 13.06 not
involving any transfer. The Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
therewith.

The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, transfer or exchange any
Bond of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days
before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Bonds of such series
selected for redemption under Section 8.04 and ending at the close of business
on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to transfer or exchange any Bond so selected
for redemption in whole or in part, or (iii) to exchange any Bearer Bond so
selected for redemption except that such a Bearer Bond may be exchanged for a
<PAGE> 39

29
Registered Bond of that series, provided that such Registered Bond shall be
immediately surrendered for redemption.

Registered Bonds may not be exchanged for Bearer Bonds.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 2.07, unless and until
it is exchanged in whole or in part for Bonds in definitive registered form, a
Global Bond representing all or a portion of the Bonds of a series may not be
transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of
such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any
such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such
successor Depositary.

If at any time the Depositary for any Bonds of a series represented by one
or more Global Bonds notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as Depositary for such Bonds, the Company shall appoint a successor
Depositary with respect to such Bonds. If a successor Depositary for such Bonds
is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such
notice, the Company's election pursuant to Section 2.03 that such Bonds be
represented by one or more Global Bonds shall no longer be effective and the
Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the
authentication and delivery of definitive Bonds of such series, will
authenticate and deliver, Bonds of such series in definitive registered form
without coupons, in any authorized denominations in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Bond or Bonds representing
such Bonds in exchange for such Global Bond or Bonds.

The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the
Bonds of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Bonds shall no
longer be represented by a Global Bond or Bonds. In such event the Company will
execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication
and delivery of the definitive Bonds of such series, will authenticate and
deliver, Bonds of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in
any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
principal amount of the Global Bond or Bonds representing such Bonds, in
exchange for such Global Bond or Bonds.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect
to the Global Bonds of any series or under any other circumstances specified by
the Company pursuant to Section 2.03 with respect to the Global Bonds of such
series the Depositary for such Global Bond may surrender such Global Bond in
<PAGE> 40

30
exchange in whole or in part for Bonds of the same series in definitive
registered form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such
Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, without service charge,

(i) to the Person specified by such Depositary a new Bond or Bonds of
the same series, of any authorized denominations as requested by such
Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such
Person's beneficial interest in the Global Bond; and

(ii) to such Depositary a new Global Bond in a denomination equal to
the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered
Global Bond and the aggregate principal amount of Bonds authenticated and
delivered pursuant to clause (i) above.

SECTION 2.08. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Bonds.

If (i) any mutilated Bond or a Bond with a mutilated coupon appertaining to
it is surrendered to the Trustee, or the Company and the Trustee receive
evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Bond or
coupon, and (ii) there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such security
or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in
the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Bond or coupon has
been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its
request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange therefor or in
lieu thereof or in exchange for the Bond to which a destroyed, lost or stolen
coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen),
a new Bond of like tenor and principal amount, bearing a number not
contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if
any, appertaining to the surrendered, destroyed, lost or stolen Bond or to the
Bond to which such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Bond or coupon has
become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may,
instead of issuing a new Bond or coupon, pay such Bond or coupon.

Upon the issuance of any new Bond under this Section, the Company may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected
therewith.
<PAGE> 41

31
Every new Bond with its coupons, if any, issued pursuant to this Section in
lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Bond or in exchange for a Bond to which a
destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed,
lost or stolen Bond with its coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen
coupon, shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all
the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all
other Bonds and coupons duly issued hereunder.

Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to a supplemental indenture or
Board Resolution creating a series of Bonds, any Bearer Bond issued under this
Section may only be delivered to the Person entitled thereto outside the United
States.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Bonds or coupons.

SECTION 2.09. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.

Interest on any Registered Bond of any series which is payable, and is
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for
Registered Bonds of such series shall be paid to the Person in whose name that
Bond (or one or more Predecessor Bonds) is registered at the close of business
on the Regular Record Date for such interest in respect of Registered Bonds of
such series. In case a Bearer Bond of any series is surrendered in exchange for
a Registered Bond of such series after the close of business (at an office or
agency maintained by the Company for such purpose for such series) on any
Regular Record Date and before the opening of business (at such office or
agency) on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, such Bearer Bond shall be
surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date and
interest will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the
Registered Bond issued in exchange for such Bearer Bond, but will be payable
only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of
this Indenture.

Any interest on any Registered Bond which is payable, but is not punctually
paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Bonds of such series
(herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such
<PAGE> 42

32
Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election
in each case, as provided in paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to
the Persons in whose names the Registered Bonds of the series in respect of
which interest is in default (or their respective Predecessor Bonds) are
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the
payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following
manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of
Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Registered Bond and the date
of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit
with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed
to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the
proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this
paragraph provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date
for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15
nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not
less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the
proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such
Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company,
shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and
the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid,
to each holder of a Registered Bond of such series at his address as it
appears in the Bond Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special
Record Date. The Trustee may, in its discretion, in the name and at the
expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least
once in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place of Payment for Registered
Bonds of such series, but such publication shall not be a condition
precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the
proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date
therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be
paid to the Persons in whose names the Registered Bonds of such series (or
their respective Predecessor Bonds) are registered on such Special Record
Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following paragraph
(2). In case a Bearer Bond of any series is surrendered at the office or
agency in a Place of Payment for such series in exchange for a Registered
<PAGE> 43

33
Bond of such series after the close of business at such office or agency
on any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such
office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted
Interest, such Bearer Bond shall be surrendered without the coupon
relating to such proposed date of payment and Defaulted Interest will not 
be payable on such proposed date of payment in respect of the Registered
Bond issued in exchange for such Bearer Bond, but will be payable only to
the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provision of
this Indenture.

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any
other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any
securities exchange on which the Bonds of the series in respect of which
interest is in default may be listed, and upon such notice as may be
required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the
Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this paragraph, such payment
shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

Any Defaulted Interest payable in respect of any Bearer Bond shall be
payable pursuant to such procedures as may be satisfactory to the Trustee in
such manner as may reasonably minimize any discrimination as between the Holders
of Registered Bonds and Bearer Bonds of the same series, and notice of the
payment date therefor shall be given by the Trustee, in the name and at the
expense of the Company, in the manner set forth in Section 1.06.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Bond delivered
under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other
Bond shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which
were carried by such other Bond.

SECTION 2.10. Persons Deemed Owners.

Prior to due presentment of a Registered Bond for transfer, the Company,
the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in
whose name any Registered Bond is registered as the owner of such Registered
Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any),
and (subject to Section 2.09) interest on, such Bond and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Bond be overdue, and neither the Company, the
Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice
to the contrary.
<PAGE> 44

34
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may
treat the bearer of any Bearer Bond and the bearer of any coupon as the absolute
owner of such Bond or coupon for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on
account thereof and for all other purposes, whether or not such Bond or coupon
be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, nor any such agent shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.

No holder of any beneficial interest in any Global Bond held on its behalf
by a Depositary shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such
Global Bond, and such Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee, and
any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the owner of such Global Bond for all
purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall impair,
as between a Depositary and such holders of beneficial interests, the operation
of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of the Depositary as
Holder of any Bond.

SECTION 2.11. Cancellation.

All Bonds and coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, transfer or
exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. The Company may at any time deliver
to the Trustee for cancellation any Bonds previously authenticated and delivered
hereunder, together with all unpaid coupons appertaining thereto which the
Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Bonds so delivered
shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Bonds shall be authenticated in
lieu of or in exchange for any Bonds cancelled as provided in this Section,
except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Bonds and coupons
held by the Trustee shall be destroyed or disposed of in accordance with the
Trustee's customary practices.

The Trustee shall be under no obligation to recompute, verify, reclassify
or recalculate any information supplied to it in any such Certificate.

If such Certificate is being delivered to the Trustee in connection with
the authentication and delivery of Bonds and the aggregate principal amount of
Bonds then being applied for plus the aggregate principal amount of Bonds
authenticated and delivered since the commencement of the then current calendar
year (other than Bonds with respect to which such a Certificate signed by an
Independent Accountant has been previously furnished) is 10% or more of the
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding, the Accountant
signing such Certificate shall be an Independent Accountant; provided, however,
that such Certificate need not be signed by an Independent Accountant as to
dates or periods not covered by annual reports required to be filed by the
Company, in the case of any matter which depends upon a state of facts as of a
date or dates or for a period or periods different from that required to be
covered by such annual reports.

The Company may include in any Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral
any cash, Permitted Investments or Eligible Mortgage Notes without also
including any other cash, Permitted Investments or Eligible Mortgage Notes on
deposit with the Trustee, and by so doing it shall not lose the right later to
file a further Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral including such other
cash, Permitted Investments or Eligible Mortgage Notes.
<PAGE> 52

42
(3) A certificate of an Appraiser, dated not more than 30 days prior
to such authentication and delivery, as to the aggregate fair value to the
Company as of the date of such Certificate of the Permitted Investments and
Eligible Mortgage Notes made the basis for such authentication and delivery
of Bonds (namely, those designated as such on Schedule A and/or Schedule B
to the Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral provided for in the
foregoing paragraph (2)). If the aggregate fair value to the Company of
such Permitted Investments and Eligible Mortgage Notes and of all other
Permitted Investments and Eligible Mortgage Notes deposited with the
Trustee since the commencement of the then current calendar year and made
the basis of the authentication and delivery of Bonds, withdrawal of cash
or the release of property or securities is 10% or more of the aggregate
principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding, such certificate shall be made
by an Independent Appraiser and, in case the certificate is being made in
connection with the authentication and delivery of Bonds, shall also cover
the aggregate fair value to the Company of all other securities deposited
with the Trustee since the commencement of the then current calendar year
as to which a certificate of an Independent Appraiser shall not previously
have been furnished; but the certificate provided for in this paragraph
need not be made by an Independent Appraiser if the aggregate fair value to
the Company of the Permitted Investments and Eligible Mortgage Notes as set
forth in such certificate of an Appraiser is less than $25,000 or less than
1% of the aggregate principal amount of Bonds at the time Outstanding.
However, notwithstanding that such certificate of an Appraiser or
Independent Appraiser, as the case may be, may show that the aggregate fair
value to the Company of such Permitted Investments and Eligible Mortgage
Notes is less than the Allowable Amount thereof, subject to Section 10.01
the Trustee shall nevertheless authenticate and deliver Bonds so long as
the Allowable Amount of Eligible Collateral thereof exceeds the principal
amount of Bonds Outstanding.

(4) An Opinion of Counsel for the Company dated the date of the
authentication and delivery of said Bonds and complying with Section 1.02
substantially to the effect that:

(i) the instruments which have been or are therewith delivered to
the Trustee conform to the requirements of this Indenture, and all
conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture (including any
<PAGE> 53

43
covenants compliance with which constitutes a condition precedent)
which relate to the authentication and delivery of the Bonds applied 
for have been complied with;

(ii) the certificate or other evidence specified therein, if any,
will be sufficient to show or provide for the compliance with the
requirements, if any, of any mortgage recording tax law or other tax
law applicable to the issuance of the Bonds then applied for;

(iii) the certificate or other evidence specified therein, if
any, will be sufficient to show the authorization, approval or consent
of or to the issuance by the Company of the Bonds then applied for, by
any Federal, State or other governmental regulatory agency at the time
having jurisdiction in the premises;

(iv) the Company is duly authorized by law and by the terms of
this Indenture to issue such Bonds, and the execution, authentication
and delivery of such Bonds have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action on the part of the Company;

(v) such Bonds, when executed by the Company, authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee and issued, will constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with
their terms and the terms of this Indenture, subject to such matters
as shall be specified therein, and will be entitled to the benefits of
this Indenture;

(vi) each Loan Agreement (if any), pursuant to which a Mortgage
Note included in item 5 of the Certificate of Available Eligible
Collateral furnished pursuant to the foregoing paragraph (2) was
issued, has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company;

(vii) each Mortgage Note and Permitted Investment included in
item 5 of said Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral has been
duly endorsed or assigned to the Trustee;

(viii) each Mortgage securing a Mortgage Note included in item 5
of said Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral complies as
<PAGE> 54

44
to form with the requirements of this Indenture and the interest
of the Company therein (if any) has been duly assigned to the
Trustee;

(ix) a financing statement with respect to said Mortgage Notes
and the proceeds of said Mortgage Notes has been properly filed so as
to make effective the lien or pledge intended to be created thereby or
thereon or stating that no such financing statement is required to be
filed, and stating that a financing statement with respect to the
assignment of such interest as the Company has in said Mortgages has
been properly filed in the jurisdictions where the Company keeps its
records and in which its principal place of business is located (but
such opinion need not state the legal effect of such latter filing);

(x) the certificate or other evidence specified therein, if any,
will be sufficient to show the authorization, approval or consent of
or to the pledge and assignment of said Mortgage Notes and of such
interest as the Company has in said Mortgages to the Trustee by any
Federal, State or other governmental regulatory agency at the time
having jurisdiction in the premises; and

(xi) the creation, execution, delivery and issuance of the Bonds,
the endorsement or assignment to the Trustee of the Mortgage Notes,
Permitted Investments and interest in Mortgages referred to above and
the execution and delivery of the supplemental indenture, if any,
hereinafter referred to in paragraph (8) of this Subsection, will not
violate any provision of the charter or by-laws of the Company or, to
the knowledge of such counsel, result in the breach of, or constitute
a default under, any agreement, indenture or other instrument to which
the Company is a party or by which it is bound.

In the event that any Mortgage Note included in item 5 of the
Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral was originally payable to a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, said Opinion of Counsel shall
state, in lieu of what is required by clause (vi) with reference to such
Mortgage Note, that the Loan Agreement (if any) pursuant to which such
Mortgage Note was issued has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by such wholly-owned subsidiary and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of such wholly-owned subsidiary, and that the interest of such
wholly-owned subsidiary in such Loan Agreement, such Mortgage
<PAGE> 55

45
Note and the Mortgage securing such Mortgage Note has been duly endorsed
or assigned to the Company free and clear of all liens, charges and
encumbrances. In addition, the statements required by clauses (ix) and
(xi) shall include appropriate references to such wholly-owned subsidiary
as well as to the Company.

(5) An Opinion or Opinions of Counsel (or a true copy or copies
thereof, certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Company) for each Member a Mortgage Note of which is included in item 5 of
said Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral, addressed to the
Company, stating in substance that as of the date of such Opinion,

(i) such Member is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has
full corporate power to execute and deliver such Mortgage Note, the
Loan Agreement pursuant to which it was issued (if any) and the
Mortgage securing the same, to perform all acts required to be done by
it under such Mortgage Note, Loan Agreement (if any) and Mortgage and
to own, operate and maintain its properties and operate its business
as conducted at the date of such opinion;

(ii) to the extent reasonably required for the maintenance and
operation of its properties and business taken as a whole, such Member
has complied with all requirements of the laws of all States in which
it operates or does business and holds all certificates, licenses,
consents or approvals of governmental authorities required to be
obtained on or prior to the date of such Opinion to enable it to
engage in the business then transacted by it;

(iii) such Mortgage Note, Loan Agreement (if any) and Mortgage
have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by said Member and
constitute the valid and binding obligations of such Member,
enforceable against such Member in accordance with their respective
terms;

(iv) the execution and performance by such Member of such
Mortgage Note, Loan Agreement (if any) and Mortgage, and the
transactions contemplated thereby, will not violate any provisions of
law, the Articles of Incorporation or by-laws of such Member, or
result in the breach of, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
<PAGE> 56

46
indenture or other instrument to which such Member is a party, or by 
which it may be bound, known to such Counsel;

(v) no authorization from any regulatory body is required in
connection with the execution and delivery of such Mortgage Note, Loan
Agreement (if any) or Mortgage or that each such authorization so
required has been obtained; and

(vi) such Counsel knows of no litigation pending or threatened
against or affecting such Member or its property which, in the opinion
of such Counsel (or in the opinion of such Member as evidenced by a
certificate of the manager or other responsible officer of such Member
annexed to said Opinion), would have a material adverse effect upon
the business, operations or financial condition of such Member.

In giving the Opinions of Counsel specified in paragraphs (4), (5) and
(8), (i) such Counsel may rely as to matters governed by the law of any
particular jurisdiction upon opinions of counsel in any such jurisdiction
upon whom they believe they and the Trustee are justified in relying, and,
in such event, they shall deliver copies of such opinions to the Trustee,
(ii) such Counsel may include in any such Opinions customary
qualifications, including without limitation qualifications to the effect
that (x) any sale or transfer by the Trustee of any of the Pledged Property
(other than a transfer into the name of the Trustee or a nominee thereof)
may be subject to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, other
applicable securities laws and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (y)
the enforceability of certain of the remedies under the Indenture are
subject to equitable requirements of good faith which may render
ineffective any consent by the Company to the sale of Pledged Property at
private sale, and (iii) insofar as any such Opinion relates to the
enforceability of any agreement or instrument, such Counsel may state that
the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or
other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights and that the enforceability thereof may be limited by
laws with respect to or affecting the remedies provided for in said
agreement or instrument (provided that such laws do not in the opinion of
such Counsel make inadequate the remedies afforded thereby for the
realization of the benefits provided for in such agreement or instrument).

ARTICLE FOUR

PROVISIONS AS TO PLEDGED PROPERTY

SECTION 4.01. Holding of Pledged Securities.

All Mortgage Notes, shares of stock and other securities pledged with the
Trustee as part of the Pledged Property pursuant to any provision of this
Indenture shall be endorsed in blank for transfer or be accompanied by proper
instruments of assignment satisfactory to the Trustee, duly executed by any
holder thereof other than the Trustee, unless and until an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the Trustee may (to the
extent a register is maintained therefor) cause the same to be registered in its
name, as Trustee, or in the name of its nominee; provided that all such
securities that may be held in book entry form only shall be at all times held
in the name of the Trustee, as such, or its nominee. The Company will delivery
promptly to the Trustee all such documents, certificates and opinions as are
specified in any instruments delivering, assigning or pledging securities to the
Trustee as part of the Pledged Property, in connection with subjection of any
securities to the lien of this Indenture to the extent contemplated hereby.

So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Trustee shall take all actions specified in a Company Request for the purposes
of maintaining, preserving, renewing or extending the existence of any
corporation the stock of which may be Pledged Property, and, for any such
purposes, from time to time, may sell, assign or transfer and deliver so many
shares of the stock of any such corporation as may be necessary to qualify
persons to act as directors of, or in any other official relation to, any such
corporation.

SECTION 4.02. Disposition of Payments on Pledged Property.

Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Company shall be entitled to receive all principal (premium, if any) and
interest paid in respect of any Mortgage Note and other indebtedness which may
be part of the Pledged Property; and the Company shall also be entitled to
receive dividends (except dividends payable in shares of stock of the issuing
corporation) out of earnings, income or earned surplus on all shares of stock
which may be part of the Pledged Property, and from time to time upon Company
Request the Trustee shall deliver to the Company any coupons for such interest
then in its possession in order that the Company may receive
<PAGE> 62

52
payment thereof or may cause the same to be cancelled; and on like Company
Request the Trustee shall deliver to the Company suitable orders in favor of the
Company, or its nominee, for the payment of such principal (premium, if any) and
interest and of such dividends, and the Company may collect such coupons,
principal (premium, if any) and interest and dividends and the Trustee shall
upon Company Request pay over to the Company any such principal (premium, if
any) and interest and dividends which may be collected or be received by the
Trustee; provided, however, that except as in this Indenture otherwise expressly
provided:

(1) the Company shall not be entitled to collect any stock dividends
that may be declared on any shares of capital stock that may be part of the
Pledged Property, and in case stock dividends are so declared the
certificates therefor shall be endorsed for transfer and delivered to the
Trustee; and

(2) the Company shall not be entitled to collect any dividends on or
other distributions in respect of any stock which is at any time part of
the Pledged Property which shall in any way be chargeable to or payable out
of the capital (including any paid-in or capital surplus or equity of
members or patrons of Members) of the corporation issuing the same.

Subject to the provisions of Section 10.01 hereof, until a Responsible
Officer shall have actual notice to the contrary the Trustee shall be entitled
to assume that any such dividend (except a dividend payable in shares of the
issuing company) is payable out of earnings, income or earned surplus.

In case any corporation whose shares of stock are part of the Pledged
Property shall issue to the holders of such shares rights to purchase any
securities or other property, the Company shall be entitled to receive and
exercise such rights or sell such rights for cash as in its discretion it shall
determine.

In case default shall be made in the payment of the principal of or
interest on any part of the Pledged Property, or in the due performance of any
covenant contained in any obligation or instrument evidencing or securing the
same, or pursuant to which it is issued, then and in any such case (without
prejudice, however, to any right to claim a default under this Indenture or to
assert any right consequent upon such default and without prejudice to any right
of the Trustee, to exercise any rights to which it may be entitled as such
holder), the Trustee, upon Company Request, shall, subject to Section 10.01,
cause, or join
<PAGE> 63

53
with other owners of like obligations and as specified therein to cause,
proceedings to be instituted and prosecuted to enforce such payment or
performance.

In case any payment or other distribution shall be received by the Company
or the Trustee on account of any part of the Pledged Property, which the Company
is not entitled to receive under the provisions of this Article, or after an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then, in any such case,
any such payment or other distribution shall be delivered to the Trustee (if not
received by it) and held by the Trustee as part of the Pledged Property. For all
purposes of this Article Four, the Trustee shall have no obligation to take any
action with respect to any Event of Default until a Responsible Officer has
actual notice of such Event of Default and the Trustee shall have no liability
for any action or inaction taken, suffered or omitted in respect of any Event of
Default by it prior to such time as a Responsible Officer has actual notice of
such Event of Default or its continuance.

SECTION 4.03. Voting; Consents.

Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Company shall have the right to vote or give consents or waivers, for all
purposes not contrary to Section 7.12 or any other covenants herein contained or
otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, upon and in
respect of all shares of stock and other securities which are part of the
Pledged Property or in respect of any instrument evidencing or securing the
same, or pursuant to which it is issued (and with the same force and effect as
if such shares or other securities were not part of the Pledged Property), and
from time to time, upon Company Request, the Trustee forthwith shall make and
deliver, or shall cause to be made and delivered to the Company or to its
nominees, such powers of attorney or proxies to vote any shares of stock or
other securities which have been transferred into the name of the Trustee or its
nominee, or to give consent or waiver in respect thereof, as shall be specified
in such Company Request. It is hereby understood that the Trustee is not
included within the definition of "mortgagee" in any Mortgage and that, so long
as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee shall
have no duties or responsibilities with regard to any Mortgage which is part of
the Pledged Property or the value of the property subject thereto, except as
specifically provided herein, and it shall not be necessary to obtain any
consent from the Trustee with regard to any
<PAGE> 64

54
action taken pursuant to any Mortgage or any action omitted to be taken
thereunder, in either case by any party thereto. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company, unless and until any Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, shall have the right to consent to the sale or other
transfer of any property of the mortgagor under any Mortgage and to execute any
release of such property, and the Trustee shall execute any release or consent
requested by Company Request to confirm any action taken by the Company pursuant
to this Section. In executing any such power of attorney, proxy, release or
consent, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely upon an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that the Company was
authorized by this Indenture to take the action taken by it and that the
execution of such power of attorney, proxy, release or consent is authorized or
permitted hereunder.

The Company covenants that it will not vote any such shares of stock or
other securities or give consents or waivers with respect to any such
instrument, under any power of attorney or proxy executed and delivered to it
under the provisions of this Section for any purpose contrary to or inconsistent
with the provisions or purposes of this Indenture.

SECTION 4.04. Certain Actions in Case of Judicial Proceedings.

The Trustee, upon Company Request and as specified therein, shall join in
any plan of reorganization in respect of any part of the Pledged Property and
may accept new securities, including in that term stock, issued in exchange
therefor under such plan.

In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Trustee shall be entitled to take such steps without the request or consent of
the Company.

In case all or any part of the property of any Person, all or part of whose
outstanding stock, Mortgage Notes, bonds, indebtedness or obligations are part
of the Pledged Property, shall be sold at any judicial or other involuntary sale
and the Trustee shall receive any portion of the proceeds of such sale accruing
on the securities held as part of the Pledged Property (subject, however, to the
pledge thereof under any mortgage or other instrument prior in lien to this
Indenture if required by the terms of such mortgage or other instrument), and
such proceeds shall be held as part of the Pledged Property.
<PAGE> 65

SECTION 4.05. Renewal; Extension; Substitution

Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Company may at any time renew or extend, subject to the continuing lien of
this Indenture, any Mortgage Notes, bonds, obligations or indebtedness forming
part of the Pledged Property upon any terms or may accept in place of and in
substitution for any such Mortgage Notes, bonds, obligations or indebtedness,
other Mortgage Notes, bonds, obligations or indebtedness of the same issuer or
of any successor thereto for at least the same unpaid principal amounts and at
any rate of interest, and, in case of Mortgage Notes, secured by a Mortgage
covering substantially the same property and having substantially the same
terms, all as evidenced by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee;
provided, however, that in case of any substitution, Mortgage Notes, bonds,
obligations or indebtedness substituted as aforesaid shall be subject to the
lien of this Indenture as part of the Pledged Property and be held in the same
manner as those for which they shall be substituted and in the case of each
substituted Mortgage Note the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Opinion or
Opinions of Counsel (or a true copy or copies thereof, certified by the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company) complying with paragraphs
(vii), (viii), (ix) and (x) of Section 3.01(b)(4) and paragraphs (iii), (iv) and
(v) of Section 3.01(b)(5) omitting any statements concerning the Mortgage
securing such Mortgage Note if the Mortgage Note substituted for was secured by
the same Mortgage which shall not have been amended or supplemented since the
pledge of the Mortgage Note substituted for, provided that the Opinion of
Counsel complying with said paragraphs Section 3.01(b)(5) shall state that no
amendment or supplement to said Mortgage or any additional recording or filing
thereof is required in order to cause said substituted Mortgage Note to be
secured by said Mortgage to the same extent as the Mortgage Note substituted
for.

So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Trustee, upon Company Request stating that no such Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, shall execute such consent to any such renewal,
extension or substitution as shall be specified in such Company Request and in
doing so the Trustee is entitled to receive and rely upon an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the execution of such
consent is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
<PAGE> 66

SECTION 4.06. Certain Rights in Respect of Stock.

Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Company shall have the right to vote or give consent, in respect of all or
any part of the shares of stock of any corporation at the time forming part of
the Pledged Property and having a par value, to the change thereof into shares
having a higher or lower par value per share, or into shares having no par
value, or shares having no par value into shares having a par value, and may
consent at any time that the shares of stock of any corporation at the time
forming part of the Pledged Property may be classified or reclassified in any
manner permitted by law; provided, however, that all of such stock forming part
of the Pledged Property shall be and remain fully paid and all new shares
substituted shall be subject to the lien of this Indenture as part of the
Pledged Property and be held in the same manner as those for which they were
substituted.

Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Company shall have the right to vote and give consent or waiver in respect
of the increase or reduction of the capital stock or the dissolution of any
corporation, shares of the stock of which form part of the Pledged Property, if
the Board of Directors determines (as evidenced by a Board Resolution) that such
increase or reduction or dissolution is desirable and not detrimental to the
interest of the Bondholders, subject to the provisions of Section 4.02 hereof
with respect to dividends in such cases being paid to the Trustee.

SECTION 4.07. Consolidation, Merger, etc., of Issuing Corporations.

Nothing contained in this Indenture shall prevent or restrict:

(1) any corporation all or any part of whose capital stock or other
securities may be part of the Pledged Property from consolidating with or
merging into, or conveying in any manner all or any part of its assets to
any other corporation, whether or not affiliated with such other
corporation, provided that any capital stock of such other corporation
which is issued for or in lieu of stock which is part of the Pledged
Property shall become part of the Pledged Property and any such other
securities shall continue to be part of the Pledged Property;

(2) any corporation, all or any part of whose capital stock or other
securities may be part of the Pledged Property, from merging into itself,
or taking a conveyance of, all or any part of the property of any other
corporation, whether or not affiliated with such other corporation,
provided
<PAGE> 67

57
that capital or other securities shall continue to be part of the
Pledged Property; or

(3) any corporation, all or any part of whose capital stock or other
securities may be part of the Pledged Property, whether or not affiliated
with the Company, from consolidating with or merging into, or conveying in
any manner all or any part of its assets to, the Company, subject, however,
to the provisions of Article Twelve;

provided, however, that in each such case if such corporation has issued a
Mortgage Note which is part of the Pledged Property, the terms of such merger,
consolidation or conveyance shall comply with the requirements of the Mortgage
securing said Mortgage Note.

SECTION 4.08. Certain Voting and Other Powers of the Trustee.

The Trustee shall vote or permit to be voted any shares of stock forming
part of the Pledged Property and take other actions to effect the purposes of
Sections 4.06 and 4.07; and, in connection with any transaction authorized
thereby, the Trustee shall make or permit any necessary exchange, cancellation,
substitution or surrender of bonds, obligations, indebtedness or stocks, or
shall transfer, in whole or in part, into the name of the Company or, of the
nominee or nominees of the Company, any shares of any corporation about to be
merged or consolidated. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, such action shall be taken only upon Company Request.

In connection with any such exchange, cancellation, substitution, surrender
or release of bonds, obligations, indebtedness or stocks, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4.06 or 4.07, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and
rely upon an Officers' Certificate as to any matters pertinent to any action
taken or contemplated in connection therewith and also an Opinion of Counsel as
to the legality and validity of any such action and to the effect that such
action is authorized or permitted hereunder.

SECTION 4.09. Rights of Trustee and Company After Event of Default.

Whenever in this Article it is provided that any right in respect of any
part of the Pledged Property or in any obligation evidencing or securing the
same or pursuant to which it is issued may be exercised by the Company only
until an Event of Default or other default shall have occurred and be
continuing, such right, nevertheless, shall be exercised by the Company for the
benefit of the
<PAGE> 68

58
Bondholders in case such an Event of Default or other default shall have
occurred and be continuing, except to the extent, if any, that the Trustee shall
in writing to the Company limit such exercise.

ARTICLE FIVE

APPLICATION OF MONEYS INCLUDED IN PLEDGED PROPERTY;
PERMITTED INVESTMENTS

SECTION 5.01. Cash Held by Trustee Treated as a Deposit.

Any and all cash held by the Trustee under any provision of this Indenture
may be treated by the Trustee, until required to be paid out pursuant hereto, as
a deposit, in trust, without any liability for interest. Nevertheless, at the
election of the Company evidenced by a Company Request, any and all such money,
in whole or in part, shall, from time to time (unless an Event of Default shall
have occurred and shall be continuing), be deposited by the Trustee, in its
corporate name as Trustee, with such other depositary or depositaries as shall
be designated pursuant to such Company Request, to be held at all times subject
to withdrawal by the Trustee when required for the purposes of this Indenture or
when requested by a Company Request. Every such depositary shall be a bank or
trust company within the continental United States and having a capital and
surplus aggregating at least $100,000,000 (determined from its most recent
report of condition, if it publishes such reports at least annually pursuant to
law or the requirements of Federal or State examining or supervisory authority).
All sums deposited with any such depositary shall nevertheless for all purposes
of this Indenture be deemed to be held by and deposited with the Trustee. The
Trustee shall have no liability for the loss of any sums so deposited with any
such depositary, but the Company shall be obligated to promptly make up any such
loss. Such depositary shall not be under any obligation to see to the
application of any sums withdrawn from it or to inquire into the authority of
the Trustee to make any such withdrawal.

SECTION 5.02. Use of Moneys for Payment, Redemption or Purchase of Bonds.

Subject to the provisions of Section 5.04, any moneys held by the Trustee
as part of the Pledged Property (other than moneys at the time held for any
payment on particular Bonds) shall, upon Company Request from time to time,
<PAGE> 69

59
such request to be accompanied by an Officer's Certificate stating that the
Allowable Amount of Eligible Collateral on deposit with the Trustee will exceed
the principal amount of Bonds Outstanding after giving effect to the action
requested,

(1) be applied by the Trustee to the redemption of Bonds then
Outstanding of any one or more series specified in such Company Request,
including the redemption of any Bonds for any sinking or analogous fund
established for Bonds of any series, or to the payment of any Bonds at
Maturity; or

(2) be applied by the Trustee to the purchase of Bonds then
Outstanding of any one or more series specified in such Company Request,
upon tender or in the open market or at a private sale or upon any
securities exchange or in any one or more of said ways specified in such
Company Request; provided, however, that no Bond shall be purchased at a
price (excluding brokerage fees) exceeding the lower of the principal
amount thereof and accrued interest thereon or the maximum price (excluding
brokerage fees) stated in such Company Request.

Whenever the Trustee shall purchase Bonds under the foregoing paragraph
(2), the Company shall promptly reimburse the Trustee for all brokerage fees and
all interest on such Bonds to the date of purchase, and any moneys so reimbursed
shall thereafter be held as part of the Pledged Property.

SECTION 5.03. Investment of Moneys by Trustee.

Any moneys held by the Trustee as part of the Pledged Property (other than
moneys held for the payment of principal of or premium (if any) or interest on
particular Bonds at Maturity except as specifically provided herein) shall, upon
Company Request and as stated therein, be invested or reinvested by the Trustee
until required to be paid out by the Trustee as provided in this Indenture, in
any one or more of the following (herein called "Permitted Investments"):

(1) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
any agency thereof for which the full faith and credit of the obligor shall
be pledged and which shall mature (except in the case of obligations
guaranteed by REA) not more than 2 years after the purchase thereof;
<PAGE> 70

60
(2) obligations of any state or municipality, or subdivision or agency
of either thereof, which shall mature not more than 2 years after the
purchase thereof and are rated AA (or equivalent) or better by at least two
nationally recognized statistical rating organizations or having a
comparable rating in the event of any future change in the rating system of
such agencies;

(3) certificates of deposit issued by, or time deposits of, any bank
or trust company (including the Trustee) organized under the laws of the
United States of America or any State thereof having capital and surplus of
not less than $500,000,000 (determined from its most recent report of
condition, if it publishes such reports at least annually pursuant to law
or the requirements of Federal or State examining or supervisory authority)
and maturing not more than 2 years after the purchase thereof; and

(4) commercial paper of bank holding companies or of other issuers
(excluding the Company) generally rated in the highest category by at least
two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and maturing not
more than one year after the purchase thereof.

Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any interest
received by the Trustee on any such investments which shall exceed the amount of
accrued interest, if any, paid by the Trustee on the purchase thereof, and any
profit which may be realized from any sale, redemption or maturity of such
investments, shall be paid to the Company. Such investments shall be held by the
Trustee as a part of the Pledged Property, but upon Company Request the Trustee
shall sell all or any designated part of the same, and the proceeds of such sale
shall be held by the Trustee subject to the same provisions hereof as the cash
used by it to purchase the investments so sold. In case the net proceeds
realized upon any sale, redemption or maturity shall amount to less than the
purchase price paid by the Trustee in the purchase of the investments so sold,
the Trustee shall notify the Company in writing thereof, and the Company shall
pay to the Trustee the amount of the difference between such purchase price and
the amount so realized, and the amount so paid shall be held by the Trustee in
like manner and subject to the same conditions as the proceeds realized upon
such sale. The Company will reimburse the Trustee for any brokerage commissions
or other expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with the purchase or
sale of such investments. The Trustee may aggregate such costs and expenses of
and such receipts from such investments on a monthly basis (or such other
periodic
<PAGE> 71

61
basis as the Company and the Trustee may agree in writing from time to time) so
as to net each against the other during such period and pay to the Company
amounts due to it or notify the Company of amounts due from it on a net basis
for such period.

The Company may at any time deposit with the Trustee Permitted Investments
to be held by the Trustee as part of the Pledged Property, provided that no such
Permitted Investment shall be subject to any reservation, limitation or
condition referred to in granting clause second.

SECTION 5.04. Trustee to Retain Moneys if Event of Default Exists.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing to the actual
knowledge of a Responsible Officer, moneys held by the Trustee as a part of the
Pledged Property shall not be paid over to the Company or upon Company Request
except pursuant to Section 9.13.

ARTICLE SIX

WITHDRAWAL OF COLLATERAL

SECTION 6.01. Withdrawal of Collateral.

(a) Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, any part of the Pledged Property may be withdrawn by the Company and
shall be delivered by the Trustee upon Company Order at any time and from time
to time, whenever the Allowable Amount of Eligible Collateral remaining after
such withdrawal shall at least equal the aggregate principal amount of Bonds to
be Outstanding after such withdrawal, as shown by the Certificate of Available
Eligible Collateral furnished to the Trustee pursuant to Subsection (b)(1) of
this Section.

(b) Prior to any such withdrawal the Trustee shall be furnished with the
following instruments:

(1) a Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral, dated not more
than 30 days prior to such withdrawal, showing that immediately after such
withdrawal the requirements of Subsection (a) of this Section and
Subsections (a)(2) and (3) of Section 3.01 will be satisfied;
<PAGE> 72

62
(2) a certificate of an Appraiser (or Independent Appraiser), dated
not more than 30 days prior to such withdrawal, as specified in Subsection
(b)(3) of Section 3.01, as to the aggregate fair value to the Company as of
the date of such certificate of the Permitted Investments and Eligible
Mortgage Notes made the basis for such withdrawal (namely, those designated
as such on Schedule A and/or Schedule B to the Certificate of Available
Eligible Collateral provided for in the foregoing paragraph (1)) (although
notwithstanding that such Certificate may show that the aggregate fair
value to the Company of such Permitted Investments and Eligible Mortgage
Notes is less than the Allowable Amount thereof, subject to Section 10.01,
the Trustee shall nevertheless permit such withdrawal if the Allowable
Amount of remaining Eligible Collateral will exceed the amount of Bonds
Outstanding after such withdrawal);

(3) an Opinion of Counsel as specified in Subsection (b)(4) of Section
3.01, dated not more than 30 days prior to such withdrawal, omitting
therefrom the statements required by clauses (i) through (v) of said
Subsection (b)(4) but stating that all conditions precedent provided for in
this Indenture (including any covenants, compliance with which constitutes
a condition precedent) which relate to such withdrawal and to the Trustee's
execution and delivery of any instruments of transfer and assignment in
connection therewith have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion or Opinions of Counsel (or a true copy or copies
thereof, certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Company) for each Member a Mortgage Note of whom is included in item 5 of
said Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral (or a confirmation of an
Opinion previously given), complying with the provisions of Subsection
(b)(5) of Section 3.01;

(5) an Officers' Certificate, dated not more than 10 days prior to
such withdrawal, complying with the provisions of Subsection (b)(6) of
Section 3.01 and certifying that so far as is known to the signers no Event
of Default has occurred which has not been remedied; and

(6) the instruments and certificates and other evidence specified in
Subsection (b)(7) of Section 3.01 (to the extent applicable).
<PAGE> 73

63
Upon any such withdrawal, the Trustee shall execute any instruments of
transfer or assignment specified in a Company Request as necessary to vest in
the Company any part of the Pledged Property withdrawn.

Prior to such delivery by the Trustee, the Trustee shall be furnished with
the certificate of an Appraiser as to the fair value of any part of the Pledged
Property to be withdrawn, which certificate shall state that in the opinion of
such Appraiser the proposed withdrawal will not impair the security under this
Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof. Such certificate shall be
made by an Independent Appraiser if the fair value of such part of the Pledged
Property and of all other Pledged Property released since the commencement of
the then current calendar year, as set forth in the certificates required by
this Section, is 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at
the time outstanding; but such a certificate of an Independent Appraiser shall
not be required in the case of any withdrawal of any part of the Pledged
Property if the fair value thereof as set forth in the certificate required by
this Section is less than $25,000 or less than 1% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Bonds at the time outstanding. However, notwithstanding that such
certificate of an Appraiser or Independent Appraiser, as the case may be, may
show that the fair value of such Permitted Investments, Mortgage Notes or other
securities is more than the Allowable Amount thereof, subject to Section 10.01
the Trustee shall nevertheless permit such withdrawal if the Allowable Amount of
Eligible Collateral remaining after such withdrawal will exceed the amount of
Bonds Outstanding.

In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Company shall not withdraw any part of the Pledged Property except that,
notwithstanding Section 4.05, any Mortgage Notes (and the Mortgages securing
such Mortgage Notes) may be withdrawn upon the deposit with the Trustee of an
Allowable Amount of cash and/or Permitted Investments at least equal to the
Allowable Amount (at the time of such withdrawal) of the Mortgage Notes so
withdrawn and the delivery to the Trustee of the instruments referred to in
Subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this Section and a Company Request. The Trustee
shall have no liability in respect of any withdrawal made when an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing unless a Responsible Officer has
actual notice of such Event of Default and its continuance.
<PAGE> 74

64
SECTION 6.02. Reassignment of Mortgage Notes upon Payment.

Upon receipt of

(1) an Officers' Certificate stating that all payments of principal,
premium (if any) and interest have been made upon any Mortgage Note held by
the Trustee other than payment of an amount (if any) specified in said
certificate required fully to discharge all obligations on said Mortgage
Note, and

(2) cash in the amount (if any) so specified fully to discharge said
Mortgage Note,

the Trustee shall deliver to the Company upon Company Request said Mortgage
Note, together with the Mortgage securing such Mortgage Note and any instrument
of transfer or assignment necessary to reassign to the Company said Mortgage
Note and the interest of the Company in the Mortgage specified in such Company
Request.

The Company will duly and punctually pay the principal of (and premium, if

presented and surrendered for payment.
<PAGE> 75

65
The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location,

notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee its agent to receive all
such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

SECTION 7.03. Money for Bond Payments to be Held in Trust.

If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent for any series
of Bonds and any coupons appertaining thereto, it will, on or before each due
date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on, any of the Bonds
of such series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or
interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or
otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee
in writing of its action or failure so to act.

All moneys deposited with the Trustee or with any Paying Agent for the
purpose of paying the principal of or premium or interest on Bonds shall be
deposited and held in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled to such
principal, premium or interest, subject to the provisions of this Section.
Moneys so deposited and held in trust shall not be part of the Pledged Property
but shall constitute a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders
entitled to such principal, premium or interest.

The Company will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute
and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree
with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying
Agent will

(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of principal of (and
premium, if any) or interest on Bonds in trust for the benefit of the
Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or
otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any
other obligor upon the Bonds or coupons) in the making of any such payment
of principal (and premium, if any) or interest; and
<PAGE> 76

66
(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the
written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so
held in trust by such Paying Agent.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction
and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or direct any
paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or
such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as
those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and,
upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be
released from all further liability with respect to such money.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by
the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any)
or interest on any Bond and remaining unclaimed for two years after such
principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be
paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall
be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Bond or relevant coupon
shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for
payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with
respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee
thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such
Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the
expense of the Company cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper in
each Place of Payment of such Bond, notice that such money remains unclaimed and
that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from
the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining
will be repaid to the Company.

SECTION 7.04. Maintenance of Corporate Existence.

Subject to the provisions of Article Twelve, the Company, at its own cost
and expense, will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and
keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, rights and franchises,
except as otherwise specifically permitted in this Indenture; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required to preserve any right or franchise if the
Board of Directors shall determine (as evidenced by a Board Resolution) that the
preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of
the
<PAGE> 77

67
Company and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect
to the Holders of Bonds or any coupons.

SECTION 7.05. Maintenance of Books of Record and Account; Financial
Statements of Company and Members.

The Company will keep proper books of record and account in which full and
correct entries will be made of its transactions in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

The Company will deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the
expiration of each fiscal year of the Company, an operating statement for such
fiscal year and a balance sheet of the Company as of the last day of such fiscal
year. Such operating statements and balance sheets shall set forth in reasonable
detail the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company and
shall be accompanied by the report of the Independent Accountants who have
audited the books of the Company for such fiscal year.

The Company will cause to be furnished to it, within 120 days after the
expiration of each calendar year, similar financial statements of each such
Member whose Mortgage Notes are then pledged hereunder, which shall be prepared
in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by REA for such
year (unless such Member is not required to maintain its accounts in accordance
with such Uniform System of Accounts), together with the latest similar
financial statements of such Member which have been audited (if not previously
furnished) by the Independent Accountants who have audited said statements. The
Company will also cause each such Member to furnish to it any additional
financial information as may be required at any time to enable a computation to
be made of the Equity Ratio and the Average Coverage Ratio of such Member,
accompanied by a certificate of an Accountant as to the correctness of such
financial information.

SECTION 7.06. Warranty of Title and Authority to Pledge.

The Company warrants that, at the date of the subjection to the lien
hereof, it owns and is possessed of all the Pledged Property pledged by it
hereunder free and clear of all mortgages, pledges, liens, charges and
encumbrances, except the lien of this Indenture and any liens referred to in the
second granting clause hereof, and that it has full power and lawful authority
to pledge, assign, transfer and deliver such Pledged Property in the manner and
form aforesaid or to cause
<PAGE> 78

68
such Pledged Property so to be pledged, assigned, transferred and delivered. Any
Mortgage Note pledged hereunder will, at the time of delivery to the Trustee, be
a genuine and validly outstanding Mortgage Note of the Member issuing the same,
according to the tenor and purport thereof. The Company hereby does and will
forever warrant and defend the title of the Trustee to Pledged Property pledged
by the Company for the benefit of the Holders for the time being of the Bonds
and coupons appertaining thereto, if any, against the lawful claims and demands
of all persons whomsoever.

SECTION 7.07. Protection of Title; Payment of Taxes; Liens, etc.

The Company will:

(1) duly and promptly pay and discharge, or cause to be paid and
discharged, before they become delinquent, all taxes, assessments,
governmental and other charges lawfully levied, assessed or imposed upon or
against any of the Pledged Property, including the income or profits
therefrom and the interests of the Trustee and Bondholders in such Pledged
Property;

(2) duly observe and conform to all valid requirements of any
governmental authority imposed upon the Company relative to any of the
Pledged Property, and all covenants, terms and conditions under or upon
which any part thereof is held;

(3) cause to be paid and discharged all lawful claims (including,
without limitation, income taxes) which, if unpaid, might become a lien or
charge upon Pledged Property; and

(4) do all things and take all actions necessary to keep the lien of
this Indenture a first and prior lien upon the Pledged Property and protect
its title to the Pledged Property against loss by reason of any foreclosure
or other proceeding to enforce any lien prior to or pari passu with the
lien of this Indenture.

Nothing contained in this Section shall require the payment of any such
tax, assessment, claim, lien or charge or the compliance with any such
requirement so long as the validity, application or amount thereof shall be
contested in good faith; provided, however, that the Company shall have set
aside on its books such reserves (segregated to the extent required by generally
accepted accounting principles) as shall be deemed adequate with respect
<PAGE> 79

thereto as determined by the Board of Directors as evidenced by a Board
Resolution.

SECTION 7.08. Recordation; Opinions of Counsel.

The Company will cause this Indenture, all financing and continuation
statements with respect thereto and all supplemental indentures to be kept
recorded and filed in such manner and in such places, if any, as may in the
opinion of counsel for the Company be required by law in order to preserve and
protect the rights of the Holders of Bonds and any coupons and the Company and
will pay all taxes and fees incidental thereto. The Company will furnish to the
Trustee:

(1) promptly after the execution and delivery of this Indenture and
the execution and delivery of each supplemental indenture, an Opinion of
Counsel,

(i) that in the opinion of such Counsel this Indenture and such
supplemental indenture, as the case may be, have been properly
recorded and filed so as to make effective the lien intended to be
created hereby and thereby, and reciting the details of such action,
or that in the opinion of such Counsel no such action is necessary to
make effective such lien, and

(ii) that any other action required to be taken so as to make
such lien so effective has been taken, and reciting the details of
such action, or that in the opinion of such Counsel no such other
action is necessary to make such lien so effective; and

(2) on May 15, 1995 and each May 15 thereafter, so long as any Bonds
are outstanding, an Opinion of Counsel either stating that in the opinion
of such Counsel such action has been taken with respect to the recording,
filing, re-recording, and re-filing of this Indenture as is necessary to
maintain the lien of this Indenture, and reciting the details of such
action, or stating that in the opinion of such Counsel no such action is
necessary to maintain such lien.

The Company will also cause each Mortgage pledged with the Trustee to be
kept, recorded and filed in such manner and in such places as may in the opinion
of counsel for the Company or such Member be required by law in order to protect
and preserve the rights of the Company, and on or before May 15 of each
<PAGE> 80

70
year, commencing with 1995, will furnish to the Trustee an Opinion or Opinions
of Counsel (which may be based on opinions of local counsel accompanying said
Opinion, certificates of officers of Members as to factual matters and such
other information deemed by such Counsel to be reliable) stating that such
action has been taken with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording and
re-filing of each Mortgage securing a Mortgage Note certified in the most recent
Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral and still held by the Trustee as
part of the Pledged Property as is necessary to maintain the lien thereof, and
reciting the details of such action, or stating that in the opinion of such
counsel no such action is necessary to maintain such lien. Nothing herein shall
be deemed to create any obligation on the part of the Company or the Trustee
(subject to Section 10.01) to take any further recording or filing steps with
respect to the rights of the Trustee in or to the Mortgages, including any
recording or filing of the assignment to the Trustee of any Mortgage, except
that the Company shall be obligated to file a financing statement with respect
to the assignment of its interest in each Mortgage pledged with the Trustee in
the jurisdictions in which the Company keeps its records and in which its
principal place of business is located. The Opinion or Opinions of Counsel
hereinabove referred to in this paragraph shall be accompanied by an Officers'
Certificate stating that no instrument of satisfaction of any Mortgage which is
then part of the Pledged Property with the Trustee has been executed by the
Company.

SECTION 7.09. Further Assurances.

The Company will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such additional instruments and do, or cause to be done, all such
additional acts as (a) may be necessary or proper, consistently with the
Granting Clauses hereof, to carry out the purposes of this Indenture and to make
subject to the lien hereof any property intended so to be subject, or (b) may be
necessary or proper to transfer to any successor trustee the estate, powers,
instruments and funds held in trust hereunder and to confirm the lien of this
Indenture with respect to any series of Bonds. The Company will also cause to be
filed, registered or recorded any instruments of conveyance, transfer,
assignment or further assurance in all offices in which such filing, registering
or recording is necessary to the validity thereof or to give notice thereof.
<PAGE> 81

SECTION 7.10. Advances by Trustee.

If the Company shall fail to perform any of its covenants contained in this
Indenture, the Trustee may (but shall not be obligated to) make advances to
perform the same on behalf of the Company, and the Company will repay upon
demand all sums so advanced, with interest after demand at the highest rate of
interest borne by any Bond then Outstanding. All sums so advanced, with interest
as aforesaid, shall be secured by this Indenture and have priority to the
indebtedness evidenced by the Bonds. No such advance shall be deemed to relieve
the Company from any default or Event of Default hereunder.

SECTION 7.11. Restriction on Indebtedness.

The Company will not incur any Superior Indebtedness, or make any optional
prepayment on any Capital Term Certificate, if, after giving effect thereto, (x)
on the date of such incurrence or making of optional prepayment (the
determination date) the aggregate principal amount of Superior Indebtedness then
outstanding, less a principal amount of Superior Indebtedness equal to the
principal amount of Government or Government Insured Obligations held by the
Company (whether or not pledged with the Trustee), exceeds 20 times the sum of
(i) the aggregate principal amount of Capital Term Certificates outstanding on
the determination date and (ii) the aggregate amount of Members' equity in the
Company, other than Capital Term Certificates, on the determination date or (y)
on any given future date the aggregate principal amount of Superior Indebtedness
outstanding on the determination date which will remain outstanding on such
given future date, less a principal amount of Superior Indebtedness equal to the
principal amount of Government or Government Insured Obligations held by the
Company on the determination date which will remain outstanding on such given
future date, will exceed 20 times the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount
of Capital Term Certificates outstanding on the determination date which will
remain outstanding on such given future date and (ii) the aggregate amount of
Members' equity in the Company, other than Capital Term Certificates, on the
determination date. The respective principal amounts of Superior Indebtedness,
Capital Term Certificates and Government or Government Insured Obligations to be
outstanding on such given future date shall be determined after giving effect to
mandatory sinking fund payments, other mandatory prepayments and serial and
other maturity payments required to be made on or prior to said given future
<PAGE> 82

date by the terms of such Superior Indebtedness, Capital Term Certificates and
Government or Government Insured Obligations or any indenture or other
instrument pursuant to which they are respectively issued. For the purposes of
this Section "Government or Government Insured Obligations" shall mean (A)
obligations of the United States of America or any agency thereof issued to
promote the purposes of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as from time to
time in effect, or any similar Act hereafter enacted by the Congress of the
United States of America and (B) obligations of Members which are guaranteed or
insured by the United States of America or any agency thereof.

SECTION 7.12. Restriction on Amendment of Certain Instruments.

The Company will not enter into any agreement providing for, or consent to,
any modification, alteration, supplement or amendment of any Mortgage Note or
Mortgage, except as provided in this Section, Section 4.05, Section 13.01(b) or
Section 13.02(b) and except that this provision shall not prevent any
modification, alteration, supplement or amendment of any Mortgage so long as
thereafter such Mortgage will continue to comply with the requirements set forth
in Schedule I to this Indenture. To the extent permitted by the preceding
sentence, the Company may waive compliance with provisions in said instruments,
either before or after the time when such compliance was required, but no such
waiver shall extend to or affect such provisions except to the extent expressly
waived.

SECTION 7.13. Maintenance of Eligible Collateral.

The Company shall cause the Allowable Amount of Eligible Collateral held by
the Trustee as Pledged Property at all times to be not less than 100% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds.

On July 1 in each calendar year, beginning with 1994, the Company will
deliver to the Trustee a Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral, dated not
more than 30 days prior to such delivery, showing that the requirements of the
preceding paragraph and Subsections (a)(2) and (3) of Section 3.01 are
satisfied; provided, however, that no such Certificate need be delivered to the
Trustee on any July 1 if a Certificate of Available Eligible Collateral shall
have been delivered in connection with the authentication and delivery of Bonds
or the withdrawal of any part of the Pledged Property since the preceding
January 1.
<PAGE> 83

SECTION 7.14. Restriction on Assignments of Mortgage and Loan Agreements.

Mortgage securing any Mortgage Note then held by the Trustee or in any Loan
Agreement pursuant to which such Mortgage Note was issued.

SECTION 7.15. Statement as to Compliance.

The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of
each fiscal year of the Company, a brief certificate signed by the principal
executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer,

and covenants under this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or
requirement of notice provided under this Indenture).

The Company will promptly deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
specifying the nature, status and period of existence of any Event of Default or
any event which with notice or lapse of time would become an Event of Default.

SECTION 7.16 Waiver of Certain Covenants.

The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any covenant
or condition set forth in Sections 7.04, 7.07(1), (2) and (3), 7.11, 7.12, 7.13
and 7.14, if before or after the time for such compliance the Holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding shall,
by Act of such Bondholders, either waive such compliance in such instance or
generally waive compliance with such covenant or condition, but no such waiver
shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so
expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations
of the Company in respect of any such covenant or condition shall remain in full
force and effect.

indenture, shall be made in accordance with such provision and this Article.

SECTION 8.03. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.

The election of the Company to redeem any Bonds shall be evidenced by a
Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of
less than all of the Bonds of any series, the Company shall, at least 45 days
prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall
be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee in writing of such
Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Bonds of such series to be
redeemed.

SECTION 8.04. Selection by Trustee of Bonds to be Redeemed.

If less than all the Bonds of any series are to be redeemed, the particular
Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the
Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Bonds of such series not
previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair
and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of
portions of the principal of Bonds of a denomination larger than $1,000. The
portions of the principal of Bonds so selected for partial redemption shall be
equal to $1,000 or the smallest authorized denomination of the Bonds of such
series, whichever is greater, or a multiple thereof.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Bonds
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond selected for partial
redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires,
all provisions relating to the redemption of Bonds shall relate, in the case of
any
<PAGE> 85

75
Bond redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal of
such Bond which has been or is to be redeemed.

SECTION 8.05. Notice of Redemption.

Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 1.06
(i) to Holders of Registered Bonds to be redeemed, once not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date; and (ii) to Holders of Bearer
Bonds to be redeemed, once not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the
Redemption Date.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date,

(2) the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any,

(3) If less than all Outstanding Bonds of any series are to be
redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the
respective principal amounts) of the Bonds to be redeemed,

(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price and accrued
interest, if any, will become due and payable upon each such Bond, and that
interest thereon shall cease to accrue from and after said date, and

(5) the place where such Bonds, together in the case of Bearer Bonds
with all coupons appertaining thereto, if any, maturing after the
Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price
and accrued interest, if any, which shall be the office or agency of the
Company in the Place of Payment for the Bonds of the series being redeemed.

Notice of redemption of Bonds to be redeemed shall be given by the Company
or, upon a Company Request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the
Company.

SECTION 8.06. Deposit of Redemption Price.

On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the
Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying
Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 7.03) an amount of
money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, of
all the Bonds which are to be redeemed on that date.
<PAGE> 86

76
SECTION 8.07. Bonds Payable on Redemption Date.

Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Bonds so to be
redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption
Price and accrued interest, if any, therein specified and from and after such
date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price
and such accrued interest) such Bonds shall cease to bear interest and the
coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Bonds so to be redeemed,
except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of such Bonds
for redemption, together with all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing
after the Redemption Date, in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall be
paid by the Company at the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any,
exclusive, however, of instalments of interest maturing on the Redemption Date
payment of which shall have been made or duly provided for to the Holders of
such Bonds registered as such on the relevant Record Dates, or otherwise,
according to their terms and the provisions of Section 2.09 ; provided, however,
that instalments of interest on Bearer Bonds with a Stated Maturity on or before
the Redemption Date shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of
coupons for such interest at an office or agency located outside the United
States.

If any Bond called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender
thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid,
bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate borne by the Bond.

If any Bearer Bond surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by
all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, the surrender of
such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee, if
there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to
save each of them harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Bond shall
surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a
deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be
entitled to receive the amount to be deducted; provided, however, that interest
represented by coupons shall be payable only as provided in Section 7.02.

SECTION 8.08. Bonds Redeemed in Part.

Any Registered Bond of any series which is to be redeemed only in part
shall be surrendered at the Place of Payment for Bonds of such series (with, if
<PAGE> 87

77
the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly
executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) and
the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the
Holder of such Bond a new Registered Bond or Bonds of the same series, of any
authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal
amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of
the Bond so surrendered; provided, that if a Global Bond is so surrendered, such
new Bond so issued shall be a new Global Bond in a denomination equal to the
unredeemed portion of the principal of the Global Bond so surrendered.

<PAGE> 88

78
warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in
this Section specifically dealt with), and continuance of such default or
breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered
or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and
the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Bonds, a written notice specifying such default or breach and
requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of
Default" hereunder; or

(6) the entry of a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in
the premises adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as
properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment
or composition of or in respect of the Company under the Bankruptcy Code or
any other applicable Federal or State law or law of the District of
Columbia, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee,
sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any
substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation
of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed
and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or

(7) the institution by the Company of proceedings to be adjudicated a
bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the institution of
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against it, or the filing by it of a
petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under the
Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable Federal or State law or law of the
District of Columbia, or the consent by it to the filing of any such
petition or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee,
trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any
substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for
the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its
inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of
corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action.

Upon receipt by the Trustee of any Notice of Default pursuant to this
Section 9.01, (i) with respect to Bonds of a series all or part of which is
represented by a Global Bond or Bonds, the Trustee shall establish a record
date, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Trustee
receives such Notice of Default, and (ii) with respect to any other series of
Bonds issued hereunder, the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to,
establish
<PAGE> 89

79
a record date, in each case for the purpose of determining Holders of
Outstanding Bonds of such series entitled to join in such Notice of Default. The
Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such
Persons, shall be entitled to join in such Notice of Default, whether or not
such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that unless
Holders of at least the requisite principal amount (which amount is 25% in the
case of subclause (5) of this Section) of the Outstanding Bonds of such series,
or their proxies, shall have joined in such Notice of Default prior to the day
which is 90 days after such record date, such Notice of Default and the Act of
Holders, or their proxies, joining in such Notice of Default shall automatically
and without further action by any Holders be cancelled and of no effect. Nothing
in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving,
(i) after expiration of such 90-day period, a new Notice of Default to the same
effect as that cancelled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, or
(ii) during any such 90-day period in respect of any Notice of Default with
respect to a prospective Event of Default with respect to Bonds of such series,
an additional Notice of Default with respect to any other prospective Event of
Default (other than a prospective Event of Default as to which such a 90-day
period has not expired) with respect to Bonds of such series, in either of which
events a new record date shall or may, as the case may be, be established
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 9.01 in respect of such new or
additional Notice of Default.

SECTION 9.02. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then and in every such
case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Bonds Outstanding may declare the principal of all the Bonds to be due and
payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee
if given by Bondholders), and upon any such declaration such principal shall
become immediately due and payable.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made and
before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by
the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided and before any sale of the
Pledged Property, or any part thereof, shall have been made pursuant to any
power of sale as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding, by written notice, to the Company
and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
<PAGE> 90

80
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue instalments of interest on all Bonds,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Bonds which
have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and
interest thereon at the respective rates borne by the Bonds,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,
interest upon overdue instalments of interest at the respective rates
borne by the Bonds, and

(D) all sums due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 10.07;

and

(2) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal
of Bonds which have become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured
or waived as provided in Section 7.16 or 9.09.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

Upon receipt by the Trustee of any written notice declaring such an
acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, (i) with respect to Bonds of
a series all or part of which is represented by a Global Bond or Bonds, the
Trustee shall establish a record date, which record date shall be at the close
of business on the day the Trustee receives such notice, and (ii) with respect
to any other series of Bonds issued under this Indenture, the Trustee may, but
shall not be obligated to, establish a record date, in each case for the purpose
of determining Holders of Outstanding Bonds of such series entitled to join in
such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies,
and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not
such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that unless such
declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be,
shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined
in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such
notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case
may be, and the Act of Holders, or their proxies, joining in such notice shall
automatically and without further action by any Holders be cancelled and of no
effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a
Holder, of Bonds of any series
<PAGE> 91

81
from giving, (i) after expiration of such 90-day period a new written notice of
declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case
may be, to the same effect as that cancelled pursuant to the proviso to the
preceding sentence, or (ii) during any such 90-day period in respect of any
written notice of declaration of acceleration or rescission and annulment
thereof, as the case may be, with respect to any Event of Default with respect
to Bonds of such series, an additional written notice of declaration of
acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, with
respect to any other Event of Default (other than an Event of Default as to
which such a 90-day period has not expired) with respect to Bonds of such
series, in either of which events a new record date shall or may, as the case
may be, be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 9.02 in
respect of such new or additional written notice.

SECTION 9.03. Trustee's Power of Sale of Pledged Property; Notice
Required; Power to Bring Suit.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing for a period
of 30 days after the Trustee shall have given the Company written notice
requiring such Event of Default to be remedied, and subject to the provisions of
Sections 9.07 and 9.08, the Trustee, by such officer or agent as it may appoint,
may:

(1) sell, to the extent permitted by law, without recourse, for cash,
or credit or for other property, for immediate or future delivery, and for
such price or prices and on such terms as the Trustee in its discretion may
determine, the Pledged Property as an entirety, or in any such portions as
the Trustee in its discretion shall deem expedient in the interest of the
Bondholders, (i) at private sale after at least 30 days' written notice to
the Company, or as otherwise required by law, or (ii) at public sale at
some convenient place in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New
York, or at such other place or places as may be required by law, after
publishing notice of such public sale in an Authorized Newspaper in such
Borough and in such place or places as may be required by law, at least
once in each of two successive calendar weeks preceding such public sale
(which notice shall state that such public sale will be subject to all
necessary governmental or statutory approvals and consents), and may from
time to time adjourn such public sale by announcement at the time and place
fixed for such sale or for such adjourned sale or sales without further
notice except such as may be required by law; and/or
<PAGE> 92

82
(2) proceed by one or more suits, actions or proceedings at law or in
equity or otherwise or by any other appropriate remedy, to enforce payment
of the Bonds and related coupons or Mortgage Notes which are part of the
Pledged Property or to realize on any collateral security for such Mortgage
Notes, or to foreclose this Indenture or to sell the Pledged Property under
a judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent jurisdiction, or by
the enforcement of any such other appropriate legal or equitable remedy, as
the Trustee in its discretion shall deem most effectual to protect and
enforce any of its rights or powers or any of the rights or powers of the
Bondholders.

In the event that the Trustee shall deem it advisable to sell any of or all
the Pledged Property in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the
Company agrees that if registration of any such Pledged Property shall be
required, in the opinion of counsel for the Trustee, under the Securities Act of
1933 or other applicable law, and regulations promulgated thereunder, and if the
Company shall not effect, or cause to be effected, such registration promptly,
the Trustee may sell any such Pledged Property at a private sale, and the
Company and the Bondholders shall not attempt to maintain that the prices at
which such Pledged Property is to be sold are inadequate by reason of the
failure to sell at public sale, or hold the Trustee liable therefor.

SECTION 9.04. Incidents of Sale of Pledged Property.

Upon any sale of all or any part of the Pledged Property made either under
the power of sale given under this Indenture or under judgement or decree in any
judicial proceedings for foreclosure or otherwise for the enforcement of this
Indenture, the following shall be applicable:

(1) Bonds Due and Payable. The principal of, and premium, if any, and
accrued interest on, the Bonds, if not previously due, shall immediately
become and be due and payable.

(2) Trustee Appointed Attorney of Company to Make Conveyances. The
Trustee is hereby irrevocably appointed the true and lawful attorney of the
Company, in its name and stead, to make all necessary deeds, bills of sale
and instruments of assignment, transfer or conveyance of the property thus
sold; and for that purpose the Trustee may execute all such documents and
instruments and may substitute one or more persons with like power; and the
Company hereby ratifies and confirms all that its said attorneys, or such
substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do by virtue hereof.

(3) Company to Confirm Sales and Conveyances. If so requested by the
Trustee or by any purchaser, the Company shall ratify and confirm any such
sale or transfer by executing and delivering to the Trustee or to such
purchaser or purchasers all proper deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
assignment, conveyance or transfer and releases as may be designated in any
such request.

(4) Bondholders and Trustee May Purchase Pledged Property. Any
Bondholder or Holder of a related coupon or the Trustee may bid for and
purchase any of the Pledged Property, and upon compliance with the terms of
sale, may hold, retain, possess and dispose of such Pledged Property in
their or its or his own absolute right without further accountability.

(5) Purchaser at Sale May Apply Bonds or Coupons to Purchase
Price. Any purchaser at any such sale may, in paying the purchase price,
deliver any of the Bonds or related coupons then Outstanding in lieu of
cash and apply to the purchase price the amount which shall, upon
distribution of the net proceeds of such sale, after application to the
costs of the action and any other sums which the Trustee is authorized to
deduct under this Indenture, be payable on such Bonds or related coupons so
delivered in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest. In case
the amount so payable on such Bonds or coupons shall be less than the
amount due thereon, duly executed and authenticated Bonds or coupons shall
be delivered to the Holder thereof for the balance of the amount due on
such Bonds or coupons so delivered by such Holder in exchange therefor.

(6) Receipt of Trustee Shall Discharge Purchaser. The receipt of the
Trustee or of the officer making such sale under judicial proceedings shall
be a sufficient discharge to any purchaser for his purchase money, and,
after paying such purchase money and receiving such receipt, such purchaser
or his personal representative or assigns shall not be obliged to see to
the application of such purchase money, or be in any way answerable for any
loss, misapplication or non-application thereof.

(7) Sale to Divest Company's Rights in Property Sold. Any such sale
shall operate to divest the Company of all right, title, interest, claim
and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity or otherwise, in and to
the Pledged Property so sold, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law and
in equity or otherwise against the Company, and its successors and assigns,
<PAGE> 94

84
and any and all persons claiming or who may claim the Pledged Property
sold or any part thereof from, through or under the Company, or its 
successors and assigns.

(8) Application of Moneys Received upon Sale. Any moneys collected by
the Trustee upon any sale made either under the power of sale given by this
Indenture or under judgment or decree in any judicial proceedings for
foreclosure or otherwise for the enforcement of this Indenture, shall be
applied as provided in Section 9.13.

SECTION 9.05. Upon Default Company Will Pay Principal and Interest
upon Demand of Trustee.

In case

(1) default is made in the payment of any instalment of interest on
any Bond when such interest becomes due and payable and such default
continues for a period of 30 days, or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
any, on) any Bond at the Maturity thereof,

then in any such event, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the
Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of the Bonds and coupons, the whole
amount then due and payable on all Bonds and coupons, for principal, premium, if
any, and interest, or any of them, as the case may be, with interest at the
rates specified in the respective Bonds on the overdue principal and premium, if
any, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is legally enforceable) on
the overdue Instalments of interest. In addition thereto, the Company will pay
to the Trustee all amounts due to it pursuant to Section 10.07.

SECTION 9.06. Judicial Proceedings Instituted by Trustee.

(a) Trustee May Bring Suit. In case the Company shall fail to pay promptly
the amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 9.05 upon demand of the
Trustee, then the Trustee in its own name, and as trustee of an express trust,
shall be entitled and empowered to institute any suits, actions or proceedings
at law, in equity or otherwise, to recover judgment against the Company or any
other obligor on the Bonds and coupons for the whole amount due and unpaid, and
may prosecute any such claim or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may
enforce any such judgment or final decree against the
<PAGE> 95

85
Company or any such other obligor and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to
be payable in any manner provided by law, whether before or after or during the
pendency of any proceedings for the enforcement of the lien of this Indenture,
or of any of the Trustee's rights or the rights of the Holders of Bonds and
coupons under this Indenture, and such power of the Trustee shall not be
affected by any sale hereunder or by the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy for the enforcement of the provisions of this Indenture or for the
foreclosure of the lien hereof.

(b) Trustee May Recover Unpaid Indebtedness after Sale of Pledged
Property. In the case of a sale of the Pledged Property and of the application
of the proceeds of such sale to the payment of the indebtedness secured by this
Indenture, the Trustee in its owns name, and as trustee of an express trust,
shall be entitled and empowered, by any appropriate means, legal, equitable or
otherwise, to enforce payment of, and to receive all amounts then remaining due
and unpaid upon, all or any of the Bonds or coupons, for the benefit of the
Holders thereof, and upon any other portion of the indebtedness remaining
unpaid, with interest as provided in Section 9.05.

(c) Recovery of Judgment Does Not Affect Lien of this Indenture or Other
Rights. No recovery of any such judgment or final decree by the Trustee and no
levy of any execution under any such judgment upon any of the Pledged Property,
or upon any other property, shall in any manner or to any extent affect the lien
of this Indenture upon any of the Pledged Property, or any rights, powers or
remedies of the Trustee, or any liens, rights, powers or remedies of the Holders
of Bonds and coupons, but all such liens, rights, powers and remedies shall
continue unimpaired as before.

(d) Trustee May File Proofs of Claim; Appointment of Trustee as
Attorney-in-Fact in Judicial Proceedings. The Trustee in its own name, or as
trustee of an express trust, or as attorney-in-fact for the Holders of Bonds and
coupons, or in any one or more of such capacities (irrespective of whether the
principal of the Bonds shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made
any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal, premium (if any)
or interest), shall be entitled and empowered to file such proofs of claim and
other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the
claims of the Trustee and of the Holders of Bonds and coupons (whether such
claims be based upon the provisions of the Bonds, the coupons, or this
<PAGE> 96

86
Indenture) allowed in any equity receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy,
liquidation, readjustment, reorganization or any other judicial proceedings
relative to the Company, or any obligor on the Bonds or coupons, the creditors
of the Company or any such other obligor, any Member, the Pledged Property or
any other property of the Company or any such other obligor and any receiver,
assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any
such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Bonds and
coupons to make such payments to the Trustee and in the event that the Trustee
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Bonds
and coupons, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it pursuant to Section
10.07. The Trustee is hereby irrevocably appointed (and the successive
respective Holders of the Bonds and coupons, by taking and holding the same,
shall be conclusively deemed to have so appointed the Trustee) the true and
lawful attorney-in-fact of the respective Bondholders, with authority to (i)
make and file in the respective names of the Holders of Bonds and coupons
(subject to deduction from any such claims of the amounts of any claims filed by
any of the Holders of Bonds and coupons themselves), any claim, proof of claim
or amendment thereof, debt, proof of debt or amendment thereof, petition or
other document in any such proceedings and to receive payment of any amounts
distributable on account thereof, (ii) execute any such other papers and
documents and to do and perform any and all such acts and things for and on
behalf of such Holders of Bonds and coupons, as may be necessary or advisable in
order to have the respective claims of the Trustee and of the Holders of Bonds
and coupons against the Company or any such other obligor, the Members, the
Pledged Property or any other property of the Company or any such other obligor
allowed in any such proceeding and (iii) receive payment of or on account of
such claims and debt; provided, however, that nothing contained in this
Indenture shall be deemed to give to the Trustee any right to accept or consent
to any plan or reorganization or otherwise by action of any character in any
such proceeding to waive or change in any way any right of any Holders of Bonds
and coupons. Any moneys collected by the Trustee under this Section shall be
applied as provided in Section 9.13.

(e) Trustee Need Not Have Possession of Bonds or Coupons. All rights of
action and of asserting claims under this Indenture or under any of the Bonds
and coupons enforceable by the Trustee may be enforced by the Trustee without
possession of any of such Bonds and coupons or the production thereof on the
trial or other proceedings relative thereto.
<PAGE> 97

87
(f) Suit To Be Brought for Ratable Benefit of Holders of Bonds and
Coupons. Any suit, action or other proceeding at law, in equity or otherwise
which shall be instituted by the Trustee under any of the provisions of this
Indenture shall be for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all the Holders
of Bonds and coupons, subject to the provisions of this Indenture.

(g) Trustee May Be Restored to Former Position and Rights in Certain
Circumstances. In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right
under this Indenture by suit, foreclosure or otherwise and such proceedings
shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been
determined adversely to the Trustee, then in every such case, the Company, the
Members, any other obligor on the Bonds or coupons and the Trustee shall be
restored without further act to their respective former positions and rights
hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee shall continue as
though no such proceedings had been taken.

SECTION 9.07. Bondholders May Demand Enforcement of Rights by Trustee.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing, the
Trustee shall, upon the written request of the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding and upon the offering
of indemnity as provided in Section 10.03(e), proceed to institute one or more
suits, actions or proceedings at law, in equity or otherwise, or take any other
appropriate remedy, to enforce payment of the principal of, or premium, if any,
or interest on, the Bonds or coupons or Mortgage Notes which are part of the
Pledged Property or to realize on any collateral security for such Mortgage
Notes, or to foreclose this Indenture or to sell the Pledged Property under a
judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent jurisdiction or under the
power of sale herein granted, or take such other appropriate legal, equitable or
other remedy, as the Trustee, being advised by counsel, shall deem effectual to
protect and enforce any of the rights or powers of the Trustee or the Holders of
Bonds and coupons, or, in case such Bondholders shall have requested a specific
method of enforcement permitted hereunder, in the manner requested, provided
that such action shall not be otherwise than in accordance with law and the
provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee, subject to such indemnity
provisions, shall have the right to decline to follow any such request if the
Trustee in good faith shall determine that the suit, proceeding or exercise of
<PAGE> 98

88
other remedy so requested would involve the Trustee in personal liability or
expense.

SECTION 9.08. Control by Bondholders.

Subject to Section 11.03(e), the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding Bonds shall have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, provided that

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or
with this Indenture, be unduly prejudicial to Holders not joining in such
request or involve the Trustee in personal liability or expense (but the
Trustee shall not be obligated to make any determination with respect to
such conflict, prejudice or liability), and

(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee
which is not inconsistent with such direction.

Upon receipt by the Trustee of any written notice directing the time,
method or place of conducting any such proceeding or exercising any such trust
or power, (i) with respect to Bonds of a series all or part of which is
represented by a Global Bond or Bonds, the Trustee shall establish a record
date, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Trustee
receives such notice, and (ii) with respect to any other series of Bonds issued
under this Indenture, the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, establish
a record date, in each case for the purpose of determining Holders of
Outstanding Bonds of such series entitled to join in such notice. The Holders on
such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall
be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders
after such record date; provided, that unless the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of such series shall have joined in
such notice prior to the date which is 90 days after such record date, such
notice and the Act of Holders, or their proxies, joining in such notice shall
automatically and without further action by any Holders be cancelled and of no
effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a
Holder, from giving, (i) after expiration of such 90-day period, a new notice to
the same effect as that cancelled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding
sentence, or (ii) during any such 90-day period in respect of any notice, a new
notice giving directions contrary to or otherwise different from such notice in
either of which events a new record date shall or
<PAGE> 99

89
may, as the case may be, be established pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 9.08 in respect of such new notice.

SECTION 9.09. Waiver of Past Defaults.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Bonds may on behalf of the Holders of all the Bonds and related
coupons waive any past default hereunder and its consequences, except a default

(1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or
interest on any Bonds, or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article
Thirteen cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of
each Outstanding Bond affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose
of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
default or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 9.10. Holder May Not Bring Suit Except Under Certain Conditions.

A Holder of any Bond of any series or any related coupon shall not have the
right to institute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity or
otherwise for the foreclosure of this Indenture, for the appointment of a
receiver or for the enforcement of any other remedy under or upon this
Indenture, unless:

(1) such Holder previously shall have given written notice to the
Trustee of a continuing Event of Default;

(2) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds then Outstanding shall have requested the Trustee in writing to
institute such action, suit or proceeding and shall have offered to the
Trustee indemnity as provided in Section 10.03(e);

(3) the Trustee shall have refused or neglected to institute any such
action, suit or proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice,
request and offer of indemnity; and
<PAGE> 100

90
(4) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given
to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of Outstanding Bonds.

It is understood and intended that no one or more of the Holders of Bonds
or coupons shall have any right in any manner whatever hereunder or under the
Bonds or coupons to (i) surrender, impair, waive, affect, disturb or prejudice
the lien of this Indenture on any Pledged Property or the rights of the Holders
of any other Bonds or coupons, (ii) obtain or seek to obtain priority over or
preference to any other such Holder or (iii) enforce any right under this
Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and
common benefit of all the Holders of Bonds or coupons subject to the provisions
of this Indenture.

SECTION 9.11. Undertaking To Pay Court Costs.

All parties to this Indenture, and each Holder of any Bond or coupon by his
acceptance thereof, shall be deemed to have agreed that any court may in its
discretion require, in any suit, action or proceeding for the enforcement of any
right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit, action or proceeding
against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee hereunder,
the filing by any party litigant in such suit, action or proceeding of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, action or proceeding, and that such
court may, in its discretion, assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, action or proceeding,
having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by
such party litigant; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section
shall not apply to (a) any suit, action or proceeding instituted by the Trustee,
(b) any suit, action or proceeding instituted by any Bondholder or group of
Bondholders holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate principal amount
of the Bonds then Outstanding or (c) any suit, action or proceeding instituted
by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Bonds or coupons, on or after the
respective due dates expressed therein.

after the respective due dates expressed in such Bond or coupon (or, in case of
redemption, on the Redemption Date fixed for such Bond), or to institute suit
for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall
not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

SECTION 9.13. Application of Moneys Collected by Trustee.

Any moneys collected or to be applied by the Trustee pursuant to this
Article, together with any other moneys which may then be held by the Trustee
under any of the provisions of this Indenture as security for the Bonds and
coupons (other than moneys at the time required to be held for the payment of
specific Bonds or coupons at Maturity or at a time fixed for the redemption
thereof) shall be applied in the following order from time to time, on the date
or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in the case of a distribution of such moneys
on account of principal, premium, if any, or interest, upon presentation of the
several Outstanding Bonds or coupons, and stamping thereon of payment, if only

enforcement of any remedies hereunder or under any Mortgage, and to

attorneys and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances
incurred or made by the Trustee, or through the Trustee by any Holder
or Holders and all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 10.07;

SECOND: in case the principal of the Bonds or any of them shall
not have become due, to the payment of any interest in default, in the
order of the maturity of the instalments of such interest, with
interest at the rates specified in the respective Bonds (to the extent
that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) on the
overdue instalments thereof;

THIRD: in case the principal of any of but not all the Bonds
shall have become due, by declaration, upon redemption or otherwise,
first to the payment of accrued interest in the order of the maturity
of the
<PAGE> 102

92
instalments thereof with interest at the respective rates
specified in the Bonds on overdue principal, premium, if any, and
(to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally
enforceable) on overdue instalments of interest, and next to the
payment of the principal of all Bonds then due;

FOURTH: in case the principal of all the Bonds shall have become
due, by declaration, upon redemption or otherwise, to the payment of
the whole amount then due and unpaid upon the Bonds then Outstanding
and the related coupons for principal, premium, if any, and interest,
at the rate specified in the respective Bonds on overdue principal,
premium, if any, and (to the extent that payment of such interest
shall be legally enforceable) on overdue instalments of interest, and,
in case such proceeds shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole
amount so due and unpaid, then to the payment of such principal,
premium, if any, and interest ratably, without discrimination or
preference; and

FIFTH: in case the principal of all the Bonds shall have become
due, by declaration, upon redemption or otherwise, and all of such
Bonds shall have been fully paid together with all interest (including
any interest on overdue payments) and premium, if any, thereon, any
surplus then remaining shall be paid to the Company, its successors or
assigns, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the
same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct;

provided, however, that all payments to be made pursuant to this Section
shall be made ratably to the persons entitled thereto, without
discrimination or preference.

SECTION 9.14. Bonds or Coupons Held by Company Not To Share in
Distribution.

Any Bonds or coupons owned or held by, or for the account or benefit of,
the Company shall not be entitled to share in any payment or distribution
provided for in this Article, provided that the Trustee shall have no liability
in respect of such payment or distribution made to any Person entitled thereto
pursuant to Section 2.10 other than the Company unless a Responsible Officer
shall have
<PAGE> 103

93
actual knowledge that any such Person holds Bonds or coupons for the account or
benefit of the Company.

SECTION 9.15. Waiver of Appraisement, Valuation, Stay, Right to

To the extent it may lawfully do so, the Company, for itself and for any

(1) agrees that neither it nor any such person will set up, plead,
claim or in any manner whatsoever take advantage of, any appraisement,
valuation, stay, extension or redemption laws, now or hereafter in force in
any jurisdiction, which may delay, prevent or otherwise hinder (i) the

and the Trustee or the Holders of Bonds or coupons or any delay or omission of
the Trustee or of any such Holder to exercise any right, remedy or power
accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any right, remedy or power or
shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or of any right

subject to the provisions of Section 9.10, every right, remedy and power given
by this Article to the Trustee or to the Holders of Bonds and coupons may be
exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the
Trustee or by such Holders.

as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants
or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of
the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to

the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof
are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee (other than with
respect to the Opinions of Counsel referred to in Section 3.01(b)(5)), the
Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or
not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

(b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee
shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and
use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act, or its own wilful misconduct, except that

(1) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of
Subsection (a) of this Section;
<PAGE> 105

upon the Trustee, under this Indenture; and

(4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend
or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the

such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in
the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or
interest on any Bond or in the payment of any sinking fund instalment, the
Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the
board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors
and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the
withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Bondholders; and provided,
further, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section

himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent

shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed
or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and
duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on request of the Company or the successor
Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and
deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights,
powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign, transfer and
deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring
Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its lien, if any, provided for in
Section 10.07. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall
execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts.

authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Bonds so
authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself
authenticated such Bonds.

exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or
incurred by the Company for the purpose of financing the purchase,
processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or
merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to,
possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the
receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or
merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is
received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor
relationship with the Company arising from the making, drawing, negotiating
or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation.

SECTION 10.14. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.

The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to
one or more series of Bonds which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the
Trustee to authenticate Bonds of such series issued upon original issue or upon
exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to
Section 2.08, and Bonds so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of
this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if
authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this
Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Bonds by the Trustee or the
Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to
include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an
Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of
the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be
acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation having a
combined capital and surplus of not less than the equivalent of $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority or the
equivalent foreign authority, in the case of an Authenticating Agent who is not
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any
State thereof or the District of Columbia. If
<PAGE> 113

103
such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of conditions at least annually,
pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining
authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and
surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital
and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If
at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance
with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign
immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.

Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or
corporate trust business of such Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an
Authenticating Agent; provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible
under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the Trustee or such Authenticating Agent.

An Authenticating agent may resign at any time by giving written notice
thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate
the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such
Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of
resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such
Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating
Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of
such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of
Registered Bonds, if any, of the series with respect to which such
Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Bond
Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment
hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its
predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an
Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed
unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.

The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee
shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions
of Section 10.07.
<PAGE> 114

104
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to
this Section, the Bonds of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to
the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of
authentication in the following form:

This is one of the Bonds of the series designated therein issued under the
within-mentioned Indenture.

If all of the Bonds of a series may not be originally issued at one time,
and if the Trustee does not have an office capable of authenticating Bonds upon
original issuance located in a Place of Payment or other place where the Company
wishes to have Bonds of such series authenticated upon original issuance, the
Trustee, if so requested by the Company in writing (which writing need not
comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel),
shall appoint in accordance with this Section an Authenticating Agent (which may
be an Affiliate of the Company if eligible to be appointed as an Authenticating
Agent hereunder) having an office in such Place of Payment or other place
designated by the Company with respect to such series of Bonds.

applicants desire to communicate with other Holders of Bonds with respect to
their rights under this Indenture or under the Bonds and is accompanied by a

shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the
entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission
shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so

SECTION 14.01. Payment of Indebtedness; Satisfaction.

If the Company shall pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all Bonds
and coupons appertaining thereto hereby secured (or provide therefor) in any one
or more of the following ways, to wit:

(1) by paying or causing to be paid the principal of (including
redemption premium, if any) and interest on Bonds and coupons appertaining
thereto hereby secured, as and when the same become due and payable; and/or

(2) by depositing with the Trustee, in trust, at or before maturity,
either (i) moneys in the necessary amount or (ii) U.S. Government
Obligations, the principal of and the interest on which when due, and
without any regard to the reinvestment thereof, will in the opinion of an
Independent Accountant or other independent financial expert delivered to
the Trustee provide moneys which, together with the moneys, if any,
deposited with or held by the Trustee, shall be sufficient to pay or redeem
the principal of or premium, if any, and interest to the date of such
deposit (in the case of Bonds and coupons appertaining thereto which have
become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date (as
irrevocably set to the satisfaction of the Trustee), as the case may be, of
the Bonds hereby secured, with irrevocable direction to apply the same to
such payment or redemption;
<PAGE> 126

116
and if the Company shall also pay or cause to be paid or provided for all other
sums payable hereunder by the Company, then, upon Company Request authorized by
a Board Resolution, accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel stating that all conditions precedent to the satisfaction and discharge
of this Indenture have been complied with, this Indenture and the lien, rights
and interests hereby granted shall cease, determine and become null and void
(except as to the rights of registration of transfer and exchange and
replacement of Bonds and coupons, if applicable, and rights to receive payments
provided for in the Bonds and coupons, if any), and the Trustee shall forthwith
cause such satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture to be entered upon the
record at the expense of the Company, and shall execute and deliver such
instruments of satisfaction as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company as
specified in a Company Request, and forthwith the estate, right, title and
interest of the Trustee in and to the Pledged Property, any securities, cash
(except cash deposited under this Section) and other property held by it under
this Indenture as a part of the Pledged Property shall thereupon cease,
determine and become null and void, and the Trustee shall in such case transfer,
deliver and pay the same to the Company or upon Company Order; provided that in
the case of redemption the notice requisite to the validity of such redemption
shall have been given or arrangements shall have been made to the satisfaction
of the Trustee that such notice will be given; and provided, further, that the
Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that Holders of the Bonds and coupons, if any, of such series will not recognize
income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the
Company's exercise of its option under this Section 14.01 and will be subject to
Federal income tax in the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such option had not been exercised.

In the absence of a Company Request authorized by a Board Resolution as
aforesaid, the payment and discharge of all indebtedness secured by this
Indenture shall not render this Indenture inoperative or prevent the Company
from issuing Bonds and coupons hereunder from time to time thereafter as herein
provided.

All money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 14.01 shall be
held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Bonds,
the coupons and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any
Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the
<PAGE> 127

117
Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and
premium, if any) and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited
with the Trustee; but such money need not be segregated from other funds except
to the extent required by law.

For the purposes of this Article, the Company and the Trustee shall not
treat as a Bond or coupon hereby secured, and the Company shall not be required
to pay or provide for the payment of, any Bond or coupon in lieu of which
another Bond or coupon has been authenticated and delivered under Section 2.08,
if

(i) such Bond or coupon has not been presented to the Trustee with a
claim of ownership and enforceability by the Holder thereof, prior to the
Company Request for the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, or

(ii) the enforceability of such Bond or coupon, if contested by the
Company, has been determined adversely against such Holder by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other competent tribunal.

The rights, duties, obligations and immunities of the Trustee, including
without limitation its rights under Section 10.07 against the Company, shall
survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

SECTION 14.02. Satisfaction, Discharge and Defeasance of Bonds of Any

of Bonds and coupons, if any, denominated in Dollars, U.S. Government
Obligations (as defined below) or, in the case of Bonds and coupons, if
any, denominated in a Foreign Currency, Foreign Government Securities (as

respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than
one day before the due date of any payment of principal (including any
premium) and interest, if any, under the Bonds and coupons, if any, of such
series, money in an amount (or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii))

coupons, if any, of such series on the dates such installments of interest
or principal are due, in the currency, currencies or currency unit or
units, in which such Bonds and coupons, if any, are payable; provided,

result in any default or event of default under any material indenture,
agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its
properties; and

(3) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that Holders of the Bonds and coupons, if any, of
such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax
purposes as a result of the Company's exercise of its option under this

therefor and the Company will make arrangements for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.

which such obligations or money were deposited or received. The Trustee shall
also deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any

certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, immediately after such
exchange the U.S. Government Obligations, Foreign Government Securities or

deposited in order to comply with Sections 14.01(1) and 14.02(q)(1) hereof,
as the case may be.

If the Trustee is unable to apply any money, U.S. Government Obligations or
Foreign Government Securities in accordance with Section 14.01 or 14.02 by
reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any
court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting
such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Bonds
and coupons, if any, of such series shall be revived and reinstated as though no
deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 14.01 or 14.02 until such time as the
Trustee is permitted to apply all such money, U.S. Government Obligations or

provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment of interest on or
principal of (and premium, if any) on any Bonds and coupons, if any, of such

any, to receive such payment from the money, U.S. Government Obligations or

of Holders of Bonds of any series with respect to the currency or currency

SCHEDULE I

SUMMARY OF TERMS OF MORTGAGE

The Mortgage shall include the provisions summarized below or other
provisions substantially as protective or more protective to the mortgagee or
mortgagees. The Mortgage may be made to one or more parties as mortgagees
(provided the notes or bonds or other obligations secured thereby (the "Mortgage
Notes") are secured equally and ratably) or to a trustee or trustees under a
trust indenture. The term "mortgagees", as used below, includes the trustee or
trustees under a trust indenture and a single mortgagee if there is only one. In
any case where the Mortgage provides that consents or approvals may be given by
a percentage (at least a majority) in principal amount of the holders of
outstanding notes or bonds (exclusive, if so provided, of notes or bonds held or
owned by the mortgagor), the references below to "consent" or "approval" of the
mortgagees include any consent or approval given by such percentage in principal
amount of such holders or by a trustee or trustees under the Mortgage pursuant
to such consent or approval.

The granting clauses shall convey all property (including all permits,
licenses, privileges and similar property) then owned or thereafter acquired by
the mortgagor, subject to usual exceptions in utility mortgages, which
exceptions may include (without limitation) cash, bills, notes and accounts
receivable; choses in action and judgments; shares of stock, bonds, notes and
other securities; contracts and operating agreements; goods, wares, materials,
merchandise and supplies acquired for purpose of sale in the ordinary course of
business; fuel, fissionable and other materials and supplies and other personal
property which are consumable (otherwise than by ordinary wear and tear) in
their use in the operation of the business; office furniture, equipment and
supplies; automobiles, trucks, trailers, tractors and similar vehicles;
airplanes, airplane engines and other flight equipment; ships or marine
equipment; the last day of the term of each leasehold estate held by the
mortgagor; coal, ore, gas, oil, and other minerals on, in or under the property
of the mortgagor; all electric energy, gas, steam, water and other products
generated, produced or purchased; any leasehold interests, permits, licenses,
franchises and other rights which cannot be assigned, mortgaged or granted
without the consent of other parties; and any other property which has
theretofore been released or which is not useful to the mortgagor in the
business of generating, manufacturing, storing,
<PAGE> 136

126
transmitting, distributing, utilizing, purchasing or disposing of electricity
for heat, light, power, refrigeration or other uses.

The Mortgage may permit mergers, consolidations or sales of all or
substantially all the property of the mortgagor, provided either they are
approved by the mortgagees or the successor corporation assumes the due and
punctual payment of the Mortgage Notes and the due and punctual performance of
the covenants contained in the Mortgage. The Mortgage may contain provisions to
the effect that in the event of any consolidation or merger or sale of all or
substantially all of the business to another corporation and provided a
supplemental indenture is executed specifying that no additional Mortgage Notes
may be issued thereunder and that no further advances may be made on any
outstanding Mortgage Notes, the lien of the Mortgage shall not extend to
property of the successor or thereafter acquired except the property then
subject to the lien of the Mortgage and extensions, improvements, substitutions
and alterations to, upon, or of such property.

Covenants and Warranties

1. The execution and delivery of the Mortgage and the Mortgage Notes issued
to the Company (or to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) have been duly
authorized by the mortgagor in accordance with law, and the Mortgage and such
Mortgage Notes are valid and enforceable.

2. The mortgagor has the right and authority to mortgage the property
described in the granting clauses. The mortgaged property is free and clear of
any equal or prior mortgage, lien, charge or encumbrance, with usual exceptions
in utility mortgages, which exceptions may include (without limitation) liens
for taxes, assessments or governmental charges for the current year and taxes,
assessments or governmental charges not due and delinquent; liens for workmen's
compensation awards and similar obligations not then delinquent; mechanics',
laborers', materialmen's and similar liens not then delinquent; and any of such
liens, whether or not delinquent, whose validity is at the time being contested
in good faith; liens and charges incidental to construction or current operation
which have not been filed or asserted or the payment of which has been
adequately secured or which, in the opinion of counsel, are insignificant in
amount; liens, securing obligations not assumed by the mortgagor and on account
of which it does not pay and does not expect to pay interest, existing upon real
estate (or rights in or relating to real estate) over or in respect of which
<PAGE> 137

127
the mortgagor has a right-of-way or other easement for substation, transmission,
distribution or other right-of-way purposes; any right which the United States
of America or any state or municipality or governmental body or agency may have
by virtue of any franchise, license, contract or statute to purchase, or
designate a purchaser of, or order the sale of, any property of the mortgagor
upon payment of reasonable compensation therefor, or upon reasonable
compensation or conditions to terminate any franchise, license or other rights

distribution lines and rights-of-way and similar purposes, zoning ordinances,
regulations, reservations, restrictions, covenants, party-wall agreements,

money), none of which in the opinion of counsel is such as to interfere with the
proper operation of the property affected thereby; the burdens of any law or
governmental organization or permit requiring the mortgagor to maintain certain
facilities or perform certain acts as a condition of its occupancy of or
interference with any public land or any river, stream or other waters or
relating to environmental matters; any lien or encumbrance for the discharge of
which moneys have been deposited in trust with a proper depository to apply such
moneys to the discharge of such lien or encumbrance; any exceptions,
reservations and other matters referred to in the description of the mortgaged
property and, with respect to any property which the mortgagor may hereafter
acquire, any terms, conditions, agreements, covenants, exceptions and
reservations expressed or provided in the deeds or other instruments under which
the mortgagor shall hereafter acquire the same, none of which in the opinion of
counsel materially adversely affects or will affect the property to which the
same relates or the operation thereof by the mortgagor; any lien reserved as
security for rent or compliance with other provisions of the lease in case of
any leasehold estate; and purchase money mortgages and liens, charges and
encumbrances upon property existing at the time of acquisition thereof by the
mortgagor. The mortgagor will maintain and preserve the priority
<PAGE> 138

Upon the expiration of 30 days after an event of default still continuing,
the principal of the Mortgage Notes may be accelerated.

Miscellaneous

In the event that the mortgagor is a governmental entity or public body or
an agency of a governmental entity or public body (including any public
authority or corporation owned or controlled by a governmental entity, public
body or agency), the granting clauses, in lieu of mortgaging property, may
mortgage the revenues of the electric generating, distribution and/or
transmission facilities operated by such governmental entity, public body or
agency, and, in such event, the covenants and warranties mentioned above shall
be modified to relate to such revenues instead of property and such other
revisions may be made as are appropriate for a mortgage made by a governmental
entity, public body or agency as distinguished from a private corporation.
