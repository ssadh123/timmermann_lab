3. CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACQUIRED ASSETS

3.1 Consideration. As consideration for the
Acquired Assets and the covenant not to compete in Section 12,
Fabri-Centers will cause FCA Ohio to assume and agree to pay and
discharge, to satisfy in full without any recourse to Sellers,
and to hold Sellers harmless and indemnify Sellers from and
against, the Assumed Liabilities and pay Cloth World cash in an
amount equal to the Net LIFO Book Value of Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries as of the Time of Closing (as defined in Section
3.6). To this end, at the Time of Closing, Fabri-Centers will
cause FCA Ohio to assume the Assumed Liabilities and to:

(a) Pay to Cloth World $61,000,000 by
delivery of a bank check drawn on a bank in St. Louis,
Missouri; and

(b) Deposit $1,000,000 with a bank in St.
Louis, Missouri that is reasonably satisfactory to both
parties, as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agent"), pursuant
to an Escrow Agreement substantially in the form
attached to this Agreement as Exhibit 3.1(b).

The amount payable under clause (a) will be reconciled with the
Net LIFO Book Value as of the Time of Closing in accordance with
Sections 3.2 through 3.6. The consideration, as adjusted, will
be allocated among the Acquired Assets and the covenant not to
compete on the basis set forth in the Allocation Schedule
attached to this Agreement as Schedule 3.1.

3.2 Closing Date Statement. As soon as
practicable following the Time of Closing (and in no event later
that 60 days following the Time of Closing), Brown Group will
cause to be prepared and deliver to Fabri-Centers an audited
consolidated balance sheet of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries as
of the Time of Closing (the "Closing Date Statement"), as well as
audited consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows of
Cloth World and the Subsidiaries for the period from January 29,
1994 to the Time of Closing. These financial statements will be
audited by Ernst & Young, a nationally recognized firm of 

8 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 12
certified public accountants; Ernst & Young will not, however, be
required to sign its audit report until after the resolution of
any dispute pursuant to Section 3.5. Fabri-Centers'
representatives will be consulted with respect to the planning
and scope of the audit. The Closing Date Statement will be based
upon the books and records of Brown Group and Cloth World and
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a basis consistent with the audited
consolidated balance sheet of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries as
of January 29, 1994 (the "January 1994 Balance Sheet"), except
that (a) the value of Inventory will be determined on a LIFO
basis in accordance with Section 3.3, (b) the amount of accruals
for prorated charges will be determined in accordance with
Section 3.4, and (c) Retained Assets and Retained Liabilities
will be excluded. Brown Group will provide Fabri-Centers with
sufficient detail to enable Fabri-Centers to reconcile the
Schedules used in delineating the Acquired Assets, Retained
Assets, Assumed Liabilities, and Retained Liabilities (e.g., the
Tangible Personal Property List, Owned Real Property List,
Personal Property Lease List, Security and Other Deposits List,
Proprietary Rights List, and Retained Assets List) with the
Closing Date Statement.

3.3 Inventory Count; Valuation and Obsolescence
Reserve. Brown Group will take a physical count of the Inventory
in all stores and the Warehouse (except for stores already
counted subsequent to May 20, 1994) in accordance with the
Inventory Instructions attached to this Agreement as Schedule
3.3(a). Fabri-Center's representatives will be permitted to
observe and perform reasonable testing of the count. The count
of the Inventory will occur during the period from the date of
this Agreement through October 1, 1994. The method for valuing
the Inventory (using the LIFO method of accounting) and
determining the amount of the obsolescence reserve will be in
accordance with the past practices and procedures of Cloth World
as illustrated in the Inventory Materials attached to this
Agreement as Schedule 3.3(b).

3.4 Prorated Charges. All rent (including
percentage rent), common area charges, utility charges, fuel
charges, and other obligations under the Store Leases, Personal
Property Leases, and Executory Contracts will be prorated as of
the Time of Closing (the "Prorated Charges") and reflected in the
Closing Date Statement and supported by a list showing the amount
owed under each of the Store Leases, Personal Property Leases,
and Executory Contracts. The accrual for the percentage rent, if
any, due under each Store Lease will be determined by multiplying
(a) a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross sales for the
Store from the first day of the current lease year to the Time of
Closing and the denominator of which is the projected annual
gross sales at that Store for the current lease year, by (b) the 

9 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 13
total projected percentage rent for the current lease year under
the Store Lease. The projected annual gross sales and the
projected percentage rent for the current lease year under each
Store Lease will be delivered to Buyers at the Time of Closing.

3.5 Review of Closing Date Statement; Resolution
of any Dispute. Following receipt of the Closing Date Statement,
Fabri-Centers will be afforded a period of 30 days to review the
Closing Date Statement and to complete a review of any work
papers prepared in connection with the preparation or audit of
the Closing Date Statement. At or before the end of the 30-day
review period, Fabri-Centers will either (a) accept the Closing
Date Statement in its entirety or (b) deliver to Brown Group
written notice identifying the items in the Closing Date
Statement that Fabri-Centers disputes. If Fabri-Centers does not
deliver any such written notice within the 30-day review period,
Fabri-Centers will be deemed to have accepted the Closing Date
Statement. Within a period of 14 days from the end of the 30-day
review period, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve
any disputed items. If they are unable to do so, the remaining
disputed items will be referred to the St. Louis, Missouri
offices of Price Waterhouse, a nationally recognized firm of
certified public accountants, for resolution. The parties will
share equally the cost of the certified public accountants. The
book value of the disputed items, as determined by the certified
public accountants, will be binding on the parties.

3.6 Purchase Price Adjustment. If the
consolidated net book value of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries
shown in the Closing Date Statement, after the resolution of any
dispute pursuant to Section 3.5, (the "Net LIFO Book Value") is
less than $62,000,000, FCA Ohio will have the right to recover,
from funds on deposit with the Escrow Agent, the amount by which
$62,000,000 exceeds the Net LIFO Book Value, together with
interest. To the extent that the funds on deposit with the
Escrow Agent are not sufficient to pay the full amount due to FCA
Ohio, Cloth World will pay the balance due to FCA Ohio, together
with interest. If the Net LIFO Book Value is more than
$62,000,000, FCA Ohio will pay to Cloth World the amount by which
the Net LIFO Book Value exceeds $62,000,000, together with
interest, and all funds on deposit with the Escrow Agent will be
remitted to Cloth World. Interest will accrue, from the Time of
Closing to the date of payment, at a rate equal to the average
monthly LIBOR plus 75 basis points. Any such payment will be
payable by check delivered within 5 business days after (a) the
acceptance by Fabri-Centers of the Closing Date Statement or (b)
the resolution of any dispute pursuant to Section 3.5, as the
case may be.

Contracts, and (v) none of Cloth World, any of the Subsidiaries,
or, to the best knowledge of Brown Group and Cloth World, any

of, any obligations under the Contracts. To the best knowledge
of Brown Group and Cloth World, none of the Contracts is subject
to any impending cancellation.

Business or the Acquired Assets: (i) neither Brown Group, Cloth
World, nor any of the Subsidiaries has taken any action with
respect to any Employee Plan that will cause, and the completion
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not

successors to the Business or otherwise, or a lien on the
Acquired Assets; (ii) none of Brown Group, Cloth World, or any of
the Subsidiaries has any obligation to contribute to, or has any
liability under ERISA for any complete or partial withdrawal
from, any "multiemployer pension plan" (within the meaning of

on the Acquired Assets; and (iii) no liability under Title IV of
ERISA has been incurred by Cloth World, any of the Subsidiaries,
or any of trades or businesses that would be aggregated with
Cloth World or any of the Subsidiaries for purposes of imposing
liability under Title IV of ERISA (an "ERISA Affiliate") that has
not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that
presents, and the completion of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement do not present, a material risk that Cloth World,
any of the Subsidiaries, or an ERISA Affiliate will incur a
liability under Title IV of ERISA other than liability for
premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

(d) COBRA. Brown Group or Cloth World has timely
provided or will timely provide all notices and any continuation

Cloth World, or any of the Subsidiaries have received notice

its other affiliates that in any material respect specifically
involves Cloth World, any of the Subsidiaries, any of Cloth
World's or a Subsidiary's current or former employees, the
Business, or any of Acquired Assets. Except as set forth in
Section 4.18 of the Disclosure Schedule, to the best knowledge of
Brown Group and Cloth World, no event has occurred or condition
exists that can reasonably be expected to result in any such
action, suit, proceeding, order, or investigation.

of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate
schedule of the workers' compensation liability of Cloth World
for claims made and remaining open.

and prior to the Time of Closing, does or will identify all
permits, licenses, and other authorizations material to the
Business or the Acquired Assets issued by a Governmental Entity
that are held by Brown Group, Cloth World, or any of the
Subsidiaries and are used in the Stores or the Business, and no
other permits, licenses, or authorizations are required for the
operation of the Stores or the Business substantially as
presently and ordinarily conducted. Except as disclosed in
Section 4.20 of the Disclosure Schedule, to the best knowledge of
Brown Group and Cloth World, each of Cloth World, and the
Subsidiaries is in material compliance with the terms of each of
the items identified on the Permit List, as supplemented, that
are applicable to it.

4.21 Compliance with Laws. 

(a) Except with respect to the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 and all regulations and guidelines
thereunder (the "ADA") and further except with respect to the
laws of states and instrumentalities of states concerning the
same general subject as that covered by the ADA, to the best
knowledge of Brown Group and Cloth World, the operation of the
Business as presently and ordinarily conducted complies in all
material respects with all applicable laws, rules, and
regulations, and to the best knowledge of Brown Group and Cloth
World, neither Cloth World nor any of the Subsidiaries has any
material liability for any past or present violation of any such
law, rule, or regulation.

(b) To the best knowledge of Brown Group and
Cloth World, all Stores remodeled or opened after the enactment 

22
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 26
of the ADA comply in all material respects with the requirements
of the ADA and with the requirements of the laws of states and
instrumentalities of states concerning the same general subject
as that covered by the ADA (assuming for this purpose that the
requirements of such laws are not substantially more burdensome
than the requirements of the ADA).

4.22 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth
in Section 4.22 of the Disclosure Schedule, none of Cloth World
or any of the Subsidiaries has released hazardous, toxic, or
polluting substances, including but not limited to PCBs, asbestos
or asbestos containing materials, petroleum, or petroleum
containing products ("Hazardous Substances") at, on, or from any
real property now or formerly owned, leased, or operated by Cloth
World or any of the Subsidiaries (including the Real Property). 
To the best knowledge of Brown Group and Cloth World, and except
as set forth in Section 4.22 of the Disclosure Schedule:

(a) The past and present conduct of the Business
by Cloth World and the Subsidiaries, and the use of any real
property now or formerly owned, leased, or operated by Cloth
World or any of the Subsidiaries (including the Real Property),
have been and are in compliance with applicable environmental
permits, laws, rules, regulations, and orders of Governmental
Entities. No Governmental Entity has made, issued, filed in any
court, or threatened to make, issue, or file in any court, any
notice of liability, notice of violation, demand, claim, request
for information, lien, citation, summons, complaint, or order
regarding an alleged violation of any such permits, laws, rules,
regulations, or orders.

(b) No person has to any material degree released
Hazardous Substances at, on, or from any real property now or
formerly owned, leased, or operated by Cloth World or any of the
Subsidiaries (including the Real Property).

(c) Brown Group has delivered to FCA Ohio
complete and accurate copies of all written reports of
environmental audits, inspections, or investigations in its
possession, if any, relating to the Business or any real property
now or formerly owned, leased, or operated by Cloth World or any
of the Subsidiaries (including the Real Property). None of these
reports, if any, suggests that Cloth World or any of the
Subsidiaries has any material liability for noncompliance or
remediation.

(d) No active or inactive underground or above
ground storage tanks in violation of law are located at any real
property now or formerly owned, leased, or operated by Cloth
World or any of the Subsidiaries (including the Real Property). 
No Hazardous Substances required by law to be cleaned up are 

23
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 27
located at or contaminate any real property now or formerly
owned, leased, or operated by Cloth World or any of the
Subsidiaries (including the Real Property).

4.23 Insurance. Section 4.23 of the Disclosure
Schedule lists all insurance policies and bonds obtained by
Sellers and in force with respect to the Acquired Assets or the
Business and, for each such policy, identifies the insurer, type
of coverage, policy limits and deductibles, and expiration date. 
All such policies are in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms, will remain in such full force and effect
to the Time of Closing, and are believed to be sufficient in all
material respects for compliance by Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries with all applicable requirements of law and of all
agreements to which any of them is a party.

4.24 Suppliers. Section 4.24 of the Disclosure
Schedule identifies each supplier from which Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries have purchased, either during the fiscal year ended
January 29, 1994 or during the period from January 29, 1994 to
the date of this Agreement, more than $50,000 of goods (other
than merchandise) or services or more than $250,000 of
merchandise. Section 4.24 of the Disclosure Schedule describes
any agreements or arrangements with any of these suppliers
regarding prices, payment terms, delivery times, service, or
other material terms of sale. Brown Group is not aware of any
anticipated changes in any of these agreements or arrangements,
of any material adverse change in the financial condition of any
of these suppliers, or of any other reason why any of these
suppliers cannot continue to do business with Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries on the same basis as heretofore.

4.25 Finders. No finder or broker has acted on
behalf of Brown Group, Cloth World, or any of the Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
other than Smith Barney, Inc., whose fee will be paid solely by

6.1 Operation of the Business Prior to the Time
of Closing. From the date of this Agreement until the Time of
Closing, Brown Group will cause Cloth World and the Subsidiaries
to operate the Business in all material respects in accordance
with the following procedures:

(a) Ordinary Course. Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries will continue to operate the Business as
presently and ordinarily conducted and will use all
reasonable efforts to preserve their existing
relationships with suppliers, customers, employees, and
others having business relations with the them.

25
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 29 
(b) Not Engage in Transactions Referred to
in Section 4.8. Neither Cloth World nor any of the
Subsidiaries will engage in any of the transactions
referred to in Section 4.8 without the prior written
consent of Fabri-Centers.

(c) Business Policies. Neither Cloth World
nor any of the Subsidiaries will change in any material
respect any of their business policies, including but
not limited to advertising, pricing, promotional,
purchasing, inventory, and personnel policies, without
the prior written consent of Fabri-Centers. Without
limiting the foregoing, neither Cloth World nor any of
the Subsidiaries will mark-down retail prices except in
accordance with existing pricing policies applied on a
basis consistent with past practices. Cloth World will
from time to time upon its reasonable request advise
Fabri-Centers of, and consult with Fabri-Centers
regarding, the types, mix, and quantities of inventory
that it intends to maintain in the Stores through the
end of the current fiscal year.

(d) Store Leases, Personal Property Leases,
and Executory Contracts. Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries will perform in all material respects the
terms and conditions of the Store Leases, Personal
Property Leases, and Executory Contracts.

(e) Maintain Properties. Cloth World and
the Subsidiaries will maintain all of the Acquired
Assets in customary condition and repair, except for
reasonable wear and tear and damage due to unforeseen
casualty.

(f) Maintain Books of Account. Cloth World
and the Subsidiaries will maintain their books of
account and records in the usual and ordinary manner
and in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

(g) Comply with Law. Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries will comply in all material respects with
all laws applicable to them or contest in good faith,
upon the advice of counsel, any alleged failure so to
comply with any such laws.

6.2 Access to Premises and Records. From the
date of this Agreement until the Time of Closing, Brown Group
will (a) permit Fabri-Centers and its representatives to review
the books and records relating to Cloth World, the Subsidiaries,
and the Business and furnish such additional financial and 

26
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 30
operating information relating thereto as Fabri-Centers may
reasonably request and (b) cause Cloth World and the Subsidiaries
to permit authorized representatives of Fabri-Centers, at
mutually agreeable times, to inspect the Stores and to interview
key officers and employees of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries. 
All of Fabri-Center's investigations will be conducted in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Brown Group's
normal business activities. Fabri-Centers agrees to treat all
proprietary information received from Brown Group, Cloth World,
and the Subsidiaries as confidential.

6.3 Training of Personnel. Prior to the Time of
Closing, Brown Group will cause Cloth World and the Subsidiaries
to permit Fabri-Centers and its representatives to enter the
Stores and to train employees of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries
in the operation of Fabri-Center's point-of-sale cash registers
and in other procedures practiced by employees of Fabri-Centers. 
All of Fabri-Center's training will be conducted in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with Brown Group's normal
business activities.

6.4 HSR Act. Fabri-Centers and Brown Group will
submit to the United States Department of Justice and the United
States Federal Trade Commission all of the forms and information
applicable to this transaction required under the HSR Act and
will use all reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any
request by them for additional information.

6.5 Efforts to Satisfy Conditions to Closing;
Waiver or Modification of Radius Clauses. Brown Group, Cloth
World, Fabri-Centers, and FCA Ohio will use all reasonable
efforts to satisfy the conditions to closing in Sections 7 and 8,
including all reasonable efforts to obtain the consents and
approvals by third parties and Governmental Entities required for
the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. To the extent requested by Fabri-Centers, Brown Group
and Cloth World will use all reasonable efforts to assist in
obtaining a waiver or modification of all Radius Clauses to the
extent that they would result in an increase in rentals due to
the proximity of Stores owned or operated by Fabri-Centers or any
of its affiliates. Fabri-Centers will control the discussions
with landlords regarding any such waiver or modification; neither
Brown Group, Cloth World, nor any of the Subsidiaries will,
without the prior written consent of Fabri-Centers, agree to an
increase in the rents, to any other material change in the terms
of any Store Lease, or to any payment to landlords in connection
with any such waiver or modification.

27
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 31 
6.6 Store Lease Consents.

(a) In connection with the sale and transfer
of the Store Leases in accordance with Section 1.1(c),
Brown Group, Cloth World, and Fabri-Centers will use
all reasonable efforts to obtain all Store Lease
Consents prior to the Time of Closing. Notwithstanding
any such sale and transfer of the Store Leases
hereunder, neither Brown Group nor Cloth World will
transfer any Store Lease hereunder unless the related
Store Lease Consent is obtained. If and to the extent
necessary to obtain any such Store Lease Consent,
Fabri-Centers will provide the landlord with all
financial and business information about Fabri-Centers
reasonably requested by such landlord or of a type
previously furnished by Fabri-Centers to its own
landlords. Fabri-Centers will control the discussions
with landlords regarding the Store Lease Consents and,
if necessary, regarding the cost of terminating any
Store Lease that cannot be transferred to FCA Ohio;
neither Brown Group, Cloth World, nor any of the
Subsidiaries will, without the prior written consent of
Fabri-Centers, agree to an increase in the rents, to
any other material change in the terms of any Store
Lease, or to any payment to landlords in connection
with the termination of any Store Leases that cannot be
transferred.

(b) In the event that Fabri-Centers, in
order to secure a Store Lease Consent agrees to an
increase in rents or makes a lump sum or other payment
to the landlord, in either case for the remaining
current lease term only, Fabri-Centers and Brown Group
will each pay one half (1/2) of the cost, subject to
the overall limitations upon Sellers' obligations for
Capped Liabilities set forth in Section 6.9. For this
purpose, the cost of any increase in rents will be
expressed as a present value, calculated using a
discount rate equal to 175 basis points in excess of
the yield to maturity on the average US Treasury
security having a duration equal to the lease duration,
and settled in cash as soon as the amount is
calculated.

(c) In the event of the failure to obtain
one or more Store Lease Consents prior to the Time of
Closing, Brown Group and Cloth World will continue for
a period of eighteen (18) months thereafter to use all
reasonable efforts to obtain the Store Lease Consents
as soon as practicable. Until these Store Lease
Consents are obtained or upon the expiration of such 

28
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 32 
period, whichever is earlier, Brown Group and Cloth World
will (i) to the extent they are legally able to do so,
consider FCA Ohio a sublessee under any such Store Leases
and make available to FCA Ohio any benefits Brown Group or
Cloth World receives, will receive, or are available to
Brown Group or Cloth World under such Store Leases, or
(ii) cooperate reasonably in devising another lawful
arrangement for transferring to FCA Ohio such benefits of
the related Store Leases, including, in the case of Store
Leases transferred into or held by Subsidiaries, the
transfer to FCA Ohio of the capital stock of the
Subsidiaries. If, notwithstanding these efforts, one or
more Store Lease Consents are not obtained and the parties
are unable to devise another arrangement for transferring to
FCA Ohio the benefits of the related Store Leases, Brown
Group will remain (as between itself and the landlord or
landlords in question) as primary obligor under the Store
Leases and, subject to the overall limitations upon Sellers'
obligations for Capped Liabilities set forth in Section 6.9,
pay future rents, the costs of terminating the Store Leases,
the costs of any associated litigation, and all other
amounts due under the Store Leases ("Store Lease
Liabilities"). 

(d) Sellers' obligations with respect to the
Store Leases will be limited to the foregoing
undertakings. There will be no adjustment in the
purchase price as a result of any failure or failures
on the part of Buyers to have received a Store Lease
Consent or any right of occupancy or use of any
property under a Store Lease.

(e) Any other term or provision in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, at such time as Sellers
have paid the Aggregate Cap (as defined in Section 6.9) for
the Capped Liabilities (as defined in Section 6.9), Buyers
will pay, discharge, satisfy in full without any recourse to
Sellers, and indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from and
against, any and all remaining liabilities with repect to
the Store Leases, including without limitation the Store
Lease Liabilities, although Buyers will not be deemed
thereby to have assumed any Store Leases for which the
requisite Store Lease Consents have not been obtained. 

6.7 Divestiture of any Stores Required to Obtain
Governmental Approvals. In the event that the divestiture of one
or more of the Stores is required in order to obtain any
governmental approval required for the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not
limited to approval by the Federal Trade Commission or the 

29
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 33
Justice Department of the United States ("Required
Divestitures"), Fabri-Centers will carry out the divestiture in a
manner that it, in its judgment, considers to be reasonable and
appropriate under the circumstances; Fabri-Centers will not,
however, be required to take, or cause to be taken, any action
that would result in divestitures or other conditions or
requirements that Fabri-Centers, in its reasonable judgment,
deems to be materially burdensome. At the time each such Store
is divested, Brown Group will, subject to the overall limitations
upon Sellers' ogligations for Capped Liabilities set forth in
Section 6.9, pay to FCA Ohio one half (1/2) of the amount
determined with respect to that Store using the following
formula:

[A times (B / C)] plus D minus E minus F

Where:

A = $62,000,000, adjusted in accordance with Section 3.6.

B = Gross sales at that Store for the fiscal year ended
January 29, 1994 (or, if the Store was not open for the
full fiscal year, gross sales at the Store for that
fiscal year on an annualized basis).

C = Gross sales at all of the Stores for the fiscal year
ended January 29, 1994.

D = The costs incurred by Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio in
connection with the divestiture, including any amounts
paid in connection with the transfer of the related
Store Lease, associated attorneys' fees, and other out-
of-pocket expenses.

E = The proceeds, if any, realized upon the transfer of the
related Store Lease.

F = The book value of the Inventory at the Store, net of
obsolescence reserve, as of the Time of Closing, as
reflected in the Closing Date Statement.

Any other term or provision in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, Sellers' liability under this
Section 6.7 will be subject to the overall limitations upon
Sellers' obligations for Capped Liabilities set forth in Section
6.9. That is to say, at such time as Sellers have paid the
Aggregate Cap for the Capped Liabilities, Buyers will pay,
discharge, satisfy in full without any recourse to Sellers, and
indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from and against, any and all
remaining liabilities with repect to the Required Divestitures. 

30
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 34 
6.8 Severance Obligations. 

(a) To Donald Richey and Warehouse Employees. 
Sellers will retain all obligations and liabilities arising
prior to the Time of Closing that they may have to Mr.
Donald Richey and to employees of Sellers at the Warehouse
(other than the manager of the Warehouse), including any
obligation to provide severance pay or other benefits
following termination of employment or the sale of the
Business. These obligations and liabilities will not be
subject to the Aggregate Cap.

(b) To All Other Employees. Subject to the
provisions of this Section 6.8(b) which follow, Brown Group
and Cloth World will also retain all obligations and
liabilities to provide severance pay to employees of Cloth
World and its Subsidiaries other than Hired Employees,
Donald Richey, and the Warehouse employees referred to in
Section 6.8(a), and will reimburse Fabri-Centers and FCA
Ohio for any severance pay that they are required to pay to
Hired Employees whose employment is terminated for any
reason within six months after the Time of Closing ("Capped
Severance Obligations"), subject in each case to the overall
limitations upon Sellers' obligations for Capped Liabilities
set forth in Section 6.9. Although Sellers will administer
the payment of all such Capped Severance Obligations, any
other term or provision in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, Sellers' liability under this Section 6.8
will be subject to the overall limitations upon Sellers'
obligations for Capped Liabilities set forth in Section 6.9. 
That is to say, at such time as Sellers have paid the
Aggregate Cap for the Capped Liabilities, Buyers will pay,
discharge, satisfy in full without any recourse to Sellers,
and indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from and against,
any and all remaining liabilities with repect to the
Severance Obligations.

(c) Sellers will be responsible for and
discharge any and all obligations to Warehouse
employees (other than the manager of the Warehouse)
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act ("WARN"), and Buyers will be responsible for and
discharge any and all obligations under WARN with
respect to all other employees of Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries, although Sellers will provide any notices
called for under WARN as directed by Buyers.

6.9 Overall Limitation on Sellers' Obligations
for Capped Liabilities. Any other term or provision in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Sellers' aggregate
payment obligations with respect to Store Lease Liabilities, 

31
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 35
Required Divestitures, and Capped Severance Obligations ("Capped
Liabilities") will be limited to an overall cap of $1,900,000
(the "Aggregate Cap"). It will be at Buyers' reasonable
discretion which category or categories of expenses are paid by
Sellers in reaching the Aggregate Cap. Once the Aggregate Cap is
reached, Sellers will have no further obligations whatsoever,
Buyers will pay and discharge all liabilities with respect to
Store Leases, Required Divestitures, or Capped Severance
Obligations, and Sellers will have no further obligations
whatsoever with respect thereto. Sellers will receive full
credit against the Aggregate Cap for any and all payments they
make directly to third parties in connection with Capped
Liabilities.

6.10 Environmental Audits. As soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, FCA Ohio may, at
its expense, obtain an environmental audit by a firm of
nationally recognized experts in the field who are reasonably
acceptable to Sellers of any Real Property that it elects to have
audited. If such environmental audit discloses, with respect to
any portion of the Real Property, the presence of Hazardous
Substances or other conditions that violate applicable
environmental permits, laws, rules, regulations, or orders of
Governmental Entities, FCA Ohio may elect to exclude from the
Acquired Assets any portion of the Real Property requiring
remediation ("Remediation Property"), in which case the
Remediation Property will be excluded from the Closing Date
Statement. In such event, Sellers may elect not to proceed with
the sale of any Acquired Assets hereunder and to terminate all
their obligations under this Agreement.

will reimburse Brown Group for the direct costs of all employees
who work full time to provide these services, for an agreed upon
percentage of the direct costs of all employees who work part
time to provide these services, and for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses, indirect and overhead expenses
(to the extent that such expenses represent a reasonable
allocation of the actual cost of the related services), and
incentive expenses approved by Fabri-Centers that are incurred by
Brown Group in providing these services, including amounts due
under the lease of the Warehouse attributable to the period in
which the warehouse services are provided.

7. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATION OF FABRI-CENTERS AND FCA
OHIO 

The obligation of Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio to
complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
subject to the satisfaction, in all material respects, at or
before the Time of Closing of the following conditions:

7.1 Performance of Agreements. Brown Group and
Cloth World have performed in all material respects all
obligations to be performed by them under this Agreement at or
before the Time of Closing.

7.2 Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties made by Brown Group and Cloth
World in this Agreement are true in all material respects at and
as of the Time of Closing as though the representations and
warranties had been made at and as of the Time of Closing.

7.3 No Material Adverse Change. Between the date
of this Agreement and the Time of Closing, there has been no
material adverse change in the consolidated financial condition,
the consolidated results of operations, or the Business of Cloth
World and the Subsidiaries, it being understood, however, that
any material adverse change proximately resulting from either a
negligent or wrongful act or omission of Buyers or from the
disclosure of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
it will not permit the Buyers to refuse to complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.4 Due Diligence Condition. In the course of
completing its due diligence investigation, nothing has come to
the attention of Fabri-Centers that causes it reasonably to
believe, and it does in fact so believe (all as evidenced with
specificity in resolutions of Buyers' Boards of Directors
promptly delivered to Sellers), that (i) the financial and other
information disclosed to Fabri-Centers before the date of this
Agreement does not represent, in all material respects, the value
and financial performance of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (ii) the value of Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, premised on information available
to Fabri-Centers after the date of this Agreement is materially
less than the value of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries premised
on information disclosed to Fabri-Centers before the date of this
Agreement.

7.5 Financing. Fabri-Centers has obtained
financing, on terms reasonably satisfactory to it, for the cash
portion of the consideration for the Acquired Assets. If this
Agreement is terminated due to the failure by Fabri-Centers to
obtain financing, Fabri-Centers will promptly (and in no event 

33
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 37
later than 30 days after receipt of an invoice from Sellers)
reimburse Brown Group and Cloth World for all of their document
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, the fees
and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by them
in connection with the negotiation, execution, and performance of
this Agreement or of any other Closing Document or in connection
with the due diligence conducted by Fabri-Centers. 

7.6 No Injunction. No temporary restraining
order or preliminary or final injunction prohibiting the
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has
been issued (other than at the instance of Buyers) and is in
effect. No action, suit, proceeding, order, or investigation
(other than at the instance of Buyers) is pending or threatened
before any federal, state, municipal, or other court or
Governmental Entity that, if adversely determined, could have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition,
the consolidated results of operations, or the Business of Cloth
World and the Subsidiaries or could materially impair the ability
of Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio to operate the Business from and
after the Time of Closing as presently and ordinarily conducted.

7.7 HSR Act. All applicable pre-merger
notification and waiting period requirements under the HSR Act
have been satisfied.

7.8 Other Third-Party Consents and Governmental
Approvals. All third-party consents and governmental approvals
required for the completion of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than the Store Lease Consents, have been
obtained in writing and delivered to FCA Ohio.

had been made at and as of the Time of Closing.

been issued (other than at the instance of Sellers) and is in
effect.

11. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION

11.1 Survival of Covenants, Representations,
Warranties and Indemnification. The covenants made by Brown
Group, Cloth World, Fabri-Centers, and FCA Ohio in this Agreement
will survive the Time of Closing and any investigation or inquiry
made by any of them without limitation as to time except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement. The representations and
warranties made by Brown Group, Cloth World, Fabri-Centers, and
FCA Ohio in this Agreement will also survive the Time of Closing
and any investigation or inquiry, although any claim for the
incorrectness or breach of these representations or warranties
must be brought by written Notice of Indemnification Claim in the
form attached as Exhibit 11.1 delivered to the party from whom
indemnification is sought within the following periods:

(a) With respect to the representations and
warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, and 5.2,
within a period of 3 years following the Time of
Closing.

(b) With respect to the representations and
warranties in Section 4.10, prior to the lapse of time
specified in the applicable statutes of limitation.

(c) With respect to all representations and
warranties not referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of
this Section 11.1, within a period of 18 months
following the Time of Closing.

All claims not brought by means of such written
notice delivered within such applicable period of limitations 

38
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 42
specified above will thereupon expire and will be forever
barred. 

Indemnification undertakings will expire
concurrently with expiration of the respective covenants,
representations, or warranties on which they are based.

11.2 Indemnification by Brown Group and Cloth
World. Subject to Sections 11.1 and 11.5, Brown Group and Cloth
World will, jointly and severally, indemnify Fabri-Centers and
FCA Ohio for any claim, loss, cost, liability, or expense
(including attorneys' fees and costs of litigation) that may be
asserted against or incurred by them as a proximate result of (a)
the incorrectness of any of the representations or warranties
made by Brown Group or Cloth World in this Agreement, (b) the
breach of any of the covenants made by Brown Group or Cloth World
in this Agreement, or (c) the assertion against Fabri-Centers or
FCA Ohio of any of the Retained Liabilities.

11.3 Indemnification By Fabri-Centers and FCA
Ohio. Subject to Sections 11.1 and 11.5, Fabri-Centers and FCA
Ohio will, jointly and severally, indemnify Brown Group, Cloth
World, and the Subsidiaries for any claim, loss, cost, liability,
or expense (including attorneys' fees and costs of litigation)
that may be asserted against or incurred by Brown Group or Cloth
World as a proximate result of (a) the incorrectness of any of
the representations or warranties made by Fabri-Centers or FCA
Ohio in this Agreement, (b) the breach of any of the covenants
made by Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio in this Agreement, (c) the
assertion against Brown Group, Cloth World, or the Subsidiaries
of any of the Assumed Liabilities or, after Sellers have paid the
Aggregate Cap for the Capped Liabilities, the assertion against
Brown Group, Cloth World, or the Subsidiaries of any of the
Capped Liabilities, (d) any damage or injury proximately
resulting from an act or omission of Buyers or their agents or
employees while on Sellers' premises in connection with any due
diligence investigation or training activity prior to the Time of
Closing. 

11.4 Notice and Defense of Claims. A party (the
"Asserting Party") claiming indemnification under this Agreement,
including indemnification under Section 2.1, 3.1, 6.9, or 11 of
this Agreement, will promptly notify in writing the party from
whom indemnification is being sought (the "Indemnifying Party")
of the nature and basis of the claim for indemnification; the
failure to give any such notice will not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party from its obligation to provide indemnification
under this Section 11. If the claim relates to a claim or other
action by a third party against the Asserting Party or any fixed
or contingent liability to a third party (a "Third Party Claim"),
the Indemnifying Party may elect to assume the defense of the 

39
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 43
Third Party Claim at its own expense with counsel selected by it. 
The Indemnifying Party may not, however, assume the defense if
the named partes to the Third Party Claim (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the
Asserting Party and the representation of both parties by the
same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them; in any such case, the Asserting
Party will have the right to employ, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, counsel approved by the Indemnifying Party. 
If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any fees or
expenses of counsel for the Asserting Party incurred in
connection with the Third Party Claim (except in the case of
potential differing interests, as provided in the preceding
sentence). If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense
of the Third Party Claim, the Asserting Party will have the right
to settle the Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's
expense. The Asserting Party and the Indemnifying Party will
cooperate in the defense of any claim, action, or proceeding
covered by this Section 12. The Asserting Party will make
available to the Indemnifying Party or its representatives all
records and other materials reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party for use in contesting any Third Party Claim.

11.5 Deductible. No action may be brought
against any party hereto on account of or in any way related to
any representation or warranty in any Closing Document (as
hereinafter defined), or for any indemnity for breach of any such
representation or warranty, unless and until the person or entity
claiming to have been injured thereby has sustained actual
damages in excess of $300,000 (the "Deductible") as a proximate
result of such party's misrepresentations or breaches of
warranty. Such action will be limited to recovery of only those
damages which exceed the Deductible. The limitation in this
Section 11.5 does not apply to any indemnification under Sections
11.2(b), 11.2(c), 11.3(b), 11.3(c) or 11.3(d).

12. COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE

For a period of five years after the Time of
Closing, Brown Group and Cloth World will not, and will cause
their affiliates not to, own or operate any retail store that
sells sewing fabrics, apparel fabric, home furnishings, notions,
patterns, craft fabric, crafts, seasonal goods, or flowers of a
type sold on the date of this Agreement at the Stores, or at
Fabri-Centers' Jo-Ann Fabrics stores, at any place within the
continental United States; except that, this Section 12 will not
prohibit Brown Group, Cloth World or any of their affiliates 
from owning not more than five percent in the aggregate of the 

40
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 44
outstanding shares of any corporation whose shares are traded on
a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market.

13. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

and Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio will pay all fees and expenses
incurred by Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio, whether before or after
the Time of Closing, in connection with the transactions

13.3 Waiver and Amendment. Any provision of this
Agreement may be waived in writing by the party that is entitled
to the benefit of that provision. This Agreement may be amended
or supplemented at any time, although no such amendment or
supplement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed
by both Brown Group and Fabri-Centers.

13.4 Entire Agreement; No Rights or Remedies to
Other Persons. This Agreement, including the Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire agreement
among the parties on its subject matter and supersedes all prior
agreements, both written and oral, and (b) is not intended to
confer any rights or remedies upon any individual or organization
other than the parties. The Confidentiality Agreement, however,
between Brown Group and Fabri-Centers dated as of May 10, 1993
(including the Addendum thereto dated August 9,1994) is hereby
confirmed, will survive execution of this Agreement and will
remain in full force and effect until the purchase price has been

14. GENERAL PROVISIONS OF GLOBAL APPLICATION

THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS ARE OF GENERAL
APPLICATION TO THE AGREEMENT AND TO THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS (AS
HEREINAFTER DEFINED) AND THEY WILL APPLY AND GOVERN ANY OTHER
TERM OR PROVISION HEREIN OR IN ANY OTHER CLOSING DOCUMENT TO THE
CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING:

14.1 Any and all disclosures made anywhere in
this Agreement or any other Closing Document will be considered
also to have been made in every exhibit and schedule hereto and
thereto. No schedule, exhibit or other document will be deemed
to be part of this Agreement unless the same has been
specifically referred to herein, marked as such and physically
attached hereto. There are no representations or warranties of
any kind whatsoever made herein by any party hereto except those
which are expressly set forth herein or in another Closing
Document.

14.2 Any party obligated hereunder or under any
other Closing Document to use "reasonable efforts" will be deemed
to have satisfied such obligation in full by the use of all
reasonable business efforts.

14.3 Any provision in this Agreement or in any
Closing Document that any document, act, forbearance, or 

43
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 47
undertaking be "satisfactory" to a party will be interpreted to
mean "reasonably satisfactory" to such party.

14.4 Each representation and/or warranty, whether
made herein or in another Closing Document, stated to have been
made "to the best knowledge" of the party making same, or words
of similar import, will be limited to mean only the actual
knowledge of the officers of Brown Group who have direct
involvement with Cloth World, Brown Group's General Counsel and
lawyers in the office of the General Counsel, officers of Cloth
World, Cloth World's store planning group, Cloth World's lease
administrators, and Jim Hankins and buyers reporting to him,
without any further inquiry or diligence on the part of such
person.

14.5 Unless the context clearly requires
otherwise, all references to this Agreement and to the Closing
Documents will include all exhibits and schedules hereto and
thereto respectively.

14.6 No representation or warranty of any party
will be deemed to have been breached because it is or may be
untrue or inaccurate on the date this Agreement is executed if,
as a result of corrective action initiated at or prior to the
Time of Closing by or on behalf of the party making such
representation or warranty, it becomes or is made true or
accurate on or before the time of Closing.

14.7 Whenever a representation or warranty
contains the word "may", "might", "could" or "would" in respect
to the future effect of an act, omission or occurrence, the same
will be deemed to mean "can reasonably be expected to".

14.8 The term "Closing Document" or "Closing
Documents" will mean and be limited to this Agreement and the
documents referred to in Sections 9.2 and 9.3.

14.9 If the subject of a representation or
warranty which is limited to a specific subject matter is also
covered by a representation or warranty of more general
application, the limitations and qualifications upon the
representation or warranty which appear in the more specific
section will also apply to the more general provision to the
extent that the more general provision covers the subject of the
specific provision.

14.10 Whenever a Closing Document provides for
the consent or approval of any party hereto, such consent or
approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

44 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 48 
14.11 The phrase "full force and effect" when
used in a Closing Document in relation to an agreement, lease or
other instrument or undertaking will mean and be limited to "full
force and effect in accordance with its terms."

Sellers (such as, without limitation, giving Sellers'
representatives reasonable access to Buyers' premises and
employees) in respect of Sellers' obligations to minimize,
resolve and discharge the Retained Liabilities.
