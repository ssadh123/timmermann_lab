Item 5. Other Events.

On February 8, 1994, Great Lakes Minerals Inc. of Toronto ("Great
Lakes"), purchased for $13,280,857 a 20% undivided interest in the Grouse Creek
Gold Project from Hecla Mining Company ("Hecla") pursuant the Acquisition
Agreement - Grouse Creek Project, dated January 21, 1994, among Hecla, Great
Lakes Idaho Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Lakes) and Great Lakes,
and the Mining Venture Agreement dated as of February 8, 1994, between Hecla
and Great Lakes Idaho Inc. (collectively, the "Grouse Agreements"). Pursuant
to the Grouse Agreements, Great Lakes is required to fund its 20% pro rata
portion of capital expenditures required to bring the Grouse Creek Gold Project
to commercial production (including its portion of capital expenditures
incurred to date). In addition, the Grouse Agreements provide that Great Lakes
has the option at any time prior to 12 months following the commencement of
commercial production at the Grouse Creek Gold Project to purchase up to an
additional 10% undivided interest in the Grouse Creek Gold Project. Under the
Grouse Agreements, Great Lakes would pay Hecla an amount estimated at
approximately U.S. $277,000 for each additional one percent (1%) undivided
interest in the Project, and would in addition thereto fund its increased share
of capital expenditures.

Great Lakes funded the purchase of its interest in the Grouse Creek
Gold Project from the sale in an underwritten public offering of 17,500,000
Great Lakes Common Shares at a price of Cdn. $2.00 per Common share for gross
proceeds of Cdn. $35,000,000. Great Lakes is required to fund its portion of
the capital expenditure requirements for the Grouse Creek Gold Project with the
net proceeds of this offering. Pursuant to the Grouse Agreements, Hecla
purchased 825,000 Great Lakes Common Shares at the offering price of Cdn. $2.00
per Common Share, using $1,229,875 of the proceeds received by Hecla from Great
Lakes for the purchase of its interest in the Grouse Creek Gold Project. In
addition, Great Lakes issued Hecla a warrant certificate entitling Hecla to
acquire up to 500,000 additional Common Shares of Great Lakes at Cdn. $2.50 per
share, which price is subject to adjustment in the event of any
recapitalization or distribution of dividends other than cash by Great Lakes.

which the dispute was referred to him or them, shall be binding upon the Vendor
and the Purchaser and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The
Vendor and the Purchaser shall co-operate in completing any arbitration as
expeditiously as possible and the arbitrator or arbitrators may engage such
experts to assist him or them as may appear to him or them appropriate. Each
of the Vendor and Purchaser shall bear its costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the arbitration and other costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the arbitration shall be borne equally by the Vendor and

with the purchase of the Grouse Creek Assets contemplated hereby other than as
a result of a material misrepresentation of the condition of the Grouse Creek

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and agree-
ments contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

Exhibit B.

direct or cause direction of management and policies through
ownership of voting securities, contract, voting trust or

curred by the Participants with respect to a Program and a schedule
of cash advances to be made by the Participants. 

1.7 "Capital Expenditures" means those items presented in

may qualify as capital expenditures under U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles consistently applied.

1.8 "Development" means all preparation for the removal and

a mill, processing plant, leach pads, or any other improvements to
be used for the mining, handling, milling, treatment, processing or

1.10 "Inflationary Adjustments" means an adjustment to reflect
any changes in the United States Producer Price Index, finished
goods, excluding consumer foods (hereinafter referred to as "PPI")
as follows:

Beginning with the calendar year after the Effective Date of
this Agreement and continuing thereafter for so long as this
Agreement is in effect, the amounts contemplated as requiring
inflationary adjustments for the calendar year shall be determined
by multiplying such amounts by the sum of 1 and the percentage
change between the PPI (1982 base) for the second preceding
calendar year and the PPI (1982 base) for the preceding year. The
actual amounts, as adjusted, shall be rounded to the nearest cent,
and said adjustment shall be made for each calendar year within
forty-five (45) days after the final PPI for the previous calendar
year is published. The adjusted amounts shall apply only during
the calendar year for which the adjustment is made and shall,
therefore, be retroactive to January 1 of that year. 

The PPI is determined and published by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. In the event
that the Bureau of Labor Statistics should shift the PPI to a new
reference base period, the PPI for the new reference base period
will be converted from the 1982 base period to the new base before
adjusting the amounts contemplated as requiring inflationary
adjustments. The conversion procedure for changing from one base

-4-
<PAGE> 5

to another will be that published or recommended by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. In the event that the PPI is discontinued, all
subsequent adjustments for inflation shall be made on a basis
proportional to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as
determined by the nearest comparable commodity price index that is
then available. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics shall
be construed to mean any successor agency that shall be empowered
by the United States government to collect and publish statistics
comparable to the PPI.

decimal places and rounded to two (e.g., 1.519% rounded to 1.52%). 
Decimals of .005 or more shall be rounded up to .01, decimals of
less than .005 shall be rounded down. The Initial Participating
Interests of the Participants are set forth in Article 6.1.

ARTICLE 4
RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTICIPANTS

4.1 No Partnership. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to constitute either Participant the partner of the
other, nor, except as otherwise herein expressly provided, to
constitute either Participant the agent or legal representative of
the other, nor to create any fiduciary relationship between them. 
It is not the intention of the Participants to create, nor shall
this Agreement be construed to create, any Mining, commercial or
other partnership. Neither Participant shall have any authority to
act for or to assume any obligation or responsibility on behalf of
the other Participant, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein. The rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the

-12-
<PAGE> 13

Participants shall be several and not joint or collective. Each
Participant shall be responsible only for its obligations as herein
set out and shall be liable only for its share of the costs and
expenses as provided herein, it being the express purpose and
intention of the Participants that their ownership of Assets and
the rights acquired hereunder shall be as tenants in common. Each
Participant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other
Participant, its directors, officers, employees, agents and
attorneys from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and
liabilities arising out of any act or any assumption of liability
by the indemnifying Participant, or any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents and attorneys done or undertaken, or apparently
done or undertaken, on behalf of the other Participant, except pur-
suant to the authority expressly granted herein or as otherwise
agreed in writing between the Participants. 

4.2 Federal Tax Elections. The Participants hereby agree to
elect that this Agreement and all Operations hereunder be excluded
from the applications of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter
1 of Subtitle A of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
as amended, and the similar provisions of applicable state law. 
Each Participant agrees to effect this election pursuant to Section
761(a) of the Code. Subject to the written approval of the
Participants, the Manager shall prepare and file the proper
documents to insure the Participant's exclusion from Subchapter K
and from similar provisions of applicable state law, and shall

-13-
<PAGE> 14

provide a copy of such documents forthwith thereafter to each of
the Participants.

4.3 State Income Tax. The Participants also agree that, to
the extent permissible under applicable law, their relationship
shall be treated for state income tax purposes in the same manner
as it is for federal income tax purposes. 

4.4 Tax Returns. The Manager shall prepare and shall file,
after approval of the Management Committee, any tax returns or
other tax forms required on behalf of the Venture.

4.5 Other Business Opportunities. Except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, each Participant shall have the right
independently to engage in and receive full benefits from business
activities, whether or not competitive with the Operations, without
consulting the other. The doctrines of "corporate opportunity" or
"business opportunity" shall not be applied to any other activity,
venture, or operation of either Participant, and neither
Participant shall have any obligation to the other with respect to
any opportunity to acquire any property outside the Area of
Interest at any time or, except as otherwise provided in Article
12.5, within the Area of Interest after the termination of this
Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, no Participant
shall have any obligation to mill, beneficiate or otherwise treat

-14-
<PAGE> 15

any Products or any other Participant's share of Products in any
facility owned or controlled by such Participants. 

4.6 Record Title. Title to the Properties shall be held in
the name of the Manager for the benefit of the Participants in
accordance with their Participating Interests. A memorandum of the
Agreement shall be recorded in the applicable real property
records. Title to all other Assets shall be held in the name of
the Manager for the benefit of the Participants in the Venture
provided however that the Company shall be entitled to require the
Manager to execute, file and record documents as may be required by
the Company to document or provide notice of the Company's
Participating Interest in any or all of the Assets. Such filings
or recordings may include, but are not limited to, Uniform
Commercial Code filings, memoranda of real property interests,
filings with the Bureau of Land Management and filings with other
government agencies. Notwithstanding that any such filing or
recording may indicate that the Company has a "security" or other
interest in the Assets, the Company's Participating Interest in the
Assets is an ownership interest as contemplated by this Agreement.

4.7 Waiver of Right to Partition. The Participants hereby
waive and release all rights of partition, or of sale in lieu
thereof, or other division of Assets, including any such rights
provided by statute. 

-15-
<PAGE> 16

4.8 Transfer or Termination of Rights to Properties. Except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither Participant shall
Transfer all or any part of its interest in the Assets or this
Agreement or otherwise permit or cause such interests to terminate. 

4.9 Implied Covenants. There are no implied covenants con-
tained in this Agreement other than those of good faith and fair
dealing. 

ARTICLE 5
CONTRIBUTIONS BY PARTICIPANTS

5.1 Participants' Initial Contributions. Hecla, as its
Initial Contribution, hereby contributes its 80% interest in the
Assets to the purposes of this Agreement. The agreed value of
Hecla's Initial Contribution is $48,523,432. The Company, as its
Initial Contribution, hereby contributes its 20% interest in the
Assets to the purposes of this Agreement. The agreed value of the
Company's Initial Contribution is $12,120,858.

5.2 Additional Cash Contributions. The Participants, subject
to any election permitted by Article 6.3, shall be obligated to
contribute funds to approved Programs and Budgets in proportion to
their respective Participating Interest.

-16-
<PAGE> 17

5.3 Funding of Reclamation and Closure Costs. The
Participants agree that funds regularly shall be set aside by the
Venture during the term of this Agreement in an amount sufficient
to meet reclamation and other closure costs which are reasonably
estimated to be required for reclamation and closure for all
Operations conducted pursuant to this Agreement. The Management
Committee will periodically, but not less frequently than once
every one (1) year, estimate the amount of funds which will be
required for such purposes and will establish the amount of annual
funding required which, together with interest thereon, will
accumulate to such estimate. The estimated annual required funding
will be made part of the Program and Budget and shall be satisfied
by cash contributions from the Participants or the posting of a
letter of credit or other form of surety. Provided, however, that
if a Participant posts a letter of credit or other form of surety,
that Participant shall be obligated to make additional
contributions on an annual basis so that the value of the letter of
credit or other surety equals the value of a cash contribution plus
interest at the rate of return realized by investment of the cash
contribution as provided in this Article 5.3. Funds will be
deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account or such other
revenue generating investment account as the Management Committee
shall direct. Withdrawals from such accounts will be restricted to
the specified purpose of paying end of mine life reclamation and
closure costs; provided, however, that the Management Committee
may, from time-to-time, use such funds to perform reclamation that

-17-
<PAGE> 18

would otherwise have to be undertaken at the end of Operations so
long as the ability to fund all such reclamation is not impaired. 
If any escrow funds remain after reclamation and closure
obligations have been fulfilled, they shall be distributed to the
Participants in proportion to the Participants' Participating
Interests at the time of distribution.

ARTICLE 6
INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS

6.1 Initial Participating Interests. The Participants shall
have the following Initial Participating Interests: 
Hecla - 80%
The Company - 20%

6.2 Changes in Participating Interests. A Participant's Par-
ticipating Interest shall be changed as follows: 

(a) As provided in Article 6.5; or

(b) As provided in Article 9 of the Acquisition Agreement; or

(c) Upon an election by a Participant pursuant to Article 6.3
to contribute less to Capitalized Expenditures which are a part
of an approved Program and Budget than the percentage reflected
by its Participating Interest; or

-18-
<PAGE> 19

(d) In the event of default by a Participant in making its
agreed-upon contribution to an approved Program and Budget,
followed by an election by the other Participant to invoke
Article 6.4(c); or

(e) Transfer by a Participant of less than all its Parti-
cipating Interest in accordance with Article 15; or

(f) Acquisition of less than all of the Participating Interest
of the other Participant, however arising. 

6.3 Voluntary Reduction in Participation. Except with respect
to a Participant's obligation to make its Initial Contribution and
contributions toward the Venture's operating cost requirements
under the most recent approved Program and Budget, as to which no
election is permitted, a Participant may elect, as provided in
Article 9.5, to limit its contributions toward the Venture's
Capitalized Expenditures which are a part of an approved Program
and Budget as follows: 

(a) To some lesser amount than its respective Participating
Interest; or

(b) Not at all.

-19-
<PAGE> 20

If a Participant elects to contribute to an approved Program
and Budget some lesser amount toward Capitalized Expenditures than
its respective Participating Interest, or not at all, the
Participating Interest of that Participant shall be recalculated at
the time of election by dividing: (A) the sum of (a) the agreed
value of the Participant's Initial Contribution under Article 5.1,
(b) the total of all of the Participant's contributions toward the
Venture's Capitalized Expenditures under Article 5.2, and (c) the
amount, if any, the Participant elects to contribute toward the
Venture's Capitalized Expenditures in the approved Program and
Budget; by (B) the sum of (a), (b) and (c) above for all
Participants; and then multiplying the result by one hundred (100). 
The Participating Interest of the other Participant shall thereupon
become the difference between one hundred percent (100%) and the
recalculated Participating Interest. 

6.4 Default in Meeting Cash Calls

(a) If a Participant defaults in paying a cash call pursuant
to section 10.2, the non-defaulting Participant may, in its
sole discretion, advance the defaulted amount on behalf of the
defaulting Participant and treat the same, together with any
accrued interest, as a demand loan bearing interest from the
date of the advance at the rate provided in Article 10.3. The
failure to repay the loan upon demand shall be a default. Each
Participant hereby grants to the other a lien upon its interest

-20-
<PAGE> 21

in the Properties and a security interest in its rights under
this Agreement and in its Participating Interest in other
Assets, and the proceeds therefrom, to secure any loan made
hereunder, including interest thereon, reasonable attorneys'
fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
recovering the loan with interest and in enforcing such lien
or security interest, or both. A non-defaulting Participant
may elect the applicable remedy under 6.4(a), 6.4(b), or
6.4(c), or, to the extent a Participant has a lien or security
interest under applicable law, it shall be entitled to its
rights and remedies at law and in equity. All such rights and
remedies shall be cumulative. The election of one or more
remedies shall not waive the election of any other remedies. 
Each Participant hereby irrevocably appoints the other its
attorney-in-fact to execute, file and record all instruments
necessary to perfect or effect the provisions hereof. 

(b) If a default in paying a cash call or loan is not cured within
sixty (60) days after notice to the defaulting Participant of
such default, the defaulting party shall have until six (6)
months after the date of the cash call pursuant to section 10.2
to cure the default by paying to the non-defaulting Participant
an amount equal to the amount of the cash call for which the
Participant is in default multiplied by 1.75 (the "Damages
Amount"). During the period of default commencing after the
initial 60-day period, the non-defaulting Participant shall be

-21-
<PAGE> 22

entitled to the proceeds from the Participant's share of
Products to fund the required cash call, up to a maximum of the
Damages Amount. If such proceeds are sufficient to pay the
entire Damages Amount, the defaulting Participant shall be
deemed to have cured the default and shall owe nothing further
to the non-defaulting Participant. If such proceeds are
insufficient to pay the entire Damages Amount, the defaulting
Participant may cure the default by paying to the non-
defaulting Participant the difference between the Damages
Amount and the amount received from such proceeds within the
six (6) month period by the non-defaulting Participant.

(c) The Participants acknowledge that if a Participant defaults
in paying a cash call, or in repaying a loan, or paying the
Damages Amount, as required hereunder, it will be difficult to
measure the damages resulting from any such default. In the
event of any such default, as reasonable liquidated damages,
the non-defaulting Participant may, with respect to any such
default not cured within six (6) months after the date of the
cash call pursuant to section 10.2, elect to treat such default
as a deemed withdrawal from the Venture, in which event the
defaulting Participant's Participating Interest shall terminate
and shall be automatically relinquished to the non-defaulting
Participant; provided, however, subject to section 6.7, the
defaulting Participant shall have the right to receive only
from 10% of Net Proceeds (calculated as provided in Exhibit C),

-22-
<PAGE> 23

if any, and not from any other source, an amount equal to the
defaulting Participant's aggregate contributions pursuant to
Articles 5.1 and 5.2 less the value of all Products or proceeds
therefrom previously received from the Venture by the
defaulting Participant. Upon receipt of such amount the
defaulting Participant shall thereafter have no further right,
title or interest in Assets or under this Agreement. 

6.5 Elimination of Minority Interest. Upon the reduction of
its Participating Interest to less than ten percent (10%), a Parti-
cipant shall be deemed to have withdrawn from this Agreement and
shall relinquish its entire Participating Interest. Provided,
however, subject to section 6.7, the withdrawing Participant shall
have the right to receive only from 5% of Net Proceeds (calculated
as provided in Exhibit C), if any, and not from any other source,
an amount equal to the withdrawing Participant's aggregate
contributions pursuant to Articles 5.1 and 5.2. Upon receipt of
such amount, the withdrawing Participant shall thereafter have no
further right, title or interest in the Assets or under this
Agreement. Such relinquished Participating Interest shall be
deemed to have accrued automatically to the other Participant. 

6.6 Continuing Liabilities Upon Adjustments of Participating
Interests. Any reduction of a Participant's Participating Interest
under this Article 6 shall not relieve such Participant of its
share of any liability, cost, penalty or fine, whether it accrues

-23-
<PAGE> 24

before or after such reduction, arising out of Operations conducted
prior to such reduction. For purposes of this Article 6, such
Participant's share of such liability shall be equal to its
Participating Interest at the time such liability was incurred. 
The increased Participating Interest accruing to a Participant as
a result of the reduction of the other Participant's Participating
Interest shall be free of royalties, liens or other encumbrances
arising by, through or under such other Participant, other than
those existing at the time the Properties were acquired or those to
which both Participants have given their written consent. An
adjustment to a Participating Interest need not be evidenced during
the term of this Agreement by the execution and recording of
appropriate instruments, but each Participant's Participating
Interest shall be shown in the books of the Manager. However,
either Participant, at any time upon the request of the other
Participant, shall execute and acknowledge instruments necessary to
evidence such adjustment in form sufficient for recording in the
jurisdiction where the Properties are located. 

6.7 Maximum Net Proceeds. If at any time more than one
Participant is entitled to receive an amount from Net Proceeds
under section 6.4 or 6.5, the maximum amount available from Net
Proceeds shall be 10%, allocated among the Participants pro rata.

ARTICLE 7
MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

-24-
<PAGE> 25

7.1 Organization and Composition. The Participants hereby
establish a Management Committee to determine overall policies,
objectives, procedures, methods and actions under this Agreement. 
The Management Committee shall consist of two (2) members appointed
by Hecla and two (2) members appointed by the Company. Each
Participant may appoint one (1) or more alternates to act in the
absence of a regular member. Any alternate so acting shall be
deemed a member. Appointments shall be made or changed by notice
to the other Participant. 

7.2 Decision. Each Participant, acting through its appointed
members, shall have the number of votes on the Management Committee
equal to its Participating Interest. Unless otherwise provided in
this Agreement, decisions of the Management Committee shall be
determined by a majority vote. If a proposed Program and Budget
receives the approval of no more than fifty percent (50%) of the
Participating Interests, the resolution of such a deadlock shall be
governed by the terms of Article 9.4. If any matters other than
the approval of Programs and Budgets receive the approval of no
more than fifty percent (50%) of the Participating Interests, the
Manager shall cast the deciding vote on such matters. 

7.3 Meeting. The Management Committee shall hold regular
meetings at least quarterly in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, or at other
locations specified by the Manager. The Manager shall give thirty
(30) days' notice to the Participants of such regular meetings. 

-25-
<PAGE> 26

Additionally, either Participant may call a special meeting upon
fifteen (15) days' notice to the Manager and the other Participant. 
In case of emergency, reasonable notice of a special meeting shall
suffice. There shall be a quorum if at least one (1) member
representing each Participant is present. Each notice of a meeting
shall include an itemized agenda prepared by the Manager in the
case of a regular meeting, or by the Participant calling the
meeting in the case of a special meeting, but any matters may be
considered with the consent of all Participants. The Manager shall
prepare minutes of all meetings and shall distribute copies of such
minutes to the Participants within thirty (30) days after the
meeting. Failure by a Participant to sign or furnish written
detailed notice of objection to the minutes within twenty (20) days
after receipt from the Manager, shall be deemed acceptance of such
minutes by the Participant. The minutes, when signed or deemed
accepted by all Participants, shall be the official record of the
decisions made by the Management Committee and shall be binding on
the Manager and the Participants. If personnel employed in
Operations are required to attend a Management Committee meeting,
reasonable costs incurred in connection with such attendance shall
be a Venture cost. All other costs shall be paid by the
Participants individually. 

7.4 Action Without Meeting. In lieu of meetings, the Manage-
ment Committee may hold telephone conferences, so long as all

-26-
<PAGE> 27

decisions are immediately confirmed in writing by the Participants. 

7.5 Matters Requiring Approval. Except as otherwise provided
by this Agreement, the Management Committee shall have exclusive
authority to determine all management matters related to this
Agreement. 

ARTICLE 8
MANAGER

8.1 Appointment. So long as Hecla holds a majority
Participating Interest in the Venture, Hecla shall be entitled to
be and is hereby appointed to be the Manager with overall
management responsibility for Operations. Hecla hereby agrees to

otherwise deemed to have offered to resign as provided in Article
8.4. 

8.2 Powers and Duties of Manager. Subject to the general
oversight and direction of the Management Committee, the Manager is
vested with the full authority to manage and carry out the day to
day management of the Venture and to conduct all Operations
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the last approved
Program and Budget. The Manager agrees, by itself, or through its
employees, agents or contractors, to carry out its duties in
accordance with the terms and intent of this Agreement, on behalf

-27-

and acquisitions to be made on the best terms available, taking
into account all of the circumstances; (ii) obtain such
customary warranties and guarantees as are available in
connection with such purchases and acquisitions; and (iii) keep
the Assets free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except
for those existing at the time of, or created concurrent with,
the acquisition of such Assets, or mechanic's or materialmen's
liens which shall be released or discharged in a diligent
manner, or liens and encumbrances specifically approved by the
Management Committee. 

-28-
<PAGE> 29

(d) The Manager shall conduct such title examinations and cure
such title defects as may be advisable in the reasonable
judgment of the Manager. 

(e) The Manager shall: (i) make or arrange for all payments
required by leases, licenses, permits, contracts and other
agreements related to the Assets; (ii) pay all taxes,
assessments and like charges on Operations and Assets except
taxes determined or measured by a Participant's sales revenue
or net income. If authorized by the Management Committee, the
Manager shall have the right to contest in the courts or
otherwise, the validity or amount of any taxes, assessments or
charges if the Manager deems them to be unlawful, unjust,
unequal or excessive, or to undertake such other steps or
proceedings as the Manager may deem reasonably necessary to
secure a cancellation, reduction, readjustment or equalization
thereof before the Manager shall be required to pay them, but
in no event shall the Manager permit or allow title to the
Assets to be lost as the result of the nonpayment of any taxes,
assessments or like charges; and (iii) do all other acts
reasonably necessary to maintain the Assets. 

(f) The Manager shall: (i) apply for all necessary permits,
licenses and approvals; (ii) use reasonable best efforts to

any allegations of substantial violation thereof; and (iv)
prepare and file all reports or notices required for
Operations. 

(g) The Manager shall prosecute and defend, but shall not
initiate without consent of the Management Committee, all
litigation or administrative proceedings arising out of
Operations. The non-managing Participant shall have the right
to participate, at its own expense, in such litigation or
administrative proceedings. The non-managing Participant shall
approve in advance any settlement involving payments,
commitments or obligations in excess of two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars ($250,000) in cash or value, subject to
Inflationary Adjustment.

(h) The Manager shall provide insurance for the benefit of the
Participants or self insure as provided in Exhibit D. 

(i) The Manager may dispose of Assets, whether by abandonment,
surrender or Transfer in the ordinary course of business,
except that Properties may be abandoned or surrendered only as
provided in Article 14. However, without prior authorization
from the Management Committee, the Manager shall not: (i)
dispose of Assets in any one transaction having a value in
excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) subject
to Inflationary Adjustment; (ii) enter into any sales contracts

-30-
<PAGE> 31

(k) The Manager shall perform or cause to be performed during
the term of this Agreement all assessment and other work
required by law and pay all rental fees or other charges
required by law in order to maintain the unpatented mining
claims included within the Properties. The Manager shall have
the right to perform the assessment work or pay the fees
required in lieu thereof required hereunder pursuant to a
common plan of Exploration, and continued actual occupancy of
such claims and sites shall not be required. The Manager shall
not be liable on account of any determination by any court or
governmental agency that the work performed by Manager does not
constitute the required annual assessment work or occupancy for
the purposes of preserving or maintaining ownership of the
claims, provided that the work done is in accordance with the
adopted Program and Budget. The Manager shall timely record
with the appropriate county and file with the appropriate
United States agency, affidavits in proper form attesting to

-31-
<PAGE> 32

the performance of assessment work or notices of intent to hold
in proper form, or notice of payment of annual rental fees, and
allocating therein, to or for the benefit of each claim, at
least the minimum amount of assessment work or rental fee
required by law to maintain such claim or site. 

(l) The Manager may: (i) locate, amend or relocate any
unpatented mining claim or mill site or tunnel site; (ii)
locate any fractions resulting from such amendment or
relocation; (iii) apply for patents or mining leases or other
forms of mineral tenure for any such unpatented claims or
sites; (iv) abandon any unpatented mining claims for the
purpose of locating mill sites or otherwise acquiring from the
United States rights to the ground covered thereby; (v) abandon
any unpatented mill sites for the purpose of locating mining
claims or otherwise acquiring from the United States rights to
the ground covered thereby; (vi) exchange with or convey to the
United States or other parties any of the Properties for the
purpose of acquiring rights to the ground covered thereby or
other adjacent ground; and (vii) convert any unpatented claims
or mill sites into one or more leases or other forms of mineral
tenure pursuant to any federal law hereafter enacted. 

(m) The Manager shall keep and maintain all required accounting
and financial records pursuant to the Accounting Procedure and

<PAGE> 33

in accordance with customary cost accounting practices in the
mining industry. 

(n) The Manager shall keep the Management Committee advised of
all Operations by submitting in writing to the Management
Committee: (i) monthly progress reports which include
statements of expenditures and comparisons of such expenditures
to the adopted Budget; (ii) periodic summaries of data
required; (iii) copies of reports concerning Operations; (iv)
a detailed final report within ninety (90) days after
completion of each Program and Budget, which shall include
comparisons between actual and budgeted expenditures and
comparisons between the objectives and results of Programs; (v) 
any activities undertaken pursuant to Section 8.2(l); and (vi)
such other reports as the Management Committee may reasonably
request. At all reasonable times the Manager shall provide the
Management Committee or the representative of any Participant,
upon the request of any member of the Management Committee,
access to, and the right to inspect and copy all maps, drill
logs, core tests, reports, surveys, assays, analyses,
production reports, operations, technical, accounting and
financial records, and other information acquired in
Operations. In addition, the Manager shall allow the
non-managing Participant, at the latter's sole risk and
expense, and subject to reasonable safety regulations, to
inspect the Assets and Operations at all reasonable times, so

-33-
<PAGE> 34

long as the inspecting Participant does not unreasonably
interfere with Operations. 

(o) The Manager shall undertake all other activities reasonably
necessary to fulfill the foregoing enumerated powers, and shall
undertake and is hereby empowered on behalf of the Venture to
take all such other actions and do all such other things as are
reasonably necessary to advance and foster the business of the
Venture.

(p) The Manager shall cause to be paid from the Joint Account
all workmen and wage earners employed by it or its contractors
in connection with the Grouse Creek Project, and for all
materials and services purchased in connection therewith,
except for claims for, without limitation, wages or materials
which the Manager is contesting in good faith. Operations
generally will be carried out by employees of the Manager
appointed pursuant to Article 8. Expenses related to employees
of the Manger directly engaged in Operations shall be charged
to the Joint Account as provided in Exhibit B. The Manager
shall not enter into any collective bargaining agreement, or
other agreement with a labor union, or engage in any other
conduct that might require the Manger to make Contributions on
behalf of employees directly engaged in Operations to a multi-
employer plan, as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, without the written

-34-

<PAGE> 35

consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

The Manager shall not be in default of any duty under this Article
8.2 if its failure to perform results from the failure of the
non-managing Participant to perform acts or to contribute amounts
required of it by this Agreement. 

8.3 Standard of Care. The Manager shall conduct all
Operations in a good, workmanlike and efficient manner, in
accordance with sound mining and other applicable industry
standards and practices, and in material compliance with the terms
and provisions of leases, licenses, permits, contracts and other
agreements pertaining to Assets. The Manager shall not be liable
to the non-managing Participant for any act or omission resulting
in damage, loss, cost, penalty or fine, except to the extent caused
by the Manager's willful misconduct or gross negligence. 

8.4 Resignation; Deemed Offer to Resign. The Manager may
resign upon two (2) months' prior written notice to the other
Participant, in which case the other Participant may elect to
become the new Manager by notice to the resigning Participant
within thirty (30) days after the notice of resignation. If any of
the following shall occur, the Manager shall be deemed to have
offered to resign, which offer shall be accepted by the other
Participant, if at all, within ninety (90) days following such

-35-

<PAGE> 36

deemed offer, and, in the absence of written acceptance by the
other Participant, the Manager shall continue to be Manager: 

(a) The Participating Interest of the Manager becomes less than
fifty percent (50%) and any other Participant holds a
Participating Interest greater than the Manager; or

(b) The Manager fails to perform a material obligation imposed
upon the Manager under this Agreement and fails to commence
curing or contest the default within thirty (30) days after
notice from the other Participant demanding performance; or

(c) If the Manager becomes insolvent, bankrupt or is placed in
receivership, it shall be deemed to have resigned without any
action by the other Participant. If a petition for relief
under federal bankruptcy laws is filed by or against the
Manager, and the removal of the Manager is prevented by the
federal bankruptcy court or laws, all Participants shall
comprise an interim operating committee to serve until the
Manager has elected to reject or to assume this Agreement
pursuant to the federal bankruptcy laws, and an election to
reject this Agreement by the Manager as a debtor in possession,
or by a trustee in bankruptcy, shall be deemed a resignation
of the Manager without any action by the other Participant. 
During the period of time the operating committee controls
activities under this Agreement, a third party acceptable to

-36-

<PAGE> 37

the non-Manager Participant, the Manager and the federal
bankruptcy court shall be selected as a member of the operating
committee, and all actions of the operating committee shall
require the approval of two (2) members of the operating
committee without regard to the Participating Interests of the
Participants.

8.5 Payments to Manager. The Manager shall be compensated for
its services and reimbursed for its costs hereunder in accordance
with the Accounting Procedure. 

8.6 Transactions with Affiliates. If the Manager engages
Affiliates to provide services hereunder, it shall do so on terms
no less favorable to the Venture than would be the case with unre-
lated persons in arm's-length transactions. 

8.7 Activities Pending Adoption of New Program and Budget. 
If the Management Committee for any reason fails to adopt a Program
and Budget, subject to the contrary direction of the Management
Committee and to the receipt of necessary funds, the Manager shall
continue Operations at levels comparable with the last adopted
Program and Budget. For purposes of determining the required
contributions of the Participants and their respective
Participating Interests, the last adopted Program and Budget shall
be deemed extended.

ARTICLE 9
PROGRAMS AND BUDGETS

9.1 Initial Program and Budget. The initial Program and
Budget, which has been adopted by the Participants, is attached as
Exhibit E. 

9.2 Operations Pursuant to Programs and Budgets. Except as
otherwise provided in Article 9.7 and Article 13, Operations shall
be conducted, expenses shall be incurred, and Assets shall be
acquired only pursuant to approved Programs and Budgets. 

9.3 Presentation of Programs and Budgets. Proposed Programs
and Budgets shall be prepared by the Manager for a period of one
year unless a longer period is agreed to by all Participants. Each
approved Program and Budget, regardless of length of time, shall be
reviewed at least once a year at a regular meeting of the
Management Committee. During the period encompassed by any Program
and Budget, and at least two (2) months prior to its expiration, a
proposed Program and Budget for the succeeding period shall be
prepared by the Manager and submitted to the Participants. Each
such proposed Program and Budget shall be in a form and degree of
detail substantially similar to Exhibit E. 

9.4 Review and Approval of Proposed Programs and Budgets. 
Within thirty (30) days after submission of a proposed Program and

-38-

<PAGE> 39

Budget, each Participant shall submit to the Management Committee: 

(a) Notice that the Participant approves the proposed Program
and Budget; or

(b) Proposed modifications of the proposed Program and Budget;
or

(c) Notice that the Participant rejects the proposed Program
and Budget. 

If a Participant fails to give any of the foregoing responses
within the allotted time, the failure shall be deemed to be an
approval by the Participant of the Manager's proposed Program
and Budget. If a Participant makes a timely submission to the
Management Committee pursuant to Article 9.4(b) or (c), then
the Management Committee shall meet to consider and develop a
Program and Budget acceptable to the Participants. If the
Management Committee does not unanimously approve a proposed
Program and Budget within thirty (30) days after the Manager's
receipt of a notice pursuant to Section 9.4(b) or (c), a
proposed Program and Budget may be approved by a majority vote
of the Management Committee.

If the Program and Budget is subsequently modified to
decrease expenditures by fifteen percent (15%) or more from the

-39-

<PAGE> 40

Program and Budget as originally approved, the non-contributing
or partially-contributing Participant, as the case may be,
shall have the right to contribute the difference between the
amount, if any, already contributed and its full share, based
on its Participating Interest prior to the reduction, of the
modified Program and Budget, and thereby avoid any reduction
in its Participating Interest. The Manager shall, at such time
as it becomes aware that expenditures for the Budget will be
eighty-five percent (85%) or less than that as originally
adopted, notify the non-contributing or partially-contributing
Participants. The non-contributing or partially-contributing
Participant may within thirty (30) days thereafter notify the
Manager of its election to contribute to its full share of the
modified Program and Budget. Such notice shall include full
payment of the non-contributing or partially-contributing
Participant's share of the modified Program and Budget to the
date of the payment. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
following shall require the unanimous approval of the
Management Committee:

(a) any Program and Budget proposing Capital Expenditures of
more than five million dollars ($5,000,000), subject to
Inflationary Adjustments;

-40-
<PAGE> 41

(b) any proposal by the Manager to shutdown Operations when the
forecasted losses of the Venture for the one year period
following the proposed shutdown are less than the closure and
holding costs of the Venture for the same period;

(c) any Program and Budget proposing an increase in operating
costs of more than fifteen percent (15%) over the previous
approved Program and Budget, subject to Inflationary
Adjustments.

9.5 Election to Participate. By notice to the Management
Committee within twenty (20) days after the final vote approving a
Program and Budget, a participant may elect to contribute to
Capitalized Expenditures which are a part of such Program and
Budget in some lesser amount than its respective Participating
Interest, or not at all, in which case its Participating Interest
shall be recalculated as provided in Article 6. If a Participant
fails to so notify the Management Committee, the Participant shall
be deemed to have elected to contribute to such Program and Budget
in proportion to its respective Participating Interest as of the
beginning of the period covered by the Program and Budget. 

9.6 Budget Overruns; Program Changes. The Manager shall
immediately notify the Management Committee of any material
departure from an adopted Program and Budget. The Manager may not
exceed an approved Program and Budget by more than fifteen percent

-41-

<PAGE> 42

(15%) without the unanimous approval of the Management Committee. 
If the Manager does exceed an approved Program and Budget by more
than fifteen percent (15%) without the unanimous approval of the
Management Committee, the Manager shall be solely responsible for
the costs associated with exceeding the approved Program and Budget
by more than fifteen percent (15%).

9.7 Emergency or Unexpected Expenditures. In case of emer-
gency, the Manager may take any reasonable action it deems
necessary to protect life, limb or property, to protect the Assets
or to comply with law or government regulation. The Manager may
also make reasonable expenditures for unexpected events which are
beyond its reasonable control and which do not result from a breach
by it of its standard of care. The Manager shall promptly notify
the Participants of the emergency or unexpected expenditure, and
the Manager shall be reimbursed for all resulting costs by the
Participants in proportion to their respective Participating
Interests at the time the emergency or unexpected expenditures are
incurred.

ARTICLE 10
ACCOUNTS AND SETTLEMENTS

10.1 Monthly Statements. The Manager shall promptly submit
to the Management Committee monthly statements of account re-
flecting in reasonable detail the charges and credits to the Joint
Account during the preceding month. 

10.2 Cash Calls. On the basis of the approved Program and
Budget, the Manager shall submit to each Participant prior to the
last day of each month, a billing for estimated cash requirements
for the next month. Within ten (10) days after receipt of each
billing, each Participant shall advance to the Manager its
proportionate share of the estimated amount. The Manager shall
promptly submit to each Participant billings for all other
authorized expenditures as they are incurred. Time is of the
essence in payment of such billings. The Manager shall at all
times maintain a cash balance approximately equal to the estimated
disbursements for the next ninety (90) days. 

10.3 Failure to Meet Cash Calls. A Participant that fails to
meet cash calls in the amount and at the times specified in Article
10.2 shall deemed to be in default of its obligations under this
Agreement, and the amounts of the defaulted cash call shall bear
interest from the date due at an annual rate equal to two (2)
percentage points over the Prime Rate, but in no event shall the

-43-

<PAGE> 44

rate of interest exceed the maximum permitted by law. The
non-defaulting Participant shall have those rights, remedies and
elections specified in Article 6.4.

10.4 Audits. Upon request made by any Participant within
twelve (12) months following the end of the calendar year (or, if
the Management Committee has adopted an accounting period other
than the calendar year, within twelve (12) months after the end of
such period), the Manager shall order an audit of the accounting
and financial records for such calendar year (or other accounting
period). The cost of such audit shall be charged to the Joint
Account. All written exceptions to and claims upon the Manager for
discrepancies disclosed by such audit shall be made not more than
three (3) months after receipt of the audit report. Failure to
make any such exception or claim within the three-month period
shall mean the audit is correct and binding upon the Participants. 
The audits shall be conducted by a firm of certified public
accountants selected by unanimous vote of the Management Committee.

ARTICLE 11
DISPOSITION OF PRODUCTION

11.1 Taking in Kind. Each Participant shall take in kind or
separately dispose of its share of all Products in accordance with
its Participating Interest. Any extra expenditure incurred in the
taking in kind or separate disposition by any Participant of its

-44-

<PAGE> 45

proportionate share of Products shall be borne by such Participant. 
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as providing, directly
or indirectly, for any joint or cooperative marketing or selling of
Products or permitting the processing of Products of any parties
other than the Participants at any processing facilities
constructed by the Participants pursuant to this Agreement. The
Manager shall give the Participants notice at least ten (10) days
in advance of the delivery date upon which their respective share
of Products will be available. 

11.2 Failure of Participant to Take in Kind. If a Participant
fails to take in kind, the Manager shall have the right, but not
the obligation, for a period of time consistent with the minimum
needs of the industry, but not to exceed one (1) year, to purchase
the Participant's share for its own account or to sell such share
as agent for the Participant at not less than the prevailing market
price in the area. Subject to the terms of any such contracts of
sale then outstanding, during any period that the Manager is pur-
chasing or selling a Participant's share of production, the
Participant may elect by notice to the Manager to take in kind. 
The Manager shall be entitled to deduct from proceeds of any sale
by it for the account of a Participant reasonable expenses incurred
in such a sale.

12.1 Termination by Expiration or Agreement. This Agreement
shall terminate as expressly provided in this Agreement, unless
earlier terminated by written agreement of all Participants. 

12.2 Withdrawal. A Participant may elect to withdraw as a
Participant from this Agreement by giving notice to the other
Participant of the effective date of withdrawal, which shall be the
later of the end of the then current Program and Budget or at least
thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. Upon such
withdrawal, this Agreement shall terminate, and the withdrawing
Participant shall be deemed to have transferred to the remaining
Participant, without cost and free and clear of royalties, liens or
other encumbrances arising by, through or under such withdrawing
Participant, except those exceptions to title described in Part 1
of Exhibit A and those to which both Participants have given their
written consent after the date of this Agreement, all of its
Participating Interest in the Assets and in this Agreement. No
withdrawal under this Article 12.2 shall relieve the withdrawing
Participant of its share of liabilities, costs, penalties or fines
to federal, state or local government or to third persons (whether
such accrues before or after such withdrawal) arising out of
Operations conducted prior to such withdrawal. For purposes of
this Article 12.2, the withdrawing Participant's share of such

-46-

<PAGE> 47

liabilities shall be equal to its Participating Interest at the
time such liability, cost, penalty or fine was incurred. 

12.3 Continuing Obligations. On termination of this Agreement
under Article 12.1, the Participants shall each remain liable for
continuing obligations hereunder until final settlement of all
accounts and for any liability, whether it accrues before or after
termination, if it arises out of Operations during the term of the
Agreement. 

12.4 Disposition of Assets on Termination. Promptly after
termination under Article 12.1, the Manager shall take all action
necessary to wind up the activities of the Venture, and all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the termination of the
Venture shall be expenses chargeable to the Venture. Any
Participant that has a negative capital account balance when the
Venture is terminated for any reason shall contribute to the Assets
of the Venture an amount sufficient to raise such balance to zero. 
The Assets shall first be paid, applied, or distributed in
satisfaction of all liabilities of the Venture to third parties and
then to satisfy any debts, obligations, or liabilities owed to the
Participants. Before distributing any funds or Assets to
Participants, the Manager shall have the right to segregate amounts
which, in the Manager's reasonable judgment, are necessary to
discharge continuing obligations or to purchase for the account of
Participants, bonds or other securities for the performance of such

-47-

<PAGE> 48

obligations. The foregoing shall not be construed to include the
repayment of any Participant's capital contributions. Thereafter,
any remaining cash and all other Assets shall be distributed (in
undivided interests unless otherwise agreed) to the Participants in
proportion to their respective Participating Interest, first in the
ratio and to the extent of their respective capital accounts and
then in proportion to their respective Participating Interests,
subject to any dilution, reduction, or termination of such
Participating Interests as may have occurred pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement. No Participant shall receive a distribution of
any interest in Products or proceeds from the sale thereof if such
Participant's Participating Interest therein has been terminated
pursuant to this Agreement. 

12.5 Non-Compete Covenants. Neither a Participant that
withdraws pursuant to Article 12.2, or is deemed to have withdrawn
pursuant to Article 6.4(c) or 6.5 nor an Affiliate of such a
Participant shall directly or indirectly acquire any interest in
property within the Area of Interest for twenty-four (24) months
after the effective date of withdrawal. If a withdrawing
Participant, or an Affiliate of a withdrawing Participant, breaches
the terms of this Article 12.5, such Participant or Affiliate shall
be obligated to offer to convey to the non-withdrawing Participant,
without cost, any such property or interest so acquired. Such
offer shall be made in writing and can be accepted by the
non-withdrawing Participant at any time within forty-five (45) days

-48-
<PAGE> 49

after it is received by such non-withdrawing Participant. The
provisions of this Article 12.5 shall not apply to any property
interests which are acquired by a Participant pursuant to Article
13.4 of this Agreement.

12.6 Right to Data After Termination. After termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 12.1, each Participant shall be
entitled to copies of all information acquired hereunder before the
effective date of termination not previously furnished to it, but
a terminating or withdrawing Participant shall not be entitled to
any such copies after any other termination or any withdrawal. 

12.7 Continuing Authority. On termination of this Agreement
under Article 12.1 or the deemed withdrawal of a Participant
pursuant to Article 6.4(c) or 6.5 or the withdrawal of a
Participant pursuant to Article 12.2, the Manager shall have the
power and authority, subject to control of the Management
Committee, if any, to do all things on behalf of the Participants
which are reasonably necessary or convenient to: (a) wind up
Operations and (b) complete any transaction and satisfy any
obligation, unfinished or unsatisfied, at the time of such
termination or withdrawal, if the transaction or obligation arises
out of Operations prior to such termination or withdrawal. The
Manager shall have the power and authority to grant or receive
extensions of time or change the method of payment of an already
existing liability or obligation, prosecute and defend actions on

-49-

<PAGE> 50

behalf of the Participants and the Venture, mortgage Assets, and
take any other reasonable action in any matter with respect to
which the former Participants continue to have, or appear or are
alleged to have, a common interest or a common liability. 

ARTICLE 13
ACQUISITIONS WITHIN AREA OF INTEREST

13.1 General. Any interest or right to acquire any interest
in real property, water, water rights or a royalty interest (a
"Property Interest") wholly or partially within the Area of
Interest acquired during the term of this Agreement by or on behalf
of a Participant or any Affiliate shall be subject to the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. 

13.2 Notice to Nonacquiring Participant. Within twenty (20)
days after the acquisition of any interest or the right to acquire
any Property Interest wholly or partially within the Area of
Interest (except real property acquired by the Manager pursuant to
a Program), the acquiring Participant shall notify the other
Participant of such acquisition. The acquiring Participant's
notice shall describe in detail the terms of the acquisition, the
lands and minerals covered thereby, and the cost thereof. The
acquiring Participant shall make available for inspection all
factual data in the possession or control of the acquiring
Participant concerning the Property Interest. In addition to such

- -50-

<PAGE> 51

notice, the acquiring Participant shall make any and all
information concerning the acquired interest available for
inspection by the other Participant. 

13.3 Option Exercised. If, within twenty (20) days after re-
ceiving the acquiring Participant's notice, the other Participant
notifies the acquiring Participant of its election to accept a
proportionate interest in the Property Interest equal to its
Participating Interest, the acquiring Participant shall convey to
the other Participant, by quitclaim deed, such a proportionate
undivided interest therein. The Property Interest shall become a
part of the Properties for all purposes of this Agreement
immediately upon the notice of such other Participant's election to
accept the proportionate interest therein. Such other Participant
shall promptly pay to the acquiring Participant its proportionate
share of the latter's actual out-of-pocket acquisition costs,
including title examination and curative costs and attorney fees.

13.4 Option Not Exercised. If the other Participant does not
give such notice within the twenty (20) day period set forth in
Article 13.3, it shall have no interest in the Property Interest,
and the Property Interest shall not be a part of the Properties or
be subject to this Agreement.

ARTICLE 14
ABANDONMENT AND SURRENDER OF PROPERTIES

14.1 Surrender or Abandonment of Property. The Management
Committee may authorize the Manager to surrender or abandon part or
all of the Properties consistent with the terms and conditions of
any agreement under which such portion or portions of the Property
were acquired. If the Management Committee authorizes any such
surrender or abandonment over the objection of a Participant, the
Participant that desires to abandon or surrender shall assign to
the objecting Participant, by quitclaim deed and without cost to
the surrendering Participant, all of the surrendering Participant's
interest in the property to be abandoned or surrendered, and the
abandoned or surrendered property shall cease to be part of the
Properties. 

14.2 Reacquisition. If any Properties are abandoned or sur-
rendered under the provisions of this Article 14, then, unless this
Agreement is earlier terminated, neither Participant nor any
Affiliate thereof shall acquire any interest in such Properties or
a right to acquire such Properties for a period of three (3) years
following the date of such abandonment or surrender. If a
Participant reacquires any Properties in violation of this Article
14.2, the other Participant may elect by notice to the reacquiring
Participant within forty-five (45) days after it has actual notice
of such reacquisition, to have such Properties made subject to the

-52-

<PAGE> 53

terms of this Agreement. In the event such an election is made,
the reacquired Properties shall thereafter be treated as
Properties, and the costs of reacquisition shall be borne solely by
the reacquiring Participant and shall not be included for purposes
of calculating the Participants' respective Participating
Interests.

Articles 15.2(f) and 15.2(g), the transferee, as of the

shall comply with and be bound by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

(c) If the transferring Participant fails to consummate the
Transfer to a third party within the period set forth in
Article 15.3(b), the preemptive right of the other Participant

NET PROCEEDS DEFINITION

A. NET PROCEEDS

If any Participant is entitled to receive an interest based on a Net
proceeds interest pursuant to the Agreement, such Participant being hereinafter
referred to as the "Royalty Holder," then the Royalty Holder shall promptly
deliver a conveyance confirming the transfer of all of its Participating
Interest without reservation or restriction to the remaining party or parties
to the Agreement, as the case may be, such remaining party or parties being
hereinafter referred to as the "Royalty Payor." Thereafter the Royalty Payor

EXHIBIT C - Page 1 of 11

<PAGE> 82
B. CALCULATION OF NET PROCEEDS

1. Definition of Net Proceeds.

"Net proceeds" shall be any excess of Receipts over Disbursements 
for any calendar quarter. To compute Net Proceeds, the receipts for the
calendar quarter are compared to all prior unrecovered Disbursements (including
Disbursements for the present quarter). If Receipts exceed all prior
unrecovered Disbursements (including Disbursements for the present quarter),
Net Proceeds will be paid. If Receipts are less than all prior unrecovered
Disbursements (including Disbursements for the present quarter), the amount by
which Disbursements exceed Receipts will be carried forward and added to the
Disbursements made in the ensuing calendar quarter and the process will be
repeated.

2. Computation of Net Proceeds.

Net Proceeds shall be computed as of the end of each calendar 
quarter. On or before the 45th day following the end of each calendar quarter
a statement shall be furnished setting forth in reasonable detail the
computation of Net Proceeds for the previous calendar quarter. Payment of any
Net Proceeds due shall be enclosed with the statement.

EXHIBIT C - Page 2 of 11

<PAGE> 83
3. Calculation of Receipts.

"Receipts" shall be all revenues received during the calendar 
quarter from the sale or other disposal of Product from a Mine on the Property
(the "Mine"). Revenue received from the sale, use or other disposition of
Product shall be determined as follows:

(a) If the Product is fine gold or silver or dore bullion 
produced from the Properties, the value is the amount of fine gold or silver
produced or the amount of gold or silver contained in dore bullion produced
from the Properties during any calendar quarter times the average New York
Commodity Exchange ("COMEX") Settlement Price for the calendar quarter shall be
determined by dividing the sum of all daily Settlement Prices posted during the
calendar quarter by the number of days that prices were posted. The posted
price shall be obtained from the COMEX Daily Market Report listing of the COMEX
Settlement price. If the COMEX Daily Market Report or the Settlement Price for
the COMEX ceases to be published, the parties shall agree upon a similar
alternative method for determining the average daily spot market price for gold
or silver, as the case may be.

(b) If Product is ore, concentrate, precipitate, leach solution, 
or any mineral substance other than dore bullion or fine gold or silver
produced from the Properties, the value is

EXHIBIT C - Page 3 of 11

<PAGE> 84
the amount of earned revenues paid by a smelter, refiner or other purchaser,
plus any bonuses and subsidies, less all penalties, assaying and sampling
charges whether deducted by the purchaser or paid or incurred by the Royalty
Payor. Any written contract for sale to an Affiliate or any sale to an
Affiliate on a basis not involving such a contract shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Royalty Holder, be on a basis less favorable (including
the terms thereof with respect to delivery and inventory), at the time of such
contract or sale, as the case may be, than that which would have been
applicable with respect to a comparable contract or sale, as the case may be,
to or by an unaffiliated third party.

4. Calculation of Disbursements.

"Disbursements" shall mean Capital Expenditures and Operating 
Expenses incurred at or on behalf of a Mine or the Property by the Royalty
Payor determined in accordance with the Accounting Procedure.

estimate of costs to be incurred to reclaim the 
Properties and any balance not used after reclamation 
is completed shall be paid out; but

(x) excluding any charges for depreciation, amortization, 
or depletion; and

(xi) reduced by all proceeds from insurance for items 
charged as Operating Expense and all proceeds from the

The Royalty Holder shall be deemed to have waived any right it may have had to
object to a statement made for any calendar quarter, unless it provides notice
in writing of such objection within six (6) months after the end of a calendar
year in which such statement was given. If the Parties are unable to resolve
the dispute within sixty (60) days after the receipt of such notice, the
dispute shall be resolved by arbitration.

of arbitration, the arbitrator shall determine what part of the costs and
expenses incurred in any such proceeding shall be borne by each party
participating in the arbitration.
