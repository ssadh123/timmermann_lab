ITEM 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

(a) On October 3, 1994, Stanhome plc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Stanhome Inc., declared its offer, publicly announced September 1, 1994 and 
formally made on September 9, 1994, to be unconditional in all respects and 
unlimited as to the acquisition of fifteen million two hundred thirty-nine 
thousand seven hundred and forty-six (15,239,746) ordinary shares of five (5) 
pence each of Lilliput Group plc, a public limited company organized and 
existing in the United Kingdom ("Lilliput"), with its principal place of
business located at Skirsgill, Penrith, Cumbria CA11 0DP. The tendered amount of
said shares constitutes sixty-five and forty-nine hundredths percent (65.49%) of
all the allotted, called up and fully paid shares of capital stock of Lilliput
(the "Shares") and is being acquired by Stanhome from the assenting Lilliput
Shareholders and their nominees, trustees or custodians (collectively referred
to as the "Sellers"). Between September 1, 1994 and September 30, 1994, Stanhome
additionally purchased in the open market six million six hundred seventy-four
thousand two hundred and nineteen (6,674,219) of the Shares on the London Stock
Exchange, which number of Shares represented twenty-eight and sixty-eight
hundredths percent (28.68%) of all the Shares. The remaining one million three
hundred fifty-five thousand four hundred and fifty-five (1,355,455) of the
Shares constitute five and eighty-three hundredths percent (5.83%) of all the
Shares and are owned by the non-assenting Lilliput Shareholders. With the
intention of acquiring one hundred percent (100%) of the Shares, Stanhome has
offered to acquire such remaining Shares. Stanhome has also offered to pay for 
the surrender of thirty-nine thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight (39,938) 
options capable of being exercised under the Lilliput Savings-Related Share 
Option Scheme and five hundred and ninety thousand (590,000) options capable of 
being exercised under the Lilliput Executive Share Option Scheme (collectively
referred to as the "Options") pursuant to applicable law of the United Kingdom.

Consideration for the Shares being acquired by Stanhome in connection with 
its declared offer of one hundred and sixty (160) pence per share

-2-
<PAGE>

consists of a payment totaling (Pounds)24,383,594 in cash to be made at the
closing currently scheduled for October 21, 1994 and allocated among the Sellers
according to their percentage equity interests. Consideration for the Shares
acquired by Stanhome in the open market totals (Pounds)10,609,772. Consideration
for the acquisition of the remaining Shares and the surrender of the Options,
assuming acceptance by all of the respective option holders, will total
(Pounds)2,340,990.

The principle followed in determining the amount of the consideration to be
paid per Share was a business judgment as to the value of Lilliput's existing 
assets and income potential based on its historic business and its future 
interrelationship with Stanhome's business.

It is anticipated that the aggregate total of (Pounds)37,334,356 of cash
consideration for all of the Shares and the Options will be provided by
short term bank loans from a group of banks. To date Stanhome has borrowed 
(Pounds)9,000,000 from Banca Popolare di Milano-London Branch and
(Pounds)1,620,000 from Mellon Bank, N.A.-London Branch. The balance of the
borrowings to fund the acquisition will be sourced by means of facilities
Stanhome has with banks under short term loan arrangements and in amounts yet to
be determined.

(b) Lilliput manufactures and distributes collectibles and other gift-
ware products. Its business is primarily the manufacturing and marketing of 
high quality, hand-painted miniature cottages sold under the "Lilliput Lane" 
brand name, and to a lesser extent the marketing of other collectible giftware
products. Lilliput's business is carried on by Lilliput and its subsidiaries 
through retail outlets in the United Kingdom and the U.S. and through export to
some 48 countries. In general, the assets of Lilliput consist of its plant and
real property, machinery and equipment, inventories, product designs and mold
making systems, accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, rights under
various copyrights and trademarks, customer and collectors' club member lists,
and goodwill. Stanhome Inc. intends for Lilliput to continue to use such assets
in its business.

[LETTERHEAD OF G. WILLIAM SEAWRIGHT, PRESIDENT 
AND CEO, OF STANHOME INC. APPEARS HERE]

9th September, 1994

To Lilliput Shareholders and, for information only, to participants in the
Lilliput Share Option Schemes

Dear Sir or Madam,

RECOMMENDED CASH OFFER FOR LILLIPUT

I am delighted that the Boards of Stanhome Inc. and Lilliput were able to
announce an agreed offer for Lilliput on 1st September, 1994. Stanhome Inc. has
been developing its interests in the United Kingdom for some time and believes
that the acquisition will be beneficial to both groups.

The reasons for the Offer are explained in detail in the accompanying letters
from your Chairman & Chief Executive, John Russell, and from Goldman Sachs, but
I would like to emphasise the following points:

. The two groups' activities are highly complementary. Lilliput's strength in
distribution and brand name is here in the United Kingdom, whereas that of
Stanhome's giftware operations is concentrated in the Americas.

. Each group will obtain better access to the other's markets, at little
incremental cost.

. Lilliput will benefit from Stanhome Inc.'s financial resources.

. Lilliput's senior management will be involved in developing Stanhome Inc.'s
European giftware and collectibles group.

The combination of Lilliput and Enesco will create one of the largest giftware
and collectibles groups in Europe.

I look forward to welcoming Lilliput's management and employees to the Stanhome
Group.

Yours faithfully
for the Board of Stanhome Inc.

9th September, 1994

To Lilliput Shareholders and, for information only, to participants in the
Lilliput Share Option Schemes

Dear Sir or Madam,

RECOMMENDED CASH OFFER FROM STANHOME

On 1st September, 1994, it was announced that your Board and the Board of
Stanhome Inc. had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer to
be made by Goldman Sachs on behalf of Stanhome to acquire the whole of the
issued and to be issued share capital of Lilliput. I am now writing to you to
explain the reasons for and benefits of the Offer and why your Directors
recommend you to accept it. Details of the Offer are set out in the
accompanying letter from Goldman Sachs.

REASONS FOR AND BENEFITS OF THE OFFER

The Board of Lilliput believes that there are substantial benefits that can be
derived from the acquisition of Lilliput by Stanhome Inc., one of the world's
leading distributors of giftware and collectibles. Although your Directors are
confident that Lilliput would continue to trade successfully as an independent
company, they firmly believe that the future prospects of Lilliput will be
greatly enhanced as part of the enlarged Stanhome Group. In particular, they
believe that Lilliput will be able to grow more rapidly as part of the enlarged
Stanhome Group than as an independent company. Stanhome has assured the
Directors that Lilliput will retain its identity and will continue to be run
from its head office in Penrith.

There is a strong complementary fit between the products sold by Stanhome
Inc.'s Enesco Giftware Group and Lilliput's product range and, following the
Offer being successfully completed, Lilliput will be involved in the marketing
and distribution of Enesco's products in Europe.

The combination of the proven management, manufacturing and marketing skills of
Lilliput and those of the Enesco Giftware Group, together with the financial
resources of the Stanhome Group, should result in a business that is well
positioned to compete successfully both in the US and continental Europe. The
acquisition of Lilliput should enhance the Stanhome Group's presence in the US
collectibles market and accelerate its expansion into the European market.

INTERIM RESULTS OF LILLIPUT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30TH JUNE, 1994

Lilliput's unaudited interim results for the six months ended 30th June, 1994
were announced on 1st September, 1994 and showed an increase in profit before
taxation to (Pounds)1.13 million from (Pounds)1.08 million on sales of
(Pounds)7.50 million, up by 6 per cent. compared with the same period last
year. As at 30th June, 1994, shareholders' funds stood at (Pounds)5.06 million
(1993: (Pounds)2.77 million).

Lilliput's profit before taxation was (Pounds)3.1 million for the year ended
31st December, 1993 on turnover of (Pounds)16.5 million. Further financial
information on Lilliput, including the unaudited interim results for the six
months ended 30th June, 1994, is set out in Appendix IV to this document.

THE OFFER

You will find set out on pages 8 to 12 a letter from Goldman Sachs, containing
the Offer on behalf of Stanhome to acquire your shares on the basis of 160p in
cash for each Lilliput Share. In addition, Lilliput Shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 29th September, 1994 will be entitled to
receive and retain the interim dividend in respect of the year ending 31st
December, 1994 of 1.65p (net) per share declared on 1st September, 1994.
Acceptance of the Offer will not prevent Lilliput Shareholders from receiving
and retaining this interim dividend.

The Offer values the fully diluted share capital of Lilliput at approximately
(Pounds)38.2 million and the Offer price of 160p per share represents a premium
of approximately 74 per cent. to the closing middle market quotation of 92p per
Lilliput Share on 31st August, 1994 (the day prior to the announcement of the
Offer).

If the Offer is declared or becomes unconditional in all respects, Stanhome
intends to offer a cash cancellation proposal, in due course, to those
optionholders who have not exercised their options during the Offer Period.
Under such proposal, optionholders will be offered the difference between the
exercise price of the option and the Offer price of 160p in cash, for each
option. In the case of the Lilliput Group plc Savings Related Share Option
Scheme, the cash cancellation proposal will be limited to the number of
Lilliput Shares that can be purchased with the repayment under the related
savings contract at the date of the proposal.

The conditions and further terms of the Offer are set out in Appendix I to this
document.

Details of the financial effects on Lilliput Shareholders of accepting the
Offer are shown on page 9 of this document.

MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES

All of the Lilliput executive Directors will remain as Directors of Lilliput.

Stanhome Inc. has given assurances to your Board that the existing employment
rights of all the Lilliput Group's management and employees, including pension
rights, will be fully safeguarded. Your Board believes that the career
opportunities of Lilliput Group employees will be enhanced within the enlarged
Stanhome Group.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN

Your attention is drawn to pages 11 and 12 of this document in which is set out
the procedure for acceptance of the Offer.

FURTHER INFORMATION

Your attention is drawn to the further information contained in Appendices II
to V to this document.

TAXATION

Your attention is drawn to section 5 of the letter from Goldman Sachs, headed
"UK taxation", on page 10 of this document. If you are in any doubt as to your
own tax position, you should consult your independent professional adviser
immediately.

RECOMMENDATION

YOUR BOARD, WHICH HAS BEEN SO ADVISED BY NATWEST MARKETS, CONSIDERS THE TERMS
OF THE OFFER TO BE FAIR AND REASONABLE AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF LILLIPUT
SHAREHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, YOUR DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND YOU TO ACCEPT
THE OFFER. THE DIRECTORS AND THEIR WIVES HAVE IRREVOCABLY UNDERTAKEN TO ACCEPT
THE OFFER IN RESPECT OF THEIR BENEFICIAL SHAREHOLDINGS AMOUNTING TO 4,981,039

Notes:

The financial comparisons set out above have been made on the
following bases:

(i) The market value of 100 Lilliput Shares of (Pounds)92 is
based on the middle market quotation as derived from The
Stock Exchange Daily Official List for 31st August, 1994
(being the last day on which the Lilliput Shares were
dealt in on the Stock Exchange before the announcement of
the Offer).

(ii) The gross income on the cash consideration has been
calculated on the assumption that the cash is reinvested
to yield approximately 9 per cent., being the yield on
the 2008 Treasury 9 per cent. gilt, on 8th September,
1994 (the latest practicable date prior to the posting of
this document).

(iii) The gross dividend from Lilliput Shares is based on the
notional dividend of 2.90p (net) per share that would
have been paid as a final dividend in respect of the
year ended 31st December, 1993 had the Lilliput Shares
been listed on the Stock Exchange for the whole of the
financial year ended 31st December, 1993 and the interim
dividend of 1.65p (net) per share in respect of the
financial year ending 31st December, 1994, together with
the associated tax credits of 20/80ths of the amounts
paid.

(iv) No account has been taken of any liability to taxation.

5. UK The following paragraphs, which are intended as a general
TAXATION guide only and are based on current legislation and Inland
Revenue practice, summarise advice received by Stanhome
regarding the position of Lilliput Shareholders, who are
resident or ordinarily resident in the UK for tax purposes and
who hold their Lilliput Shares as an investment, in respect of
UK taxation.

To the extent that a Lilliput Shareholder receives cash under
the Offer, this will constitute a disposal of shares for the
purposes of UK taxation of capital gains which may give rise
to a liability to taxation. Liability to UK taxation of
capital gains will depend upon the particular circumstances of
the individual Lilliput Shareholder.

Lilliput Shareholders who acquired or acquire their Lilliput
Shares by exercising options under the Lilliput Share Option
Schemes are reminded that they may incur a charge to UK income
tax upon exercising their options.

IF YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT AS TO YOUR TAXATION POSITION, YOU
SHOULD CONSULT YOUR INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVISER WITHOUT
DELAY.

FOR THE leader in the marketing and distribution of giftware and to

existing product lines.

The board of Stanhome Inc. believes that the acquisition of
Lilliput should allow the Enesco Giftware Group to benefit
from synergies, including the leveraging of resources with
Enesco's European operations in the UK and Germany and other
distributorships in Europe. In addition, the combination of
Lilliput's and Enesco's strong management teams and efficient
production, marketing and financial organisations should
assist in the successful growth of the two organisations.

extension thereto and shall include any election available in 
connection with it;

(ii) "the Offer becoming unconditional" shall include the Offer being
declared unconditional;

(iii) "the Offer being or becoming unconditional" shall be construed as a
reference to the Offer being or becoming unconditional as to
acceptances, whether or not any other condition of the Offer remains
to be fulfilled;

(iv) the "acceptance condition" shall mean the condition as to acceptances
set out in paragraph (i) of Part A of this Appendix I;

(iv) an extension of the Offer shall, in relation to the Offer, include an
extension of the date by which the acceptance condition has to be
fulfilled; and

(v) "the Offer document" shall mean any document containing the Offer.

1. ACCEPTANCE PERIOD

(a) The Offer will initially remain open for acceptance until 3.00 p.m. on 30th
September, 1994. Although no revision is envisaged, if the Offer is revised
it will remain open for acceptance for a period of at least 14 days from 
the date of posting of written notification of the revision to Lilliput
Shareholders. Except with the consent of the Panel, no such written
notification of the revised Offer may be posted to Lilliput Shareholders
after 25th October, 1994 or, if later, the date falling 14 days prior to 
the last date on which the Offer can become unconditional.

(b) The Offer, whether revised or not, shall not (except with the consent of
the Panel) be capable of becoming or being declared unconditional after
midnight on 8th November (or any earlier time and/or date beyond which
Stanhome has stated that the Offer will not be extended and in respect of
which it has not withdrawn that statement) nor of being kept open after
that time and/or date unless it has previously become unconditional.
However, Stanhome reserves the right, with the consent of the Panel, to
extend the Offer to a later time(s) and/or date(s). Stanhome may not, for
the purpose of determining whether the acceptance condition has been
satisfied, take into account acceptances received, or purchases of Lilliput
Shares made, after 1.00 p.m. on 8th November, 1994 (or on any earlier date
beyond which Stanhome has stated that the Offer will not be extended and in
respect of which it has not withdrawn that statement) or such later time
and/or date as Stanhome may with the permission of the Panel decide. If the
Offer is extended beyond midnight on 8th November, 1994 acceptances
received and purchases made in respect of which relevant documents have
been received by The Royal Bank of Scotland plc after 1.00 p.m. on the
relevant date may (except where the Code otherwise permits) only be taken
into account with the consent of the Panel.

(c) If the Offer becomes unconditional, it will remain open for acceptance for
not less than 14 days after the date on which it would otherwise have
expired. If the Offer has become unconditional and it is stated that the
Offer will remain open until further notice, then not less than 14 days'
notice will be given prior to the closing of the Offer.

(d) If a competitive situation arises after Stanhome has given a no extension
statement or a no increase statement, Stanhome may (if it has specifically
reserved the right to do so at the time such statement was made) withdraw
such statement provided that notice is given to that effect within 4
business days after the day of the announcement of the competing offer and
Lilliput Shareholders are informed in writing thereof. Stanhome may (if it
has reserved the right to do so) choose not to be bound by the terms of a
no increase statement or a no extension statement, if it would otherwise
prevent the posting of an increased or improved Offer which is recommended
for acceptance by the Board of Lilliput, or in other circumstances
permitted by the Panel.

(e) For the purpose of determining at any particular time whether the
acceptance condition has been satisfied, Stanhome shall not be bound
(unless otherwise required by the Panel) to take into account any Lilliput
Shares which have been unconditionally allotted or issued before such
determination takes place, unless The Royal Bank of Scotland plc on behalf
of Stanhome has received written notice of the relevant details of such
allotment or issue (including the price thereof) before that time. Telex or
facsimile transmission will not be sufficient for this purpose.

2. ANNOUNCEMENTS

which the Offer is due to expire or becomes unconditional or is revised or
extended, or such later time and/or date as the Panel may agree, Stanhome
will make an appropriate announcement and simultaneously inform the Stock
Exchange of the position. Such announcement will also state (unless
otherwise permitted by the Panel) the total number of Lilliput Shares and

Stanhome or any person acting in concert with Stanhome during the Offer
Period and (iii) held by or on behalf of Stanhome or any person acting in
concert with Stanhome prior to the Offer Period, and will specify the
percentage of the share capital of Lilliput represented by these figures.
Any decision to extend the time and/or date by which the acceptance
condition has to be fulfilled may be made at any time up to, and will be
announced not later than, 8.30 a.m. on the relevant day (or such later time
and/or date as the Panel may agree) and the announcement will state the
next expiry date. In computing the number of Lilliput Shares represented by
acceptances and purchases, there may, at the discretion of Stanhome, be
included or excluded for announcement purposes acceptances and purchases
which are not complete in all respects or are subject to verification where
such acceptances or purchases of Lilliput Shares could be counted towards
fulfilling the acceptance condition in accordance with paragraph 5(k)
below.

(b) References in this Part B of Appendix I to the making of an announcement by
Stanhome include the release of an announcement by public relations
consultants or by Goldman Sachs to the press, and the delivery or
telephone, telex or facsimile or other electronic transmission of an
announcement to the Stock Exchange. An announcement made otherwise than to
the Stock Exchange will be notified simultaneously to the Stock Exchange.

3. RIGHTS OF WITHDRAWAL

(a) If Stanhome, having announced the Offer to be unconditional, fails to
comply by 3.30 p.m. on the relevant day (or such later time and/or date as
the Panel may agree) with any of the other requirements specified in
paragraph 2(a) above, an accepting Lilliput Shareholder may immediately
thereafter withdraw his acceptance by written notice (signed by the
accepting shareholder or his agent duly appointed in writing and evidence
of whose appointment is produced with the notice) given to The Royal Bank
of Scotland plc, Registrar's Department New Issues Section, P.O. Box 859,
Consort House, East Street, Bedminster, Bristol BS99 1XZ on behalf of
Stanhome. Subject to paragraph 1(b) above, this right of withdrawal may be
terminated not less than 8 days after the relevant day by Stanhome
confirming, if that be the case, that the Offer is still unconditional and
complying with the other requirements specified in paragraph 2(a) above. If
any such confirmation is given, the first period of 14 days referred to in
paragraph 1(c) above will run from the date of such confirmation and
compliance.

(b) If by 3.00 p.m. on 21st October, 1994 (or such later time and/or date as
the Panel may agree) the Offer has not become unconditional, an accepting
Lilliput Shareholder may withdraw his acceptance at any time thereafter at
the address and in the manner referred to in paragraph 3(a) above before
the earlier of (i) the time that the Offer becomes unconditional and (ii)
the final time for lodgement of acceptances which can be taken into account
in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above. If Stanhome withdraws a no
extension statement or a no increase statement in accordance with paragraph
1(d) above, any Lilliput Shareholder who accepts the Offer after the date
of such statement may withdraw his acceptance thereafter at the address and
in the manner referred to in paragraph 3(a) above for a period of 8 days
after the date of posting of written notice to that effect by Stanhome to
the relevant Lilliput Shareholders.

(c) Except as provided by this paragraph 3, acceptances and elections shall be
irrevocable. In this paragraph 3, "written notice" (including any letter of
appointment, direction or authority) means notice in writing bearing the
original signature(s) of the relevant accepting Lilliput Shareholders or
his/their agent(s) duly appointed in writing (evidence of whose appointment
is produced with the notice) and telex or facsimile transmissions or copies
will not be sufficient. No notice which appears to Stanhome, its agents or
advisers, to have been sent from the United States or Canada or by a North
American person will be treated as valid.

4. REVISED OFFER

(a) Although no such revision is envisaged, if the Offer (in its original or
any previously revised form(s)) is revised (either in its terms or
conditions or otherwise) and such revision represents on the date on which
such revision is announced (on such basis as Goldman Sachs may consider
appropriate) no diminution in the value of the consideration previously
offered, the benefit of the revised Offer (subject to this paragraph 4 and
paragraph 6 below) will be made available to Lilliput Shareholders who have
accepted the Offer in its original or any previously revised form(s))
(hereinafter called "Previous Acceptor(s)"). The acceptance by or on behalf
of a Previous Acceptor of the Offer (in its original or any previously
revised form(s)) shall, subject as provided in this paragraph 4 and
paragraph 6 below, be deemed an acceptance of the Offer as so revised and
shall also constitute an appointment of any director of Stanhome or of
Goldman Sachs as his attorney and/or agent with authority to accept any
such revised Offer on behalf of such Previous Acceptor.

(b) Although no such revision is envisaged, if any revised Offer provides for
Lilliput Shareholders who accept it to elect for (or accept) alternative
forms of consideration, the acceptance by or on behalf of a Previous
Acceptor of the Offer (in its original or any previously revised form(s))
shall, subject as provided below, also constitute an appointment of any
director of Stanhome or of Goldman Sachs as his attorney and/or agent to
make on his behalf elections for and/or to accept such alternative forms of
consideration on his behalf as such attorney and/or agent in his absolute
discretion thinks fit and to execute on behalf of and in the name of such
Previous Acceptor all further documents (if any) as may be required to give
effect to such acceptances and/or elections. In making such acceptance or
any such election, such attorney and/or agent shall take into account the
nature of any previous acceptances and/or elections made by the Previous
Acceptor and such other facts or matters as he may reasonably consider
relevant.

(c) The deemed acceptances referred to in paragraphs 4(a) and (b) above shall
not apply and the authorities conferred by paragraphs 4(a) and (b) above
shall not be exercised if as a result thereof a Previous Acceptor would
receive less in aggregate in cash than he would have received as a result
of his acceptance of the Offer in the form in which it was originally
accepted by him.

(d) The deemed acceptances referred to in paragraphs 4(a) and (b) above shall
not apply and the authorities conferred by paragraphs 4(a) and (b) above
shall be ineffective to the extent that a Previous Acceptor shall lodge,
within 14 days of the posting of the document pursuant to which the
revision of the Offer referred to in paragraphs 4(a) and (b) above is made
available to the Lilliput Shareholders (or such later date as Stanhome may
determine), a form in which he validly elects to receive the consideration
receivable by him under that revised Offer in some other manner.

(e) The authorities referred to in this paragraph 4 and any acceptance of a
revised Offer and/or election pursuant thereto shall be irrevocable unless
and until the Previous Acceptor becomes entitled to withdraw his acceptance
under paragraph 3 above and duly does so.

(f) Stanhome reserves the right to treat an executed Form of Acceptance
relating to the Offer (in its original or any previously revised form(s))
which is received after the announcement or the issue of the Offer in any
revised form as a valid acceptance of the revised Offer and such acceptance
shall constitute an authority in the terms of this paragraph 4 mutatis
mutandis on behalf of the relevant Lilliput Shareholders.

5. GENERAL

(a) Except with the consent of the Panel, the Offer will lapse unless all the
conditions to the Offer have been fulfilled by or (if capable of waiver)
waived by or (where appropriate) satisfied as at midnight on 21st October,
1994 or within 21 days after the date on which the Offer becomes
unconditional, (whichever is the later), or such later date as Stanhome
may, with the consent of the Panel, decide. If the Offer is referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission before 30th September, 1994 or the date
when the Offer becomes unconditional (whichever is the later) the Offer
will lapse. References in this paragraph 5(a) to the Offer lapsing mean
that the Offer will thereupon cease to be capable of further acceptance and
Lilliput Shareholders who have accepted the Offer and Stanhome will cease
to be bound by acceptances effected on or before the date on which the
Offer so lapses.

16
<PAGE>

(b) No acknowledgement of receipt of any Form of Acceptance, share
certificate(s) or other document(s) of title will be given. All
communications, notices, certificates, documents of title and remittances
to be delivered by or to or sent to or from Lilliput Shareholders or as
otherwise directed will be delivered by or to or sent to or from them (or
their designated agents) at their risk.

(c) The expression "Offer Period" when used in this document means the period
commencing on 1st September, 1994 and ending on whichever of the following
dates shall be the latest:-

(i) 30th September, 1994;

(ii) the date on which the Offer lapses; and

(iii) the date on which the Offer becomes unconditional.

(d) All references in this document and in the Form of Acceptance to 30th
September, 1994, shall (except in paragraph 5(c) above and where the
context otherwise requires), if the expiry date of the Offer shall be
extended, be deemed to refer to the expiry date of the Offer as so
extended.

(e) Except with the consent of the Panel, settlement of the consideration to
which any Lilliput Shareholder is entitled under the Offer will be
implemented in full in accordance with the terms of the Offer without
regard to any lien, right of set-off, counterclaim or other analogous right
to which Stanhome may otherwise be, or claim to be, entitled as against
such Lilliput Shareholder.

(f) Subject to paragraph 5(k) of this Part B, notwithstanding that no share
certificate(s) is/are delivered in respect of it, a duly completed Form of
Acceptance (i) executed as a deed by SEPON Limited and endorsed on behalf
of the Stock Exchange to the effect that the shares to which it refers are
the whole or part of a holding registered in the name of SEPON Limited
and/or are Lilliput Shares to which SEPON Limited is unconditionally
entitled immediately to become the registered holder or (ii) executed by
any other person(s) and endorsed on behalf of the Stock Exchange to the
effect that such person(s) is/are unconditionally entitled immediately to
become the registered holder(s) of the Lilliput Shares to which it refers
and that one or more Talisman transfer(s) in favour of such person(s) in
respect thereof is/are in the course of registration shall (if otherwise in
order) be treated by Stanhome and Goldman Sachs as an acceptance valid in
all respects on the date of its actual receipt provided that, on its
presentation to the Registrars of Lilliput, it is unconditionally accepted
for registration.

(g) The instructions, terms, provisions and authorities contained in or deemed
to be incorporated in the Form of Acceptance constitute part of the terms
of the Offer. Words and expressions defined in this document shall, unless
the context otherwise requires, have the same meanings when used in the
Form of Acceptance.

(h) The Offer, the Form of Acceptance and all acceptances thereof and all
elections thereunder or pursuant thereto and all contracts made pursuant
thereto and action taken or made or deemed to be taken or made under any of
the foregoing shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English
law. Execution by or on behalf of a Lilliput Shareholder of a Form of
Acceptance constitutes his submission, in relation to all matters arising
out of the Offer and Form of Acceptance, to the jurisdiction of the Courts
of England.

(i) Any omission to despatch this document or the Form of Acceptance or any
notice required to be given under the terms of the Offer to, or any failure
to receive the same by, any person to whom the Offer is made or should be
made shall not invalidate the Offer in any way or create any implication
that the Offer has not been made to any such person.

(j) Stanhome and Goldman Sachs reserve the right to treat acceptances of the
Offer and/or elections pursuant thereto as valid if received by or on
behalf of either of them at any place or places determined by them
otherwise than as stated herein or in the Form of Acceptance.

(k) Notwithstanding the right reserved by Stanhome and Goldman Sachs to treat a
Form of Acceptance as valid even though not entirely in order or not
accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and/or other document(s)
of title, except with the consent of the Panel an acceptance of the Offer
will only be counted towards fulfilling the acceptance condition if the
requirements of Note 4 and, if applicable, Note 6 on Rule 10 of the Code
are satisfied in respect of it. Except with the consent of the Panel, a
purchase of Lilliput Shares by Stanhome or its nominee(s) (or, if Stanhome
is required to make an offer or offers under the provisions of Rule 9 of
the Code, by a person acting in concert with Stanhome for the purpose of
such offer(s) or its nominee(s)) will only be counted towards fulfilling
the acceptance condition if the requirements of Note 5 and, if applicable,
Note 6 on Rule 10 of the Code are satisfied in respect of it. The Offer may
not be accepted otherwise than by means of a Form of Acceptance.

(l) Except with the consent of the Panel, the Offer will not become
unconditional until The Royal Bank of Scotland plc has issued a certificate
to Stanhome or Goldman Sachs (or their respective agents) which states the
number of Lilliput Shares in respect of which acceptances have been
received which meet the requirements of Note 4 on Rule 10 of the Code and
the number of Lilliput Shares otherwise acquired (whether before or during
the Offer Period) which meet the requirements of Note 5 on Rule 10 of the
Code and, in each case, if applicable, Note 6 on Rule 10 of the Code.
Copies of such certificate will be sent to the Panel as soon as possible
after it is issued.

(m) All mandates and other instructions to Lilliput given by Lilliput
Shareholders or in force relating to holdings of Lilliput Shares will,
unless and until revoked, continue in force in relation to such
shareholders.

(n) All powers of attorney, appointments of agents and authorities on the terms
conferred by or referred to in this Part B of Appendix 1 or in the Form of
Acceptance are given by way of security for the performance of the
obligations of the Lilliput Shareholders concerned and are irrevocable in
accordance with Section 4 of the Powers of Attorney Act 1971, except in the
circumstances where the donor of such power of attorney or authority is
entitled to withdraw his acceptance in accordance with paragraph 3 above 
and duly does so.

(o) The Offer extends to any Lilliput Shareholders not resident in the UK to
whom this document, the Form of Acceptance and any related documents may
not have been despatched and such Lilliput Shareholders may collect copies
of those documents from The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Registrar's
Department, New Issues Section, P.O. Box 859, Consort House, East Street,
Bedminster, Bristol BS99 1XZ. Stanhome and Goldman Sachs reserve the right
to notify any matter, including the making of

17
<PAGE>

the Offer, to all or any Lilliput Shareholders with a registered address
outside the UK (or whom Stanhome knows to be nominees, trustees or
custodians for such persons) by announcement or paid advertisement in a
daily newspaper published and circulated in the UK, in which event such
notice shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given notwithstanding any
failure by a Lilliput Shareholder to receive such notice and all references
in this document to notice, or the provision of information in writing, by
Stanhome, Goldman Sachs and/or their respective agents and/or public
relations consultants shall be construed accordingly.

(p) The Offer is made at 11.59 p.m. on 9th September, 1994 and is capable of
acceptance from and after that time. Forms of Acceptance are available for
collection from Goldman Sachs, Peterborough Court, 133 Fleet Street, London
EC4A 2BB from that time. The Offer is being made by means of this document
and by means of an advertisement in the London edition of the Financial
Times dated 10th September, 1994.

(q) If the Offer does not become unconditional in all respects, Forms of
Acceptance, share certificate(s) and other document(s) of title will be
returned by post (or by such other method as may be approved by the Panel)
within 14 days of the Offer lapsing to the person or agent whose name and
address is set out in the relevant box on the Form of Acceptance or, if
none is set out, to the first-named holder at his registered address
outside the United States or Canada. No such documents will be sent to an
address in the United States or Canada.

(r) If sufficient acceptances are received, Stanhome intends to apply the
provisions of Sections 428 to 430F of the Companies Act 1985 to acquire
compulsorily any outstanding Lilliput Shares.

6. LILLIPUT OVERSEAS SHAREHOLDERS

(a) The making of the Offer in, or to certain persons resident in,
jurisdictions outside the UK or to certain persons who are citizens,
residents or nationals of jurisdictions outside the UK may be affected by
the laws of the relevant overseas jurisdiction. Lilliput Shareholders who
are citizens, residents or nationals of jurisdictions outside the UK should
inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It
is the responsibility of any such person wishing to accept the Offer to
satisfy himself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant
jurisdiction in connection therewith, including the obtaining of any
governmental or other consents which may be required, or the compliance
with other necessary formalities and the payment of any issue, transfer or
other taxes due in such territory. Any such Lilliput Shareholder will be
responsible for any issue, transfer or other taxes by whomsoever payable
and Stanhome shall be entitled to be fully indemnified and held harmless by
such shareholder for any such issue, transfer or other taxes as Stanhome
may be required to pay.

of, the United States or Canada. This includes, but is not limited to,
facsimile transmission, telex and telephone. Stanhome will not (unless
otherwise determined by Stanhome in its sole discretion and save as
provided for in paragraph 6(c) below) mail or deliver, or authorise the
mailing or delivery of, this document, the Form of Acceptance or any
related offering document in or into the United States or Canada, including
to Lilliput Shareholders with registered addresses in the United States or
Canada or to persons whom Stanhome knows to be nominees holding Lilliput
Shares for such persons. Persons receiving such documents should not
distribute or send them in or into the United States or Canada or use such
mails or any such means or instrumentality for any purpose directly or
indirectly in connection with the Offer and so doing may invalidate any
proposed acceptance. Persons wishing to accept the Offer should not use
such mails or any such means or instrumentality for any purpose directly or
indirectly related to acceptance of the Offer. Envelopes containing Form(s)
of Acceptance should not be postmarked in the United States or Canada or
otherwise despatched from the United States or Canada for the receipt of
the remittance of cash or for the return of Form(s) of Acceptance,
certificate(s) for Lilliput Shares and/or other document(s) of title.

(c) The provisions of this paragraph 6 and/or any other terms of the Offer
relating to citizens, residents or nationals of jurisdictions outside the
UK may be waived, varied or modified as regards specific Lilliput
Shareholder(s) or on a general basis by Stanhome in its absolute
discretion. Subject as aforesaid, the provisions of this paragraph 6 shall
have precedence over any terms of the Offer which are inconsistent
therewith.

(E) SELECTED NOTES EXTRACTED FROM THE PUBLISHED AUDITED ACCOUNTS OF STANHOME
INC. FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED 31ST DECEMBER, 1993.

(I) ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

(a) Basis of consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Stanhome Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements. Certain reclassifications have been made to
the prior years' financial statements to make them comparable to the
1993 presentation.

(b) Cash

The carrying amount of cash and certificates of deposit and notes
and loans payable approximate fair value.

The Company considers all highly liquid securities with maturities
of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
Marketable securities consist primarily of treasury bills and
commercial paper maturing as follows:

(c) Direct selling

Sales by certain international direct selling subsidiaries are
transacted at retail prices. However, these sales are reflected in
the consolidated financial statements at equivalent wholesale
selling prices.

(d) Notes and accounts receivable

Notes and accounts receivable were net of allowance for doubtful
accounts of $15.7 million at 31st December, 1993.

(e) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost
components include labour, manufacturing overhead and amounts paid
to suppliers of materials. The Company values raw materials and
certain manufactured and purchased items in the United States and
Italy utilising the last-in, first-out method while the first-in,
first-out method is used for substantially all other inventories.
The cost, on a first-in, first-out basis over the carrying amount of
inventories as reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet was $1.2 million at 31st December, 1993.

The major classes of inventories were as follows:

(f) Pre-paid expenses

The Company incurs prepaid advertising expense in connection with
the marketing of certain of its direct response products. Such
expense is amortised over the life of the associated product
programs which is generally less than one year.

(g) Depreciation

Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the
assets utilising straight-line and declining balance methods. The
methods for financial statement and income tax purposes differ in
some circumstances, resulting in deferred income taxes.

The estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets are:

Buildings and improvements.................................. 15-40
Machinery and equipment..................................... 5-12
Furniture and fixtures...................................... 5-10
Transportation equipment.................................... 3-8
</TABLE>

(h) Amortisation of goodwill

Intangible assets result from the allocation of the excess cost of
acquisitions over net tangible assets acquired. Intangibles were net
of accumulated amortisation of $19.1 million at 31st December, 1993.
Product lines, not resulting from the acquisition of Enesco in 1983
were $18.3 million in 1993 and are being amortised over the shorter
of actual life or 33 years. Other items are being amortised over 5
years. Goodwill is being amortised over 20 to 40 years. Product
lines and other amortisation amounted to $1.0 million for 1993.
Goodwill amortisation was $1.3 million for 1993.

(i) Interest paid

Total Company interest paid was $2.0 million in 1993, $3.4 million
in 1992 and $5.0 million in 1991.

(j) Income from foreign subsidiaries

The Company accrues appropriate US and foreign income taxes on
earnings of subsidiary companies which are intended to be remitted
to the parent company in the near future. The cumulative amount of
unremitted earnings of subsidiaries which has been, or is intended
to be, permanently reinvested, aggregated approximately $16.6 million
at 31st December, 1993. Had such reinvested unremitted earnings been
distributed during 1993, applicable income taxes would have amounted
to approximately $3.6 million representing primarily taxes which
would be withheld by foreign countries.

(k) Earnings per share

Primary earnings per common share are based on the average number of
common shares outstanding and common share equivalents during the
year. Common share equivalents represent dilutive stock options
using the treasury stock method. Fully diluted earnings per common
share assumes, in addition to the above, an additional dilutive
effect of stock options.

The number of shares used in the earnings per common share
computation for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were as follows:

(II) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

The Company and some of its subsidiaries have several employee benefit
plans covering most of their full time US employees. The benefits
under these plans are based primarily on years of service and
compensation rates near retirement. The plans are funded in conformity
with Federal tax and actuarial regulations. The prior year figures for
the domestic plans have been adjusted to include nonqualified
supplemental plans.

Pension expense for the domestic plans includes the following
components:

The weighted average discount rate used to measure the projected
benefit obligation ranges from 5% to 8%, the rate of increase in
future compensation levels ranges from 5% to 7% and the expected long-
term rate of return on assets is 8%.

Certain foreign subsidiaries are required to pay a severance allowance
to eligible employees upon voluntary or involuntary separation.
Provision is made annually for all eligible employees. Generally, such
payments are based upon years of service and level of compensation.

Severance expense for the combined foreign subsidiary severance
allowance programs includes the following components:

The discount rates used to measure the projected benefit obligation
range from 8% to 13.5%, the rate of increase in future compensation
levels ranges from 5.5% to 11.5% and funding is not significant.

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Stanhome Group sponsors
a single-employer defined benefit post retirement health care and life
insurance plan. Substantially all of the US direct selling and
corporate employees may become eligible for the benefits under this
plan if they reach allowable retirement age while working for the
Company or its subsidiaries. Those benefits are provided principally
through insurance companies whose premiums are based on the
anticipated benefits to be paid. The total costs for such retired
employee benefits were principally accrued during their active
employment.

Effective January 1993, the Company adopted Statement No. 106 of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board and formalized its funding policy
for the plan. Under that policy, the Company pays premiums to
insurance companies who provide the post retirement benefits. The
effect of adopting the statement in 1993 was not material to the
Company.

Net periodic post retirement benefit expense for 1993 includes the
following components (in thousands):

</TABLE>

A 25% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health
care benefits was assumed for 1994. The cost trend rate was assumed to
decrease gradually but still remain at double digit rates until 2020.
After 2020, the rate was assumed to drop to and stabilize at 8%.
Increasing the assumed health care expense trend rates by one
percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated post
retirement benefit obligation as of 31st December, 1993 by $500,000
and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of the
net post retirement benefit expense for the year then ended by
$150,000.

The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
post retirement benefit obligation was 6%.

In addition, provisions have been made for unfunded anticipated
retirement benefits for certain Officers. Also, certain subsidiaries
have established funded profit sharing and defined contribution
retirement plans. Total consolidated pension, severance allowance,
profit sharing and retirement plan expense amounted to $9,561,000 in
1993, $9,614,000 in 1992 and $8,579,000 in 1991.

(III) SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY:
In 1988, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights
Plan in which common stock purchase rights were distributed to
shareholders at the rate of one right for each share of common stock
creating common stock together with the associated common stock
purchase rights ("common stock"). The rights are exercisable at $85
per share and will expire on 19th September, 1998.

In 1991, the shareholders approved a new Stock Option Plan previously
adopted by the Board of Directors which provides for both incentive
and nonqualified stock options. Options for up to 2,000,000 shares of
common stock may be granted under the 1991 Plan. The plan provides
that nonqualified options for 1,500 shares of common stock be granted
annually from 1991 through 1995 to each non-employee Director then
serving. The Company also has a 1984 Stock Option Plan, which provides
for both incentive and nonqualified stock options, under which options
for up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock may be granted. Both plans
provide for the granting to selected key employees, and non-employee
Directors in the case of the 1991 Plan, of options to acquire shares
of such stock at a price not less than their fair market value at the
time of grant. Other option terms are determined at the time of grant,
but normally options are exercisable only after a one year waiting
period in four equal annual instalments, and expire ten years from the
date of grant.

In 1993, the Board of Directors approved a Special Interim Chief
Executive Officer Stock Option Plan which provided for a special one-
time grant of nonqualified stock options to the Company's Interim
Chief Executive Officer in lieu of cash compensation. These options
vested fully in increments of 10,000 during each month in which he
served in that capacity, are exercisable six months after the date of
grant, and expire ten years from the date of grant.

Stock option activity under all plans is summarised as follows:

</TABLE>

In 1985, the Company approved a Payroll-Based Stock Ownership Plan
("PAYSOP") which provides common stock to eligible employees and
allows the Company a Federal income tax deduction equal to the market
value of the issued stock. In 1987, the Company introduced an
Investment Savings Plan in accordance with Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. One of the features of this retirement savings
plan provides common stock to eligible employees and allows the
Company a Federal income tax deduction equal to the market value of
the issued stock.

The change in capital in excess of par value resulted from the
exercise of stock options, including the related income tax benefit
($0.7 million, $5.0 million and $4.7 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively), issuance of PAYSOP shares ($0.2 million, $0.2 million
and $0.1 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively) and issuance of
401(k) Plan shares ($0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million in
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively) noted above.

(V) GEOGRAPHICAL AND PRODUCT ANALYSIS

The Company operates predominantly in two major geographic areas and
three business segments. The direct selling segment is engaged in the
manufacture, sale and distribution of household cleaning, personal
grooming and related products. The giftware segment imports and
distributes creatively designed giftware and collectibles to a diverse
group of retailers. The direct response segment markets collectibles
and giftware to consumers and retailers.

Transfers between geographic areas and segments are made at the market
value of the merchandise transferred. The eliminations in the
identifiable assets are for intercompany receivables and profit in
inventory. Corporate assets have consisted principally of certificates
of deposit, time deposits, marketable securities and corporate
receivables.

The following tables summarise the Company's operations by geographic
area and business segment for 1991, 1992 and 1993:

(b) Royalties

The Company and its subsidiaries have entered into various licensing

specified product sales. Royalty payments under these licensing
agreements totalled $28.1 million in 1993, $23.9 million in 1992 and
$21.3 million in 1991. Pursuant to the various licensing agreements,
the future minimum guaranteed royalty payments due as of 31st
December, 1993 were $13.9 million in 1994, $12.4 million in 1995 and
$12.0 million in 1996.

(c) Lines of Credit

At 31st December, 1993 the Company had formal and informal unused
lines of credit of approximately $100.0 million.

(d) FOREX Hedging

The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts as a hedge
against receivables from international subsidiaries. Market value
gains and losses are recognised and the resulting credit or debit
offsets foreign exchange gains or losses on those receivables. At
31st December, 1993 the Company had approximately $22.0 million
(notional amount) of foreign exchange hedge contracts outstanding.

(e) Legal Proceedings

There are various legal proceedings pending against the Company and
its subsidiaries which have arisen during the normal course of

those legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact upon the
consolidated financial condition of the Company.

4. RECENT RESTRUCTURING

In the second quarter of 1993, the Company incurred a restructuring charge of
$17 million pre-tax, $11.5 million after tax, or $0.58 per share. The
restructuring program takes advantage of consolidation opportunities
principally in the distribution and administrative functions within the
Company to achieve future operating efficiencies and savings. It is expected
to include a reduction of approximately 10% of the Company's worldwide work
force of 4,500. The program is expected to be virtually completed by the end
of 1994. When completed, future annual cost savings are expected to be
approximately $11 million pre-tax, $7 million after tax, or $0.35 per share.
Part of the savings generated by the program will be used to build the
Company's profitability, as well as enhance the Company's flexibility to
capitalise on attractive growth opportunities. The charge includes $9.7
million for severance, $4.8 million for facilities closing and moving, $1.7
million write down of current assets, and $0.8 million write down of net fixed
assets.

5. SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS

Set out below are extracts from the text of the unaudited statement of second-
quarter results for Stanhome Inc. for the three months ended 30th June, 1994.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

"Stanhome is building momentum to achieve long-term profitable growth
and, in turn, enhanced shareholder value. Over a year ago, we
commenced a program to increase our Company's operating efficiencies
to achieve important cost savings, and to allocate our resources more
effectively. The effect of this effort is being realized in our
enhanced financial performance. Stanhome is now positioned to take
advantage of increasing growth opportunities on a global basis.

Stanhome's successful second quarter, ended June 30, 1994, reflects
the more efficient cost structure the Company is putting in place, and
a particularly strong record performance by Enesco, the Company's
Worldwide Giftware operation. Stanhome achieved operating profit of
$20,834,000 and net income of $11,608,000 or $.59 per share fully
diluted, on revenues of $188,592,000. This represents a strong
turnaround from the 1993 second quarter ended June 30, when, inclusive
of a $17,000,000 pre-tax restructuring charge for the implementation
of a two year cost savings program, Stanhome incurred a net loss of
$1,223,000, or $.06 per share, on revenues of $187,236,000. The
restructuring charge amounted to $11,500,000 after tax, or $.58 per
share. Operating profit for the 1993 second quarter, exclusive of the
restructuring charge, was $18,719,000.

Both our Worldwide Giftware and Worldwide Direct Response operations
had record revenue and earnings performances for the second quarter.
Our Worldwide Direct Selling operation, even with a lower sales base
than a year ago, produced increased profits and was consistent with
management's expectations.

31
<PAGE>

Worldwide Giftware's record performance reflected a firming of the US
retail marketplace, with strong demand for its Precious Moments and
Cherished Teddies collectible product lines. The success of Enesco
Giftware demonstrates the Group's expertise with respect to
identifying consumer preferences, product design and sourcing. Sound
management of inventories, consistent with demand, also contributed to
the Group's profitability.

Worldwide Direct Response's performance was achieved against an
exceptionally strong 1993 second quarter. In 1993, the Hamilton Group
experienced a sizable increase in volume relating to expanded shipment
of products to consumers on credit, and to expanded use of Enesco
product lines. Hamilton is proceeding with its strategy of broadening
its product offerings.

Worldwide Direct Selling's enhanced profitability on lower revenues is
testimony to the cost efficiencies now being realized in that
operation. Lower sales in the US, due in part to the economy and in
part to cost efficiencies, combined with the sluggish business
environment in Europe and unfavourable foreign currency exchange
rates, were primarily responsible for the Group's lower revenues.

Stanhome's enhanced profitability is indicative of how we are
positioning the Company for profitable growth long-term as a worldwide
marketing and distribution enterprise. Each of Stanhome's three
businesses--Worldwide Giftware, Worldwide Direct Response and
Worldwide Direct Selling--has a strong presence in its respective
market. Each has attractive potential to grow globally. With the
appropriate cost structures in place, we are achieving greater
operating efficiencies and, in turn, greater profit margin potential
which should result in building Stanhome's inherent value to you, the
shareholder.

The Company is continuing to purchase its stock under the repurchase
program authorized by the Board of Directors; 1,149,000 shares remain
to be purchased in this approved program following the purchase of
252,000 shares during the second quarter."

(E) SELECTED NOTES EXTRACTED FROM LILLIPUT'S PUBLISHED AUDITED ACCOUNTS FOR
THE THREE FINANCIAL PERIODS ENDED 31ST DECEMBER, 1993.

(I) ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Basis of preparation

The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and
in accordance with applicable accounting standards.

36
<PAGE>
(b) Basis of consolidation

The group accounts consolidate the accounts of Lilliput and all its
subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year. The 1992
accounts were drawn up to 3rd January, 1993. No profit and loss
account is presented for Lilliput as provided by Section 230 of the
Companies Act 1985.

(c) Research and development

Research and development expenditure is written off as it is
incurred.

(d) Depreciation

Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than
freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost or
valuation, less residual value, of each asset on a straight line
basis over its expected useful life. The expected useful lives are:
<TABLE> 
<S> <C> 
Freehold buildings............... 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings..... the term of the lease in equal
annual instalments
Plant, machinery and equipment... 4 to 5 years
Motor vehicles................... 4 years
</TABLE> 
(e) Leased Assets

Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases, which
are those where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
of the asset have passed to the Lilliput Group, are capitalised in
the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives.

The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the
profit and loss account over the period of the contract or lease and
represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital
repayments outstanding.

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a
straight line basis over the term of the lease.

(f) Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realiseable value.
Cost comprises amounts incurred in bringing each product to its
present location and condition as follows:
<TABLE> 
<S> <C> 
Raw materials................................ purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis
Work in progress and finished goods.......... cost of direct materials and labour plus
attributable overheads based on the
normal level of activity
</TABLE> 
Net realiseable value is based on estimated selling price less
further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

(g) Deferred Taxation

Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method on all
timing differences to the extent that they are expected to reverse
in the future without being replaced, calculated at the rate at
which it is anticipated the timing differences will reverse.

(h) Foreign currencies

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling
at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the
transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate. Investments
in overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of
exchange ruling at the date of the investment. All differences are
taken to the profit and loss account.

On consolidation, the accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings
are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date. The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of
opening net assets is taken directly to reserves. All other
translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account.

(II) PENSIONS

The Lilliput Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they become
payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.

(III) TURNOVER AND SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS

Turnover represents the amounts derived from the provision of goods and
services which fall within the Lilliput Group's ordinary activities,
stated net of value added tax.

37
<PAGE>

All of the turnover, operating profit and net operating assets
(i.e., excluding those assets and liabilities on which interest is
earned or paid respectively) relate to the manufacture and sale of
miniature cottages as collectibles and giftware, and are analysed as
follows:

2. INTERIM RESULTS

Set out below is the unaudited interim statement of Lilliput for the six months
ended 30th June, 1994.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

TRADING RESULTS

Turnover in the six months ended 30th June, 1994 increased to
(Pounds)7.5 million (1993: (Pounds)7.1 million) and pre-tax profits
were (Pounds)1.13 million (1992: (Pounds)1.08 million). Earnings per
share remain unchanged at 3.2p.

The Board has declared an interim dividend of 1.65p (net) per share,
an increase of 14 per cent. over the notional interim dividend of
1.45p (net) per share for the same period last year. This dividend
will be paid to shareholders on the register on 29th September, 1994.

Sales in the US have continued to be affected by the difficult trading
conditions in the US collectibles market that I referred to in my
Chairman's statement accompanying the preliminary announcement of the
Group's 1993 results. US sales for the period were 16 per cent. below
1993 levels and this has reduced profits by approximately
(Pounds)150,000. The Board has thoroughly reviewed the product
offering and special requirements of the American market over the last
six months. New product concepts are expected to be launched in early
1995 that should widen the appeal of the Lilliput Lane brand and open
up new channels of distribution.

Sales elsewhere have continued to improve at a steady rate with sales
in the UK 7 per cent. ahead of the same period last year and sales in
other export markets 25 per cent. ahead.

At the end of 1993 the Board took steps to increase production levels
in order to meet the peak demand experienced at Christmas. These
increased levels of production have been maintained as part of a
specific strategy to ensure an adequate supply of product for
Lilliput's retailers and to provide them with higher levels of
service. This has resulted in an increase in the level of stocks held
by Lilliput and a consequent one-off reduction in the level of stocks
held by retailers. However this does provide us with the ability to
respond quickly to the expected increased demand in the second half of
this year.

45
<PAGE>

Membership of the Collectors' Club has continued to grow and worldwide
membership now stands at 72,400 compared to 68,539 at 31st December,
1993.

CURRENT TRADING AND PROSPECTS

Although there are signs that the UK economy is strengthening we are
finding, in common with many businesses, that the strength of the
recovery is fragile. The second half is the seasonally more important
half of Lilliput's year both in terms of sales and profits and the
Board remains optimistic about the outcome for the full year.

NOTES TO THE INTERIM ACCOUNTS AS AT 30TH JUNE, 1994

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION

The interim accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounting
policies set out in the Group's 1993 Annual Report. Fixed annual
charges are apportioned to the interim period on the basis of time
elapsed. Other expenses are accrued in accordance with the same
principles used in the preparation of the annual accounts. The
taxation charge is calculated by applying the directors' best estimate
of the annual effective tax rate to the profit for the period.

3. EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE

Earnings per ordinary share are based on the profit attributable to
equity shareholders for the period and on 23,269,420 (1993:
18,716,189) ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue, as adjusted, during the period.

4. PAYMENT OF DIVIDEND

The interim dividend of 1.65p per share will be paid on 14th October,
1994 to holders of ordinary shares on the register at the close of
business on 29th September, 1994.

5. CIRCULATION

This statement will be available from Lilliput's registered office at
Skirsgill, Penrith, Cumbria, CA11 0DP.

6. REPORT OF THE AUDITORS

To the members of Lilliput Group plc

We have reviewed the interim financial information for the six months
ended 30th June, 1994 set out on pages 45 to 48 which is the
responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. Our
responsibility is to report on the results of our review.

Our review was carried out having regard to the Bulletin "Review of
Interim Financial Information", issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. This review consisted principally of obtaining an understanding
of the process for the preparation of the interim financial
information, applying analytical procedures to the underlying
financial data, assessing whether accounting policies have been
consistently applied, and making enquiries of Group management
responsible for financial and accounting matters. The review excluded
audit procedures such as tests of controls and vertification of assets
and liabilities, and was therefore substantially less in scope than an
audit performed in accordance with Auditing Standards. Accordingly, we
do not express an audit opinion on the interim financial information.

On the basis of our review:

In our opinion the interim financial information has been prepared
using accounting policies consistent with those adopted by Lilliput
Group plc in its financial statements for the year ended 31st
December, 1993; and

We are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to
the interim financial information as presented.

6. MATERIAL CONTRACTS

The following contracts (not being contracts entered into in the ordinary
course of business) have been entered into by members of the Lilliput Group
since 1st September, 1992 and are or may be material:

(i) an agreement dated 11th November, 1993 between Lilliput, the executive
Directors of Lilliput, W D Dodd, The North of England Venture Fund
Limited, Coutts & Co and Lazard Venture Funds (Managers) Limited,
whereby a subscription agreement dated 22nd August, 1990 (pursuant to
which an equity investment of (Pounds)1.2 million was made in Lilliput)
was terminated; and

(ii) an agreement dated 12th November, 1993 between Lilliput, the
shareholders of Lilliput, the Directors of Lilliput and NatWest Markets
whereby, in connection with the admission of Lilliput Shares to the
Official List of the Stock Exchange, NatWest Markets, as agent for
National Westminster Bank Plc, underwrote the sale of 9,814,823 existing
Lilliput Shares and the issue of 2,222,214 new Lilliput Shares, in each
case at 135p per share, by way of a placing and an intermediaries offer.
Lilliput paid commissions in respect of the new Lilliput Shares so
issued and advisory fees to NatWest Markets and the brokers.

7. FINANCING

The Offer is to be financed by means of facilities made available to Stanhome
by Mellon Bank, N.A., Banca Popolare di Milano, Chemical Connecticut
Corporation and The First National Bank of Boston. By a facility advisement
letter agreement dated 30th August 1994 Mellon Bank, N.A. agreed to make
available to Stanhome an aggregate facility amount of $25,000,000 on the terms
and conditions therein described. Stanhome Inc. has entered into a guarantee
agreement dated 6th September, 1994 in favour of Mellon Bank, N.A. in respect
of this facility. The other three banks have confirmed to Goldman Sachs by
means of letters dated 30th August, 1994, that facilities have been made
available to Stanhome. Those facilities are as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Banca Popolare di Milano............................................ $15,000,000
Chemical Connecticut Corporation.................................... $15,000,000
The First National Bank of Boston................................... $25,000,000
</TABLE>

Neither repayment of, nor security for, any liability (contingent or
otherwise) of Stanhome will depend to any significant extent on the business
of Lilliput, although the payment of interest by Stanhome in respect of the
above facilities will depend upon the receipt by Stanhome of income from
Lilliput or upon finance being received by Stanhome from elsewhere in the
Stanhome Group.

Goldman Sachs is satisfied that Stanhome has the necessary financial resources
for it to implement the Offer in full. Full acceptance of the Offer would
involve the payment of approximately (Pounds)38.2 million in cash by Stanhome
(assuming exercise of all outstanding options under the Lilliput Share Option
Schemes).

8. OTHER INFORMATION

(a) The expenses of, and incidental to, the preparation and circulation of the
Offer will be paid by Stanhome.

(b) No proposal exists in connection with the Offer whereby any payment or
other benefit shall be made or given to any Director of Lilliput as
compensation for loss of office or as consideration for or in connection
with his loss of office.

(c) (i) Save as disclosed herein, no agreement, arrangement or understanding
exists between Stanhome or any party acting in concert with Stanhome and any
of the directors or recent directors, shareholders or recent shareholders of
Lilliput having any connection with or dependence on the Offer.

53

the worldwide Stanhome Inc. Management Incentive Plan.

(d) There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding whereby the beneficial
ownership of any of the Lilliput Shares acquired by Stanhome in pursuance of
the Offer will be transferred to any other person, save that Stanhome
reserves the right to transfer any such shares to any member of the Stanhome
Group.

STANHOME PLC

11th October, 1994

To the holders of Lilliput shares who have not accepted the Offer

Dear Sir or Madam,

OFFER BY STANHOME PLC ("STANHOME") TO ACQUIRE THE ENTIRE
ISSUED AND TO BE ISSUED ORDINARY SHARE CAPITAL OF LILLIPUT GROUP PLC
("LILLIPUT")

The offer made by Goldman Sachs International on behalf of Stanhome on 9th
September, 1994 ("the Offer") to acquire all the issued and to be issued
ordinary shares of 5p each in Lilliput not already owned by the Stanhome Group
was declared unconditional in all respects on Monday, 3rd October, 1994. At
that time acceptances from the holders of approximately 65.49 per cent. of
Lilliput's issued ordinary share capital had been received, and Stanhome had
purchased approximately 27.95 per cent. Stanhome therefore owns or controls
approximately 93.4 per cent. of Lilliput's issued ordinary share capital.

The terms of the offer were 160p in cash for each Lilliput ordinary share.

According to our records we have not received your acceptance of the Offer and
we therefore enclose the statutory notice under section 429 of the Companies
Act 1985 informing you that Stanhome will apply the procedure under that
section compulsorily to acquire your ordinary shares in Lilliput. Upon
completion of the compulsory acquisition Stanhome intends to institute
proceedings to remove Lilliput's listing on the London Stock Exchange.

If you have lost or mislaid your Form of Acceptance, further copies can be
obtained from The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Registrar's Department, New
Issues Section, P.O Box 859, Consort House, East Street, Bedminster, Bristol,
BS99 1XZ. If you do not accept the Offer in the normal way your shares will in
any event be compulsorily acquired pursuant to section 429 of the Companies Act
1985.

Yours faithfully

THE BOARD OF LILLIPUT, WHICH HAS BEEN SO ADVISED BY NATWEST MARKETS, CONSIDERS
THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSAL TO BE FAIR AND REASONABLE.

STANHOME PLC

11th October, 1994

To participants in The Lilliput Group plc Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
(the "SAYE Scheme")

DEAR OPTIONHOLDER,

RECOMMENDED CASH OFFER ON BEHALF OF STANHOME PLC ("STANHOME")
A SUBSIDIARY OF STANHOME INC.
FOR
LILLIPUT GROUP PLC ("LILLIPUT")

You will have received a copy of the Offer Document in which it was stated
that a cash cancellation proposal would in due course be put to Optionholders
under the Lilliput Share Option Schemes who have not exercised their options
during the Offer Period. On 3rd October, 1994 the Offer was declared wholly
unconditional and Stanhome now controls over 90 per cent. of the issued and to
be issued shared capital of Lilliput which is the subject of the Offer. You
will see from Appendix I to this document on page 4 of this document, the
alternative courses of action available to holders of options under the SAYE
Scheme. We are writing to propose to you the separate offer under which you
may surrender your option for a cash payment (the "Proposal").

THE PROPOSAL

Under the Proposal, you may elect to surrender your option in return for a
cash payment.

We hereby offer to pay you a cash payment in consideration of the surrender of
any option held by you. The cash sum will be calculated by multiplying the
number of Lilliput Shares that can be purchased with the proceeds of your
related share save account with the Halifax Building Society ("the Sharesave
Account") standing to the credit of that account at the close of business on
11th October, 1994 by 160p and deducting therefrom the total subscription
price which would have been payable on exercise of the option.

If you accept the Proposal you will avoid the two-stage process of having to
exercise your option and subsequently being required to sell your shares to
Stanhome.

HALIFAX BUILDING SOCIETY SHARESAVE ACCOUNT

You should note that acceptance of the Proposal does not require you to close
your Sharesave Account nor for any amounts to be deducted from your Sharesave
Account. If you wish, your Sharesave Account can be continued until maturity
of the related savings contract or, as the case may be, closed in accordance
with any instructions you may give to the Halifax Building Society. The
ability to continue the Sharesave Account may be of particular significance
for those Optionholders who wish to take advantage of the tax reliefs
available in relation to the bonus payable upon maturity of the savings
contract underlying the Sharesave Account.

WORKED EXAMPLE OF THE PROPOSAL

An Optionholder has an option over Lilliput Shares exercisable at 98p per
Lilliput Share. On the date of the Proposal the balance of the Optionholder's
Sharesave Account is (Pounds)196. This amount would allow the

2
<PAGE>

Optionholder to acquire 200 Lilliput Shares. The Optionholder may therefore
accept the Proposal in respect of options over 200 Lilliput Shares and would
receive the following consideration under the Proposal:-

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
(Pounds)
<S> <C> 
Cash sum 200 X 160p 320 
less 200 X 98p (196)
-----
Net cash sum 124 
===== 
</TABLE>

No account has been taken of any liability to taxation in the above example.

TAXATION

You should note that by electing to surrender your option in accordance with
the Proposal you will be subject to income tax in the current year of
assessment at your highest marginal rate on the proceeds of surrender of your
options (that is, on the net cash sum which you receive). If you were to
exercise your option in accordance with the terms of the SAYE Scheme, to the
extent that such exercise is permitted by the rules of the SAYE Scheme, rather
than accept the Proposal, the tax consequences are likely to be essentially the
same.

IF YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT ABOUT YOUR TAX POSITION YOU ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT AN
INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVISER IMMEDIATELY.

PROCEDURE FOR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROPOSAL

To accept the Proposal you must ascertain from Rob Freestone, the Company
Secretary of Lilliput, the number of shares you could subscribe for as at 11th
October, 1994. To accept the Proposal you should complete the accompanying
Form. This should be signed and returned with the relevant option certificate
as soon as possible, but in any event so as to reach Rob Freestone at Lilliput
Group plc, Skirsgill, Penrith, Cumbria CA11 0DP no later than close of business
on 12th November, 1994. The Proposal will close at close of business on 12th
November, 1994 unless Stanhome has previously agreed to extend this time limit.

SETTLEMENT

SETTLEMENT WILL NOT BE MADE UNTIL AFTER RECEIPT OF A VALID COMPLETED FORM AND
YOUR OPTION CERTIFICATE.

IF YOU ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL AND YOUR VALIDLY COMPLETED FORM AND OPTION
CERTIFICATE ARE RECEIVED NOT LATER THAN 14TH OCTOBER, 1994, A CHEQUE WILL BE
DESPATCHED TO YOU ON OR BEFORE 21ST OCTOBER, 1994. OTHERWISE, CHEQUES WILL BE
DESPATCHED NOT LATER THAN 21 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF A VALID AND COMPLETED FORM
TOGETHER WITH YOUR OPTION CERTIFICATE.

COMPULSORY ACQUISITION

You will find enclosed a notice of our intention to exercise rights of
compulsory acquisition pursuant to section 429 of the Companies Act 1985 as
regards all Lilliput Shares. Pursuant to Rule 7.2 of the SAYE Scheme your
option shall remain exercisable until 12th November, 1994 and shall thereafter
lapse and cease to be of any further value. The extent to which you may
exercise your option under the SAYE Scheme will depend on the amount of savings
you have made. No interest will be payable and in order to exercise you will
have to close your Sharesave Account, which you could otherwise have continued
to maturity as explained above.

To the extent that an option is exercisable under the rules of the SAYE Scheme,
the Lilliput Shares issued pursuant to such exercise will be compulsorily
acquired under section 429 of the Companies Act 1985.

The tax consequences of this course of action are set out in Appendix II to
this document.

Yours faithfully

APPENDIX I

1. INTRODUCTION

The definitions set out in Appendix III are used in this description of your
rights.

The Offer made on behalf of Stanhome for Lilliput is to pay 160 pence in cash
for each Lilliput Share.

The following courses of action are open to you under and subject to the Rules
of the SAYE Scheme:-

(i) you may take up the Proposal set out in the accompanying letter from
Stanhome; or

(ii) you may exercise your option and become a Lilliput Shareholder. The
Lilliput Shares issued pursuant to such exercise will then be compulsorily
acquired by Stanhome. You have a limited period in which to exercise your
option if you are permitted to do so under the rules of the SAYE Scheme.
This is explained in paragraph 3 below; or

(iii) you may do nothing in which case your option will lapse on 12th November,
1994 and cease to be of any further value.

The taxation consequences of these courses of action are set out in Appendix II.

2. THE PROPOSAL

Stanhome is offering you a cash sum in consideration of the cancellation of
your option. The terms and conditions of the Proposal are set out in the
accompanying letter.

For each option to acquire a Lilliput Share which would be capable of being
exercised and in respect of which you validly accept the Proposal, you will be
paid 160p less the exercise price per share of that option.

You need not close your Sharesave Account and if you maintain it you will
continue to obtain favourable tax treatment in respect of it.

3. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS

To the extent that you are permitted to exercise your option and become a
Lilliput Shareholder, you should be aware that pursuant to Rule 7.2 of the SAYE
Scheme your right to exercise your option will cease on 12th November, 1994, as
Stanhome has exercised its rights under section 429 of the Companies Act 1985
compulsorily to acquire any remaining Lilliput Shares. Any option not exercised
by 12th November, 1994 will lapse and cease to be of any further value.

You may not exercise your option with a sum exceeding the total repayment due
to you under your Sharesave Account.

If you exercise your option the Lilliput Shares issued pursuant to such
exercise will be compulsorily acquired on the terms set out in the Offer
Document by Stanhome under section 429 of the Companies Act 1985.

Further details of the Offer are given in the Offer Document.

4. IF YOU TAKE NO ACTION

If you take no action, your option will lapse on 12th November, 1994.

5. TAXATION

A summary of the tax implications of the courses of action described above is
set out in Appendix II. The precise implications for you will, however, depend
on your particular circumstances. If you are in any doubt, you should consult a
professional tax adviser.

6. GENERAL

If you have any questions concerning the proposals set out in this document,
you should refer them to Rob Freestone at Lilliput.

4
<PAGE>

APPENDIX II

TAXATION

The following is a summary of the likely United Kingdom taxation implications
of the courses of action described in this letter for optionholders resident
for tax purposes in the United Kingdom. The precise implications for you will,
however, depend on your particular circumstances and, if you are in any doubt
as to your tax position, you should consult a professional adviser. This
applies in particular to any optionholder not resident nor ordinarily resident
for tax purposes in the United Kingdom.

You should also refer to the taxation paragraphs of the Offer Document for
general taxation information relating to the Offer.

1. ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROPOSAL (I.E. CASH CANCELLATION OF OPTIONS)

If you accept the Proposal you will be subject to income tax on the value of
the consideration you receive (that is, the cash sum) in return for cancelling
your option.

2. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND COMPULSORY ACQUISITION

If you exercise your option you will be subject to income tax on the amount by
which the market value of the Lilliput Shares acquired on exercise of your
option exceeds the option exercise price.

If you exercise your option, the Lilliput Shares issued pursuant to such
exercise will be compulsorily acquired by Stanhome on the terms set out in the
Offer Document. You may, depending on your personal circumstances, be liable
for Capital Gains Tax ("CGT").

The amount of any gain chargeable to CGT will be based on the proceeds of sale
of your Lilliput Shares less your allowable acquisition costs of those shares.
The allowable acquisition cost of your shares will equal the market value of
the shares on the date of exercise.

Liability to CGT is particularly dependent on your personal circumstances. You
should be aware that, if you already hold Lilliput Shares, the disposal of
those shares may trigger an overall CGT liability even though some of the
shares forming part of the pool have been acquired at full market value.

You will only be liable to CGT to the extent that your total chargeable gains
(less allowable capital losses) for the entire tax year 1994/95 exceed the
annual exempt amount which is, for individuals, (Pounds)5,800 for the tax year
1994/95.

3. TAX RETURNS

IF YOU HAVE TO PAY INCOME TAX ON MONEY RECEIVED WHEN YOU EXERCISE YOUR OPTION
OR ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL YOU MUST GIVE DETAILS OF THE MONEY RECEIVED ON YOUR
INCOME TAX RETURN FOR THE TAX YEAR ENDING 5TH APRIL, 1995. IF YOU DO NOT
NORMALLY COMPLETE AN INCOME TAX RETURN IT IS INCUMBENT UPON YOU TO DO SO IN
RESPECT OF THIS ADDITIONAL INCOME.

YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO PUT ASIDE SUFFICIENT MONEY TO ENABLE YOU TO MEET
THE INCOME TAX WHICH YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPAY IN DUE COURSE.

DEAR OPTIONHOLDER,

RECOMMENDED CASH OFFER ON BEHALF OF STANHOME PLC ("STANHOME")
A SUBSIDIARY OF STANHOME INC.
FOR
LILLIPUT GROUP PLC ("LILLIPUT")

I refer to the offer (the "Offer") which has been made on behalf of Stanhome to

copy of the Offer document was sent to you on 9th September, 1994 and the Offer

In the accompanying letter to you from Stanhome, you will find details of a

STANHOME PLC

11th October, 1994

To participants in The Lilliput Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme (the
"Executive Scheme")

DEAR OPTIONHOLDER,

RECOMMENDED CASH OFFER ON BEHALF OF STANHOME PLC ("STANHOME")
A SUBSIDIARY OF STANHOME INC.
FOR
LILLIPUT GROUP PLC ("LILLIPUT")

You will have received a copy of the Offer Document in which it was stated that
a cash cancellation proposal would in due course be put to Optionholders under
the Lilliput Share Option Schemes who have not exercised their options during
the Offer Period. On 3rd October, 1994 the Offer was declared wholly
unconditional and Stanhome now controls over 90 per cent. of the issued and to
be issued shared capital of Lilliput which is the subject of the Offer. You
will see from Appendix I to this document, on page 4 of this document, the
alternative courses of action available to holders of options under the
Executive Scheme. We are writing to propose to you the separate offer under
which you may surrender your option for a cash payment (the "Proposal").

THE PROPOSAL

Under the Proposal, you may elect to surrender your option in return for a cash
payment. This may assist Optionholders who do not wish to raise the funds
necessary to pay for the exercise of their options to the extent that such
exercise is permitted by the rules of the Executive Scheme.

We hereby offer to pay you a cash payment in consideration of the surrender of
any option held by you. The cash sum will be calculated by multiplying the
number of Lilliput Shares over which such option would be exercisable, were it
to be validly exercised on the date upon which the completed Form relating to
your option is received, by 160p and deducting therefrom the total subscription
price which would have been payable on exercise of the option.

If you accept the Proposal you will avoid the two-stage process of having to
exercise your option and subsequently having to sell your shares to Stanhome.

WORKED EXAMPLE OF THE PROPOSAL

An Optionholder who surrenders an option over 10,000 Lilliput Shares
exercisable at 135p per Lilliput Share would receive the following
consideration under the Proposal:-

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
(Pounds)
<S> <C>
Cash sum 10,000 X 160p 16,000
less 10,000 X 135p (13,500)
------
Net cash sum 2,500
======
</TABLE>

No account has been taken of any liability to taxation in the above example.

<PAGE>

TAXATION

You should note that by electing to surrender your option in accordance with
the Proposal you will be subject to income tax in the current year of
assessment at your highest marginal rate on the proceeds of surrender of your
option (that is, on the net cash sum which you receive). If you were to
exercise your option in accordance with the terms of the Executive Scheme, to
the extent that such exercise is permitted by the Rules of the Executive
Scheme, rather than accept the Proposal, the tax consequences are likely to be
essentially the same.

IF YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT ABOUT YOUR TAX POSITION YOU ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT A
PROFESSIONAL TAX ADVISER IMMEDIATELY.

PROCEDURE FOR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROPOSAL

To accept the Proposal you must complete the accompanying Form. This should be
signed and returned with the relevant option certificate as soon as possible,
but in any event so as to reach Rob Freestone at Lilliput Group plc, Skirsgill,
Penrith, Cumbria CA11 0DP not later than close of business on 12th November,
1994. The Proposal will close at close of business on 12th November, 1994
unless Stanhome has previously agreed to extend this time limit.

SETTLEMENT

SETTLEMENT WILL NOT BE MADE UNTIL AFTER RECEIPT OF A VALID COMPLETED FORM AND
YOUR OPTION CERTIFICATE.

IF YOU ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL AND YOUR VALIDLY COMPLETED FORM AND OPTION
CERTIFICATE ARE RECEIVED NOT LATER THAN 14TH OCTOBER, 1994 A CHEQUE WILL BE
DESPATCHED TO YOU ON OR BEFORE 21ST OCTOBER, 1994. OTHERWISE, CHEQUES WILL BE
DESPATCHED NOT LATER THAN 21 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF A VALID AND COMPLETED FORM
AND YOUR OPTION CERTIFICATE.

COMPULSORY ACQUISITION

You will find enclosed a notice of our intention to exercise rights of
compulsory acquisition pursuant to section 429 of the Companies Act 1985 as
regards all Lilliput Shares. Pursuant to Rule 6.2 of the Executive Scheme your
option will remain exercisable until 12th November, 1994 and shall thereafter
lapse and cease to be of any further value.

To the extent that options are exercisable under the rules of the Executive
Scheme, the Lilliput Shares issued pursuant to such exercise will be
compulsorily acquired under section 429 of the Companies Act 1985.

The tax consequences of this course of action are set out in Appendix II to
this document.

YOURS FAITHFULLY

[SIGNATURE OF G. WILLIAM SEAWRIGHT APPEARS HERE]

FOR STANHOME PLC

APPENDIX I

1. INTRODUCTION

The definitions set out in Appendix III are used in this description of your
rights.

The Offer made on behalf of Stanhome for Lilliput is to pay 160 pence in cash
for each Lilliput Share over which an option is held by you.

The following courses of action are open to you under and subject to the Rules
of the Executive Scheme:-

(i) you may take up the Proposal set out in the accompanying letter from
Stanhome; or

(ii) you may exercise your option and become a Lilliput Shareholder. The
Lilliput Shares issued pursuant to such exercise will then be compulsorily
acquired by Stanhome. You have a limited period in which to exercise your
option if you are permitted to do so under the rules of the Executive
Share Scheme. This is explained in paragraph 3 below; or

(iii) you may do nothing in which case your options will lapse on 12th November,
1994 and cease to be of any further value.

The taxation consequences of these courses of action are set out in Appendix
II.

2. THE PROPOSAL

Stanhome is offering you a cash sum in consideration of the cancellation of
your option. The terms and conditions of the Proposal are set out in the
accompanying letter.

For each Lilliput Share over which an option is held by you in respect of which
you accept the Proposal, you will be paid 160p less the exercise price per
share of your option.

3. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS

To the extent that you are permitted to exercise your options and become a
Lilliput Shareholder, you should be aware that pursuant to Rule 6.2 of the
Executive Scheme your right to exercise your options will cease on 12th
November, 1994, as Stanhome has exercised its rights under section 429 of the
Companies Act 1985 compulsorily to acquire any remaining Lilliput Shares. Any
option not exercised by then will lapse and cease to be of any further value.

If you exercise your option the Lilliput Shares issued pursuant to such
exercise will be compulsorily acquired on the terms set out in the Offer
Document by Stanhome under section 429 of the Companies Act 1985.

Further details of the Offer are given in the Offer Document.

4. IF YOU TAKE NO ACTION

If you take no action, your option will lapse on 12th November, 1994.

5. TAXATION

A summary of the tax implications of the courses of action described above is
set out in Appendix II. The precise implications for you will, however, depend
on your particular circumstances. If you are in any doubt, you should consult a
professional tax adviser.

6. GENERAL

If you have any questions concerning the proposals set out in this document,
you should refer them to Rob Freestone at Lilliput.

APPENDIX II

TAXATION

The following is a summary of the likely United Kingdom taxation implications
of the courses of action described in this letter for optionholders resident
for tax purposes in the United Kingdom. The precise implications for you will,
however, depend on your particular circumstances and, if you are in any doubt
as to your tax position, you should consult a professional adviser. This
applies in particular to any optionholder not resident or ordinarily resident
for tax purposes in the United Kingdom.

You should also refer to the taxation paragraphs of the Offer Document for
general taxation information relating to the Offer.

1. ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROPOSAL (IE CASH CANCELLATION OF OPTIONS)

If you accept the Proposal you will be subject to income tax on the value of
the consideration you receive (that is, the cash sum) in return for cancelling
your option.

2. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND COMPULSORY ACQUISITION

If you exercise your option you will be subject to income tax on the amount by
which the market value of the Lilliput Shares acquired on exercise of your
options exceeds the option exercise price.

If you exercise your option, the Lilliput Shares issued pursuant to such
exercise will be compulsorily acquired by Stanhome on the terms set out in the
Offer Document. You may, depending on your personal circumstances, be liable
for Capital Gains Tax, ("CGT").

The amount of any gain chargeable to CGT will be based on the proceeds of sale
of your Lilliput Shares less your allowable acquisition costs of those shares.
The allowable acquisition cost of your shares will equal the market value of
the shares on the date of exercise.

Liability to CGT is particularly dependent on your personal circumstances. You
should be aware that if you already hold Lilliput Shares, the disposal of
those shares may trigger an overall CGT liability even though some of the
shares forming part of the pool have been acquired at full market value.

You will only be liable to CGT to the extent that your total chargeable gains
(less allowable capital losses) for the entire tax year 1994/95 exceed the
annual exempt amount which is, for individuals, (Pounds)5,800 for the tax year
1994/95.

3. TAX RETURNS

IF YOU HAVE TO PAY INCOME TAX ON MONEY RECEIVED WHEN YOU EXERCISE YOUR OPTION
OR ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL YOU MUST GIVE DETAILS OF THE MONEY RECEIVED ON YOUR
INCOME TAX RETURN FOR THE TAX YEAR ENDING 5TH APRIL, 1995. IF YOU DO NOT
NORMALLY COMPLETE AN INCOME TAX RETURN IT IS INCUMBENT UPON YOU TO DO SO IN
RESPECT OF THIS ADDITIONAL INCOME.

YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO PUT ASIDE SUFFICIENT MONEY TO ENABLE YOU TO MEET
THE INCOME TAX WHICH YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPAY IN DUE COURSE.
