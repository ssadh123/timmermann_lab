EXHIBIT A

Birmingham, Alabama, January 25, 1994: Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) today
announced that 1993 net earnings were $88,229,000, or $2.39 per share, as
compared with net earnings and earnings per share, before the cumulative effect
of an accounting change, of $90,980,000 and $2.41 in 1992. In the first quarter
of 1992 the Company adopted an accounting change referable to income taxes that
increased net earnings by $3,005,000, or 8 cents per share. With the accounting
change included, last year's net earnings and earnings per share totaled
$93,985,000 and $2.49, respectively.

Sales in 1993 were $1,133,489,000, up 5 percent from the 1992 total of
$1,078,035,000. Pretax earnings were $125,222,000 as compared to $130,726,000
in 1992.

The Company's 1993 effective tax rate was 29.5 percent, down from the 1992 rate
of 30.4 percent. The decrease reflects principally an increased favorable
effect of statutory depletion and an adjustment to prior year accruals for state
income taxes, partially offset by an increase in the federal statutory rate.
The increase in the federal rate, including an adjustment to deferred taxes for
the rate change, lowered 1993 earnings per share by 6 cents.

Fourth quarter sales were $281,959,000, up 4 percent from the $270,853,000
reported in 1992. Pretax earnings of $28,261,000 increased 2 percent from
1992's fourth quarter amount of $27,625,000. Net earnings and earnings per
share in the fourth quarter of 1993 totaled $20,550,000 and 57 cents,
respectively. These results compare favorably with net earnings and earnings
per share in the fourth quarter of 1992 of $20,356,000 and 55 cents.

All results are preliminary and, as yet, unaudited.

The Construction Materials segment reported fourth quarter sales of
$191,287,000, up 11 percent from 1992. The increase reflects principally
stronger demand in most crushed stone markets. Shipments of crushed stone in
the quarter increased 9 percent from last year's level. Unit selling prices
also improved slightly. Chemicals fourth quarter sales were $90,672,000, down
9 percent from corresponding 1992 sales of $99,177,000. The decrease reflects
a sharp decline in caustic soda prices, partially offset by improved prices for
chlorine and organic products.

Construction Materials segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 1993 totaled
$31,040,000, up 64 percent from the $18,961,000 reported for the same quarter of
1992. This increase was due principally to higher volume, as well as improved
prices. The Chemicals segment reported a fourth quarter loss of $907,000 in
1993 as compared with 1992 segment earnings of $10,488,000. The decline
reflects lower net prices and a less favorable product mix.

For the full year, Construction Materials sales totaled $756,659,000, up 10
percent from the 1992 result of $686,396,000. The increase reflects mainly
improved volumes, including a 7 percent increase in crushed stone shipments.
Improved unit selling prices also contributed to the increase. Full-year
segment earnings of $116,689,000 increased 32 percent from 1992's level of
$88,330,000, again reflecting principally higher volume.

Chemicals 1993 sales of $376,830,000 declined 4 percent from the 1992 level of
$391,639,000. Lower caustic soda prices and unfavorable product mix changes
were only partially offset by improved prices for chlorine and organic products.
Segment earnings for the year of $17,400,000 were down sharply from 1992's
result of $51,279,000. The decline reflects net lower prices, the less
favorable product mix and higher energy, raw material and manufacturing costs.

Selling, administrative and general expenses for the Company totaled
$111,085,000 in 1993, up 5 percent from the 1992 level. This increase reflects
principally higher bad-debt provisions, higher professional fees and normal
increases in personnel costs, partially offset by lower provisions for
stock-based incentive plans.

Other income, net of other charges, was $3,740,000 in 1993, up from the 1992
amount of $2,485,000. The favorable comparison reflects mainly improved results
referable to current as well as discontinued joint ventures.

Interest expense totaled $9,171,000 in 1993, down from the 1992 amount of
$9,768,000.

Working capital, exclusive of debt and cash items, totaled $150,899,000 at
December 31, 1993, down 4 percent from the 1992 year-end amount of $156,607,000.
The 1993 decline reflects lower inventories and higher current liabilities,
partially offset by an increase in the current portion of deferred taxes.

Net cash provided by continuing operations amounted to $194,097,000, down
3 percent from the $199,126,000 generated in 1992. The decline reflects
primarily lower earnings and other net adjustments, partially offset by an
increase in cash from lower working capital.

Cash used for investing activities totaled $103,811,000, down from the 1992
amount of $110,692,000. The decrease reflects higher spending for plant,
property and equipment, offset by lower payments for business acquisitions.

Property additions totaled $100,551,000, up $2,058,000 from the $98,493,000
spent in 1992. In 1993, the Company acquired a stone quarry in Tennessee and 
one in Texas. Spending also continued for the construction of a sodium chlorite
plant at the Wichita, Kansas chemicals complex.

Cash used for financing activities decreased to $90,882,000 from the 1992 level
of $93,732,000. Lower retirements of debt were partially offset by increased
purchases of common stock in 1993.

Pursuant to the Company's common stock purchase program, 895,015 shares of
common stock were purchased in 1993 at a total cost of $39,986,000, equal to an
average price of $44.68 per share. Purchases of common stock in 1992 totaled
786,230 shares at a total cost of $32,424,000, equal to an average price of
$41.24 per share.

As of December 31, 1993, interest-bearing debt totaled $103,776,000, down 4
percent from total debt of $108,374,000 outstanding a year ago, and down 17
percent from the balance at year-end 1991.

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $13,996,000 at December 31, 1993, down
slightly from the 1992 year-end amount of $15,669,000.

H. A. Sklenar, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan, stated, "After
a weak first quarter, shipments in our Construction Materials business improved
significantly in 1993. Lower interest rates stimulated higher residential
construction while improved funding supported greater highway construction.
The current outlook suggests a continuation of these trends in 1994. As a
result, we expect earnings of our Construction Materials segment to increase
again in 1994.

"The recent performance of our Chemicals business has been and continues to be
dominated by caustic soda pricing levels. Weak demand in several important
caustic consuming industries, as well as the addition of some new industry
chlor-alkali capacity, have pushed caustic prices to extremely low levels. The
timing and magnitude of a domestic recovery in caustic volume and prices are the
principal uncertainties facing our Chemicals business in 1994. Our present view
is that caustic prices will remain depressed. Consequently, our current
expectation is that earnings in our Chemicals segment will be down substantially
again in 1994."

Vulcan is a producer of industrial materials and commodities with significant
positions in two industries. It is the nation's foremost producer of
construction aggregates and a leading chemicals manufacturer, producing a
diversified line of chlorinated solvents and other industrial chemicals.

</TABLE>
2. Income Taxes

Effective January 1, 1992, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which supersedes and
amends SFAS No. 96. The principal change made by SFAS No. 109 is to revise the
criteria for recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets. The cumulative
effect of applying the new accounting method to years prior to 1992 increased
net earnings by $3,005,000 ($.08 per share), which is reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the first quarter of 1992.
Implementation of the new method had no material impact on earnings before
recognition of the cumulative effect of accounting change for 1993 and 1992.

The impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 for the nine months
ended September 30, 1993 was reflected in the third quarter, including a charge
to adjust cumulative deferred tax. The total effect in 1993 of the increased
federal rate amounted to $.06 per share.
