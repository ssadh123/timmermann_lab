Item 5. Other Events.

On January 11, 1994 South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (the Company)
has reached a settlement with Westinghouse Electric Corporation resolving a
dispute involving steam generators provided by Westinghouse to the Company's
V. C. Summer Nuclear Station (see Note 4C of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 1993).

Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The Company had filed an
action in May 1990 against Westinghouse in the U. S. District Court for South
Carolina seeking compensation for damages to the Summer Station.

In commenting on the settlement, Bruce Kenyon, the Company's president
and chief operating officer, said: "We are pleased to have this nearly four-
year dispute resolved. The settlement is in the best interest of all parties
and avoids what would have been a costly and uncertain trial. In addition,
our electric customers will benefit as costs for Summer Station operations
will be reduced."

The Company operates the 885-MW electric generating facility and had
previously announced that it plans to replace the plant's three steam
generators in the fourth quarter of 1994, during a scheduled refueling.
