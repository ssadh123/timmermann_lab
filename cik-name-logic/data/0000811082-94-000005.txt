FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LIBERTY, MISSOURI --- Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. and Ferrellgas,
L.P., newly formed limited partnerships that will conduct the
business of Ferrellgas, Inc., today filed two registration
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission with
respect to the proposed offering of 13.1 million Common Units
representing limited partnership interests of Ferrellgas
Partners, L.P. with an estimated initial offering price between
$20.50 to $22.25 per Common Unit representing a 45 percent
interest in the partnership and $250 million principal amount
of Senior Notes due 2001 by Ferrellgas, L.P. Ferrellgas, Inc.
will serve as general partner of both partnerships.

Ferrellgas, Inc. is the nation's third largest retail marketer
of propane, serving more than 600,000 customers in 44 states.

The underwriting group for the Common Units will be managed by
Goldman, Sachs & Co., Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corporation, A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., PaineWebber
Incorporated and Smith Barney Shearson, Inc. The Senior Note
offering will be managed by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corporation and Goldman, Sachs & Co.

In connection with these offerings, Ferrellgas, Inc. will
refinance its existing indebtedness by calling for redemption
all of its Senior Notes due in 1996. The formal notice of
redemption will not be given until the successful completion of
the securities offerings by the partnerships.

In addition, Ferrellgas, Inc. will make a tender offer to
purchase all of its 11 5/8 percent Senior Subordinated
Debentures due 2003. It is anticipated that this tender offer
will first be mailed to holders of the Subordinated Debentures
on or about May 4, 1994. Closing of the tender offer is also
conditioned on, among other things, the successful completion
of the offering of the securities by the partnerships.
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation will act as
dealer manager, and MacKenzie Partners, Inc. will act as
information agent, with respect to the tender offer.

Danley K. Sheldon, Vice President and CFO of Ferrellgas, Inc.,
stated "This transaction represents an excellent opportunity to
reduce the indebtedness of the Company and better position the
Company for future growth."

A registration statement relating to these securities has been
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not
yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may
offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration
statement becomes effective. This press release shall not
constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to
buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any
State in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be
unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the
securities laws of any such State.
