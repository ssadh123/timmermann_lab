NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MERGER

On November 15, 1993, the Federal Reserve Board, by a 3
to 3 vote, failed to approve Shawmut National Corporation's
("Shawmut") application to acquire New Dartmouth Bank ("New
Dartmouth"). Because Shawmut was unable to obtain by November
15, 1993 all regulatory approvals necessary to consummate the
proposed Merger, New Dartmouth was entitled to abandon the
transaction under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

On December 20, 1993, Shawmut and New Dartmouth agreed
to amend the Merger Agreement to extend the deadline for
completing the Merger to June 30, 1994. Pursuant to the terms of
the Merger Agreement, as amended, each share of New Dartmouth
common stock will be exchanged for shares of Shawmut common stock
having a value equal to $310.95 plus 177% of New Dartmouth's net
earnings per share (assuming the exercise of all outstanding
warrants and options) from October 1, 1993 through the closing
date, subject to certain adjustments. For purposes of
calculating the number of shares of Shawmut common stock to be
exchanged for each share of New Dartmouth common stock, if the
market price of Shawmut common stock prior to closing exceeds
$23.14, the exchange ratio will be calculated as if the market
price were $23.14. If the market price of Shawmut common stock
is less than $17.11, then the exchange ratio will be calculated
as if the market price were $17.11, unless Shawmut waives this
provision.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The unaudited consolidated financial statements of New
Dartmouth presented herein should be read in conjunction with New
Dartmouth's Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual
Report for the period ended June 30, 1993. The accompanying
unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles but do 
not include all of the information and footnotes required by
generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements.

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of New Dartmouth and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
collectively referred to as "New Dartmouth." All material
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The
unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which are, in the
opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial
position at December 31, 1993 and the results of operations for
the six month periods ended December 31, 1993 and December 31,
1992. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results
to be expected for the entire year.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Primary earnings per share is determined on the basis
of the weighted average number of shares outstanding after giving
effect to dilutive stock options and warrants.

Fully diluted earnings per share reflects the dilutive
effect of conversion of each share of preferred stock into 1.25
shares of common stock.

CONTINGENCIES

New Dartmouth and its subsidiaries are involved in a
number of legal proceedings arising out of and incidental to,
their respective businesses. Management of New Dartmouth, based
on its review with its legal counsel of the merits of each of
these proceedings, does not anticipate that any losses that may
be incurred as a result of these proceedings would materially
affect New Dartmouth's consolidated financial position.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

On August 27, 1993, New Dartmouth redeemed 40,000
shares of Preferred Stock for $4.1 million, reflecting a
redemption price of $102.42 per share. Under the terms of the
Merger Agreement, New Dartmouth will redeem the remaining 170,073
shares of Preferred Stock outstanding prior to consummation of
the Merger.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of New Dartmouth Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and

respects, the financial position of New Dartmouth Bank and its
subsidiaries at June 30, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year ended June 30, 1993
and the period October 10, 1991 (date of commencement of
operations) to June 30, 1992, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the management of New Dartmouth Bank; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. FORMATION OF NEW DARTMOUTH

New Dartmouth Bank ( New Dartmouth ) is a New Hampshire
chartered guaranty savings bank that was formed to acquire
certain assets and assume certain liabilities, as of the close of
business on October 10, 1991 (the Acquisition Date ), from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ), as Receiver
of the failed Dartmouth Bank, New Hampshire Savings Bank and
Numerica Savings Bank, FSB (collectively, the Failed Banks ). 
New Dartmouth was initially capitalized through the sale of $40.4
million of common stock to accredited investors and $31.0 million
of non-voting, convertible, redeemable perpetual preferred stock
( Preferred Stock ) to the FDIC.

Simultaneous with New Dartmouth's capitalization and the
FDIC's appointment as Receiver, New Dartmouth entered into three
Purchase and Assumption Agreements (collectively, the 1991 P&A
Agreements ) with the FDIC as Receiver of the Failed Banks. 
Under the terms of the Agreements, New Dartmouth acquired from
the FDIC $1.7 billion in certain assets and assumed $2.1 billion
in deposits of the Failed Banks (collectively, the 1991 P&A
Transaction ). The FDIC paid New Dartmouth $55.3 million to
complete the transaction in addition to a payment of $400.8
million to New Dartmouth for the assumption of net liabilities. 
Included in the assets acquired were $1.4 billion of loans.

Pursuant to the Agreements, New Dartmouth acquired Consulting
Systems and Management Corporation ( CSM ), National Mortgage
Company, Inc. ( NMC ) and United Savers Acceptance Corporation
( USAC ), all non-bank subsidiaries of the Failed Banks. CSM, a
data processing subsidiary, ceased active operations in March
1992. USAC and NMC are currently engaged in servicing portfolios
of automobile and residential real estate loans, respectively,
that were sold into the secondary market.

In connection with the 1991 P&A Transaction, the FDIC provided
the following assistance:

(a) the FDIC transferred an allowance for possible loan
losses of 1.25% of the book value of all acquired loans to New
Dartmouth;

(b) the FDIC agreed to repurchase at book value, including up
to 90 days accrued interest, subject to certain limitations,
all loans, other than Small Loans, which become adversely
credit classified within three years after the Acquisition
Date ( Puts );

(c) the FDIC agreed to share losses on certain small
residential mortgage and consumer loans for the three-year
period following the Acquisition Date by assuming 90% of
amounts charged-off each quarter in excess of 0.0875% and
0.25% of the respective loan balances outstanding at the
beginning of each quarter, and to reimburse New Dartmouth for
up to 90 days accrued interest on such loans;

(d) the FDIC agreed to reacquire, during the 180-day period
following the Acquisition Date, certain assets with material
defects in title which may impair collectibility; and

(e) the FDIC agreed to indemnify New Dartmouth with respect
to certain other matters.

Putable loans are loans on the books of the Failed Banks as of
the Acquisition Date which are other than Small Loans (defined
below). Loans put to the FDIC during the period October 10,
1992 through October 9, 1993 are subject to a discount of 2% and
loans put to the FDIC during the period October 10, 1993
through October 10, 1994 are subject to a discount of 4%. Small
Loans are defined as consumer loans (including advances on home
equity lines of credit) and residential mortgage loans (i.e.,
loans secured by mortgages on one to four family residential
properties or by stock of cooperative housing associations)
having a book balance as of the Acquisition Date of not more than
$100,000 and $191,250, respectively. Amounts due from the FDIC
under the Small Loan loss protection and put provisions are
classified as Due from FDIC.

Under the 1991 P&A Agreements, on the Acquisition Date all
classified loans, charged-off loans and other real estate owned
of the Failed Banks were transferred to an FDIC-owned special
asset pool ( the Pool ). The Pool was serviced by New Dartmouth
until March 9, 1992, as required under the terms of the 1991 P&A
Agreements. Total fees received by New Dartmouth under this
arrangement were $3.0 million and are included in noninterest
income.

2. MERGER WITH SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION

On March 23, 1993, New Dartmouth entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ) with Shawmut National
Corporation ( SNC ) pursuant to which SNC will acquire New
Dartmouth through the merger (the Merger ) of New Dartmouth with
a wholly owned subsidiary of SNC. Upon consummation of the
Merger, New Dartmouth stockholders will become stockholders of
SNC and will receive a number of shares of SNC Common Stock in
exchange for each share of New Dartmouth Common Stock as shall be
equal to the exchange ratio.

Upon consummation of the Merger, each issued and outstanding
share of New Dartmouth Common Stock will be converted into the
right to receive a number of shares of SNC Common Stock equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (i) $310 by (ii) the Average
Closing Price (the average of the daily closing price of SNC
Common Stock for the fifteen consecutive trading days prior to
the Merger), provided that if the Average Closing Price is (x)
less than $19.975, then the Average Closing Price will be deemed
to be $19.975 and the Exchange Ratio will be 15.519, unless
waived by SNC and (y) greater than $27.025, then the Average
Closing Price will be deemed to be $27.025 and the Exchange Ratio
will be 11.471, unless waived by New Dartmouth.

As a condition to SNC s merger proposal, New Dartmouth and SNC
entered into a Stock Option Agreement pursuant to which New
Dartmouth granted SNC an option to purchase up to 74.275 shares
of New Dartmouth Common Stock, or 14.9% of the issued and
outstanding shares of such common stock at March 31, 1993, at an
exercise price of $310 per share. The Stock Option Agreement is
intended to increase the likelihood that the Merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. 
Consequently, the Stock Option Agreement may discourage persons
who might now or prior to the Merger be interested in acquiring
New Dartmouth from considering such an acquisition, even if such
persons were prepared to pay a higher price per share for New
Dartmouth Common Stock than the price per share implicit in the
Exchange Ratio. The option is exercisable only upon the
occurrence of one of the following events: (a) a material breach
by New Dartmouth of any of its covenants and agreements contained
in the Merger Agreement; (b) New Dartmouth fails to publicly
oppose a tender offer or an exchange offer to purchase shares of
New Dartmouth Common Stock; (c) any person shall have acquired
beneficial ownership or any group shall have been formed which
beneficially owns, or has the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, of 10% of the outstanding shares of New Dartmouth
Common Stock; (d) any person who, as of March 23, 1993, owns or
controls 10% or more of the outstanding shares of New Dartmouth
Common Stock shall have acquired an additional 2% or more of the
New Dartmouth Common Stock; (e) New Dartmouth Stockholders shall
not have approved the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, or
the Special Meeting shall have been cancelled prior to the
abandonment of the Merger Agreement, in each case after it shall
have been publicly announced that another person shall have (i)
made, or disclosed an intention to make, a proposal to acquire
New Dartmouth or (ii) filed an application under the Bank Holding
Company Act or the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, for
approval to acquire New Dartmouth; or (f) New Dartmouth s Board
of Directors shall not have recommended to New Dartmouth
Stockholders that such stockholders vote in favor of the Merger.

The Merger is expected to qualify as a tax-free reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Service Code.

Holders of New Dartmouth Common Stock and Preferred Stock will
be asked to vote on the Merger at a Special Meeting of
Stockholders to be held on August 26, 1993. New Hampshire law
requires the affirmative approval of the holders of 66 2/3% of
all the outstanding shares of New Dartmouth Common Stock and
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, in order to
obtain the permission of the Bank Commissioner of the State of
New Hampshire to consummate the Merger. In addition, New
Dartmouth s Articles of Agreement separately require that the
Merger be approved by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of New Dartmouth Common Stock.

The Merger is subject to prior approval by (i) the Federal
Reserve Board under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, (ii) the FDIC under the Bank Merger Act, (iii) the Board of
Trust Company Incorporation of the State of New Hampshire, (iv)
the Board of Bank Incorporation of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and (v) the Bank Commissioner of the State of New
Hampshire. The Merger will not be consummated unless all of the
requisite regulatory approvals for such transactions are obtained
without the imposition of any condition or requirement that, in
the reasonable opinion of SNC, would so materially adversely
affect the economic or business benefits to SNC of the Merger as

New Dartmouth and SNC expect the Merger will occur prior to
December 31, 1993.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

New Dartmouth s consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and prevailing practices within the banking industry.

Certain amounts in the 1992 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the 1993 presentation.

BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
New Dartmouth and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The
financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the
opinion of management, necessary to state fairly the results of
operations for the periods presented. The acquisition of The
Somersworth Bank on June 26, 1992 (the Somersworth Transaction )
has been accounted for as a purchase and the accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the results of
operations from the date of acquisition.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest bearing
deposits in other banks and federal funds sold.

SECURITIES

During 1993, as a result of changing industry practice and
management s evaluation of the investment securities portfolio,
New Dartmouth segregated its investment portfolio into securities
held to maturity and those held for sale. Securities held for
sale are to be held for an indefinite period of time and can be
used for asset/liability management and may be sold in response
to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk or other factors.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities ( FAS 115"). FAS 115 requires that debt
and equity securities be classified as trading, available for
sale or held to maturity. Securities classified as trading are
reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included
in income. Securities classified as held for sale are reported
at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as a
separate component of stockholders equity. Securities
classified as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. 
In order to classify securities as held to maturity, management
must have the positive intent and ability to hold securities to
maturity.

New Dartmouth adopted FAS 115 effective June 30, 1993 and on
June 30, 1993 recorded a total unrealized gain of $2.6 million
($1.6 million, net of tax) as a separate component of
stockholders equity.

Gains or losses on sales of securities are computed on a
specific identification method.

LOANS

Loans are stated at principal outstanding net of unearned
income with the exception of mortgages held for sale which are
carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market. Interest
income on loans is recognized on an accrual basis based on the
principal amount outstanding. Unearned income on loans made or
purchased at a discount and loan related fees are recognized in
interest income over the lives of the loans using a method that
results in a level yield.

When a loan, other than a credit card or student loan, reaches
90 days past due for principal or interest, it is placed on non-
accrual status and interest accrued is reversed and charged
against current year interest income. Collections on non-accrual
loans which are not subject to the FDIC protection are applied as
either a reduction of principal or interest income depending upon
management s assessment of the ultimate collectibility of
principal. Loans are removed from non-accrual status when they
become current as to principal and interest and when, in the
opinion of management, the loans are estimated to be fully
collectible on a timely basis as to principal and interest.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, Accounting
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan ( FAS 114"). Among other
things, FAS 114 requires that impairments of loans due to
uncollectibility of principal and interest be measured based upon
the present value of probable and estimable future cash flows. 
Previously, measurement of such impairments was on an
undiscounted basis. FAS 114 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1994. Generally, the impact of
FAS 114 will be to increase loan losses and, because of the
effect of discounting, provide future interest income on impaired
loans. Had FAS 114 been adopted at June 30, 1993, management
believes that it would not have had a material effect on New
Dartmouth s financial position and results of operations.

On October 10, 1991, New Dartmouth allocated approximately
$39.0 million of the federal financial assistance it received
from the FDIC as part of the 1991 P&A Transaction as a discount
against the acquired loan portfolio representing New Dartmouth s
estimate of potential future losses in excess of the protection
provided by the FDIC. On June 26, 1992, New Dartmouth allocated
approximately $3.6 million of the federal financial assistance it
received from the FDIC as part of the Somersworth Transaction as
a discount against the acquired loan portfolio representing New
Dartmouth s estimate of potential future losses. These discounts
were not accreted into interest income in Fiscal 1993 or 1992.

An allowance for possible loan losses is established for the
absorption of potential losses on loans through charges to
current expense. Loan losses are charged against this allowance
for possible loan losses and subsequent recoveries are added to
it. Small Loan protection payments received from the FDIC are
recorded as noninterest income and offset by a corresponding
provision for possible loan losses.

The amount and adequacy of this allowance is determined by
management and is based on several factors, including, but not
limited to, a review and evaluation of specific loans, the
overall quality, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, an
evaluation of present and anticipated economic conditions and
other pertinent factors. While management considers the
allowance for possible loan losses to be adequate to provide for
losses inherent in the portfolios, it should be noted that it is
based on estimates and ultimate losses may vary from the
estimates if future conditions differ substantially from the
assumptions used in making the evaluation. It is possible that
future events may result in additional charge-offs and changes in
the level of the allowance for possible loan losses and the level
of non-performing loans. Further, various regulatory agencies,
as an integral part of their examination process, periodically
review New Dartmouth's allowance for possible loan losses. Such
agencies may require New Dartmouth to recognize additional
provisions to the allowance for possible loan losses based on
judgments different from those of management.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
charged to expense using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of each asset. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The
cost of major additions and improvements are capitalized,
Amortization of leasehold improvements on leased facilities is
charged to expense using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. 
Upon retirement or disposition, the cost and accumulated
depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and any
resulting gain or loss is credited to or charged against income.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED

Other real estate owned is comprised of foreclosed properties
for which New Dartmouth has received title. The properties are
recorded at the lower of the remaining principal balance of the
foreclosed loan or estimated fair market value. Estimated fair
market value is determined on the basis of an appraisal at the
time of foreclosure. The difference between the principal
balance and the estimated fair value of the loan at the time of
foreclosure is charged against the allowance for possible loan
losses. Any subsequent write-down, related to loans that
originally qualified for Small Loan loss protection, resulting
from an excess of the carrying value over the fair market value
is subject to reimbursement by the FDIC under the Small Loan Loss
Protection provisions of the 1991 P&A Agreement. Any subsequent
write-down, related to loans originated or acquired after October
10, 1991, resulting from an excess of the carrying value over the
fair market value is charged to expense.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are provided at the statutory federal and state
income tax rates on income and unrealized gains or losses on
securities held for sale as reported in the accompanying
financial statements. Deferred taxes are provided as a result of
the recognition of certain income and expense items in different
time periods for financial and income tax purposes.

New Dartmouth adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("FAS 109"),
effective October 10, 1991. FAS 109 is an asset and liability
approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets
and liabilities. In estimating future tax consequences, FAS 109
generally considers all expected future events other than
enactments of changes in the tax law or rates.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Primary earnings per share is determined on the basis of the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
after giving effect to dilutive stock options and warrants.

Fully diluted earnings per share reflects both the effect of
dilutive stock options and warrants and the dilutive effect of
conversion of each share of preferred stock into 1.25 shares of
common stock (the maximum conversion ratio applicable for the
preferred stock).

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

New Dartmouth implemented Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments" ("FAS 107"), for the year ended June 30, 1993, which
requires New Dartmouth to disclose the fair value of its
financial instruments. A financial instrument is defined as
cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity or a
contract that conveys or imposes the contractual right or
obligation to either receive or deliver cash or another financial
instrument. Examples of financial instruments included in New
Dartmouth's balance sheet are cash, federal funds sold, debt and
equity securities, loans, demand, savings and other interest-
bearing deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase
and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Examples of financial
instruments which are not included in New Dartmouth's balance
sheet are commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit
and loans sold with recourse. Fair value is defined as the
amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in forced
sale or liquidation and is best evidenced by a quoted market
price if one exists.

FAS 107 requires the fair value of deposit liabilities with no
stated maturity, such as demand deposits, N.O.W. and money market
accounts, to equal the carrying value of these financial
instruments and, therefore, does not allow for the recognition of
the inherent value of these core deposit relationships.

New Dartmouth has estimated fair value based on quoted market
prices, where available. In cases where quoted market prices
were not available, fair values were based on the quoted market
price of a financial instrument with similar characteristics, the
present value of expected future cash flows or other valuation
techniques. Each of these alternative valuation techniques
utilizes assumptions which are highly subjective and judgmental
in nature. Subjective factors include, among other things,
estimates of cash flows, the timing of cash flows, risk and
credit quality characteristics and interest rates. Accordingly,
the results may not be precise and modifying the assumptions may
significantly affect the values derived. In addition, fair
values established utilizing alternative valuation techniques may
or may not be substantiated by comparison with independent
markets. Further, fair value may or may not be realized if a
significant portion of the financial instruments were sold in a
bulk transaction. Therefore, any aggregate unrealized gains or
losses should not be interpreted as a forecast of future earnings
or cash flows. Furthermore, the fair value disclosed should not
be interpreted as the aggregate current value of New Dartmouth.

The methodology and assumptions utilized to estimate the fair
value of New Dartmouth's financial instruments, not previously
discussed in the policy statements above, are described below.

Financial instruments with fair value approximate to carrying
value - The carrying value of cash and due from banks, interest-
bearing deposits in other banks, federal funds sold and
securities sold under agreement to repurchase, demand deposits,
savings, N.O.W. and money market deposits, and accrued interest
income and expense approximate fair value due to the short-term
nature of these financial instruments.

Securities - The fair value of securities held for sale and
securities held to maturity was derived based on quoted market
prices.

Loans - The fair value of loans was estimated for groups of
similar loans based on the type of loan, interest rate
characteristics, credit risk and maturity. The carrying value of
loans maturing or repricing within 90 days was estimated to
approximate fair value due to the short-term characteristics of
these loans. The fair value of performing loans was estimated by
discounting expected future cash flows utilizing appropriate
discount rates. Prepayments were not anticipated for either
fixed-rate or variable-rate loans. The fair value of non-
accruing loans was estimated by discounting expected future cash
flows utilizing appropriate discount rates, commensurate with a
portfolio of non-accruing loans. As appropriate, the fair values
reflect the FDIC loss protection. The fair value of loans was
approximately $928.4 million at June 30, 1993 compared to a
carrying value of $900.2 million.

Deposits - The fair value of deposits with fixed maturities
was estimated by discounting expected future cash flows utilizing
interest rates currently being offered on deposits with similar
characteristics and maturities. The fair value of these deposits
was approximately $811.2 million at June 30, 1993 compared to a
carrying value of $803.0 million.

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances - The fair value of Federal
Home Loan Bank advances was estimated by discounting expected
future cash flows utilizing interest rates currently being
offered on advances with similar characteristics and maturities. 
The fair value of these advances was approximately $50.7 million
at June 30, 1993 compared to a carrying value of $50.0 million.

Off-balance sheet financial instruments - The fair value of
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit was
determined based on the discounted value of fees currently
charged for similar agreements and was not significant. The fair
value of New Dartmouth's recourse obligations was not significant
due to FDIC credit protection.

4. SOMERSWORTH ACQUISITION

On June 26, 1992, New Dartmouth and the FDIC, as Receiver
for The Somersworth Bank, Somersworth, New Hampshire
("Somersworth"), entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement
(the "Somersworth Agreement"), whereby New Dartmouth assumed
Somersworth's deposits, totaling approximately $101.6 million
and purchased certain assets totaling approximately $54.0
million. New Dartmouth accounted for the Somersworth transaction
under the purchase method of accounting. New Dartmouth's June
30, 1992 financial statements include Somersworth's results of
operations since the date of acquisition.

Under the terms of the Somersworth Agreement, the FDIC
retained Somersworth's initial pool of classified assets and paid
New Dartmouth $4.5 million to complete the transaction in
addition to a payment of $48.7 million to New Dartmouth for the
assumption of net liabilities. The FDIC is not providing New
Dartmouth with loan loss protection with respect to the acquired
loans. New Dartmouth allocated approximately $3.6 million of the
federal financial assistance received from the FDIC as a discount
against the acquired loan portfolio.

In fiscal 1993, New Dartmouth returned to the FDIC
approximately $6.6 million, of the loans acquired as part of the
Somersworth Transaction ($6.0 million net of discount). These
loans should have been retained by the FDIC under the terms of
the Somersworth Agreement.

5. CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS

New Dartmouth is required by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston to maintain average balances in the form of cash or
noninterest bearing deposits. Reserve balances of $16.7 million
at June 30, 1993 were maintained in accordance with these
requirements compared to reserve balances of $11.0 million at
June 30, 1992.

The foregoing tables do not include any allocation of the
$39.0 million discount on loans acquired from the FDIC pursuant
to the 1991 P&A Agreements or the $3.6 million discount on loans
acquired from the FDIC pursuant to the Somersworth Agreement.
There was no accretion of these discounts from October 10, 1991
to June 30, 1993. The discount was adjusted, however, in
connection with the return to the FDIC of certain loans acquired
in the Somersworth Transaction. See Note 4 above.

At June 30, 1993, New Dartmouth had $32.8 million of non-
accrual loans and $0.9 million in loans 90 days past due and
still accruing compared to $84.1 million and $1.2 million,
respectively, at June 30, 1992. Interest income for the year
ended June 30, 1993 relating to non-accrual loans would have been
$2.5 million had these loans performed according to their
original terms. Interest income actually recorded for the year
ended June 30, 1993 was approximately $0.8 million. The FDIC
will reimburse New Dartmouth up to 90 days of interest that would
have been earned had these loans performed in accordance with
their original terms. Amounts due from the FDIC at June 30,
1993, resulting from the Small Loan and "put" protection
processes, were $6.5 million and $0.00, respectively, compared to
$2.0 million and $28.5 million, respectively at June 30, 1992.

The following table summarizes the loans "put" to the FDIC
under the terms of the 1991 P&A Agreements for the periods
indicated below:

The following table summarizes New Dartmouth's net charge-
offs and the payments received from the FDIC under the Small Loan
protection provisions of the 1991 P&A Agreements for the periods
indicated:

FDIC Small Loan protection payments 10,903 2,216

New Dartmouth considers its primary market area for lending
and deposit activities to be the State of New Hampshire. 
Although New Dartmouth has a diversified loan portfolio, a
substantial portion of its debtors' ability to honor their
contracts is reliant upon the economic stability of the area.

In the normal course of business, New Dartmouth enters into
commitments to lend to customers. These commitments are not
recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. These off-balance
sheet items include commitments to extend credit and standby
letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are contracts
made by New Dartmouth to lend to a customer under specified
conditions. Failure to satisfy these conditions by the customer
would terminate New Dartmouth's obligation to lend. Generally,
these commitments have fixed expiration dates and require the
payment of fees. Due to the fixed expiration dates or other
termination agreements, these commitments may not be drawn upon. 
Therefore, total commitments outstanding do not necessarily
represent future cash outlays. The amount of collateral
necessary is determined on an individual basis.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued
by New Dartmouth as a financial or performance guarantee of a
customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing
letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in
commitments to extend credit.

The following table summarizes New Dartmouth's loan
commitments to extend credit at June 30, 1993:

(In thousands) June 30, 1993

Residential real estate $ 24,802
Commercial real estate 1,380
Construction 923
Commercial 7,353
Consumer 17,060
Total $ 51,518

Standby Letters of Credit $ 288

At June 30, 1993, New Dartmouth had commitments to sell
residential real estate loans totaling approximately $12.2
million. New Dartmouth and its subsidiary, NMC, also have
recourse obligations as a result of certain loan sales by the
Failed Banks or NMC prior to the Acquisition Date. These
recourse obligations are subject to the same Small Loan
protection provisions as loans held in the portfolio. At June
30, 1993, loans sold with recourse amounted to $144.1 million. 
At June 30, 1993, New Dartmouth and NMC were servicing a
portfolio of $345.3 million of residential real estate loans
compared to $301.5 million at June 30, 1992.

Treasury Tax and Loan note.

12. FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES

As of June 30, 1993, New Dartmouth has the ability to borrow
up to approximately $510.1 million, or 30% of its total assets,
from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ("FHLBB") with no
restriction on the terms of maturity. At June 30, 1993, New
Dartmouth had outstanding borrowings of $50.0 million with a

On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993 (the "Act) was enacted. Among other things, the Act
increases the corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent
for corporations with taxable income in excess of $10 million. 
Management believes that the Act will not have a material effect
on New Dartmouth.

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

New Dartmouth and its subsidiaries are involved in a number
of legal proceedings arising out of, and incidental to, their
respective businesses. Management of New Dartmouth, based on its
review with legal counsel of the merits of each of these
proceedings, does not anticipate that any losses that may be
incurred as a result of these legal proceedings would materially
affect New Dartmouth's consolidated financial position.

On October 31, 1991, New Dartmouth entered into a five year
non-cancelable facilities management contract with a third-party
vendor for its data and item processing services. Under the
contract, the vendor provides the hardware, software and staff
required to perform these services. New Dartmouth provides the
vendor with suitable facilities. The minimum annual commitment
under this contract is approximately $3.0 million. Items
processed in excess of monthly base volumes are charged on a per
item basis. Expenses under this contract for the twelve months
ended June 30, 1993 amounted to $3.4 million.

15. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

New Dartmouth was initially capitalized through the issuance
of $31.0 million of Preferred Stock to the FDIC and the sale of
$40.4 million of common stock to private investors.

On October 10, 1991, New Dartmouth issued 347,073 shares of
non-voting, convertible, redeemable, preferred stock ("Preferred
Stock") to the FDIC at a price of $89.46 per share. The shares
of Preferred Stock are redeemable at New Dartmouth's option at a
price that increases by approximately 7.2% per year for the first
four years, by 22.1% in year five and by 12.6% per year
thereafter. The redemption price increases quarterly. At June
30, 1993, the redemption price was $101.01 per share. The
Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock beginning
October 10, 1994 if held by, or immediately on transfer to,
anyone other than the FDIC. The conversion ratio will be 1.00
share of Common Stock for 1.00 share of Preferred Stock in year
four and will increase to 1.10 shares of Common Stock for 1.00 of
Preferred Stock in year five and 1.25 shares of Common Stock for
1.00 share of Preferred Stock thereafter.

So long as the FDIC owns Preferred Stock that, assuming the
full conversion thereof into Common Stock, constitutes at least
10% of the then outstanding common stock, New Dartmouth may not
declare or pay dividends on any shares of its capital stock
without the FDIC's prior consent. A holder of the Preferred
Stock is entitled to receive dividends per share equal to
dividends per share paid on common stock. There were no
dividends declared or paid from October 10, 1991 to June 30,
1993.

On January 25, 1993, New Dartmouth redeemed 112,000 shares
of Preferred Stock having an aggregate value of $10.9 million at
a redemption price of $96.95 per share. On April 8, 1993, New
Dartmouth redeemed an additional 25,000 shares, for $2.5 million
at a redemption price of $99.28 per share. In May 1993, the New
Hampshire Bank Commissioner approved a petition of the Board of
Directors to redeem the remaining shares of Preferred Stock.

On August 9, 1993, New Dartmouth notified the FDIC of its
intention to redeem an additional 40,000 shares of its preferred
stock outstanding for $4.1 million in August 1993.

As a condition to SNC's merger proposal, New Dartmouth and
SNC entered into a Stock Option Agreement dated March 23, 1993
pursuant to which New Dartmouth granted Shawmut National
Corporation an option to purchase up to 74,275 shares of New
Dartmouth Common Stock, at an exercise price of $310 per share. 
See Note 2 above.

16. WARRANTS AND STOCK OPTION PLAN

New Dartmouth has adopted a management warrant plan and a
stock option plan authorizing the granting of warrants and
options to issue 47,133 shares of common stock to senior
executives.

Warrants for 11,783 shares were granted on October 10, 1991
at an initial price of $100.00 per share which escalates by 1.75%
per quarter. These warrants vested in three installments over an
eighteen month period and can be exercised during the lifetime of
the employee. At June 30, 1993, the warrants for 11,783 shares
were fully exercisable and the warrants had an exercise price of
$112.91 per share.

Warrants for 17,675 shares were granted on October 10, 1991
for which the exercise price is $109.06 per share. These
warrants vest in three installments over a three year period and
can be exercised during the lifetime of the employee. At June
30, 1993, warrants for 5,892 shares were fully exercisable.

Options for 9,250 shares and 1,500 shares were granted on
September 10, 1992 and December 17, 1993, respectively, at
exercise prices of $129.82 and $149.83 per share, respectively. 
These options vest in equal installments on June 30, 1995, June
30, 1996 and June 30, 1997. Options are exercisable for a period
of ten years from the date of the grant.

There were 6,925 shares available for future grants under
the stock option plan. The exercise price of the warrants and
options approximated fair market value at the date of the grant. 
There were no warrants or options exercised for the year ended
June 30, 1993 or for the period October 10, 1991 to June 30,
1992.

17. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Contribution Employee Savings and Retirement Plan. 
New Dartmouth maintains a defined contribution, tax qualified,
employee savings and retirement plan (the "401(k) Plan") in which
all employees of New Dartmouth working more than 1,000 hours per
year are eligible to participate after completing 1,000 hours of
service to New Dartmouth and attaining the age of 21. 
Participants are entitled to contribute between 1% and 15% of
their salaries per year up to the federally prescribed maximum,
which for 1992 is $8,728. Each year, New Dartmouth contributes
to each participant's account an amount equal to 25% of the
participant's contribution up to the first 4% of the
participant's base salary. Each participant is immediately
vested with respect to both the participant's respective
contribution and New Dartmouth's contribution. New Dartmouth's
contribution to the 401(k) plan for the period July 1, 1992 to
June 30, 1993 amounted to $67,303 compared to $32,600 for the
period October 10, 1991 to June 30, 1992.

Supplemental Retirement Arrangements. Effective October 10,
1991, New Dartmouth entered into a three-year Consulting
Agreement with its Chairman. Pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement, New Dartmouth is obligated to provide maximum annual
retirement benefits up to 12% of the Chairman's base
compensation. The supplemental retirement benefit accrues and
vests annually at the rate of 4% per year over the three-year
term of the Agreement. The supplemental retirement benefit will
be payable monthly for ten years commencing on the earliest of
(i) the termination of the Agreement, (ii) the Chairman's
attainment of age 65, and (iii) the Chairman's death. Any
retirement benefits remaining unpaid at the Chairman's death will
be paid to his designated beneficiary.

Pursuant to the terms of an Employment Agreement with its
President and Chief Executive Officer, New Dartmouth is obligated
to provide maximum annual retirement benefits through a non-
qualified, unfunded arrangement of up to 45% of his Average Base
Salary. The supplemental retirement benefit accrues and vests
annually at the rate of 4% per year. The supplemental retirement
benefit will be paid monthly for 10 years commencing upon (i) the
later of his retirement date or age 65 or (ii) his death, if
earlier. Any retirement benefits remaining unpaid at his death
will be paid to his designated beneficiary.

The expense incurred under the Supplemental Retirement
Arrangements was $96,000 for the period July 1, 1992 to June 30,
1993 compared to $71,000 for the period October 10, 1991 to June
30, 1992.

Senior Management Incentive Program. New Dartmouth has a
Senior Management Incentive Program for the benefit of eligible
participants who hold positions of Vice President or above. 
Amounts eligible for distribution under the Senior Management
Incentive Program are determined by the Board of Directors, at
its sole discretion, based upon (i) a formula containing certain
financial targets for New Dartmouth and (ii) the exercise of
discretionary authority by New Dartmouth's President and Chief
Executive Officer, based upon a participant's attainment of
individual performance goals and objectives. New Dartmouth's
discretionary contribution to 23 eligible participants under the
Senior Management Incentive Program for the year ended June 30,
1993 amounted to $175,000 compared to $99,300 for the period
October 10, 1991 to June 30, 1992.

Profit Sharing Plan. New Dartmouth instituted a Profit
Sharing Plan in January 1992 for the benefit of all employees in
lieu of a pension plan. To be eligible to participate in the
plan, an individual must be a full-time employee with a minimum
of one year of service. New Dartmouth's annual contribution to
the Profit Sharing Plan is determined by the Board of Directors,
at its sole discretion, based on New Dartmouth's earning
performance for the year. The annual discretionary contribution
is made to eligible participants based on a percentage of each
participant's salary. New Dartmouth's contribution to the Profit
Sharing Plan is deposited into a separate trust on behalf of the
participants. The Profit Sharing Plan is intended to satisfy the
requirements of a qualified retirement plan. New Dartmouth's
discretionary contribution for the year ended June 30, 1993
amounted to $450,000, or 4% of eligible participants' base
salaries compared to $216,700 for the period October 10, 1991 to
June 30, 1992.

18. RELATED PARTIES

It is New Dartmouth's practice that loans, other than credit
card loans and overdraft protection, will not be granted to
executive officers and directors. At June 30, 1993, loans and
loan commitments to executive officers and directors aggregated
$143,802 compared to $158,583 at June 30, 1992.

On October 10, 1991, New Dartmouth entered into a Consulting
Agreement with the Chairman of its Board of Directors. Pursuant
to the terms of the agreement, he will serve as a non-exclusive
Chairman of the Board of Directors. In such capacity, he
performs such services for New Dartmouth as the Board of
Directors designates. The agreement expires on October 9, 1994
and provides for payments totaling $250,000 per year.

19. SUBSEQUENT EVENT (UNAUDITED)

On November 15, 1993, the Federal Reserve Board, by 3 to 3
vote, failed to approve SNC's application to acquire New
Dartmouth. Because SNC was unable to obtain by November 15, 1993
all regulatory approvals necessary to consummate the proposed
Merger, New Dartmouth was entitled to abandon the transaction
under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

On December 20, 1993, SNC and New Dartmouth agreed to amend
the Merger Agreement to extend the deadline for completing the
Merger to June 30, 1994. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, as amended, each share of New Dartmouth Common Stock
will be exchanged for shares of SNC Common Stock having a value
equal to $310.95 plus 177% of New Dartmouth's net earnings per
share (assuming the exercise of all outstanding options and
warrants) from October 1, 1993 through the closing date subject
to certain adjustments. For purposes of calculating the number
of shares of SNC Common Stock to be exchanged for each share of
New Dartmouth Common Stock, if the market price of SNC Common
Stock prior to closing exceeds $23.14, the Exchange Ratio will be
calculated as if the market price were $23.14. If the market
price of SNC Common Stock is less than $17.11, then the Exchange
Ratio will be calculated as if the market price were $17.11,
unless SNC waives this provision.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Peoples Bancorp of Worcester, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peoples
Bancorp of Worcester, Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Peoples Bancorp of Worcester, Inc. at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for investments
and income taxes in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Peoples Bancorp of Worcester, Inc. ("Bancorp") and its
subsidiaries, including its principal subsidiary, Peoples Savings Bank (the
"Bank"). In the Parent Company Statements, the investment in subsidiary is
accounted for by the equity method (see Note 18). All material
intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

INVESTMENTS: In May of 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
"FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("FAS
115"). This statement addresses the accounting and reporting for
investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values
and for all investments in debt securities. Those investments are to be
classified in three categories and accounted for as follows:

Debt securities that Bancorp has the positive intent and ability to hold
to maturity will be classified as "held-to-maturity securities" and
reported at amortized cost.

Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the
purpose of selling them in the near term will be classified as "trading
securities" and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
included in earnings.

Debt and equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity
securities or trading securities will be classified as "available-for-
sale securities" and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
stockholders' equity.

As permitted under FAS 115, Bancorp has elected to adopt the provisions
of the new standard as of December 31, 1993. In accordance with FAS 115,
prior period financial statements have not been restated to reflect the
change in accounting principle. Bancorp does not currently own any
securities that would be required to be classified as trading securities;
however, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $259,556,000
and a market value of $263,934,000, marketable equity securities with a
cost of $1,768,000 and a market value of $2,503,000, and certain
adjustable-rate federal agency obligations with an amortized cost of
$32,071,000 and a market value of $31,852,000, were reclassified at
December 31, 1993 as available-for-sale securities. Debt securities with a
book value of $70,174,000 and a market value of $70,144,000 were
reclassified at December 31, 1993 to held-to-maturity securities. The
$4,894,000 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, less a
$2,112,000 reduction in the deferred tax asset account, was added to
stockholders' equity and recorded as a change in accounting principle to
reflect the net unrealized holding gain on securities classified as
available-for-sale previously carried at amortized cost or the lower of
amortized cost or market.

The amortized cost of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity or
available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion
of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities,
over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization is included in
interest income from investments. Interest and dividends are included in
interest income from investments. Realized gains and losses, and declines
in value judged to be other than temporary, are included in net securities
gains (losses). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method.

Prior to December 31, 1993, mortgage-backed securities were classified as
held-for-sale and were carried at the lower of cost, adjusted for the
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, or market, on an
aggregate basis. These securities represent mortgage-backed securities
that management may sell based upon an assessment of changes in economic or
financial market conditions, interest-rate risk and Bancorp's financial
position and liquidity. Mortgage-backed securities consist primarily of
instruments guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association
("GNMA") or insured by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC")
and by the Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA").

Prior to December 31, 1993, investment securities included U.S. Treasury
and federal agency obligations, other debt securities and equity
securities. Investments, other than equity securities, were carried at
cost adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount. 
Investments in marketable equity securities were carried at the lower of
aggregate cost or market value.

LOANS: Interest on undiscounted loans is recognized primarily utilizing 
the simple interest method based upon the principal amount outstanding. 
Interest on discounted loans is recognized utilizing the effective yield
method.

The net amount of loan origination and commitment fees and direct costs
incurred to underwrite and issue the loan are deferred and amortized as an
adjustment of the related loan's yield over the estimated life of the loan
in a manner which approximates the interest method.

When a loan is past due 90 days or more, or the ability of a borrower to
repay principal or interest is in doubt, Bancorp discontinues the accrual
of interest and reverses any unpaid accrued amounts. If there is doubt as
to collectibility, cash interest payments are applied to reduce principal. 
A loan is not restored to accruing status until the borrower has brought
the loan current and demonstrated the ability to make payments of principal
and interest, and doubt as to the collectibility of the loan is not
present. Bancorp may continue to accrue interest on loans past due 90 days
or more which are well secured and in the process of collection.

Restructured loans are loans with original terms which have been modified
to below market rate terms as a result of a change in the borrower's
financial condition. Interest income on restructured loans is accrued at
the reduced rates.

In May of 1993, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" ("FAS
114"). Compliance with this statement is required for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1994, and will require that impaired loans be
measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows,
discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical
expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Bancorp is accumulating
the necessary data to determine when to adopt FAS 114; however, adoption of
FAS 114 is not expected to have a material impact on Bancorp's financial
position.

RESERVE FOR POSSIBLE LOAN LOSSES: The reserve for possible loan losses is
the amount set aside to absorb future charge-offs of loans in the existing
portfolio. The reserve is increased by a loan loss provision charged to
expense. When a loan or portion thereof is considered uncollectible, it is
charged against the reserve for possible loan losses. Recoveries of
amounts previously charged off are credited to the reserve for possible
loan losses when collected.

The amount of the provision for possible loan losses is based on a
periodic review of loans and management's judgments concerning a variety of
factors including the risk characteristics of the portfolio, current
economic conditions, past loss experience and the balance of the reserve
for possible loan losses.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT: Premises, leasehold improvements and furniture and
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-
line method over useful lives as follows:

Premises 18 to 40 years
Leasehold improvements 5 to 20 years
Furniture and equipment 3 to 10 years

INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Other assets include goodwill and core deposit
intangible, which are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. 
Amortization of goodwill is computed on the straight-line method over 10
years, while amortization of the core deposit intangible is computed on an
accelerated method over 12 to 14 years.

INCOME TAXES: The Bank qualifies as a thrift institution for federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Bank has special tax provisions
available such as the percentage of taxable income method for computing bad
debt expense. Prior to December 31, 1991, Bancorp had filed a consolidated
federal income tax return based upon a tax year ending October 31; however,
in 1991, Bancorp changed its tax year end to December 31.

In February of 1992, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("FAS 109"). FAS 109
requires a change from the deferred method of accounting for income taxes
of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion 11 to the asset and
liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method of FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Under FAS 109, the effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.

Effective January 1, 1992, Bancorp adopted FAS 109 and has reported the
cumulative effect of that change in the method of accounting for income
taxes in the 1992 consolidated statement of income.

Pursuant to the deferred method under APB Opinion 11, which was applied
to 1991 and prior years, deferred income taxes are recognized for income
and expense items that are reported in different years for financial
reporting purposes and income tax purposes using the tax rate applicable
for the year of the calculation. Under the deferred method, deferred taxes
are not adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates.

Deferred tax assets are reported in other assets.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED ("OREO"): Real estate acquired in satisfaction of
a loan and in-substance foreclosures are reported in other assets. 
Properties acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, and
properties classified as in-substance foreclosures, are transferred to OREO
and recorded at the lower of cost or market, net of disposal costs, based
on appraised value at the date actually or constructively received. If the
fair value of the asset minus the estimated costs to sell the asset is
subsequently less than the original amount recorded, the deficiency is
recognized by use of a valuation allowance. If the fair value of the asset
minus the estimated costs to sell the asset subsequently increases, the
valuation allowance is reduced, but not below zero. Increases or decreases
in the valuation allowance are charged or credited to income. At December
31, 1993 and 1992, OREO balances of $1,447,000 and $2,374,000,
respectively, were net of valuation allowances of $365,000 and $0,
respectively.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Bancorp has defined cash and cash equivalents
as those amounts included in the balance sheet caption "Cash and due from
banks." Included in cash and due from banks as of December 31, 1993 is
approximately $4.9 million, which is subject to withdrawal restrictions and
is on deposit with the Federal Reserve.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: In December of 1991, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments" ("FAS 107"). FAS 107 requires
disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether
or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to
estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other
valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the
assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash
flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be
substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases,
could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. FAS 107
excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments
from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value
amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of Bancorp. The
following methods and assumptions were used by Bancorp in estimating its
fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND
ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE: The carrying amounts reported in the balance
sheet for cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, certificates of
deposit and accrued interest receivable approximate the fair values of
those assets.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES: Fair values, or
market values, for investment securities and mortgage-backed securities are
based upon quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair values are based upon quoted market prices of
comparable instruments, except in the case of stock of the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Boston and stock of the Savings Bank Life Insurance Company of
Massachusetts. The fair values of the stock of these two entities
approximate book values.

LOANS: Fair values for loans are estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses, using interest rates currently being offered with similar terms
to borrowers of similar credit quality except in the case where quoted
market prices, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics, are
available for similar loans sold in conjunction with securitization
transactions.

DEPOSITS: The fair values disclosed for noninterest-bearing deposits,
regular savings accounts, money market accounts and NOW accounts are, by
definition, equal to the book values of those deposits, which are payable
on demand. The carrying amounts for variable-rate, fixed-term certificates
of deposit approximate their fair values. Fair values for fixed-rate
certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow
calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on
certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on
time deposits. The fair values of deposits disclosed do not reflect the
value of Bancorp's core deposit accounts, which management of Bancorp
believes would be significant due to the low cost of its deposits and the
stable nature of its customer relationships.

ESCROW FUNDS: The carrying amount of escrow funds approximates fair
value.

COMMITMENTS: The fair values of the lending commitments reported in Note
14 are believed by management of Bancorp to be immaterial or have been
reflected in the estimation of fair values of the related loans.

RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain consolidated financial statement amounts
previously recorded have been reclassified to conform to the 1993
presentation.

NOTE 2. AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

On August 26, 1993, Peoples Bancorp of Worcester, Inc. ("Peoples") and
Shawmut National Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the State of Delaware ("Shawmut"), entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), pursuant to which Peoples will merge
(the "Merger") with and into Shawmut Service Corporation, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Shawmut and a Delaware corporation ("SSC"). As a result of
the Merger, each share of the $0.10 par value common stock of Peoples
("Peoples Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger (as described in the Agreement, the "Effective Time"),
other than shares held directly or indirectly by Bancorp or Shawmut (other
than in a fiduciary capacity in respect of debt previously contracted),
will be converted into a number of shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of $0.01
par value common stock of Shawmut ("Shawmut Common Stock"), such number of
shares of Shawmut Common Stock to be determined by dividing $52 by the
"Average Closing Price" (as defined in the Agreement) of Shawmut Common
Stock, provided, that (a) if the "Average Closing Price" is equal to or
greater than $27.744, the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.874 (the "Minimum
Exchange Ratio"); provided further, that Peoples may waive the Minimum
Exchange Ratio, and (b) if the "Average Closing Price" is equal to or less
than $20.506, the Exchange Ratio shall be 2.536 (the "Maximum Exchange
Ratio"), provided further, that Shawmut may waive the Maximum Exchange
Ratio.

The Merger is intended to constitute a tax-free transaction under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and to be accounted for as a
pooling of interests.

Consummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including: 
(i) receipt of the approval of the Agreement by the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Peoples Common Stock; (ii) receipt of
the necessary approvals from the appropriate regulatory authorities; (iii)
receipt of opinions of counsel to Shawmut and counsel to Peoples as to the
tax-free nature of certain aspects of the Merger; (iv) receipt of a
satisfactory opinion from Shawmut's independent certified public
accountants to the effect that the Merger qualifies to be accounted for as
a pooling of interests; (v) listing, subject to notice of issuance, with
the New York Stock Exchange of the Shawmut Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger; (vi) the "Average Closing Price" of Shawmut Common Stock shall be
no less than $20.506, unless Shawmut consents to waive the Maximum Exchange
Ratio; (vii) the "Average Closing Price" of Shawmut Common Stock shall be
no greater than $27.744, unless Peoples consents to waive the Minimum
Exchange Ratio; and (viii) satisfaction of certain other conditions
customary in transactions of this nature.

At December 31, 1993, Peoples had incurred $649,000 of merger-related
expenses that were included in other assets pending the outcome of the
Merger.

ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

NOTE 8. ADVANCES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF BOSTON

Advances from the FHLBB are secured by unencumbered securities, mortgages
and other loans defined as eligible by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act and
Regulations. The Bank also has a $10,285,000 line of credit with the
FHLBB; however, during 1993 and 1992, there were no material borrowings
from the FHLBB.

The Bank is authorized to borrow up to 30% of its total assets, but not
more than 20 times its capital stock holdings in the FHLBB, from the FHLBB,
for any sound business purpose for which the Bank has legal authority.

NOTE 9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Retained earnings of the Bank include approximately $12,713,000, which is
classified for federal income tax purposes as a reserve for possible loan
losses. If any portion thereof is used for purposes other than to absorb
the losses for which established, an amount up to approximately one and
one-half times the amount actually used must be included in gross income
for federal income tax purposes in the year in which it is used. As the
Bank does not intend to use the reserve for purposes other than to absorb
loan losses, deferred income taxes have been provided only on $1,197,000 of
such amount. Upon the Merger of Peoples Savings Bank into Shawmut Bank,
National Association, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Shawmut,
Peoples Savings Bank would lose its status as a savings bank and income
taxes not provided on the $12,713,000 tax reserve for possible loan losses
would become payable.

In accordance with Massachusetts law, when the Bank converted to stock
form in 1986, a liquidation account was established for the benefit of
eligible account holders who continued to maintain their accounts in the
Bank after the conversion. In the event of a complete liquidation, each
eligible account holder would be entitled to receive a distribution in an
amount equal to the current adjusted liquidation account balances to the
extent that funds are available. At December 31, 1993, the balance of the
liquidation account was approximately $3,992,000.

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on
dividends paid by the Bank to Bancorp. The total amount of dividends that
may be paid at any date is generally limited to the undivided profits of
the Bank, which were approximately $41 million at December 31, 1993.

At December 31, 1993, the capital ratios of both Bancorp and the Bank
significantly exceeded minimum applicable regulatory requirements.

NOTE 10. STOCK OPTION PLAN

Bancorp has a Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), under which 330,000 shares
were reserved for issuance to directors and key employees at a price equal
to the fair market value at the date of grant. The options expire on the
tenth anniversary of the date of grant unless terminated earlier pursuant
to the provisions of the Plan. If, at any time before the fifth
anniversary of the date of grant, the optionee has been employed by the
Bank for five or more years, all of the optioned shares are exercisable. 
Other optionees are subject to the vesting provisions of the Plan ranging
from 40% vesting on the second anniversary of the date of grant to 100%

NOTE 11. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Bank provides pension benefits for its employees through membership in
the Savings Banks Employees Retirement Association (the "Association").

The benefits provided at age 65 to any participant are based on the
average of the highest three consecutive years of cash compensation in the
last 10 years at the Bank for such participant. The Bank's funding policy
is to contribute annually the amount recommended by the Association's
actuary to keep the plan funded. Contributions are intended to provide not
only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those
expected to be earned in the future.

The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts
recognized in Bancorp's consolidated balance sheet as of the plan's year
end:

over 23 years 46 49
Accrued pension cost included in
other liabilities $ (1,170) $ (312)

Net pension expense included the following components:

Years Ended December 31, 1993 1992 1991
In Thousands 

Service cost benefits 
earned during the period $ 813 $ 782 $ 608
Interest cost on projected
benefit obligation 684 604 603
Actual return on plan assets (1,332) (680) (1,385)
Amortization of net losses 690 183 897
Net amortization and deferral 3 3 3
Net periodic pension cost $ 858 $ 892 $ 726

The weighted-average discount rate and rate of increase in future
compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the
projected benefit obligation at October 31, 1993, were 7.00% and 6.00%,
respectively (7.00% and 6.00%, respectively at October 31, 1992). The
expected long-term rates of return on assets for the plan years ended
October 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, were 7.00%, 6.75% and 7.75%, respectively. 
Plan assets are invested primarily in U.S. Treasury and federal agency
obligations and marketable equity securities.

Bancorp also provides for certain supplemental retirement benefits. 
Supplemental pension expense was $94,000, $162,000 and $1,216,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The 1991
amount included $626,000 as a result of the early adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 ("FAS 106"), which affects
accounting for deferred compensation contracts. In January of 1992, this
supplemental retirement benefit was fixed at $2,977,700 with interest on
the unpaid benefit accruing interest at 1/2% below the prime rate. After
paying out $1,500,000 in December of 1992, Bancorp has cumulatively accrued
$1,769,000 for supplemental retirement benefits at December 31, 1993, which
equals the accumulated vested obligation at that date.

NOTE 12. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM

Prior to December 31, 1991, the Bank issued and sold life insurance and
annuities through its Savings Bank Life Insurance Department ("SBLI") under
the regulation and supervision of the Trustees of the Massachusetts General
Insurance Guaranty Fund and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance. 
As required under Massachusetts law, the assets, reserves and earnings of
this department were held solely for policyholders and were segregated from
all other assets and liabilities of the Bank. Accordingly, the financial
results of this department are not reflected in the accompanying financial
statements.

On December 31, 1991, the SBLI departments of participating banks were
reorganized into one newly formed company, The Savings Bank Life Insurance
Company of Massachusetts, through the issuance of stock. The surplus funds
of the SBLI departments were distributed to policyholders and participating
banks, with the latter receiving distributions in the form of stock of the
newly formed company. As a result of this reorganization, Bancorp received
stock in the new company valued at $2,231,000 and recorded deferred income
tax expense of $944,000.

NOTE 13. INCOME TAXES

As discussed in Note 1, Bancorp adopted FAS 109 as of January 1, 1992. The
cumulative effect of this change in accounting for income taxes of
$1,544,000 was determined as of January 1, 1992 and is reported separately
in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31,
1992. Prior years' financial statements have not been restated to apply
the provisions of FAS 109.

Total income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992
was allocated as follows:

Years Ended December 31, 1993 1992
In Thousands 

Income from continuing operations $7,961 $7,054
Stockholders' equity, for compensation
expense for tax purposes in excess
of amounts recognized for financial 
reporting purposes (199) (126)
Stockholders' equity for tax effect of
net unrealized gains on held-for-sale
investments 2,112 --
$9,874 $6,928

Income tax expense attributable to income from continuing operations
consisted of the following:

Years Ended December 31, 1993 1992 1991

State (501) (102) (337)
(1,771) (344) (1,182)
$7,961 $7,054 $4,713

A reconciliation of Bancorp's tax provision to the U.S. federal income
tax rate (35% in 1993, 34% in 1992 and 1991) is shown below:

Years Ended December 31, 1993 1992 1991

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
presented below:

December 31, 1993 1992
In Thousands

Deferred tax assets:
Reserve for possible loan losses $ 1,886 $ 2,159

Total deferred tax liabilities (3,804) (1,987)
Net deferred tax asset $ 1,651 $ 1,992

For the year ended December 31, 1991, the deferred tax benefit results
from timing differences in the recognition of income and expense for
financial reporting and income tax accounting. The sources of the
differences and the related tax effects attributable to income from
continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 1991 were as follows:

In Thousands

Provision for possible loan losses $ 26
Accrual basis adjustment (1,132)
Accretion of bond discount (111)
Depreciation (93)
Partnership income and losses 127
Other 1
$(1,182)

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Bancorp leases certain property and equipment under operating leases that
expire at various times over the next 10 years. Payments for property
taxes, insurance and other costs under certain lease arrangements are
considered basic rentals.

At December 31, 1993, minimum annual rental commitments for property
under noncancellable leases with an initial term greater than one year were
as follows:

In Thousands

1994 $ 556
1995 484
1996 300
1997 269
1998 244
1999 to 2003 581
$2,434

The above rental commitments do not include any provision for Bancorp's
main office lease, which expired in 1993 and is currently being
renegotiated. Rental expense for this lease in 1993 was $474,000.

Rent expense was $1,096,000, $1,003,000 and $1,260,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

At December 31, 1993, Bancorp had approximately $120,000 outstanding in
standby letters of credit. In addition, Bancorp had approximately $81.2
million of unused equity lines of credit in connection with home equity
lines and an additional $5.7 million of unused commercial lines of credit
and unadvanced funds on construction loans. Bancorp also had commitments
to fund approximately $4.6 million of new residential mortgages.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A:

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation: Gateway Financial Corporation (the
"Company") was formed during 1989 under the laws of the State of
Delaware and became the holding company for Gateway Bank (the
"Bank"). The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing the
financial statements, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and operations
for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from
those estimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to
significant change in the near term relate to the determination
of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of real estate
acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of
loans. In connection with the determination of the allowances
for loan losses and other real estate owned, management
periodically obtains or internally updates independent appraisals
for significant properties.

While management uses available information to recognize losses
on loans and other real estate owned, future additions to the
allowances may be necessary, based on the changes in economic
conditions, particularly in Connecticut. In addition, various
regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination
process, periodically review the Bank's allowances for losses on
loans and other real estate owned. Such agencies may require the
Bank to recognize additions to the allowances, based on their
evaluation of information available to them at the time of their
examination.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The following methods and
assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value
disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents: The carrying value reported in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates the assets' fair
values.

Securities: Fair values for securities are based on quoted
market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are
not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices
of comparable instruments.

Loans Held For Sale/Putback: The fair value for loans held
for sale are based on quoted market prices of similar loans
sold in conjunction with securitized transactions, adjusted
for differences in loan characteristics. The fair value of
loans held for putback approximates their carrying value.

Loans: For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and
with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are
based on carrying values. The fair values for certain
mortgage loans (e.g., one-to-four family residential) are
based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in
conjunction with securitization transactions, adjusted for
differences in loan characteristics. The fair value of
other loans (e.g., commercial mortgage, commercial and
consumer loans) are estimated, using discounted cash flow
analysis, using interest rates currently being offered for
loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit
quality. Management concluded it was not practical to
estimate the fair value of non-accruing loans and
insubstance foreclosed real estate, due to the soft and
uncertain real estate market. Management believes any
estimate of fair value for these loans and insubstance
foreclosed real estate would be very subjective and costly. 
The carrying value of accrued interest approximates its fair
value.

Other Real Estate Owned: The carrying value reported in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates the assets' fair
values. The carrying value is the lower of cost or fair
value, less estimated selling costs.

Deposits and Borrowings: The fair values disclosed for
demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking,
regular savings, and certain types of money market accounts)
are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at
the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The
carrying amounts for variable-rate, fixed-term money market
accounts and certificates of deposits approximate their fair
values at the reporting dates. Fair values for fixed-rate
certificates of deposit are estimated, using a discounted
cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently
being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated
expected monthly maturities on certificates of deposit.

The carrying value of the short-term advances from the
Federal Home Loan Bank approximates their fair value.

Off Balance Sheet Instruments. Fair values for the
Company's loan commitments and standby letters of credit are
estimated, based on fees currently charged to enter into
similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms
of the agreements, and the counterparties' credit standing.

Securities: Effective December 31, 1993, the Company adopted, on
a prospective basis, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115 "Accounting For Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities" ("SFAS 115"), and revised its securities accounting
policies. Securities that may be sold due to changes in market
interest rates, needs for liquidity, changes in the availability
of and the yield on alternative investments, and changes in terms
are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair market
value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on such securities
are reported net of related taxes as a separate component of
stockholders' equity. Securities that the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as
held-to-maturity, and accounted for at amortized cost. Amounts
reported as realized gains and losses on securities are measured
by the difference between the proceeds of the sale and the basis
of the security sold, using the specific identification cost
method. The adoption of SFAS 115, which has not been applied
retroactively to prior years' financial statements, has had no
effect on the Company's retained earnings.

Prior to December 31, 1993, investments in debt securities, which
the Company has the ability to hold to maturity and the intent to
hold on a long-term basis or until maturity, are stated at cost,
adjusted for amortization of premiums, and accretion of discounts
using the level yield method. Events which may be reasonably
anticipated are considered when determining the Company's intent
to hold investment securities on a long-term basis or until
maturity. Marketable equity securities are stated at the lower
of aggregate cost or market. A valuation allowance is recorded
as a component of stockholders' equity when the aggregate cost
temporarily exceeds market value.

Loans Held For Sale/Putback: Fixed-rate, single-family
residential mortgages that the Company intends to sell in the
secondary mortgage market to reduce interest rate sensitivity are
classified as held-for-sale. The carrying value of these assets
is the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Loans held for
putback to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are carried
at face value, which is the same as the amount at which the loans
may be put back to the FDIC.

Loans: Interest on loans is recognized on the accrual basis as
earned, based on rates applied to principal amounts outstanding. 
The accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when a
loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest. When
interest accruals are discontinued, unpaid interest credited to
income in the current year is reversed, and interest accrued in
prior years is charged to the allowance for loan losses. 
Management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the
fair value of collateral is sufficient to cover principal balance
and accrued interest.

Non-refundable loan origination and commitment fees and the
direct costs associated with originating or acquiring loans are
deferred. The net deferred amount is amortized as an adjustment
to the related loan yield over the contractual life of the
related loan.

On June 10, 1993, federal banking regulators jointly issued a
regulatory credit initiative on insubstance foreclosed real
estate. In accordance with this initiative, insubstance
foreclosed real estate, previously reported as a component of
other real estate owned, was reclassified to loans as of December
31, 1993. In connection with this reclassification, all prior
periods presented have been reclassified, including the
reclassification of related provisions and write-downs as loans
charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. The
recognition and measurement accounting policies for identifying
insubstance foreclosed real estate were not changed as a result
of this reclassification.

Insubstance foreclosed assets are defined as loan situations
where: (i) the borrower has little or no equity in the property,
which is the primary source of repayment of the loan: (ii) the
borrower has relinquished control of the property to the Company: 
and (iii) the borrower is unlikely to be able to rebuild equity
in the property. Insubstance foreclosed assets are carried at
the lower of historical cost, or fair value. Reductions to fair
value are made through a charge to the allowance for loan losses.

Allowance For Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is
maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential
losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the
adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the
portfolio, past loan-loss experience, current economic
conditions, volume, growth, and composition of the loan
portfolio, and other relevant factors.

Premises and Equipment: Premises and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation computed using the straight-
line method at rates based on estimated useful lives. 
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
operations, as incurred. Any gains or losses from the sale or
disposition of premises and equipment are included in other
income or expense.

Other Real Estate Owned: Other real estate owned includes
properties acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or
acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. These assets are
carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated
selling costs. Reductions from cost to fair value upon
classification as other real estate owned are made through a
charge to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent reductions
in value are charged to operations through a provision for other
real estate owned. An allowance is maintained for losses and for
future costs to complete and sell these assets.

Income Taxes: The Company files consolidated federal and
combined state income tax returns, using the accrual method of
accounting as required by current regulations. Deferred taxes
result from different methods of accounting for financial and tax
reporting purposes, and are included in the consolidated
financial statements.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted on a prospective
basis, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109") which requires the use
of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. 
Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Bank
provides deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards when
realization is more likely than not. See Note O, "Income Taxes."

Income (Loss) Per Common Share: Income (loss) per common share
is computed, based upon the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the year.

Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications have been made to
prior years' financial statements to conform to the 1993
presentation.

NOTE B:

REGULATORY MATTERS AND BALANCE SHEET RESTRUCTURING PLAN

In May 1993, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent
to the Issuance of an Order to Cease and Desist ("Stipulation")
with the Bank regulators. Pursuant to the Stipulation, the Bank
regulators issued the Order which became effective on May 28,
1993. Under the terms of the Stipulation and the Order, the Bank
has agreed to take certain actions and to seek to achieve certain
goals, including (i) to achieve and maintain a leverage ratio of
at least 5.25% as of September 30, 1993 and 5.75% as of March 31,
1994, and to continue maintenance of its risk-based capital ratio
in compliance with standards set by the FDIC; (ii) to maintain
adequate loan loss reserves, and to evaluate such reserves on at
least a quarterly basis; (iii) to refrain from paying or
declaring cash dividends without the prior written approval of
the FDIC Regional Director and the Banking Commissioner of the
State of Connecticut; (iv) to have and retain qualified
management (including additional senior executive officers, at
least one of whom will be a senior executive officer whose
position will be junior in title, rank, and responsibility only
to that of the Chief Executive Officer), including at a minimum a
Chief Executive Officer and a Chief Operating Office; (v) to
conduct a written evaluation of the Bank's management and
staffing needs, including an evaluation of each officer, in
particular, the Chief Executive Officer; (vi) to not extend
credit to any borrower whose credit has been classified unless
certain findings are made by the Board of Directors; (vii) to not
accrue interest on any loan that is 90 days or more past due,
unless such loan is well secured and in the process of
collection; (viii) to not make payments to any affiliated
organization without prior written approval of the Bank
regulators; and (ix) to develop and/or revise its written plans
regarding lessening risk with respect to certain borrowers, loan
policy, profits, and funds management. At September 30 and
December 31, 1993, the Bank was in compliance with the
requirements of the Order regarding its minimum leverage ratio. 
The Bank remains subject to the other requirements of the Order,
and has worked diligently to satisfactorily address all of the
other requirements. As a result of the Company's agreement with
Shawmut National Corporation discussed earlier, the Bank has
decided, however, to suspend its recruitment of a Chief Operating
Officer. The Bank feels it is in compliance with all of the
other requirements of the Order, and any additional Bank actions
necessary to satisfy the Order's requirements will not have an
adverse material impact on the Bank's financial condition.

The FDIC and the Connecticut Banking Department are
conducting a concurrent examination of the Bank as of December
31, 1993, the results of which are unknown to the Company. 
However, the Company does not anticipate any adverse material
impact on the consolidated financial condition of the Company nor
any change in the consolidated financial statements as presented
herein.

In 1993, the Company implemented a restructuring plan which
consisted of a distribution to its stockholders of rights to
purchase stock, sales of certain of its non-performing assets,
and steps to solidify and strengthen its management. Through the
rights offering, which was completed August 4, 1993, Gateway
raised approximately $28.3 million, net of underwriting
discounts, commissions, and expenses, in new capital by
distributing transferable rights to stockholders of record on
June 28, 1993 to subscribe for and purchase up to 4,927,309
shares of Gateway's common stock for a price of $5.25 per share. 
The total shares were subscribed for, and an additional 857,142
shares were issued and sold to standby purchasers. The
restructuring plan also included the sale or resolution of up to
$60 million in book value (carrying value of the assets before
specific reserves, if any) of non-performing assets. It was
originally the Company's intent that up to $10 million of capital
would be used to absorb losses on these sales of non-performing
assets after an appropriate allocation of the then existing
reserves. However, only $11.3 million in non-performing assets
were sold through bulk sales. These sales resulted in a loss of
$97,000 after the utilization of $3.2 million of unallocated
reserves. Since many of the non-performing assets that might
have been included in bulk sales were resolved without the
necessity of their being included in bulk sales, the losses
incurred and the mark-to-market writedowns with respect to them,
were significantly less. Principal collections, proceeds from
sales, and internal resolutions totalled $31.3 million. Non-
performing assets were reduced by a net of $17.1 million, due
principally to charge-offs and provision for further other real
estate owned losses. At December 31, 1993, non-performing assets
were $50.2 million, a decrease of $59.7 million since December
31, 1992. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets was
3.93% at December 31, 1993, compared to 8.33% at December 31,
1992.

At December 31, 1993, the Company's and the Bank's capital
ratios and the required regulatory minimums were as follows:

Minimum Minimum
Gateway Financial Requlatory Gateway Regulatory
Corporation Requirements Bank Requirements

Leverage ratio 7.12% 4.00% 7.10% 5.25% *
Tier 1 risk-based ratio 11.66% 4.00% 11.63% 4.00%
Total risk-based ratio 12.95% 8.00% 12.90% 8.00%

* Order requirement at September 30, 1993. This
requirement increases to 5.75% at March 31, 1994 under the
existing Order. General regulatory requirement was 4.0% at
December 31, 1993.

Based upon the Bank's capital ratios at December 31, 1993,
as indicated above, the Bank is categorized as "adequately
capitalized" under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"). Under the regulations, a
bank will be "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-based
capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio of 6% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and
is not subject to any order or written directive by the FDIC to
meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital
measure, or "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based
capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
of 4% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4% or greater and does
not meet the definition of a "well-capitalized" institution.

NOTE C:

NOTE D:

ACQUISITIONS

On December 13, 1991, the Bank purchased certain assets and
assumed certain liabilities of The BankMart ("BankMart") from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") as receiver of
BankMart.

Assets acquired of $350 million, which included $67.2
million in cash and due from banks and federal funds sold,
consisted primarily of performing residential, commercial, and
consumer loans, while liabilities assumed of $482 million
consisted primarily of deposits. In addition, the FDIC provided
$132 million in cash to the Bank to bring the value of the assets
equal to the value of the liabilities, along with $14.6 million
in cash as the negotiated discount. In 1991, the negotiated
discount was allocated to BankMart residential and consumer loans
($3 million), the allowance for loan losses ($8 million),
deposits ($2 million), and various liabilities incurred or to be
incurred by the Bank ($2 million) as a result of the acquisition
to adjust their carrying amounts to their estimated fair values. 
During the quarter ended December 31, 1992, the Company
reclassified certain components of the 1991 allocation of the
negotiated discount in order to comply with an FDIC mandate. 
This reclassification increased the discount allocated to
BankMart residential, commercial, commercial real estate, and
consumer loans, and decreased the allocation to allowance for
loan losses. This reclassification was retroactive to December
31, 1991, and resulted in an adjustment of certain amounts
previously reported for the quarters ended September 30, 1992,
March 31, 1992, and December 31, 1991. These adjustments caused
no changes in the previously-reported net income (loss) or net
income (loss) per share for any of these quarters. See Note G.

Under the terms of the acquisition of BankMart from the
FDIC, the FDIC agreed to repurchase from the Bank any commercial
loans and commercial mortgages that become delinquent, as
defined, prior to December 13, 1993. As of December 31, 1993,
intentions to put back approximately $58.1 million of loans had
been delivered to the FDIC, of which $21.1 million is classified
as loans held for sale/putback awaiting payment.

As a result of the BankMart acquisition, the Bank elected to
prepay $82 million of its high coupon Federal Home Loan Bank
advances, which resulted in a $2.3 million prepayment penalty in
1991. In 1992, the Bank prepaid an additional $20 million in
advances, which resulted in prepayment penalties of $371,000. 
These penalties are reported as extraordinary charges in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The acquisition of BankMart was accounted for as a purchase. 
The results of its operations are included in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period subsequent
to December 13, 1991. The Company acquired only certain assets
and assumed only certain liabilities of BankMart. The
composition of earning assets has been significantly affected by
the exercise of options the Company had to put back certain
assets to the FDIC. Also, deposit rates have been adjusted to
align with the Company's traditional deposit pricing. 
Accordingly, pro forma financial information related to this
transaction would not be indicative of the continuing effect on
future operations and earnings.

NOTE E:

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL

The carrying value and fair value of the whole loans
purchased under agreements to resell was $10 million at December
31, 1992. The Company had no whole loan purchases under
agreement to resell at December 31, 1993.

Periodically, the Company enters into purchases of loans or
securities under agreements to resell. The amounts advanced
under these agreements represent short-term loans, and are
reflected as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
related collateral is held by either the Bank's custodian or in a
third-party custodian account under a written custodial agreement
that explicitly recognizes the Bank's interest in the collateral. 
The agreements require the resale of substantially identical
collateral. At December 31, 1992, the repurchase agreement with
Goldman, Sachs & Co. had an interest rate of 4%, and matured
within 30 days. Securities purchased under agreements to resell
averaged $82,192 and $8,480,874 during 1993 and 1992,
respectively, and the maximum amounts outstanding at any month-
end during 1993 and 1992 were $0 and $25,000,000, respectively.

NOTE F:

SECURITIES

Effective December 31, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 115,
which requires that securities be classified as either held-to-
maturity, available-for-sale, or trading (see Note 1 - Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies - Securities). As of December
31, 1993, securities have been classified as held-to-maturity or
available-for-sale. Prior to December 31, 1993, all investment
securities were classified as held-for-investment. The adoption
of SFAS 115, which has not been applied retroactively to prior
years' financial statements and which has had no effect on the
Company's retained earnings, has increased stockholders equity by
approximately $1.3 million as a result of the inclusion, as a
separate component of stockholders' equity, of unrealized holding
gains on securities available-for-sale. No tax effect has been
recorded against these unrealized gains because of net operating
loss tax carryforwards. Securities held-to-maturity (carried at
carrying value) and available-for-sale (carried at fair value) at
December 31, 1993 are as follows (in thousands):

delinquent and still accruing amounted to $8.5 million, $1
million, and $.8 million at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively.

The Bank services residential mortgage loans for others that
amounted to $353 million and $405 million at December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively. Substantially all loans sold into the
secondary market are sold without recourse to the Bank. Such
loans are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the
three years ended December 31 are as follows (in thousands):

1993 1992 1991

Allowance acquired in 
acquisitions 1,376
Balance at December 31 $18,265 $27,376 $21,558

During the quarter ended December 31, 1992, the Company
complied with an FDIC mandate involving its 1991 accounting for
an acquired allowance. Consequently, during the quarter ended
December 31, 1992, and retroactive to December 31, 1991, a
significant portion of the amount previously reported as the
allowance acquired in the 1991 acquisition was reclassified. See
Note D.

During 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan" (SFAS 114). SFAS 114 addresses the accounting by creditors
for impairment of a loan by specifying how allowances for credit
losses related to certain loans should be determined, including
loans that are restructured in a troubled debt restructuring
involving a modification of terms of a receivable. Management
has not assessed the impact of the implementation of SFAS 114,
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1994, with initial application as of the beginning of the fiscal
year.

NOTE H:

ALLOWANCE FOR OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED LOSSES

Allowance for other real estate owned losses is deducted from
other real estate owned. Changes in the allowance for each of

As disclosed in Note A, the fair value of demand deposits
are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand. The
fair value disclosed has not been adjusted for any value derived
from retaining those deposits for an expected future period of
time. That component is commonly referred to as a deposit base
intangible. This intangible asset is neither considered in the
above fair value amounts, nor is it recorded as an intangible
asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has not
performed the calculations to estimate the amount of this
intangible asset due to the absence of certain information
required and the complexity of the computation.

Scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit in
denominations of $100,000 or more at December 31, 1993 are as

As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLBB)
and in accordance with an agreement with them, the Bank is
required to maintain qualified collateral, as defined in the
"FHLBB" Statement of Credit Policy, free and clear of liens,
pledges and encumbrances as collateral for the advances. Total
qualified collateral which includes fully disbursed whole first
mortgages, direct obligations of the United States Treasury, U.S.
agency-backed securities, securitized mortgage obligations and
deposits held at the FHLBB, totalled $739 million at December 31,
1993. The FHLBB allows members to borrow at various percentages
against this collateral to determine total borrowing capacity. 
The Bank may borrow up to $564 million against the $739 million
of collateral.

NOTE K:

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

On August 28, 1985, the Bank converted from mutual to stock
ownership in a public offering. Upon conversion, eligible
savings account holders as of December 31, 1984 were granted a
priority in the event of future liquidation for a period of ten
years by establishing a special reserve account in an amount
equal to the total net worth of $36.3 million at June 30, 1985. 
The amount of the special reserve account is being decreased to
the extent that the balances of eligible account holders are
reduced at annual determination dates, which commenced December
31, 1985. No dividends may be paid to the Company if such
dividends reduce the net worth of the Bank below the amount
required for the special reserve account.

Dividends are paid by the Company from its assets which are
provided by dividends from the Bank. However, certain
restrictions exist regarding the ability of the Bank to transfer
funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans, or
advances. Pursuant to the Connecticut General Statutes, the Bank
may not declare cash dividends, loans, or advances. Pursuant to
the Connecticut General Statutes, the Bank may not declare cash
dividends except from its net profits. The approval of the State
of Connecticut Banking Commissioner is required to pay cash
dividends in excess of the Bank's earnings retained in the
current year, plus retained net profits of the preceding two
years. Further, in December 1990, the Company entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding with the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York (the "Fed MOU"). Under the Fed MOU, the Company agreed,
among other things: (i) not to declare cash dividends or make any
significant expenditures not in the ordinary course of business
without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York; and (ii) not to significantly expand its activities or
acquire, or enter into any agreements to acquire, any bank or
non-bank entities or asset portfolios, without first consulting
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, whether or not a formal
application is required.

In order to conserve its capital, the Company has not paid
any dividends since January 1990. Due to its recent results of
operations and regulatory restrictions on the payment of
dividends by the Bank (see Note B), which are the Company's
primary source of funds for the payment of dividends, management
of the Company currently does not anticipate the resumption of
dividend payments for the foreseeable future.

The Company has authorized to issue one million shares of
no-par-value preferred stock. No preferred stock was issued as
of December 31, 1993. In 1989, the Board of Directors of the
Company adopted a Shareholders Rights Plan. The rights become
exercisable ten days after a public announcement that a party or
group has acquired or obtained the right to acquire 20% or more
of the Company's common stock in a transaction not previously
approved by the Board of Directors, or after commencement of a
tender offer for 20% or more of the Company's common stock, or
after the Board of Directors declares any person or group to be
acting in other than the best interests of the Company after
becoming a beneficial owner of 10% or more of the Company's
common stock. If the rights become exercisable, they will
entitle holders of common stock to buy shares in the Company (or
a surviving company) at discounted prices, while the rights of
the unsolicited acquirer will become null and void. The rights
are designed to protect stockholders from unfair takeover
tactics, and expire in 1999.

NOTE L:

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

A substantial portion of the Company's loans are
collateralized by real estate in depressed markets in Fairfield
County, Connecticut. In addition, a substantial portion of the
real estate owned is located in those same depressed markets. 
Accordingly, the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion
of the Company's loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial
portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are
particularly susceptible to changes in market conditions in
Fairfield County. At December 31, 1993, the Company's largest
credit concentration consisted of $10.5 million in outstanding
loans. None of these loans were non-accruing. Management has
considered credit concentrations in determining the level of the
allowance for loan losses believed adequate to absorb potential
losses in the loan portfolio.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a
customer, and have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company
evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case
basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by
the Company upon extension of credit, is based on a credit
evaluation of the customer. Collateral held generally includes
income-producing commercial properties, residential properties,
and property, plant, and equipment. The Company generally
requires an initial loan-to-value ratio of no greater than 80%
when real estate collateralizes a loan. Interest rates on
approved loan commitments are a combination of fixed and variable
interest rates. Interest rates on unadvanced portions of
construction loans are either fixed or variable. Construction
loan commitments generally mature within eighteen months.

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-
balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the
financing needs of its customers. These expose the Company to
credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of non-
performance by the other party to the financial instrument for
commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual
amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit
policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it
does for on-balance-sheet instruments. Total credit exposure at
December 31, 1993 related to these items is summarized below (in
thousands):

Contract Amount Fair Value

Loan commitments:
Approved loan commitments $45,896 $574
Standby letters of credit 949 14
Unadvanced portion of 
construction loans 1,255 25

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments
issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer
to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to
support private domestic borrowing arrangements. All guarantees
have stated expiration dates, generally one year or less. The
credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially
the same as that involved in extending loans to customers, and
appropriate amounts of collateral, generally real estate, are
obtained when applicable.

NOTE M:

STOCK OPTIONS

The Company's Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "Plan")
authorizes the granting of stock options and stock appreciation
rights to key personnel. The Plan provides for the granting of
options to purchase a maximum of 693,000 shares of Company common
stock for terms of up to ten years. The options are exercisable
one year after the date of grant, and are granted at the fair
market value on the date of grant, except for options granted in
1993 which become exercisable upon termination of any FDIC
supervisory agreement or, at any time after March 24, 1995, upon
waiver of such restriction by the Board of Directors of the Bank
or by the Salary and Benefits Committee thereof and options
granted in 1991 and 1992 which are exercisable over a four-year
period.

At December 31, 1993, options to purchase 184,650 shares are
exercisable, and an additional 262,275 shares are reserved for
issuance pursuant to options not yet granted under the Plan. 
Changes in outstanding options were as follows:

Shares Price Range 

Outstanding January 1, 1991 235,825 $2.00 - $14.83
Options granted 54,000 2.38 - 2.50
Options cancelled (34,000) 2.00 - 13.63
Outstanding December 31, 1991 255,825 2.00 - 14.83
Options granted 104,500 4.50
Options exercised (5,000) 2.00 - 2.38
Options cancelled (18,000) 2.00 - 14.83
Outstanding December 31, 1992 337,325 2.00 - 14.83
Options granted 95,000 7.13
Options exercised (21,750) 2.00 - 7.88
Options cancelled (45,800) 2.00 - 14.83
Outstanding December 31, 1993 364,775 $2.00 - $14.83

In 1991, non-qualified options to purchase up to 30,000
shares of Company common stock at prices ranging from $4.50 to
$6.00 per share were granted to a former officer of the Company. 
The options replace previously-existing options to purchase a
like number of shares upon substantially the same terms as the
Plan. The options were exercised in 1993.

NOTE N:

BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a non-contributory defined benefit pension
plan covering all eligible employees. The benefits are primarily
based on the employee's years of service and compensation during
the last five years of employment. The Company's funding policy
is to contribute annually the maximum amount that can be deducted
for federal income taxes. Contributions are intended to provide
not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for
those expected to be earned in the future.

The following table sets forth the Plan's funded status and
amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in
thousands):

December 31 

1993 1992 

Actuarial present value of benefit 
obligations:

Accumulated benefit obligation, 
including vested benefits of 
$8,920 in 1993 and $7,402 in 1992 $10,121 $ 8,234

Projected benefit obligation 
for service rendered to date $13,147 $10,623

Plan assets at fair value-listed 
equity securities including the 
Company's common stock ($925 in
1993 and $284 in 1992) and
insurance annuity investment 11,314 9,349

Projected benefit obligation 
in excess of plan assets (1,833) (1,274)

Unrecognized net loss 2,522 2,204

Unrecognized prior service cost 291 419

Unrecognized net asset at transition (1,001) (1,144)

Prepaid (accrued) pension cost 
included in other assets or 
other liabilities $ (21) $ 205

Net pension cost included the following components (in
thousands):

Year Ended December 31 
1993 1992 1991 

Service cost-benefits earned during 
the period $1,038 $808 $ 646
Interest cost on projected benefit 
obligations 832 740 682
Actual return on Plan assets (1,797) (493)
(1,451)
Net amortization and deferral 989 (383) 573
Net Periodic Pension Cost $1,062 $672 $ 450

The weighted-average discount rate and rate of interest in
future compensation levels used in determining the actuarial
present value of the projected benefit obligation were 7.25% and
5.0%, respectively, in 1993 and 8.0% and 5.0%, respectively, in
1992. The expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets was
9.5% in 1993 and 10% in 1992 and 1991. The change in actuarial
assumptions and the effect of a bank acquisition increased net
periodic pension cost approximately $306,000 in 1993.

The Company has a 401(k) Savings Retirement Plan covering
all eligible employees. Participants may contribute up to 10% of
their compensation, subject to a maximum of $8,994 per year in
1993. The Company contributes amounts equal to 50% of annual
employee contributions up to 6% of participants' compensation. 
Employees are fully vested in the Company's contributions after
five years of service. The Company contributed $215,000,
$169,000, and $166,000 to the Plan in 1993, 1992, and 1991.

In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions ("SFAS 106"). The
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 106 in its financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 1993. The effect of
adopting SFAS 106 was to decrease 1993 pretax income by $75,000. 
As permitted by SFAS 106, prior year financial statements have
not been restated to reflect the change in accounting method.

Under SFAS 106, the Bank is required to accrue
postretirement benefits other than pensions during the years that
the employee renders the necessary service, of the expected cost
of providing those benefits to an employee, and the employee's
beneficiaries and covered dependents. Prior to SFAS 106, the
pay-as-you-go (cash) basis was the acceptable accounting
practice. In adopting SFAS 106, the Bank chose to recognize the
transition obligation on a delayed basis instead of choosing to
immediately recognize the transition obligation as a cumulative
effect of an accounting change.

The Company sponsors two defined benefit postretirement
plans covering all eligible employees. One plan provides health
(medical and dental) benefits, and the other provides life
insurance benefits. The postretirement health care plan is
shared by the Company and retiree, and benefits are based on
deductible and coinsurance provisions. The life insurance plan
is a non-contributory plan, and benefits are based on a
percentage of the base pay at retirement. The accounting for the
health care plan anticipates future cost-sharing changes that are
consistent with the current structure retiree contributions. The
Bank does not advance-fund its postretirement health care and
life insurance plans.

The following table sets forth the plans' combined funded
status reconciled with the amount shown in the Company's
statement of financial position at December 31, 1993 (in
thousands):

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation:
Retired participants $ 761
Fully-eligible active plan participants 15
Other active participants 65
841

Plan assets at fair value

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation in excess of
plan assets (841)
Unrecognized net loss from past experience different 
from that assumed and from changes in assumptions 54
Prior service cost not yet recognized in net periodic 
post-retirement benefit cost
Contributions 2
Unrecognized transition obligation 711
Accrued postretirement benefit cost $ (74)

The Company's postretirement health care plan is
underfunded, and the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation equals $748,000 (there are no plan assets).

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1993 included
the following components (in thousands):

Service cost - benefit attributable to service during 
the period $ 14
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation 59
Actual return on plan assets
Unrecognized transition obligation 37
Net amortization and deferral 
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost $ 110

For measurement purposes, a 13% annual rate of increase in
the per-capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed
for 1993; the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 6% for
the year 2000 and remain at the level thereafter. The health
care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the
amounts reported. To illustrate, increasing the assumed health
care cost trend rates by a 1% point in each year would increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December
31, 1993 by $52,000.

The weighted-average discount rate and rate of increase in
future compensation levels used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation were 7.25% and 5%.

NOTE O:

INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted on a
prospective basis, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). SFAS 109
requires the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are
recognized for the future tax consequences of differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation
allowance is established when it is considered to be more likely
than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be
realized. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 109, income tax expense
was based on items of income and expense that were reported in
different years in the financial state-ments and tax returns and
were measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the
difference originated.

The adoption of SFAS 109, which has not been applied
retroactively to prior years' financial statements, had no effect
on the Company's stockholders' equity as of January 1, 1993
because the deferred tax asset was fully reserved as of that

The Company will only recognize a deferred tax asset, when
based upon available evidence, realization is more likely than
not. The Company projected its estimated future taxable income
for the year ended December 31, 1994. These projections, which
the Company considers conservative, provided the support for
reducing the valuation allowance in 1993. Accordingly, at
December 31, 1993, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance
of approximately 80%, based on anticipated future earnings.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards as follows (in thousands):

In addition, the Company has federal alternative minimum tax
credits available of approximately $1 million.

NOTE P:

CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

The Company and certain of its Directors and officers were
named as defendants in two civil class actions commenced and
subsequently consolidated in 1990. Claims against non-officer
Directors were voluntarily dismissed in late 1990. The action
was filed on behalf of a class consisting of all persons who
purchased shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.01
per share, in the open market during the period from February 8,
1989 through July 20, 1990, or received the Company's common
stock in return for the Bank's common stock in the reorganization
of July 1, 1989, and who allegedly sustained damages. The action
claimed, among other things, alleged violations of federal
securities laws, and requested unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages. The Company disputed the allegations of the
action; however, the Company and its officers reached a
settlement with the class in late October 1991,which was approved
by the court on January 3, 1992, pursuant to which the Company
and its liability insurer (for claims against Directors and
officers) agreed to pay an aggregate of $2,350,000. The
Company's share of the settlement was approximately $825,000,
which is included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for
the year ended December 31, 1991.

There are no pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary
routine litigation incidental to the business of the Company, to
which the Company is a party or to which any of its properties
are subject. In the opinion of management, these matters will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
position.

Rental expense of $2.1 million in 1993, $2.1 million in
1992, and $1.7 million in 1991 is included in operating expenses. 
Future minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under non-
cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of
one year or more, consist of the following at December 31, 1993
(in thousands):

1994 $2,113
1995 2,008
1996 1,690
1997 1,586
1998 871
Thereafter 626
$8,894

These leases include options to renew for periods ranging
from 1 to 25 years.

The Company is required to maintain average reserve balances
with the Federal Reserve Company. The average amount of these
reserve balances for the year ended December 31, 1993 was $4.5
million.

NOTE Q:

AGREEMENT WITH SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION

On November 5, 1993, Shawmut National Corporation
("Shawmut") and Gateway executed a definitive agreement pursuant
to which Shawmut agreed to acquire Gateway Financial Corporation
in a fixed stock-for-stock exchange of 0.559 of a share of
Shawmut common stock for each Gateway share of common stock.

The agreement allows Gateway to terminate in the event that
the average price of Shawmut stock during a ten-day period
preceding the receipt of all regulatory approvals falls below
$18.70 a share, and Shawmut elects not to preserve the
transaction's value by increasing the exchange ratio.

The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals,
approval by the stockholders of the Company, and certain other
conditions, is expected to close in the first half of 1994. Upon
completion of the transaction, Gateway Bank will be merged into
Shawmut Bank Connecticut, the state's largest bank.

In connection with the transaction, Gateway granted Shawmut
an option to acquire up to 19.9% of Gateway's outstanding shares
of stock at $10.75 per share upon the occurrence of certain
events.

Shawmut National Corporation had total assets of
approximately $27 billion on December 31, 1993, and over 300
branches in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. 
Shawmut is a leading provider of financial services to consumers
and small-to-medium-sized business in southern New England. 
Shawmut maintains dual headquarters in Hartford and Boston.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Cohasset Savings Bank:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of
Cohasset Savings Bank and Subsidiary as of December 31, 1993
and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income,
changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
the Bank's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Cohasset Savings Bank and
Subsidiary as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Bank has elected to adopt Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes," effective January 1, 1992, and SFAS
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities," effective December 31, 1993.

As discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Bank entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger as of March 2, 1994.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993, 1992 AND 1991

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation and consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cohasset
Savings Bank (the "Bank") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, North Scituate
Corporation, which engages in equipment leasing to the Bank and the rental
of real estate. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

Accounting policy changes

Investment securities:

Effective December 31, 1993, the Bank adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities." SFAS No. 115 establishes standards for all debt securities
and for equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. As
required under SFAS No. 115, prior year financial statements have not been
restated.

SFAS No. 115 requires that investments in debt securities that
management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity be
classified as "held to maturity" and reflected at amortized cost. 
Investments that are purchased and held principally for the purpose of
selling them in the near term are classified as "trading securities" and
reflected on the balance sheet at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses included in earnings. Investments not classified as either of the
above are classified as "available for sale" and reflected on the balance
sheet at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from
earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle at December 31,
1993 is to increase stockholders' equity by $238,140, net of related income
tax effects. There was no effect on net income for the year ended December
31, 1993 relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 115.

Prior to December 31, 1993, debt securities that management had the
intent and ability to hold until maturity were reflected at amortized cost. 
Marketable equity securities were stated at the lower of aggregate cost or
fair value with net unrealized losses reflected as a charge to
stockholders' equity.

For all years presented, equity securities other than marketable
equity securities are reflected at cost. Purchase premiums and discounts
are amortized to earnings by the straight-line method over the terms of the
investments, which income would not differ materially if accounted for on
the interest method. Declines in the value of investments that are deemed
to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings when identified. 
Gains and losses on disposition of investments are computed by the specific
identification method.

Income taxes:

Effective January 1, 1992, the Bank adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." As permitted under SFAS No. 109, prior
year financial statements were not restated.

SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be
reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in
which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or
settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets
and liabilities will be adjusted accordingly through the provision for
income taxes. The Bank's allowance for loan losses for tax purposes that
arose before 1987 will remain a permanent difference without recognition of
a deferred tax liability. However, the loan loss allowance maintained for
financial reporting purposes is now treated as a temporary difference with
allowable recognition of a related deferred tax asset, if it is deemed
realizable.

The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on years
prior to 1992 is reflected as an increase in the 1992 operating results and
amounted to $300,000. The effect of the accounting change for the year
ended December 31, 1992 was to decrease net income by $70,000.

For regulatory capital purposes, the recognition of deferred tax
assets, when realization of such is dependent on an institution's future
taxable income, is limited to the amount that can be realized within one
year or 10% of core capital, whichever is less.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts have been reclassified in the 1992 and 1991
consolidated financial statements to conform to the 1993 presentation.

Cash equivalents

Cash equivalents include amounts due from banks and short-term
investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Trading account securities

Trading account securities consist of marketable equity securities
which are carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses
are recognized in the statement of income as they occur.

Loans

The Bank grants mortgage and other loans to customers. A substantial
portion of the loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans in Cohasset,
Massachusetts, and surrounding communities. The ability of the Bank's
debtors to honor their contracts is dependent upon the local real estate
market and economy.

Loans, as reported, have been adjusted for amounts due to borrowers on
incomplete loans, net deferred loan fees/costs and the allowance for loan
losses.

Interest on loans is recognized on a simple interest basis and is not
accrued for loans which are ninety days or more in arrears, or, when in the
judgement of management, collectability becomes doubtful. Net deferred
loan fees/costs are amortized over the contractual lives of the related
loans on the interest method.

Allowance for loan losses

The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for
loan losses charged to operations and is maintained at a level considered
adequate by management to provide for reasonably foreseeable loan losses.

The provision and the level of the allowance are evaluated on a
regular basis by management and are based upon management's periodic review
of the collectability of the loans in light of known and inherent risks in
the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may
affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying
collateral and prevailing economic conditions.

The allowance is an estimate and ultimate losses may vary from current
estimates and future additions to the allowance may be necessary. As
adjustments become necessary, they are reported in the results of
operations for the periods in which they become known. Loan losses are
charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability
of the loan principal is unlikely.

Foreclosed real estate

Foreclosed real estate and in-substance foreclosures are held for sale
and carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to
sell. Troubled loans are transferred to foreclosed real estate upon
completion of formal foreclosure proceedings, and to in-substance
foreclosure when it is determined that the borrower has little or no equity
in the underlying collateral and that loan payments can be expected only
from the sale or operation of the collateral.

Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or classified as
in-substance foreclosures are initially recorded at fair value at the date
of foreclosure. Costs relating to development and improvement of property
are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding property are expensed.

Valuations are periodically performed by management, and an allowance
for losses is established through a charge to operations if the carrying
value of a property exceeds its fair value less estimated costs to sell.

Prior to December 31, 1992, foreclosed and in-substance foreclosed
real estate was carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. 
Declines in value subsequent to foreclosure classification were reflected
as direct charges to operations and to the related properties without the
utilization of a valuation allowance. The change in accounting method had
no significant effect on the Bank's results of operations in 1992.

Banking premises and equipment and real estate held for investment

Land is carried at cost. Buildings and equipment are carried at cost,
less accumulated depreciation computed on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets.

It is general practice to charge the cost of maintenance and repairs
to earnings when incurred; major expenditures for betterments are
capitalized and depreciated.

Retirement plan

The Bank accounts for pension benefits on the net periodic pension
cost method for financial reporting purposes. This method recognizes the
compensation cost of an employee's pension benefit over the employee's
approximate service period. Pension costs are funded in the year of
accrual using the aggregate cost method.

Income taxes

The Bank and its subsidiary file state and consolidated federal income
tax returns based on an October 31 year end.

Earnings per share

Earnings per share is based on the number of shares outstanding as
shown on the statement of income. The dilutive effect of stock options
granted is not significant.

Recent accounting pronouncement

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan." SFAS No. 114
requires that impaired loans be measured on a loan by loan basis by either
the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair
value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

SFAS No. 114 is applicable to all creditors and to all loans, except
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively
evaluated for impairment, loans that are measured at fair value or at the
lower of cost or fair value, leases, and convertible or nonconvertible
debentures and bonds and other debt securities.

SFAS No. 114 applies to financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1994. Earlier adoption is permissible. 
Management has not yet determined the financial statement impact of
adopting the provisions of this statement.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

General

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet
risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its
customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend
credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to
varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the
amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Bank's exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual
amount of these instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in
making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-
sheet instruments. A summary of financial instruments outstanding whose
contract amounts represent credit risk is as follows:

DECEMBER 31, 
1993 1992

Commitments to grant 
loans . . . . . . . . . . $ 382,000 $ 1,006,000
Standby letters of 
credit . . . . . . . . . . 120,000 136,000

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as
long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Bank evaluates each
customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. These financial
instruments are collateralized by real estate.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the
Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These
letters of credit are primarily issued to support borrowing arrangements.
The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the
same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. At
December 31, 1993, letters of credit expire in 1994 and are unsecured
except for two letters of credit amounting to $20,000, which are fully
secured by certificates of deposit.

Employment Agreements

The Bank has entered into Employment Agreements with the President and
three executive officers. The Agreements provide for a specified minimum
compensation and the continuation of benefits in accordance with the Bank's
general policies at various terms. The Bank has also entered into Special
Termination Agreements with the President and three executive officers,
which provide for certain lump-sum severance payments and continuation of
benefits following a "change in control," as defined in the Agreements.

12. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Minimum regulatory requirements

Federal banking regulators require that the Bank meet certain Tier 1
leverage capital and risk-based capital ratio requirements. Generally, all
institutions are required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage capital
ratio of not less than 4% and a risk-based capital ratio of not less than
8%. The Bank exceeded all minimum regulatory requirements at December 31,
1993 and 1992.

The Bank may not declare or pay dividends on its shares of common
stock if the effect thereof would cause its stockholders' equity to be
reduced below applicable capital maintenance requirements or if such
declaration and payments would otherwise violate regulatory requirements
including restriction of the liquidation account.

Tax reserve for loan losses

The total reserve for loan losses for federal income tax purposes at
the Bank's base year amounted to approximately $1,240,000. If any portion
of the reserve is used for purposes other than to absorb the losses for
which established, approximately 150% of the amount actually used (limited
to the amount of the reserve) must be included in gross income for federal
income tax purposes in the fiscal year in which used. As the Bank does not
intend to use the reserves for purposes other than to absorb loan losses, a
deferred income tax liability of approximately $525,000 has not been
provided. (See Note 1.)

Liquidation Account

At the time of the Bank's conversion from mutual to stock ownership,
it established a liquidation account in the amount of $4,005,827 for the
benefit of eligible account holders. The liquidation account is reduced
annually to the extent that eligible account holders reduce their
qualifying deposit. In the event of a complete liquidation, eligible
account holders will be entitled to receive a distribution from the
liquidation account to the extent that funds are available.

13. PENSION PLAN

The Bank provides basic and supplemental pension benefits for eligible
employees through the Savings Banks Employees Retirement Association
("SBERA") Pension Plan. Each employee reaching the age of 21 and having
completed at least one year of service automatically becomes a participant
in the retirement plan. All participants are fully vested after three
years of employment.

Pension expense for the plan years ended October 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 
consisted of the following:

1993 1992 1991
Service cost - benefits earned
during the year . . . . . . . . . . $ 45,582 $ 61,283 $ 44,644
Interest cost on projected benefits . 91,599 82,561 73,524
Actual return on plan assets . . . . . (132,673) (65,549) (132,966)
Net amortization and deferral . . . . 12,527 12,527 12,527
Net loss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 67,086 16,810 81,169
$ 84,121 $ 107,632 $ 78,898

Total pension expense for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 
amounted to $78,650, $115,500 and $76,500, respectively.

According to SBERA's actuary, a reconciliation of the funded status of the 
plan at October 31, 1993 and 1992 is as follows:

1993 1992

Projected benefit obligation . . . . . . . . $ (1,464,746) $ (1,308,559)
Plan assets at fair value . . . . . . . . . 1,136,675 921,350

Excess of projected benefit obligation
over plan assets . . . . . . . . . . . . (328,071) (387,209)
Unamortized net obligation since adoption
of SFAS No. 87 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 187,924 200,451
Unrecognized net gain . . . . . . . . . . . (95,932) (25,141)
Accrued pension liability . . . . . . . . . $ (236,079) $ (211,899)

The accumulated benefit obligation (substantially all vested) at October 31, 
1993 amounted to $760,161, which is less than the plan assets at fair value.

For the plan years ended October 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, actuarial 
assumptions include an assumed discount rate on benefit obligations of 
7.00%, 7.00% and 6.75%, respectively, and an expected long-term rate of 
return on plan assets of 7.00%, 6.75% and 7.75%, respectively. An annual
salary increase of 6% was utilized for all years.

14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

In the normal course of business, the Bank has granted loans to
certain of its officers and Directors and their affiliates. The aggregate
amount of such loans which exceeded $60,000 in aggregate outstanding amount
to any related party amounted to $1,973,000 at December 31, 1993 and
$2,543,000 at December 31, 1992. During the year ended December 31, 1993,
total principal additions were $439,000 and principal payments were
$529,000. At December 31, 1992 loans to one Director and his affiliates
amounted to $480,000. This Director resigned in 1993 and those loans are
not included in the balance at December 31, 1993.

15. STOCK OPTION PLAN

The Bank has a stock option plan for the benefit of its officers and
other employees which became effective upon the Bank's conversion to stock
form. Shares of common stock up to 100,298 have been reserved for issuance
pursuant to options granted under the plan. Both "incentive stock options"
and "nonqualified stock options" may be granted under this plan with a
maximum option term of ten years.

Stock options may be granted as determined by the Board of Directors
of the Bank, and will have an exercise price equal to or in excess of the
fair market value of a share of common stock of the Bank on the date the
option is granted. The plan also permits the inclusion of stock
appreciation rights in any option granted. As of December 31, 1993 and
1992, there were 53,900 nonqualified stock options outstanding exercisable
at a price of $8.625 per share. No options have been cancelled or
exercised and no stock appreciation rights have been granted to date.

16. EMPLOYEES' STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

The Bank has an Employees' Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") which was
established as of November 1, 1986 for eligible employees. The ESOP will
be funded by the Bank's contributions made in cash (which generally will be
invested in common stock) or common stock. Benefits may be paid in shares
of common stock or in cash, subject to the employees' right to demand
shares.

In September, 1987, the ESOP purchased 10,000 shares of common stock
with a fair value of $91,250. The purchase was funded with a loan from the
Bank of $66,250 and the Bank's initial contribution of $25,000 to the ESOP. 
In addition, the Bank borrowed $450,000 from a third party lender and
loaned the proceeds to the ESOP which purchased 40,000 additional shares
during 1988. The loan to the ESOP was repaid from contributions made by
the Bank. The Bank's ESOP expense for the years ended December 31, 1993,
1992 and 1991 amounted to $67,820, $94,240 and $95,502, respectively. The
balance of the loan due from the ESOP as of December 31, 1992 is shown as a
deduction from stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets.

17. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On March 2, 1994, the Bank and a subsidiary of Shawmut National
Corporation ("SNC") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger. In
accordance with the terms of the Agreement, each share of the Bank's issued
and outstanding common stock at the effective time of the Merger, other
than dissenting shares, shall be converted into the right to receive $16.00
per share.

The completion of the Merger is subject to certain conditions,
including (a) approval by the stockholders of the Bank, (b) approval of the
Federal Reserve Board, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and other
requisite federal and state regulatory authorities and (c) other closing
conditions customary in transactions of this type.

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Bank and
SNC entered into a Stock Option Agreement (the "Option Agreement"), dated
as of March 2, 1994, providing, among other things, for the grant by the
Bank to SNC of an option (the "Option") to purchase up to 19.9% of the
Bank's then outstanding common stock, before giving effect to the exercise
of the Option, at $14.00 per share. The Option is only exercisable upon
the occurrence of certain events as specified in the Option Agreement. The
Option was granted by the Bank as a condition of and is consideration for
SNC's entering into the Merger Agreement.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
of West Newton Savings Bank:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of West Newton
Savings Bank and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1993. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Bank's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial state-
ments. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of West
Newton Savings Bank and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank
has elected to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," effective January 1, 1992 and SFAS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation and consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Bank and its wholly-owned subsidiar-
ies, Prolog Corporation, Prolog Two Corporation and,
in 1993, West Newton Securities Corp. Prolog Corpo-
ration leases equipment to the Bank and Prolog Two
Corporation has invested in real estate development
ventures and currently holds a minor investment in
real estate. West Newton Securities Corp. was
formed in 1993 to engage in the purchasing, selling
and holding of investment securities. All signifi-
cant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Accounting policy changes

Investment securities:

Effective December 31, 1993, the Bank adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The
Statement establishes standards for all debt securi-
ties and for equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values. As required under SFAS
No. 115, prior year financial statements have not
been restated.

SFAS No. 115 requires that investments in debt
securities that management has the positive intent
and ability to hold to maturity be classified as
"held to maturity" and reflected at amortized cost. 
Investments that are purchased and held principally
for the purpose of selling them in the near term are
classified as "trading securities" and reflected on
the balance sheet at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses included in earnings. Investments
not classified as either of the above are classified
as "available for sale" and reflected on the balance
sheet at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses excluded from earnings and reported as a
separate component of stockholders' equity, net of
tax effects. There was no effect on net income for
the year ended December 31, 1993 relating to the
adoption of SFAS No. 115.

Prior to December 31, 1993, U.S. Government and
federal agency obligations were stated at cost,
adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion
of discounts. Gains and losses on disposition of
investment securities were computed by the average
cost method. The carrying basis of debt securities
reflected management's intention and ability to hold
the securities for the foreseeable future or to
maturity. For all years presented Federal Home Loan

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Accounting policy changes (continued)

Bank stock is stated at cost.

Income taxes:

Effective January 1, 1992, the Bank adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes". As permitted under SFAS No. 109, prior year
financial statements have not been restated. SFAS
No. 109 requires that deferred tax assets and lia-
bilities be reflected at currently enacted income
tax rates applicable to the period in which the
deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to
be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or
rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabili-
ties will be adjusted accordingly through the provi-
sion for income taxes. The Bank's allowance for
loan losses for tax purposes that arose before 1987
will remain a permanent difference without recogni-
tion of a deferred tax liability. However, the loan
loss allowance maintained for financial reporting
purposes will now be treated as a temporary differ-
ence with allowance recognition of a related de-
ferred tax asset, if it is deemed realizable. The
cumulative effect of the change in accounting prin-
ciple on years prior to 1992 is reflected as an
increase in the 1992 operating results and amounted
to $1,567,000. The effect of the accounting change
for the year ended December 31, 1992 was to decrease
net income by $230,000.

For regulatory capital purposes, the recognition of
deferred tax assets, when realization of such is
dependent on an institution's future taxable income,
is limited to the amount that can be realized within
one year or 10% of core capital, whichever is less.

Reclassification

Certain amounts have been reclassified in the 1992
and 1991 consolidated financial statements to con-
form to the 1993 presentation.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from
banks and federal funds sold on a daily basis.

Loans

The Bank grants mortgage and consumer loans to
customers. A substantial portion of the loan port-
folio consists of mortgage loans in the eastern New
England area. The ability of the Bank's debtors to

WEST NEWTON SAVINGS BANK AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Accounting policy changes (concluded)

honor their contracts is dependent on the real
estate and construction economic sectors and the New
England economy in general.

Loans, as reported, have been reduced by unadvanced
funds on construction loans, deferred loan origina-
tion fees and the allowance for loan losses.

Interest income on loans is recognized on a simple
interest basis and is not accrued on loans which are
ninety days or more past due. Interest income
previously accrued on such loans is reversed against
current period earnings.

Loan origination fees and certain related direct
loan costs are deferred and the net amount is amor-
tized as an adjustment of the yield on loans using
the level interest method over the contractual life
of the related loans.

Allowance for loan losses

This allowance for loan losses is established
through a provision for loan losses charged to
operations and is maintained at a level considered
by management as adequate to provide for reasonably
foreseeable loan losses.

The provision and the level of the allowance are
evaluated on a regular basis by management and are
based on management's periodic review of the
collectibility of the loans in light of known and
inherent risks in the nature and volume of the loan
portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the
borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any
underlying collateral and prevailing economic condi-
tions.

The allowance is an estimate and ultimate losses may
vary from current estimates and future additions to
the allowance may be necessary. As adjustments
become necessary, they are reported in the results
of operations for the periods in which they become
known. Loan losses are charged against the allow-
ance when management believes the collectibility of
the loan balance is unlikely.

Advances to joint venture

Prolog Two Corporation accounts for its advances to
a joint venture partnership at an amount that ap-
proximates fair value (See Note 4).

WEST NEWTON SAVINGS BANK AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Foreclosed real estate

Foreclosed real estate and in-substance foreclosures
are held for sale and carried at the lower of cost
or fair value less estimated costs to sell and an
allowance for losses. Troubled loans are trans-
ferred to foreclosed real estate upon completion of
formal foreclosure proceedings, and to in-substance
foreclosure when it is determined that the borrower
has little or no equity in the underlying collateral
and that loan payments can be expected only from the
sale or operation of the collateral.

Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure
or classified as in-substance foreclosures are
initially recorded at fair value at the date of
foreclosure. Costs relating to development and
improvement of property are capitalized, whereas
costs relating to holding property are expensed.

Valuations are periodically performed by management,
and an allowance for losses is established through a
charge to operations if the carrying value of a
property exceeds its fair value less estimated costs
to sell.

Prior to December 31, 1992, foreclosed and in-sub-
stance foreclosed real estate was carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value. Declines in
value subsequent to foreclosure classification were
reflected as direct charges to operations and to the
related properties without the utilization of a
valuation allowance. The change in accounting
method had no significant effect on the Bank's
results of operations in 1992.

Banking premises and equipment

Land is carried at cost. Banking premises, lease-
hold improvements and equipment are stated at cost,
less accumulated depreciation and amortization,
computed primarily on the straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
terms of leases, if shorter.

It is general practice to charge the cost of mainte-
nance and repairs to earnings when incurred; major
expenditures for improvements and additions are
capitalized and depreciated.

Income taxes

Provisions for deferred income taxes are made as a
result of timing differences between financial and
income tax methods of accounting.

WEST NEWTON SAVINGS BANK AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Banking premises and equipment (concluded)

Pension plan

The Bank uses the "net periodic pension cost" method
of accounting for pensions for financial reporting
purposes. This method recognizes the compensation
cost of an employee's pension benefit over that
employee's approximate service period. The aggre-
gate cost method is used for funding purposes.

Earnings per share

The earnings per share computations for the years
ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 are based on
weighted average shares outstanding of 1,767,000,
1,735,000 and 1,714,000, respectively, and assume
that outstanding stock options, when the market
price exceeded the exercise price, were exercised
and the proceeds used to purchase common shares. In
each of the three years ended December 31, 1993,
primary and fully diluted earnings per share were
the same.

Fair value of financial instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instru-
ments" requires disclosure of estimated fair values
of all financial instruments where it is practicable
to estimate such values. In cases where quoted
market prices are not available, fair values are
based on estimates using present value or other
valuation techniques. Those techniques are signifi-
cantly affected by the assumptions used, including
the discount rate and estimates of future cash
flows. Accordingly, the derived fair value esti-
mates cannot be substantiated by comparison to
independent markets and, in many cases, could not be
realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. 
SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments
and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure
requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value
amounts presented do not represent the underlying
value of the Bank.

The following methods and assumptions were used by
the Bank in estimating fair value disclosures for
financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts
of cash and short-term instruments approximate
fair values.

Investment securities: Fair values for invest-

WEST NEWTON SAVINGS BANK AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

ment securities, excluding Federal Home Loan Bank
stock, are based on quoted market prices. The
carrying value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock
approximates fair value.

Loans: For variable-rate loans that reprice fre-
quently and with no significant change in credit
risk, fair values are based on carrying values. 
Fair values for certain mortgage loans are esti-
mated using discounted cash flow analyses, using
interest rates currently being offered for loans
with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit
quality. Fair values for other loans (e.g., com-
mercial real estate, construction, installment
and passbook and stock loans) are estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, using interest
rates currently being offered for loans with
similar terms to borrowers of similar credit
quality. Fair values for nonperforming loans are
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses or
underlying collateral values, where applicable.

Deposit liabilities: The fair values disclosed
for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-in-
terest checking, passbook savings, and certain
types of money market accounts) are, by defini-
tion, equal to the amount payable on demand at
the reporting date (i.e., their carrying
amounts). Fair values of certificates of deposit
are estimated using a discounted cash flow calcu-
lation that applies interest rates currently
being offered on certificates to a schedule of
aggregated expected monthly maturities on time
deposits.

Federal Home Loan Bank advances: The fair values
of advances are estimated using discounted cash
flow analyses based on the Bank's current incre-
mental borrowing rates for similar types of bor-
rowing arrangements.

Accrued interest: The carrying amounts of ac-
crued interest approximate fair value.

Off-balance-sheet instruments: Fair values for
off-balance-sheet lending commitments are based
on fees currently charged to enter into similar
agreements, taking into account the remaining
terms of the agreements and the counterparties'
credit standings. The fair values of these in-
struments are not material.

Fair value of financial instruments (concluded)

Recent accounting pronouncement

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan." The Statement requires
that impaired loans be measured on a loan by loan
basis by either the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at the loan's effective inter-
est rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the
fair value of the collateral if the loan is collat-
eral dependent.

The Statement is applicable to all creditors and to
all loans, except large groups of smaller balance
homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated
for impairment, loans that are measured at fair
value or at the lower of cost or fair value, leases,
and convertible or nonconvertible debentures and
bonds and other debt securities.

The Statement applies to financial statements for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. 
Earlier adoption is permissible. Management has not
yet determined the financial statement impact of
adopting the provisions of this statement.

tively.

4. ADVANCES TO JOINT VENTURE

The Bank, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Prolog Two Corporation,
has in the past made investments in and advances to real estate joint
ventures. As of December 31, 1992 the joint venture consisted of a
limited partnership formed to operate and lease a professional office
building. As of December 31, 1992, all equity contributions had been
written off and the advance had been written down to its estimated fair
value. The advance was secured by real estate and provided for interest
at market rates. However, interest had not been paid or accrued for
over three years on the advance. In 1993, the joint venture was termi-
nated and Prolog Two Corporation received $435,000 as a settlement of
the advance resulting in a recovery of $110,000.

Changes in advances to joint ventures outstanding are as follows:

In 1992, the Bank recorded a loss of $1,004,000 on subleased property
including the writeoff of leasehold improvements with a net book value
of $480,000. This decision resulted from the expiration of the sub-
lease, the subtenant's notice of intent to vacate and the Bank's inabil-
ity to find a new tenant.

in the amount of $370,000. The advance bears interest at 6.72% and is
due in monthly payments of $2,829 to April 2013. The advance is
secured by a blanket lien on certain qualified collateral, defined
principally as 90% of the fair value of U.S. Government and federal
agency obligations and 75% of the carrying value of first mortgage
loans on owner-occupied residential property. At December 31, 1993,
the estimated fair value of the Federal Home Loan Bank advance was

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

WEST NEWTON SAVINGS BANK AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Loan Commitments

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-
balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to
meet the financing needs of its customers. These finan-
cial instruments include various commitments to extend
credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of
credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount
recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.

The Bank's exposure to credit loss is represented by the
contractual amount of these instruments. The Bank uses
the same credit policies in making commitments as it does
for all balance sheet instruments.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the following financial
instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts
represent credit risk:

1993 1992
(In Thousands)

Commitments to grant loans $ 3,207 $ 2,644
Unadvanced funds on equity 
lines-of-credit 13,624 12,888

Commitments to grant loans are agreements to lend to a
customer as long as there is no violation of any condi-
tion established in the contract. Commitments generally
have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for
equity lines-of-credit may expire without being drawn
upon, therefore, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank
evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-
case basis. These financial instruments are collateral-
ized by real estate.

Employment Agreements

The Bank has entered into severance agreements with five
principal officers, which provide for certain lump-sum
severance payments within a two-year period following a
"change in control" as defined in the agreements. In
addition, the agreements provide for the immediate vest-
ing of stock options and other similar benefits upon a
"change in control".

Other Contingencies

In the ordinary course of business, various legal claims
arise from time to time and, in the opinion of manage-
ment, these claims will have no material effect on the
Bank's consolidated financial position.

12. LEASE COMMITMENTS 

Pursuant to the terms of noncancelable lease agreements
pertaining to banking premises, future minimum rental

loss on subleased property as described in Note 6.

Net rent expense for the years ended December 31, 1993,
1992 and 1991 amounted to $108,000, $109,000 and
$127,000, respectively.

13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Tax reserve for loan losses

At October 31, 1993, the close of the most recent year
for taxes, the total reserve for loan losses for federal
income tax purposes amounted to approximately $3,067,000. 
If this amount, or any portion thereof, is used for
purposes other than to absorb the losses for which estab-
lished, an amount up to approximately 150% of the amount
actually used (limited to the amount of the reserve),
must be included in gross income for federal income tax
purposes in the fiscal year in which used and would
result in up to approximately $1,297,000 in additional
federal income tax liability. As the Bank does not
intend to use the reserves for purposes other than to
absorb loan losses, deferred income taxes have not been
provided on these amounts (See Note 1).

Liquidation account

At the time of the Bank's conversion from a Massachusetts
chartered savings bank in mutual form to a Massachusetts
chartered savings bank in stock form, the Bank estab-
lished a liquidation account in the amount of
$10,961,000. In accordance with Massachusetts law, the
liquidation account is maintained for the benefit of
Eligible Account Holders who continue to maintain their
accounts in the Bank after the conversion. The liquida-
tion account is reduced annually to the extent that
Eligible Account Holders have reduced their Qualifying
Deposit. Subsequent increases do not restore an Eligible
Account Holder's interest in the liquidation account. In
the event of a complete liquidation, Eligible Account
Holders will be entitled to receive a distribution equal
to their proportionate balance of the liquidation account
to the extent funds are available.

Dividend restrictions

WEST NEWTON SAVINGS BANK AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (concluded)

The Bank may not declare or pay cash dividends on its
shares of common stock if the effect thereof would cause
its stockholders' equity to be reduced below applicable
capital maintenance requirements, or below the balance of
the liquidation account, or if such declaration and
payments would otherwise violate regulatory requirements.

Minimum regulatory requirements

Federal banking regulators require that the Bank meet
certain Tier 1 leverage capital and risk-based capital
ratio requirements. The Bank exceeded all minimum regu-
latory requirements at December 31, 1993 and 1992.

14. STOCK OPTION AND OWNERSHIP PLANS

The Bank has a Stock Incentive Plan for the benefit of
its Directors, officers and other employees and has
reserved 240,000 shares of common stock for issuance
pursuant to options granted under the plan. Both "Incen-
tive Stock Options" and "Non-Statutory Stock Options" may
be granted under the plan. Incentive stock options
granted under the plan will have an exercise price equal
to or in excess of the fair market value of a share of
common stock at the date the option is granted and will
have a maximum option term of five years. Non-statutory
stock options granted under the plan will have an exer-
cise price of not less than 50% of the market value of a
share of common stock at the date the option is granted
and will have a maximum option term of ten years.

Stock option activity for the years ended December 31,
1993 and 1992 is as follows:

Years Ended December 31,
1993 1992

Shares Under Option:
Outstanding at beginning of year 144,400 120,400
Expired and cancelled - (5,000)
Exercised (2,500) -
Granted - 29,000

Outstanding at end of year 141,900 144,400

Exercisable at end of year 85,400 60,400

Option Price Per Share $5.25 to $9.00

The Bank has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust
Agreement (ESOP) for eligible employees. Although the
Bank has no current plans to fund the ESOP, it may be
funded by Bank contributions made in cash (which will be
invested primarily in common stock) or common stock. 
Benefits may be paid in shares of common stock or in
cash, subject to the employees' right to demand shares.

STOCK OPTION AND OWNERSHIP PLANS (concluded)

15. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Bank provides basic and supplemental pension benefits
for eligible employees through the Savings Banks Employ-
ees Retirement Association Pension Plan ("SBERA"). Each
employee reaching the age of 21 and having completed at
least 1,000 hours of service in one consecutive twelve-
month period beginning with such employee's date of em-
ployment automatically becomes a participant in the
retirement plan. All participants are fully vested after
three years of such service.

Net periodic pension cost and pension expense consisted
of the following:

Years Ended December 31,
1993 1992 1991
(In Thousands)

Service cost-benefits earned
during year $247 $176 $137
Interest cost on projected
benefits 151 128 115

Net amortization and deferral (12) (12) (12)
Net loss 152 49 188

Total $274 $209 $154

According to the Association's actuary, a reconciliation
of the funded status of the plan is as follows for the
plan years ended October 31, 1993 and 1992:

1993 1992
(In Thousands)

Plan assets at fair value $2,096 $1,835
Projected benefit obligation 2,613 2,154

Excess of projected benefit obligation
over plan assets (517) (319)
Unamortized net obligation since 
adoption of SFAS No. 87 (200) (212)
Unrecognized net loss 240 327

Accrued pension liability $ (477) $ (204)

The accumulated benefit obligation (all vested) at Octo-
ber 31, 1993 amounted to $1,565,000 which was less than
the fair value of plan assets at that date.

For the plan years ended October 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991
actuarial assumptions include an assumed discount rate on
benefit obligations of 7%, 7% and 6.75%, respectively,
and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
of 7%, 6.75% and 7.75%, respectively. An annual salary
increase of 6% was utilized for these years.

WEST NEWTON SAVINGS BANK AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (concluded)

In addition, pension expense related to an unfunded
supplemental pension benefit granted to the Bank's Chief
Executive Officer amounted to approximately $10,000,
$9,000 and $8,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively.

16. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On March 7, 1994, the Bank and Shawmut National Corpora-
tion ("SNC") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merg-
er. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agree-
ment, each share of the Bank's issued and outstanding
common stock at the effective time of the Merger, other
than dissenting shares, shall be converted into the right
to receive $25.00 per share. The consideration per share
of common stock is subject to upward adjustment in cer-
tain circumstances if the acquisition is not completed by
September 30, 1994.

The completion of the Merger is subject to certain condi-
tions, including (a) approval by the stockholders of the
Bank, (b) approval of the Federal Reserve Board, the
Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and other requisite
federal and state regulatory authorities and (c) other
closing conditions customary in transactions of this
type.

Concurrently with the execution of and as a condition of,
and in consideration for SNC's entering into the Merger
Agreement, the Bank and SNC entered into a Stock Option
Agreement (the "Option Agreement"), dated as of March 7,
1994, providing, among other things, for the grant by the
Bank to SNC of an option (the "Option") to purchase up to
19.9% of the Bank's then outstanding common stock at
$21.00 per share, before giving effect to the exercise of
the Option. The Option is only exercisable upon the
occurrence of certain triggering events as specified in
the Option Agreement. Under certain circumstances, the
Bank would have a right of first refusal with respect to
any secondary sale, transfer or other disposition of
shares previously issued pursuant to the exercise of the
Option.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Concluded)

QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED) (concluded)

(1) The increase in the provision for loan losses
in the first quarter of 1992 was made primarily
to reflect increases in classified loans and
declining property values.

(2) The Bank recorded a loss on subleased property
in the first quarter of 1992 as a result of the
expiration of a tenant sublease, the
subtenant's notice of intent to vacate, and the
Bank's inability to find a new tenant.

(3) Fluctuations in the provision for income taxes
provided for each quarter are the result of the
estimated annual effective income tax rates
utilized for the periods.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT
OF INCOME
DECEMBER 31, 1993

The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Statement of Income gives effect to the proposed
mergers of Shawmut, Peoples, New Dartmouth and Gateway by
combining the results of operations of Shawmut for the
three years ended December 31, 1993 (pro forma including
Cohasset and West Newton for 1993, as if the proposed
acquisitions of Cohasset and West Newton had occurred on
January 1, 1993) with the results of operations of
Peoples, New Dartmouth and Gateway for the three years
ended December 31, 1993 on a pooling of interests basis,
assuming the proposed mergers had occurred as of December
31, 1993 (with the exception of New Dartmouth which is
presented for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992
and the period from October 10, 1991 (the date operations
commenced) through December 31, 1991). Income before
extraordinary credit and cumulative effect of accounting
changes per common share and weighted average common
shares outstanding are based on the exchange ratios as
specified in the respective merger agreements. The
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of
Income should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Combining Balance Sheet appearing
elsewhere in this Current Report on Form 8-K and the
historical financial statements and notes thereto of
Peoples, New Dartmouth, Gateway, Cohasset and West Newton
which are included in this Current Report on Form 8-K. 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of
Income is presented for informational purposes only and
is not necessarily indicative of the combined results of
operations that would have occurred if the proposed
mergers had been consummated on December 31, 1993 or at
the beginning of the periods indicated or which may be
obtained in the future.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

NOTE 1:

Certain reclassifications have been made to the
accounts of Peoples, New Dartmouth, Gateway, Cohasset and West
Newton in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combining Balance Sheet and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Statement of Income to conform to Shawmut presentation. 
Pro forma results of operations do not reflect nonrecurring items
of income and expense resulting directly from the proposed
mergers. In addition, the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Statement of Income does not reflect the
following: the cumulative effect of an accounting change due to
the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS)
No. 109 of $52,800,000 for Shawmut for the year ended December
31, 1993 and $1,544,000 for Peoples for the year ended December
31, 1992; the cumulative effect of an accounting change due to
the adaption of FAS No. 112 of $6,600,000 for Shawmut for the
year ended December 31, 1993; extraordinary credits from the
utilization of federal tax loss carry forwards of $18,378,000 for
Shawmut for the year ended December 31, 1992; extraordinary
charges relating to debt prepayment penalties of $371,000 and
$2,250,000 for Gateway for the year ended December 31, 1992 and
1991, respectively; and the extraordinary credit for a stock
distribution of $1,287,000 for Peoples for the year ended
December 31, 1991. Intercompany cash and due from bank balances
of $10,714,000 have been eliminated between Shawmut and Peoples.

NOTE 2:

PEOPLES

The pro forma shareholders' equity accounts of Shawmut
and Peoples have been adjusted in the accompanying Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combining Balance Sheet to reflect the issuance
of shares of Shawmut Common Stock in exchange for all of the
outstanding shares of Peoples Common Stock. The number of shares
of Shawmut Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the acquisition
of Peoples (in the range between 6,256,720 and 8,466,938 shares)
is based upon the number of shares of Peoples Common Stock
outstanding as of December 31, 1993 and the exchange ratios
specified in the Peoples merger agreement. The difference
between the par value of the Shawmut Common Stock to be issued
over the par value of the Peoples Common Stock outstanding
($271,000 to $249,000 at December 31, 1993) has been credited to
surplus.

PRO FORMA PENDING ACQUISITIONS

The pro forma shareholders' equity accounts of Shawmut,
as adjusted for Peoples, have been further adjusted to reflect
the issuance of shares of Shawmut Common Stock in exchange for
all of the outstanding shares of New Dartmouth Common Stock and
Gateway Common Stock (Pro Forma Pending Acquisitions). The
number of shares of Shawmut Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
the acquisition of New Dartmouth (in the range between 5,700,400
and 7,709,411 shares) is based upon the number of shares of New
Dartmouth Common Stock outstanding as of December 31, 1993 and
assumes an exchange ratio of 13.438 to 18.174 shares of Shawmut

Common Stock for each share of New Dartmouth Common Stock,
assuming consideration of $310.95 per share. The New Dartmouth
merger agreement provides for additional per share consideration
based on 177 percent of New Darmouth's earnings from October 1,
1993 to the closing date of the merger, subject to certain
potential adjustments. Any additional shares of Shawmut Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to the New Dartmouth transaction will
have a de minimis effect on the unaudited pro forma financial
information for all periods presented. The excess of the par
value of the Shawmut Common Stock to be issued over the par value
of the New Dartmouth Common Stock outstanding ($53,000 to $73,000
at December 31, 1993) has been charged to surplus. The equity
accounts of New Dartmouth reflect the expected retirement of
outstanding New Dartmouth Preferred Stock prior to consummation
of the New Dartmouth merger at the December 31, 1993 redemption
price of $104.58 per share ($17,786,000). The excess
($2,571,000) of redemption price over the stated value of New
Dartmouth Preferred Stock ($15,215,000) has been charged to
retained earnings.

The number of shares of Shawmut Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to the acquisition of Gateway (7,414,475 shares)
is based upon the number of shares of Gateway Common Stock
outstanding as of December 31, 1993 and the exchange ratio
specified in the Gateway merger agreement. The difference
between the par value of the Shawmut Common Stock to be issued
over the par value of the Gateway Common Stock outstanding
($64,000 at December 31, 1993) has been credited to surplus. The
equity accounts of Gateway reflect the retirement of Gateway
Treasury Stock ($2,976,000) upon consummation of the Gateway
merger with a charge to surplus.

The shareholders' equity accounts of Cohasset and West
Newton have been eliminated and reflect the acquisition of
Cohasset and West Newton by Shawmut for an aggregate purchase
price of $16,900,000 and $45,400,000, respectively. The excess
of the purchase price over the recorded shareholders' equity
accounts at December 31, 1993 has been reflected as goodwill
(other assets) in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combining Balance Sheet. No goodwill amortization has been
reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Statement of Income as the annual amount of amortization
is de minimis.

NOTE 3:

Pro forma earnings per share amounts in the
accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of
Income are based on the weighted average number of common shares
of the constituent companies outstanding during each period, as
adjusted for the minimum and maximum exchange ratios as specified
in the respective merger agreements.

PEOPLES

Shares of Peoples Common Stock have been adjusted to
the equivalent shares of Shawmut Common Stock for each period
assuming an exchange ratio of 1.874 to 2.536 shares of Shawmut
Common Stock for each share of Peoples Common Stock.

PRO FORMA PENDING ACQUISITIONS

Shares of New Dartmouth Common Stock have been adjusted
to the equivalent shares of Shawmut Common Stock for each period
assuming an exchange ratio of 13.438 to 18.174 shares of Shawmut
Common Stock for each share of New Dartmouth Common Stock,
assuming consideration of $310.95 per share (see Note 2 for
further discussion). Shares of Gateway Common Stock have been
adjusted to the equivalent shares of Shawmut Common Stock for
each period assuming an exchange ratio of 0.559 shares of Shawmut
Common Stock for each share of Gateway Common Stock.

NOTE 4:

The expenses associated with the proposed acquisitions
are not reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Statement of Income. These expenses are not
reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combining Balance Sheet as such expenses are not considered
material.

NOTE 5:

Retained earnings of Peoples includes approximately
$11,500,000 which is classified for federal income tax purposes
as a reserve for loan losses. Deferred income taxes were not
provided on such amounts because Peoples Bank, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Peoples, is a savings bank. Upon the merger of
Peoples Bank with and into Shawmut Bank, National Association, an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Shawmut, Peoples Bank will
lose its status as a savings bank and income taxes previously not
provided will become payable. An adjustment of $5,000,000 has
been reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combining Balance Sheet to reflect this, which represents taxes
payable at a combined federal and state tax rate of 43 percent. 
This adjustment is not reflected in the accompanying Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income.
