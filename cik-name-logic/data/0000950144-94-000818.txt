FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

THE ACTAVA GROUP REPORTS 1993 RESULTS AND ANNOUNCES
SUCCESSION PLAN AND SUSPENSION OF DIVIDEND

ATLANTA, GA (March 3, 1994) - The Actava Group Inc. (NYSE:ACT) today
reported a net loss of $47.6 million, or $2.77 per share, for the year ended
December 31, 1993, compared with a net profit of $11.6 million, or $.70 per
share, for 1992. Actava also announced that its Board of Directors has
suspended the dividend on its Common Stock as a result of the loss incurred in
1993 and has appointed a special committee of independent directors to conduct
a search for a new president to succeed Charles R. Scott, Actava's president
and chief executive officer.

Actava's sales for 1993 were $1.2 billion compared with 1992 sales of
$1.1 billion. The sales increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of
Diversified Products Corporation (DP(R)) in June 1993.

Scott said, "I am very disappointed with our 1993 results but believe
that the problems we have experienced have been properly addressed and that a
turn-around is in progress. For example, we have changed more than ten key
members of our senior management team in the past eight months. In addition,
we have outsourced several functions in a number of our companies in order to
improve operating results and reduce costs."

Frederick B. Beilstein, Actava's chief financial officer, said, "The
decision to suspend the dividend is designed to conserve cash and is based on
the philosophy of the Board of Directors that dividends should be paid from
current earnings rather than retained earnings."

The primary factors contributing to the 1993 loss, according to
Beilstein, were manufacturing problems experienced at the Company's Snapper
Division, a continuation of Snapper's program to reduce production and
shipments to distributors in order to balance production to estimated retail
sales, an increase in certain product-related expenses at Snapper, and
unanticipated operating problems at DP. In addition, Beilstein said Actava
wrote down the book value of its investment in Sienna Plantation, a real estate
venture south of Houston, Texas, and recorded additional reserves at its
photofinishing company in the fourth quarter to provide for the future costs
associated with additional plant and administrative consolidations.
<PAGE> 6
Fourth Quarter Results

Actava reported a fourth quarter net loss of $31.0 million or $1.76
per share compared with a net profit of $5.0 million or $.31 per share for the
same period of 1992. Sales for the fourth quarter were $319.5 million compared
to $276.6 million for the fourth quarter of 1992.

Subsidiary Developments

In announcing Actava's fourth quarter and 1993 results, Scott reviewed
developments at Actava's subsidiary companies. "On a positive note," Scott
said, "we are very pleased with the performance of two of our sporting goods
companies. Nelson/Weather-Rite, our camping and outdoor equipment company,
continued its growth as operating income in 1993 improved by 43 percent over
1992. In addition, the operating income at Hutch Sports USA grew 27 percent
during 1993." Hutch produces and sells sporting equipment under licensing
agreements from the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the
National Basketball Association, The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros., and
various colleges and universities.

Scott said Actava is disappointed with the results to date of its June
1993 acquisition of DP, but continues to believe that DP has tremendous
potential. Actava has made a number of management changes at DP, including the
appointment of James L. Marden as DP's president and chief executive officer.
Scott added, "We have a high confidence in DP's new management team and believe
that DP should show substantially improved results in 1994."

With respect to Snapper, Scott pointed out that Actava announced in
March 1993 that it had retained Merrill Lynch to assist in exploring
alternatives for realizing value from the Company's investment in Snapper.
Scott said these efforts have not been successful to date and have resulted in
a substantial distraction for Snapper's management, distributors and dealers.
As a result, Scott said Actava has suspended its efforts to find alternatives
for Snapper and has instructed Snapper's management to devote their full time
and attention to improving operating results. In August, Jerry J. Schweiner
was named president and chief executive officer of Snapper, and he has
subsequently recruited several new members to the senior management team.
Scott said Actava is pleased with the progress being made by Snapper's new
management team.

Actava's 1993 financial results include the results of Qualex Inc.,
the largest photofinisher in the United States. Actava owns 51 percent of the
voting stock of Qualex, and the remaining 49 percent is owned by Eastman Kodak
Company (NYSE:EK). The accounts of Qualex are consolidated with those of
Actava, and Kodak's interest in the earnings and equity of Qualex are reflected
as a minority interest. Scott said the revenues and operating income of Qualex
were basically flat in 1993 compared with 1992.

Management Succession

Scott, who celebrated his 65th birthday last year, said he has been
discussing the subject of management succession with Actava's Board of
Directors for several months. As a result of these discussions, the Board has
appointed a committee of independent directors to select a 
<PAGE> 7
successor to Scott and has named John Imlay, a director of Actava, to serve
as chairman of the committee. Scott said, "I fully support the decision to
begin a search for my successor and look forward to working closely with the
succession committee and with the individual ultimately elected by the Board to
succeed me as president."

The Actava Group provides high quality, brand-name consumer products
through distribution channels in the areas of sports, fitness and recreation.
Actava has five companies engaged in the leisure industry: DP(R) (fitness and
recreation equipment); Qualex (photofinishing); Hutch Sports USA (sporting
goods equipment); Nelson/Weather-Rite (camping and outdoor products); and
Willow Hosiery (athletic and family hosiery). Another member of the Actava
Group is Snapper, which manufacturers and markets premium quality lawn care and
garden products.
