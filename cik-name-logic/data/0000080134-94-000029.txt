PRESIDIO OIL COMPANY

ANNOUNCES

The Interest Rate on Presidio Oil Company's Senior Subordinated
Gas Indexed Notes due 1999 and the Senior Gas Indexed Notes due
2002 will be 13.300% for the period February 15, 1995 to May 14,
1995. The Gas Index Price for the determination period (the
Natural Gas Clearinghouse, Inc. average spot gas price for the 12
months ending December 1994) was $1.77. Since this price
exceeded the Base Price of Gas (defined as $1.75 in the Note
Indenture), an Additional Interest Rate of 0.050% (.025% for
every $.01 the Gas Index Price exceeds the Base Price of Gas)
will be added to the base rate of 13.25% for this interest period
only.
