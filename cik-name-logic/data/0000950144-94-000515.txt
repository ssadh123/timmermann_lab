(a) The Corporation had previously acquired 17.93% of the common stock of
BOET ($3.4 million), and on January 1, 1993 purchased an additional
43.93% of the common stock of BOET in exchange for 331,741 shares of
the Corporation's Series E Preferred Stock ($11.1 million). Effective
May 3, 1993, the Corporation acquired the remaining outstanding common
stock of BOET for 317,045 shares of the Corporation's Series E
Preferred Stock ($10.8 million).

(b) The Corporation acquired Maryville, a mutual savings bank, which
pursuant to a conversion/acquisition converted to a federal stock
charter, all of the stock of which was acquired by the Corporation in
exchange for a capital contribution equalling approximately $14.1
million derived in part from the proceeds of an offering of the
Corporation's Common Stock made in connection with the
conversion/acquisition.

(c) The recording of the acquisition of Maryville using the purchase
method of accounting resulted in negative goodwill of approximately
$9.4 million, $8.1 million of which was deducted from noncurrent,
nonmonetary assets (premises and equipment, fair value adjustment of
loans, prepaid software and mortgage servicing rights). The remaining
negative goodwill of $1.3 million was recorded in other liabilities
and is being amortized over 7 years.
