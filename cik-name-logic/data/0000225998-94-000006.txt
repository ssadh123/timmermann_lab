Item 5. Other Events

On April 7, 1994, Washington Energy Company made the following press release:

UTILITY REGULATORY STAFF RECOMMENDS $19 MILLION INCREASE FOR WNG

SEATTLE -- The staff of the Washington Utilities and Transportation
Commission (WUTC) has recommended a $19 million increase, or 4.9 percent, in
annual revenues for Washington Natural Gas, the gas utility subsidiary of
Washington Energy Company (NYSE:WEG). If the staff's recommendation is
adopted by the WUTC, the average residential bill would increase by approxi-

mately $2.42 a month. 

The filing made yesterday (April 6), is a recommendation by the staff of
the WUTC. The WUTC's three commissioners now have until October 19, 1994, to
issue a final decision on the utility's rate increase request. 

The WUTC staff proposal is in response to the November 1993 request
filed by Washington Natural Gas for a rate increase of $24.6 million, or 6.4
percent, in annual revenues.

The gas utility's filing seeks to update its rates to cover costs
related to increased customer usage and improvements to its distribution
system, as well as increases in operating costs since the 1991 test year on
which current rates are based. The test year for this current filing covers a
12-month period ending September 30, 1993. 

Neither the staff's nor the company's filings request a 
change to Washington Natural Gas' currently authorized 9.15 percent overall
rate of return or its 10.5 percent return on common equity.

Washington Natural Gas, serving more than 440,000 customers in the Puget
Sound region of Washington state, is the largest gas utility in the Pacific
Northwest.
