[LOGO OF WORTHEN BANKING CORPORATION]

LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS (June 9, 1994) -- Curt Bradbury, chairman and CEO of
Worthen Banking Corporation (WBC), announced today that Jim G. Farmer has joined
the executive management team of Worthen Banking Corporation as president and
chief operating officer.

"In his new role with Worthen Banking Corporation, Farmer will bring his
experience as a successful executive and banker to help lead the WBC executive
management team in continuing cost control initiatives and focusing on enhanced
revenue generation for our company," Bradbury said. "It will be his challenge
to continue management's efforts to establish a high efficiency banking culture
in our organization that will further equip Worthen to offer its customers
superior service and products essential to today's competitive banking
environment."

Farmer, 45, is an Arkansan and graduate of the University of Arkansas at
Fayetteville. Following his graduation from the U of A, he moved to St. Louis
where he was president and CEO of two private sector St. Louis-based companies,
and served as the executive vice president for Mark Twain Bancshares, a $2.5
billion banking organization.

"Jim has a proven record of performance in the successful management of a
number of companies, including a major banking organization," Bradbury said.
"He brings to our organization broad business perspectives and operating
successes that will be invaluable to Worthen as we face continuing challenges of
profitability and

growth that are common in banking. We feel that bankers have much to learn
from other industries. Because of his broad business experience, he will be
capable of bringing a non-traditional approach to our most critical operating
issues."

Bradbury said that after several meetings with Farmer, it became apparent
that Farmer's business philosophy and record of performance meshed well with
that of the existing WBC team. The hiring of Farmer completes the senior
management team of Andrew T. Melton, executive vice president, treasurer and
chief financial officer and Jim Patridge, executive vice president and senior
credit officer.

While with Mark Twain Bancshares, Farmer was a member of the company
executive committee and his duties included the supervision of credit quality
and loan workout strategies, expense control and revenue generation in non-bank
lines of business such as brokerage, mortgage and trust. Farmer's efforts,
along with those of the executive management team, resulted in Mark Twain's
rapid growth and superior financial performance. Most recently, as the largest
shareholder, president and CEO of Delmar Gardens Enterprises, a skilled nursing
home and congregate care company with operations in five states, Farmer
successfully led Delmar's restructuring and turnaround efforts. These efforts
have been characterized by those knowledgeable with Delmar as nothing short of
spectacular. He sold his interest in Delmar in late 1993.

Farmer's background also includes a 13-year tenure as president and CEO of
Pelham Holding Corporation, an investment company which has held interests in a
variety of industries including banking, oil and gas, real estate development
and insurance brokerage.

"I'm very happy to have the opportunity to return home to Arkansas and work
with so many old friends in such a wonderful company as Worthen," Farmer said.
"Curt and his team have established a fine reputation in the banking industry
and I look forward to being part of the team which takes Worthen to the next
level of high performance."
