HALLIBURTON AND McDERMOTT DISCUSS
SCOTTISH JOINT VENTURE

DALLAS, Texas -- Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) and
McDermott International, Inc. (NYSE: MDR) announced today that
their Brown & Root Energy Services and McDermott Scotland Ltd.
business units have commenced discussions to form a 50/50 joint
venture company to operate their North Sea fabrication yards in
the Highland Region of Scotland. The proposal is that Brown &
Root Highlands Fabricators' yard at Nigg and McDermott Scotland
Ltd.'s yard at Ardersier will merge to create one of the United
Kingdom's largest fabricators for the offshore oil and gas
industry.

The parties have entered into the discussions in order to
realign and strengthen their businesses, and to accommodate
fundamental changes in the marine construction market. The new
company will create economies of scale in an industry segment in
need of rationalization, as well as creating the only company
capable of providing a fully integrated range of construction
services for the North Sea.

Following satisfactory completion of the due diligence
reviews by both partners, and discussions with interested
parties, it is expected that the joint
venture will start operations on January 1, 1995. A new
management team will be appointed from within the joint venture
partners.

<PAGE> 6

Approximately 950 people are employed at Nigg, and 400 at
Ardersier on current projects. While the joint venture company
will be taking the opportunity to review its overheads and
possible duplication of roles, it is anticipated that the two
yards will become even more competitive and that this will lead
to increased business and job opportunities in the future.

McDermott Scotland Ltd. is a subsidiary of McDermott
International Inc. which is a leading worldwide energy services
company. The company and its subsidiaries manufacture steam-
generating equipment, environmental equipment, and government and
aerospace products. They also provide engineering and
construction services for industrial and utility facilities
onshore, and to the oil and gas industry offshore.

Root Inc., a business unit of Halliburton Company. Halliburton
Company is one of the world's largest diversified energy
services, engineering, maintenance, and construction companies.
Founded in 1919, Halliburton provides a broad range of energy
