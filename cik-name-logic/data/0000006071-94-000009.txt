ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

On April 5, 1994 Ames Department Stores, Inc. ("Ames" or the 
"Company") publicly released its audited results of operations and 
balance sheet for the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994 ("fiscal 
1994"). Beginning on April 6, 1994, Ames will distribute, to certain 
of its banks, potential lenders, principal trade vendors and factors, 
summaries of its financial results for the four (unaudited) and 
fifty-two weeks ended January 29, 1994 and for the four weeks ended 
February 26, 1994 (unaudited). These monthly and year-to-date 
results (collectively, the "monthly results") are attached hereto as 
Exhibits 20-A and 20-B and are incorporated by reference herein. The 
balance sheets as of January 29, 1994 and February 26, 1994 are 
subject to possible debt reclassifications depending upon the status 
of the Company's negotiations for new long-term financing prior to 
the filing of its Form 10-K for fiscal 1994.

Compared with the projections contained in the Form 8-K dated April 
5, 1993 (referred to herein as the "FY 94 Plan"), sales for the four 
weeks ended January 29, 1994 were $18.1 million below FY 94 Plan and 
EBITDA was $.5 million better than FY 94 Plan. EBITDA is defined as 
earnings (loss) before interest, income taxes, LIFO expense or 
credit, restructuring charges, bankruptcy expenses, depreciation and 
amortization, and any non-cash extraordinary or unusual items. In 
January, the major component of the sales shortfall was in softline 
categories. January's sales were significantly impacted by severe 
winter weather. The unfavorable impact from the lower-than-planned 
sales on January's EBITDA was more than offset by a higher-than- 
planned gross margin rate and lower-than-planned expenses. The gross 
margin rate was above FY 94 Plan in January due primarily to lower- 
than-planned clearance markdowns. In addition, in January, 
advertising and store operating expenses were below FY 94 Plan. 

Sales for the fifty-two weeks ended January 29, 1994 were $157.5 
million below FY 94 Plan; however, EBITDA was $.5 million above FY 94 
Plan. The fiscal 1994 sales shortfall against FY 94 Plan was 
primarily due to the Company's de-emphasis of lower-margin hardline 
categories, a weak apparel market and harsh winter weather during the 
first and fourth quarters of the year. The unfavorable impact from 
the sales shortfall on fiscal 1994's EBITDA was offset by lower-than- 
planned expenses and a higher-than-planned gross margin rate 
resulting primarily from the Company's emphasis on higher-margin 
products in its merchandise mix and in its advertising and more 
stringent inventory (and other operating) controls, which resulted 
in, among other things, improved shrink results and lower clearance 
markdowns compared to FY 94 Plan.

As a consequence of the adoption of fresh-start reporting (see below) 
and Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income 
Taxes," the Company recorded a non-cash income tax provision of $3.3 
million for fiscal 1994 with an associated increase of $3.3 million 
in additional paid-in capital. Ames currently expects to report the 
tax benefits realized for tax purposes for cummulative temporary 
differences, as well as for the net operating loss carryovers, as an 

Page 2 of 11

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
addition to paid-in capital rather than as a reduction in the tax 
provision in future statements of operations. As a result, the 
Company now currently anticipates that, assuming profitability, there 
will be a tax provision for the fiscal year ending January 28, 1995 
("fiscal 1995") at an effective rate similar to fiscal 1994. 
However, the tax provision has no impact on the Company's EBITDA, 
taxes payable, or cash flows. As a result of its significant carry- 
forward tax benefits, Ames does not anticipate having to pay income 
taxes for an extended period.

As of January 29, 1994, inventories were $4.7 million above FY 94 
Plan due primarily to a planned LIFO reserve of $3.0 million that was 
not needed. Trade payables were $14.3 million below FY 94 Plan due 
primarily to the timing of trade payments. Outstanding
borrowings under the Company's revolving line of credit 
as of January 29, 1994 were $15.4 million above FY 94 Plan due, in 
part, to earlier-than-planned funding of standby letters of credit 
and the timing of trade payments. The Company's cash balance at 
January 29, 1994 was $19.3 million below FY 94 Plan due, in part, to 
lower-than-planned total outstanding letters of credit (that must be 
cash collateralized) and the timing of trade payments.

The Company met its consecutive 30-day "clean-up" requirement in 
January and is in compliance with all debt covenants through fiscal 
February.

As previously reported, on January 28, 1994, there was a partial roof 
collapse at the Company's distribution center in Leesport, PA. The 
collapse involved approximately 10,000 square feet of the total 1.2 
million square feet in the facility. Subsequent to that date, there 
were three additional partial collapses totalling approximately 
30,000 square feet. The Leesport facility was closed for several 
weeks. However, since March 24, 1994, the Company has been able to 
access the inventory at Leesport. Repair work has begun and the 
facility is currently expected to be partially operational by June 
1994 and fully operational by October 1994. The Company obtained 
temporary warehouse space within a short distance from Leesport and 
has also been operating additional shifts at its other distribution 
centers in Mansfield and Clinton, MA. The Company believes that 
these steps will continue to provide an adequate supply of 
merchandise to its stores in the immediately foreseeable future. In 
addition, the Company expects to be reimbursed for its property 
damages and for a substantial portion of any incremental expenses it 
may incur in connection with this incident. At the present time, the 
Company believes that the net financial effect from the Leesport 
situation will not have a material impact on the Company's financial 
position or results of operations.

Compared with the projections contained in the Form 8-K dated 
February 17, 1994 (referred to herein as the "FY 95 Plan"), sales for 
the four weeks ended February 26, 1994 were $3.6 million below FY 95 
Plan; however, EBITDA was $1.8 million better than FY 95 Plan. In 
February, the sales shortfall was entirely in hardlines. February 
sales were affected by the persistently harsh winter weather and the

Page 3 of 11
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Leesport closing. The unfavorable impact from the lower-than-planned 
sales on February's EBITDA was more than offset by lower-than-planned 
expenses and the gain on sale of a store lease. Store operating, 
field and home office expenses were all below FY 95 Plan in February.

As of February 26, 1994, inventories were $24.0 million below FY 95 
Plan, principally in softline categories, due, in part, to a 
temporary delay in the volume of shipments received as a result of 
the Leesport closing. Trade payables were $33.3 million above FY 95 
Plan due primarily to the timing of payments. Outstanding borrowing 
under the Company's revolving line of credit were $61.5 million below 
FY 95 Plan as of February 26, 1994 due, in part, to the above 
factors. The Company's unrestricted cash balance at February 26, 
1994 was $3.8 million below FY 95 Plan due, in part, to the fact that 
the beginning balance was less than projected in the FY 95 Plan.

Ames is distributing the monthly results to its banks, potential 
lenders, principal trade vendors and factors to facilitate their 
credit analysis following the Company's emergence from bankruptcy. 
The summary results SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE 
and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K for 
the fiscal year ended January 30, 1993 ("fiscal 1993"), the Company's 
most recent Form 10-Q for the third fiscal quarter ended October 30, 
1993, the Company's Form 10-K to be filed for the fiscal year ended 
January 29, 1994, the Company's Form 8-K dated April 5, 1993, and the 
Company's Form 8-K dated February 17, 1994. The monthly results are 
being reported publicly solely because they are being distributed to 
a large number of the Company's vendors for purposes of their credit 
analyses.

In accordance with the guidelines provided by the American Institute 
of Certified Public Accountants in Statement of Position 90-7 
"Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the 
Bankruptcy Code," the Company adopted fresh-start reporting at 
December 26, 1992, the effective date of the Chapter 11 plan of 
reorganization for accounting purposes. Under fresh-start reporting, 
the reorganization value of the Company upon its emergence from 
Chapter 11 was allocated to its net assets on the basis of the 
purchase method of accounting at December 26, 1992. Accordingly, 
results for the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994, except for 
January's monthly results, are not comparable in certain material 
respects to such results for fiscal 1993. Management believes that 
the presentation of EBITDA results in a more meaningful comparison 
with fiscal 1993 due to the impact of fresh-start reporting on 
depreciation, amortization and LIFO inventory.

During the pendency of its reorganization case, Ames disclosed 
publicly its monthly results through filings with the Office of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee. Although Ames expects to continue to make 
its monthly results public for fiscal 1995, Ames does not believe it 
is obligated to provide such information indefinitely, other than as 
required by applicable regulations, and Ames may cease making such 

Page 4 of 11

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
disclosures and updates at any time. The monthly results were not 
examined, reviewed or compiled by Ames' independent certified 
accountants. Moreover, Ames does not believe that it is obligated to 
update the monthly results to reflect subsequent events or 
developments. The reported monthly results for February are subject 
to future adjustments, if any, that could materially affect such 
results. However, in the opinion of the Company, the monthly results 
contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments 
for February) necessary for a fair statement of the results for the 
periods presented.
