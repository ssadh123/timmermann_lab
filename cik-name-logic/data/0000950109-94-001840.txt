Exhibit 99

SCOTT PAPER TO SELL S.D. WARREN FOR $1.6 BILLION

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., October 10, 1994 -- Scott Paper Company announced today that 
it has signed an agreement of sale with a global investment group for S.D. 
Warren, Scott's printing and publishing papers subsidiary, for $1.6 billion, 
subject to certain adjustments. The transaction is expected to close by 
mid-December once certain conditions are met.

The investment group is headed by Sappi, Ltd., South Africa's leading paper and 
forest products company. The group also includes DLJ Merchant Banking Partners, 
L.P. and its affiliated funds as well as UBS Capital Corporation, the U.S. 
private investment arm of the Union Bank of Switzerland.

This announcement marks the completion of three of four key initiatives 
established by Albert J. Dunlap, Scott's chairman and chief executive officer, 
to revitalize Scott.

"I congratulate Sappi for taking advantage of this unique opportunity to 
strengthen their business with the addition of the world's leading producer of 
high quality, coated free papers," Dunlap said. "S.D. Warren is a great 
business, and I believe it will only benefit from the alliance."

Eugene van As, chairman and chief executive officer of Sappi, described the 
acquisition of S.D. Warren as a perfect strategic fit. "This is a once in a 
lifetime opportunity for us. It is the key step for Sappi in becoming the global
leader in the fastest-growing segment of the paper industry -- coated free 
paper," Mr. van As said.

Dunlap described the sale as a major milestone in Scott's 115-year history and 
a key initiative in transitioning the company from a paper company to a 
fast-moving, consumer products company.

The proceeds from the sale will be redeployed to strengthen Scott's financial 
position by repaying debt and to support key strategies to grow and improve 
Scott's global tissue business. Other uses for the proceeds, including the 
repurchasing of Scott stock, are also under consideration, according to Dunlap.

"Our sole criterion for these decisions continues to be directed at our number 
one priority: increasing shareholder value," said Dunlap. "We have, in only six 
months, essentially completed the first three parts of a four-part program for 
Scott that was announced earlier this year at our annual meeting."

During that time, Scott has implemented a major one-time restructuring and put 
in place a new management reporting structure and experienced management team.

"We are currently making excellent progress on the fourth and most important 
part of the program--developing new and improved strategies for our core 
tissue business," said Dunlap. "Our recently announced joint venture in China 
and the ground breaking for a new converting site in Arizona are the first steps
along the path to make Scott a sharply focused, low-cost competitor."

"I am more optimistic than ever about Scott's future," Dunlap said.
