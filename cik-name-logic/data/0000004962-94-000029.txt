Item 5. Other Events

On October 24, 1994, American Express Company issued the following
press release:

NEW YORK, October 24, 1994 - American Express Company today reported

third quarter net income of $369 million ($0.71 per share), up 18 percent

from a year ago when income from continuing operations totaled $313 million

($0.61 per share).

Travel Related Services (TRS) reported third quarter net income of $264

million, a 13 percent increase over last year's net income of $234 million.

Net revenues increased 9 percent reflecting an increase in worldwide

billed business and growth in business travel sales. The increase in

billed business resulted from higher spending per Cardmember and an

increase in the number of Cards outstanding.

Total expenses increased 8 percent, reflecting business travel

acquisitions and growth, as well as investments in certain business

initiatives. Marketing and promotion expenses for the full year are

expected to be approximately the same as a year ago.

IDS Financial Services (IDS) reported third quarter net income of $114

million, a 19 percent increase over last year's net income of $96 million.

Revenue and earnings growth benefited from an increase in fees related

to higher levels of assets under management, as well as an increase in life

insurance in force. These benefits were partially offset by lower

investment margins.

IDS reported increased sales of annuities and investment certificates,

while sales of mutual funds and life and other insurance products decreased

slightly from last year.

<PAGE>
American Express Bank (AEB) reported third quarter net income of $20

million, compared with last year's net income of $29 million.

Last year's results included a $5 million benefit from the change in

the U.S. federal income tax rate.

Results for the third quarter reflect lower revenues and higher

operating expenses, primarily reflecting spending related to systems

technology. This decline in results was partially offset by a reduction in

the provision for credit losses.

Corporate and Other reported third quarter net expenses of $29 million,

compared with net expenses of $46 million last year.

Corporate expenses for 1993 included a $5 million expense from the

change in the U.S. federal income tax rate.

American Express Company is a diversified travel and financial services

company founded in 1850. It is a world leader in charge and credit cards,

Travelers Cheques, travel, financial planning, investment products,

insurance and international banking.
