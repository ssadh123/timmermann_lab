Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

As of June 17, 1994, Flagstar Corporation ("Flagstar")
closed the sale of its Food and Vending operation as conducted
through its Canteen Corporation subsidiary. The buyer in the
transaction was a subsidiary of Compass Group PLC, a London-based
food service company. The sale, effected in the form of a sale
of the stock of IM Vending, Inc., an indirect subsidiary of
Flagstar and the parent company of Canteen Corporation, was for a
cash purchase price paid at closing of $450 million, subject to
post-closing adjustment under certain circumstances. Such
purchase price was the result of arm's-length negotiations
between the parties. A copy of the press release issued on the
closing date is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Under the terms of certain public indentures governing
Flagstar's public debt, Net Proceeds (as defined therein) of the
sale must be applied within one year from the closing date to one
or more of the following in such combination as Flagstar may
choose: (i) an investment in other food service businesses or
assets related thereto, (ii) an offer, in accordance with
applicable law, to repurchase such public debt at a price not
less than 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, or (iii) the purchase, redemption or
other prepayment or repayment of outstanding Senior Indebtedness
(as defined in such indentures).

For certain pro forma financial information concerning the

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The unaudited pro forma condensed statements of consolidated
operations on the following pages are based upon the historical
results of operations of the Company for the year ended December
31, 1993 and the three month period ended March 31, 1994. The
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheets for
March 31, 1994 presented below are based upon the historical
balance sheet as of March 31, 1994 and include pro forma
adjustments as if the sale of Canteen's food and vending
subsidiary had occurred on that date. The reclassifications
made to the historical results of operations give effect to the
reporting of Canteen's food and vending and recreational
services subsidiaries as discontinued operations for the year
ended December 31, 1993 and the pro forma adjustments thereto
give effect to the sale of Canteen's food and vending subsidiary
as if such sale had occurred on January 1, 1993. The pro forma
condensed consolidated balance sheets and pro forma condensed
statements of consolidated operations were derived by adjusting
the historical financial statements of the Company for certain
pro forma transactions as described in the respective notes
thereto. Since Flagstar is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Flagstar
Companies, Inc., per share data is not meaningful and has been
omitted for the periods presented.
