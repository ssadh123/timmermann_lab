FOR RELEASE:
May 16, 1994

FORMER INTERIOR SECRETARY WILLIAM P. CLARK ELECTED TO MORRISON
KNUDSEN BOARD OF DIRECTORS

BOISE - William P. Clark, former Secretary of Interior,
advisor to President Ronald Reagan for national security affairs
and Justice of the California Supreme Court, has been elected to
the board of directors of Morrison Knudsen Corporation.

Clark presently is chief executive officer of Paso Robles,
California-based Clark Companies and has practiced international
law for the past nine years.

"William Clark's record of public service during the past 30
years is one of the most distinguished in our country," said
William J. Agee, MK chairman, president and chief executive
officer. "He is highly experienced in international affairs and
his advice and counsel will be invaluable as MK continues its
expansion around the globe."

Clark first entered public service in 1967 in California as
cabinet secretary to then Governor Ronald Reagan. He also served
as the governor's executive secretary and chief of staff. He
later served as a judge of the California Superior Court,
associate justice of the California Court of appeals and in 1973
was named by Governor Reagan to the California Supreme Court.

In addition to his terms as President Reagan's Secretary of
Interior and assistant for National Security Affairs, Clark
served as Deputy Secretary of the State Department. In 1985 he
ended 18 years of full-time public service and was named by
President Reagan as chairman of the Task Group on Nuclear Weapons
Program Management; to the Commission on Defense Management
(Packard Commission); and a member of the Defense Department's
Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy.

He also was appointed a trustee of the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Foundation and Library. Clark attended Stanford
University and Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

Clark was elected to an MK class of directors that will
stand for re-election in 1996.

Morrison Knudsen Corporation (MRN-NYSE) serves the world's
construction, transportation, environmental, industrial, and
power markets as an engineer, contractor and manufacturer,
offering complete development, operations and financial
services.
