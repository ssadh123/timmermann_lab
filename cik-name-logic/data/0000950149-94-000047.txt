(a) Based on a 10% discount factor on the estimated present value of future
operating lease payments.

(b) Safeway's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the 52 weeks ended
January 1, 1994, was adversely affected by a $54.9 million charge to
operating and administrative expense for severance payments to be made to
retail employees in the Alberta, Canada division as part of a voluntary
employee buyout. Excluding this charge the ratio of earnings to fixed
charges for 1993 would have been 1.66.

(c) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 1991 was adversely affected
because 1991 earnings included a charge to operating profit of $115
million in connection with the bankruptcy of AppleTree Markets, Inc.
("AppleTree"). The $115 million charge was an estimate of the eventual
net lease and related cash payments which Safeway expected to make over a
period of up to 16 years in connection with any liability Safeway may have
on the leases assigned to AppleTree as part of the sale of the Company's
former Houston division. Excluding this charge, the ratio of earnings to
fixed charges for 1991 would have been 1.44.
