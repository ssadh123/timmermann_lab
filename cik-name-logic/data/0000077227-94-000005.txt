ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On February 14, 1994, General Public Utilities Corpora-

tion ("GPU") announced plans to realign its corporate structure

in response to increasing competition in the electric utility

industry.

The corporate realignment program will involve the

formation of a new subsidiary, GPU Generation Corporation, which

will operate and maintain the fossil-fuel and hydroelectric

generating facilities owned and/or operated by GPU's electric

operating subsidiaries, Jersey Central Power & Light Company,

Metropolitan Edison Company ("Met-Ed") and Pennsylvania Electric

Company ("Penelec"). GPU Generation would also construct the new

generation facilities needed by these subsidiaries in the future.

GPU will continue its involvement in the independent power

generation market through its Energy Initiatives subsidiary. The

second element of the realignment program will combine the

remaining functions of GPU's Pennsylvania electric Subsidiaries,

Met-Ed and Penelec. The combined operation would be accom-

plished without a merger of the corporate entities. GPU will

also review other areas of its business, including the System's

workforce and the role of GPU Service Corporation, as part of the

realignment program.

The program, which in certain respects, is subject to

various regulatory reviews and approvals is, together with other

cost reduction initiatives, expected to result in annual cost

reduction savings of approximately $80 million by the end of

1996.

GPU ANNOUNCES CORPORATE REALIGNMENT

Parsippany, N.J., February 14, 1994 -- General Public

Utilities Corporation (NYSE:GPU) today announced plans to realign

its corporate structure to position the corporation for the

increasing level of competition in the electric utility industry.

James R. Leva, GPU chairman, president and chief executive

officer, said that the program being announced today and other

cost reduction initiatives are expected to result in annual cost

savings of some $80 million by the end of 1996.

"As the new competitive structure of our industry unfolds,

further actions may well be necessary. We will focus sharply on

our core business: the generation, transmission and distribution

of electric energy, and renew our emphasis on customer service.

"At the heart of our program are three key strategies," Leva

stated. "First, we will substantially improve our competitive

outlook by the end of 1996 under the industry structure we

foresee. We will also substantially increase our effectiveness

through performance improvements and cost reductions, without

adversely affecting service quality, to position GPU as an

industry leader. "Finally, we will work to create a regulatory

climate that is fair to both our customers and our shareholders,"

Leva said.

To achieve its goals, GPU will form a new subsidiary, GPU

Generation Corporation, which will operate and maintain the

fossil-fueled and hydroelectric generating stations owned and/or

operated by the GPU companies. GPU Generation will also build

new generating facilities as needed in the future. The ownership

of the generating plants will remain with Metropolitan Edison

(Met-Ed), Pennsylvania Electric (Penelec) and Jersey Central

Power and Light (Jersey Central).

"The goal of GPU Generation will be to provide low-cost

energy that will be priced to compete effectively in the changing

generation marketplace," Leva said.

The new subsidiary will be headquartered in Johnstown, Pa.,

and be headed by Robert L. Wise, now president of Penelec.

GPU will continue its involvement in the independent power

generation market through its subsidiary, Energy Initiatives.

The second element of the GPU realignment program will be

the combination of the remaining functions of Met-Ed and

Penelec.

"Focusing on the customer will be a top priority in the new

competitive world. Customers will be looking for lower costs and

services that are attuned to their needs," said Leva.

The combined operation, which will be accomplished without a

merger of the two corporate entities, will be based in Reading,

Pa., and be headed by Fred D. Hafer, who is now president of Met-

Ed.

Some of these actions will be subject to various regulatory

reviews and approvals.

The third component of GPU's program will be a performance

improvement initiative that will enhance productivity and

effectiveness and focus on cost reduction. Included in this

effort will be a search for parallel opportunities at GPU Nuclear

Corporation and Jersey Central.

"In a competitive marketplace, we must always look for ways

to reduce our costs and improve our performance. This part of

our program will enable us to do that," Leva stated.

Related to the performance improvement effort is the fourth

element of GPU's program, a review of the corporation's "people

needs" in terms of the size, skills and compensation of GPU's

workforce.

"Staffing levels will be based on the needs of the new

organization. I am certain that the employee population will be

lower," said Leva.

The fifth part of the GPU program will be an examination of

the role of GPU Service Corporation, GPU's corporate service

unit. GPU Service currently provides several corporate

administrative and support functions to the GPU System.

"We'll be looking at all services, and deciding which could

best be provided at the local level, and which through greater

consolidation," Leva said.

"This program is a necessary step in changing the direction

and culture at GPU. Our immediate challenge will be to implement

these changes quickly and effectively. At the same time, we will

develop additional long-term strategies for our organization that

will enable us to capitalize on opportunities to expand as the

competitive markets present them to us," Leva stated.
