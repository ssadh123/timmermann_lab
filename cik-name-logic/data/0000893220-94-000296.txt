FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE June 21, 1994

FERC AUTHORIZES COLUMBIA GAS UNIT
TO RECOVER $20 MILLION IN GAS COSTS

CHARLESTON, W.VA. -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
has approved an order that permits Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., a unit of
The Columbia Gas System, Inc. (NYSE:CG), to recover from its sales customers
approximately $20 million in carrying charges related to gas exchange activity.

The FERC disallowed the collection of these carrying charges
when it approved Columbia Transmission's 1993 annual purchase gas adjustment
filing earlier this year. The company sought rehearing and, upon
consideration, the FERC agreed that the adjustment was legitimate and
authorized its collection. The adjustment relates to the period April 1985
through December 1991.

Under FERC procedures, requests for reconsideration of the
order may be filed.

The Columbia Gas System, Inc., and its principal pipeline
subsidiary, Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., have been operating as
debtors-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code since
July 31, 1991.
