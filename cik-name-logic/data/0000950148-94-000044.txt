THE FOOTHILL GROUP, INC. REPORTS

1993 FOURTH QUARTER AND RECORD YEAR END RESULTS

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, January 31, 1994 . . . The Foothill
Group, Inc. (NYSE-FGI) today reported a 72% increase in income from
continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 to a record
$20,823,000, or $1.20 per fully diluted share, compared with income from
continuing operations of $12,134,000, or 81 cents per fully diluted share,
for the year ended December 31, 1992. Foothill reported income from
continuing operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 1993 of
$5,329,000, or 30 cents per fully diluted share, compared with income from
continuing operations of $2,892,000, or 17 cents per fully diluted share, for
the 1992 fourth quarter. Previously reported financial information has
undergone certain reclassifications due to the spin-off of Foothill Thrift
and Loan to Foothill Group shareholders on December 23, 1993. All results of
Foothill Thrift and Loan through the record date for the spin-off are
classified as discontinued operations. Net income for 1993 totaled
$18,683,000 or $1.08 per fully diluted share as compared to $12,145,000 or 82
cents per fully diluted share for 1992.

Henry K. Jordan, Chief Financial Officer, said, "The
Company's return on average assets and average equity from continuing
operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 totaled 4.13% and 17.16%,
respectively, as compared to 2.80% and 13.78% for the year ended December 31,
1992. Fourth quarter income from continuing operations in 1993 exceeded 
the 1992 fourth quarter due to improvements in interest margins, growth of 
the asset-based loan portfolio and strong results from money management
activities. Interest margin, as a percent of average assets of continuing

<PAGE> 4

operations, grew to 6.96% for the 1993 fourth quarter, up from 5.92% for the
year ended December 31, 1992. Asset based loans reached $514,518,000 as of
December 31, 1993, up 30% from $394,895,000 as of December 31, 1992.

"The Company reported $4,334,000 in gains from sales of bank
loans during the 1993 fourth quarter versus $837,000 in the fourth quarter of
1992. Gain on investments, which include profits from managed partnerships,
were $79,000 in the 1993 fourth quarter versus $755,000 in the fourth quarter
of 1992. The Company's level of nonperforming finance receivables and
repossessed assets totaled $16,296,000, or 3.17% of finance receivables and
repossessed assets as of December 31, 1993, as compared to the $22,057,000 or
5.71% of finance receivables and repossessed assets as of December 31, 1992.

"We anticipate loan growth and profits from asset-based
lending activities at Foothill Capital Corporation in 1994 will remain
strong. We expect gains from the sale of bank loans and profits from managed
partnerships to be reported sporadically during 1994, as was the case during
1993. The Company anticipates 1994 earnings will be in excess of those
reported for 1993, but not on a consistent quarterly basis. Also, the
previously announced potential sale of the Company's holdings of equity and
debt securities of G. Heilman Brewing Company was completed on January 24,
1994. The Company's pretax gains from sales of these positions in G. Heilman
are in excess of $10 million and will be reflected in earnings in the first
quarter of 1994.

"Equity and purchased bank debt positions owned by the
Company have unrealized gains totaling $37,805,000 as of December 31, 1993,
up significantly from $13,743,000 as of December 31, 1992. In addition,
investments of Foothill's managed partnerships show substantial unrealized
gains which, if realized, will contribute to future earnings. Effective
December 31, 1993, the Company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, which governs accounting for certain investments in debt
and equity securities. Under this Statement, unrealized gains, net of income
taxes, on the Company's equity and purchased bank debt positions are shown on
the attached balance sheet as a component of stockholders' equity and are
included in the carrying value of these investments.

"Book value per common share was $9.02 as of December 31, 1993, up
from $7.78 as of December 31, 1992. Total stockholders' equity increased 18%
in 1993 to a record $152 million."

The Foothill Group, Inc. is a financial services company engaged in the
asset-based lending and asset management businesses. As of December 31, 1993,
Foothill had total assets owned or under management of more than $1.1 billion.
Foothill Capital Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiary, provides asset-based
financing secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and other assets
to businesses nationwide. The parent company's asset management operation
manages institutional limited partnerships which invest in the debt of
companies which are in reorganization or in the process of restructuring.
