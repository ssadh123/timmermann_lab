Item 5. Other Events.

On October 26, 1994, First Financial Corporation ("FFC") announced that it
had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated October 26, 1994
(the "Agreement") among FFC, First Financial Acquisition Company, a wholly owned
subsidiary of FFC ("Acquisition Company"), and FirstRock Bancorp, Inc.
("FirstRock") pursuant to which FFC will acquire FirstRock (the "Acquisition")
through the merger of FirstRock and Acquisition Company. The Agreement is filed
as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. As part of the
Acquisition, FirstRock's wholly owned subsidiary, First Federal Savings Bank,
F.S.B. ("First Federal"), will be merged into FFC's wholly owned subsidiary,
First Financial Bank, FSB ("First Financial"). At September 30, 1994, FirstRock
reported total assets of $408.0 million, deposits of $302.5 million and
stockholders' equity of $48.6 million.

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Acquisition is to be accounted for as a
pooling of interests, and each share of issued and outstanding FirstRock common
stock will convert into the right to receive FFC common stock valued at $27.10,
based upon the average of the closing prices of the FFC common stock on The
Nasdaq Stock Market during the fifteen trading days on which reportable sales of
FFC common stock took place ("Average Trading Price") immediately prior to the
third business day before the closing of the Acquisition. Outstanding employee
and director options to acquire FirstRock common stock shall be converted into
options to acquire FFC common stock. The Agreement may be terminated by FFC if
the Average Trading Price of FFC common stock is less than $13.25 (unless
FirstRock determines to accept an exchange ratio of 2.06 shares of FFC common
stock for each issued and outstanding share of FirstRock common stock) and by
FirstRock if the Average Trading Price of FFC Common Stock is greater than
$20.00 (unless FFC determines to issue 1.365 shares of FFC common stock for each
issued and outstanding share of FirstRock common stock).

In connection with the Agreement, FirstRock issued a Warrant to FFC (the
"Warrant") pursuant to which FFC has the right to acquire up to 475,246 shares
of FirstRock common stock at $22.50 per share (the market price of FirstRock
common stock on the trading day immediately prior to execution of the
Agreement). The Warrant is exercisable only under certain circumstances related
primarily to third-party offers for FirstRock or if the transaction is not
completed. A copy of the Warrant is filed as an exhibit hereto and is
incorporated herein by reference.

FFC anticipates that the Acquisition will be consummated in the first
quarter of 1995 and that at such time, FFC will take an estimated one-time
after-tax charge of $4.0 million for restructuring and transaction costs. The
Acquisition is subject to receipt of necessary corporate and regulatory
approvals and other conditions.

WHEREAS, FFC-Acquisition is a wholly owned subsidiary of First Financial,
and First Financial and the Company desire that FFC-Acquisition shall be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with the applicable statutes of the
State of Delaware and in accordance with an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the

and

WHEREAS, immediately upon the Merger, First Federal Savings Bank, F.S.B.,

subsidiary of First Financial ("FF-Bank");

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual and
dependent promises hereinafter contained, the parties do represent, warrant,
covenant and agree as follows:

ARTICLE ONE

The Merger

1.01 Plan of Merger. FFC-Acquisition, the Company and First Financial
hereby adopt and agree to execute the Plan of Merger substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A.

1.02 Manner of Merger. At the Effective Time, as hereinafter defined, FFC-
Acquisition shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with
applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "Delaware
Law") and on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement
and the Plan of Merger. Simultaneously with the effectiveness of the Merger, (a)
the separate existence of FFC- Acquisition shall cease and (b) the Company, as
the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), shall continue to exist
<PAGE>
under and be governed by the Delaware Law. Upon the effectiveness of the Merger,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended to be in the form of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
FFC-Acquisition as in effect immediately prior to the Merger. Upon the
effectiveness of the Merger, the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the persons serving in such positions at FFC-Acquisition
immediately prior to such effectiveness.

1.03 Effect of Merger. Upon the Merger becoming effective:

(a) The separate existence of FFC-Acquisition shall cease and be
merged into the Surviving Corporation, which shall possess all of the rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of a public as well as of a
private nature, and shall be subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities
and duties, of each of the Company and FFC-Acquisition; and all singular rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of each of the Company and
FFC-Acquisition, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due
to either the Company or FFC-Acquisition in whatever account, including
subscriptions to shares, and all other things in action or belonging to each of
the Company and FFC-Acquisition shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation;
and all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, and all
and every interest, shall be thereafter as effectually the property of the
Surviving Corporation as they were of the Company and FFC-Acquisition and the
title to any real estate, or interest therein, vested by deed or otherwise, in
either of the Company and FFC-Acquisition shall not revert or be in any way
impaired by reason of the Merger.

(b) All rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of the
Company or FFC-Acquisition shall be preserved unimpaired and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company or FFC-Acquisition shall thenceforth
attach to the Surviving Corporation and may be enforced against the Surviving
Corporation to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had been
incurred or contracted by it; provided, however, that all such liens shall
attach only to those assets to which they were attached prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) Any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, instituted, pending or threatened by or against either the
Company or FFC-Acquisition or relating to their assets, liabilities or shares of
common stock shall be prosecuted as if the Merger had not taken place, and the
Surviving Corporation may be substituted as a party in such action or proceeding
in place of FFC-Acquisition.

(d) Each share of stock of FFC-Acquisition issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive the same number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(e) Subject to Sections 9.01(g) and (h) of this Agreement each share
of the Company's Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger (other than shares of Company Common Stock held (x) in the Company's
treasury or (y) directly or indirectly by First Financial or any of its
subsidiaries, except for any shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts,
custodial accounts or in any similar manner that are beneficially owned by third
parties or shares held as collateral or in lieu of a debt previously contracted)
<PAGE>
shall be converted into and represent the right to receive and be exchangeable
for such number of shares (rounded to the nearest ten thousandth of a share) of
First Financial Common Stock as shall be equal to (i) Twenty-Seven Dollars and
Ten Cents ($27.10) divided by (ii) the average of the closing trade prices
("Average Price") of First Financial Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market
during the last fifteen trading days on which reportable sales of First
Financial Common Stock took place immediately prior to, but not including, the
third business day prior to the Effective Time as defined below (the "Exchange
Ratio"). Fractions of shares of First Financial Common Stock will not be issued.
In lieu of a fraction of a share of First Financial Common Stock, each holder of
Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share of First
Financial Common Stock shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash equal to
(i) the fraction of a share of First Financial Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled, multiplied by (ii) the actual market value of First
Financial Common Stock which shall be deemed to be the last per share sales
price of the First Financial Common Stock as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market
on the fourth trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date (as defined
below). Following consummation of the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock
shall be entitled to dividends or any other rights in respect of any such
fraction.

(f) Each of the Option Rights (as hereinafter defined) which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall be converted automatically
into an option to purchase shares of First Financial Common Stock in an amount

the terms (including those terms, if any, providing for accelerated vesting) of
the Company's 1992 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "Employee Plan") and the
Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (the "Director Plan"),
(the option rights granted under the Employee Plan and the Director Plan are
sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Option Rights"):

(1) The number of shares of First Financial Common Stock to be
subject to the new option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares
of FirstRock Common Stock subject to the original option and the Exchange Ratio,
provided that any fractional shares of First Financial Common Stock resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share; and

(2) The exercise price per share of First Financial Common
Stock under the new option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of
FirstRock Common Stock under the original option divided by the Exchange Ratio,
provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which are
"incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be effected
in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The duration
and other terms of the new option shall be the same as the original option,
except that all references to the Company shall be deemed to be references to
<PAGE>
First Financial. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all
Limited Rights (as such term is defined in the Employee Plan) granted under the
Employee Plan shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon receipt
of consent to such termination from the grantees of such Limited Rights. The
Company will use its best efforts to obtain such consents from all holders of
Limited Rights.

For purposes of determining Option Rights outstanding immediately prior to
the Merger, all Option Rights which have been granted as of the date hereof, as
described in Section 3.03 hereof, shall be deemed outstanding unless they shall
have been exercised prior to the Effective Time or shall have expired or
otherwise have been terminated prior thereto.

(g) In the event of any increase or reduction in the number of shares
of First Financial Common Stock issued and outstanding caused by split-up,
reverse split, reclassification, distribution of stock dividends or change of
par or stated value, the parties agree to amend the Plan of Merger to cause a
proportionate adjustment to be made to the Exchange Ratio and the Option
Exchange Ratio and the ratio specified in Section 9.01(g) and (h).

(h) The Reorganization shall constitute a tax-free reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and except for cash received in
lieu of fractional shares, no gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of
Company Common Stock upon receipt of shares of First Financial Common Stock in
exchange for their shares of Company Common Stock.

1.04 Bank Merger. Immediately after the Merger, as part of the
Reorganization and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bank
Merger Agreement attached as Appendix 1 hereto, First Federal shall be merged
with and into FF-Bank, which will be the "Surviving Bank" of the Bank Merger.

the transactions contemplated hereby so long as (i) there are no material
adverse federal or state income tax consequences to the Company and its
stockholders or to holders of options under the Employee Plan or the Director
Plan as a result of such modification; (ii) the consideration to be paid to
holders of Company Common Stock under this Agreement is not thereby reduced in

thereto, together with the reports of Ernst & Young relating thereto; and (ii)
the unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 1994, and the
related unaudited Consolidated Statement of Income for the period then ended
(the "Financial Statements"). Such Financial Statements fairly present the
consolidated financial position of First Financial as of and for the periods
<PAGE>
ended on their respective dates and the consolidated operating results and
changes in financial position of First Financial for the indicated periods in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent
basis. Since September 30, 1994, there have not been any changes in First

except as otherwise disclosed. All of the aforesaid Financial Statements present
fairly, and all of the Subsequent Financial Statements will present fairly, the
consolidated financial position of First Financial and the results of its
operations and changes in its financial position as of and for the periods
ending on their respective dates. Subject to such changes which may result from
an audit which includes the nine months ended September 30, 1994, or an audit of

be material), the allowance for loan losses in such Financial Statements is, and
with respect to the Subsequent Financial Statements will be, adequate under the
standards applied by the OTS and based on past loan loss experiences and
potential losses in current portfolios to cover all known or anticipated loan
losses.

2.05 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as and to the extent
reflected or reserved against in the Financial Statements or the Subsequent
Financial Statements, neither First Financial nor any of its subsidiaries have,

First Financial or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, pursuant to any
indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, license, lease or other agreement (including
borrowing agreements) or instrument to which First Financial or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets may be
<PAGE>
bound; or (ii) violate any statute, rule or regulation, judgment, order, writ,
decree or injunction applicable to First Financial or any of its subsidiaries.
No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or
with any court, regulatory authority or other governmental body, or of any
lender or purchaser under any borrowing agreement, other than as specifically
contemplated by this Agreement, is required for the consummation by First
Financial of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.07 Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no legal,
quasijudicial, administrative, or other actions, suits, proceedings or

("FDIC") and, to the best knowledge of First Financial, all such filings

complete and accurate in all material respects as of the dates of the filings,
and no such filing made or will make any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Except for normal examinations conducted by the IRS or various
banking regulatory authorities in the regular course of the business of First
Financial and its subsidiaries, no federal, state or local governmental agency,
commission or other entity has initiated any proceeding or, to the best of the
knowledge and belief of the First Financial, investigation into the business or
operations of the First Financial and its subsidiaries within the past five
years. To First Financial's knowledge, there is no unresolved violation,
criticism or exception of a material nature by the SEC or the OTS or the FDIC or
other agency, commission or entity with respect to any report or statement
referred to herein. Since the date of any such filings there has been no
material change in First Financial's condition, financial or otherwise, such
that had such change occurred prior to any such filing, such change would have
been required to be disclosed or described therein.

<PAGE>

2.10 Advice of Changes. Between the date hereof and the Effective Time,
First Financial shall promptly advise the Company in writing of any fact which,
if existing or known at the date hereof, would have been required to be set
forth or disclosed in or pursuant to this Agreement or of any fact which, if
existing or known at the date hereof, would have made any of the representations
contained herein materially untrue.

the stockholders of the Company will be entitled to receive upon consummation of
the Merger pursuant to the Plan of Merger will, at the Effective Time, be duly

Section 412 of the Code (if applicable). Neither the Company, the Subsidiaries
nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction in connection with which
the Company, the Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate could be subject to either
a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed

best knowledge of the Company, threatened or anticipated claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Company

4.12 Resolution of Company Benefit Plans. The Company and First Financial
shall cooperate in effecting the following treatment of the Company Benefit
Plans, except as mutually agreed upon by First Financial and the Company before
the Effective Time:

(a) After the Effective Time, First Financial, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or as permitted by Code or ERISA law, shall not amend
or take any other action, with respect to any Company Benefit Plan which has or
will have the effect of reducing or eliminating any: (i) accrued benefits
regardless of whether the benefits have been vested, (ii) early retirement
benefits or retirement-type subsidies, and/or (iii) optional form of benefits,
or any other benefit, right or feature of the Company Benefits Plans, which
enures or will enure to any participant, former participant and/or retired
participant or beneficiaries of such persons who are covered under the terms of
the Company Benefit Plans, as the described benefits and forms of benefits
existed under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, First Financial shall
deem the single sum payment optional form of benefit and the early retirement
benefit known as the "Rule of 80" available in the First Federal Employees'
Defined Benefit Plan as "Protected Benefits" and shall take no action to amend
or eliminate such options for a period of 90 days after the Effective Time. In
addition, First Financial agrees to pay the accrued vacation benefits to Company
employees.

(b) On the Effective Date, First Financial or a subsidiary shall be
substituted for the Company as the sponsoring employer under those Company
Benefit Plans with respect to which the Company is a sponsoring employer
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall assume and be vested with all
of the powers, rights, duties, obligations and liabilities previously vested in
the Company with respect to each such Plan. Except as otherwise provided herein,
each such Plan and any Company Benefit Plan sponsored by the Company Subsidiary,

Defined Benefit Plan, the First Federal ESOP, the Deferred Compensation
Agreements entered into by the Company with certain of its officers, the
Incentive Compensation Plans and the Benefit Equalization Plan, shall be

provided, however, that First Financial shall not reduce, diminish or terminate
<PAGE>
any accrued benefit or the form of such benefit as provided by the Company
Benefit Plans as of the Effective Time unless agreed upon by the parties prior
to the Effective Time, or if after the Effective Time, permitted by the Code or
by ERISA. The Company, each Company Subsidiary, and First Financial will use all
reasonable efforts (i) to effect said substitutions and assumptions, and such
other actions contemplated under this Agreement, and (ii) to amend such plans to
the extent necessary to provide for said substitutions and assumptions, and such
other actions contemplated under this Agreement.

(c) After the Effective Time, First Financial shall provide, or cause
an applicable Subsidiary to provide, to each employee of the Company and any
Company Subsidiary as of the Effective Time ("FirstRock Employees") the
opportunity to participate in First Financial Benefit Plans offered to
similarly-situated employees. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall obligate
First Financial or any subsidiary to hire any person or retain in employment any
employee or director or to provide or cause to be provided any benefits
duplicative to those provided under any Company Benefit Plan that is continued
pursuant to Section 4.13(b) above. Except as otherwise provided in this

amend or terminate any benefit plan or program, including any Company Benefit
Plan shall not be altered or affected. Moreover, this Agreement shall not confer

constitute a contract of employment or create any rights, to be retained or
otherwise, in employment at First Financial, the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any First Financial Subsidiary.

the Code. All shares released from the ESOP unallocated stock fund as a result
of the reduction of the ESOP loan prior to the Effective Time shall be allocated
to the Company ESOP participants prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, First Financial, Company and their
respective representatives shall use their best efforts, and after the Effective
Time, First Financial and its representatives shall use their best efforts, to
cause Company and the Company Subsidiaries to: take any action necessary
(including amendment of the ESOP, if necessary) to maintain the status of the
ESOP as a separate plan qualified under Sections 401(a) and 4975 of the Code
until all shares of stock held by the ESOP have been allocated to the accounts
of participants therein.
<PAGE>
(e) All accounts under the First Federal 401(k) Savings Plan and
accrued benefits under the First Federal Employees' Defined Benefits Plan shall
as of the Effective Time become fully vested and nonforfeitable within the
meaning of Section 411 of the Code, and First Financial shall honor the terms of
the Company plans and shall not reduce the benefits accrued under such plans
except as permitted under the Code or ERISA. The benefits provided under the
Benefit Equalization Plan and the Deferred Compensation Agreements, upon the
Effective Time, shall be fully vested and such plans shall be terminated in
accordance with those plans.

(f) All outstanding stock options which have been granted pursuant to
the FirstRock Stock Option Plans will become fully vested, nonforfeitable and
100% exercisable as of the Effective Time. The FirstRock Stock Option Plans
shall continue following the Effective Time and First Financial shall assume the
rights, duties and obligations of FirstRock under the FirstRock Stock Option
Plans. Options representing FirstRock Common Stock outstanding as of the
Effective Time shall become options to purchase shares of First Financial Common
Stock, subject to adjustment as set forth in the FirstRock Stock Option Plans,
and as provided in Section 1.03(f) hereof.

(g) All awards which have been granted under the First Federal
Recognition and Retention Plans and Trusts will become fully vested and
nonforfeitable to the extent permitted by the Plans and shares representing such
awards and earnings thereon shall be distributed to participants or
beneficiaries as of the Effective Time and these plans and trusts will terminate
following such distribution as of the Effective Time.

(h) First Financial shall honor the Company's obligation to pay a
lifetime benefit of of $499.38 every biweekly pay period as a retirement benefit
to a former employee as set forth on Schedule 4.12(h), but shall not be
obligated to provide medical coverage to any retired director of the Company or

materially modified prior to the vote of the stockholders.

6.11 Consents and Approvals. Any consents or approvals required to be
secured by either party by the terms of this Agreement or the Plan of Merger or

referenced in Article Six shall impose any term, condition or restriction upon

respective Subsidiaries that First Financial or the Company, in good faith,
reasonably determines would so materially and adversely affect the economic or
business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to First
Financial or the Company as to render inadvisable in the reasonable good faith
judgment of First Financial or the Company, the consummation of the Merger (a
"Burdensome Condition").
<PAGE>
6.14 Cooperation. The Company and First Financial will use best efforts
prior to the Effective Time to cause the closing condition at Section 8.13

Change in the Company, and it being further understood that no breach or default
shall occur with respect to any representation, warranty, obligation or
condition of the Company, unless any such breach or default individually, or all
such breaches and defaults in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse

be likely to enjoin consummation, or result in rescission, of the

adverse to the best interests of First Financial's stockholders.

assets, properties, business, operations or condition, financial or otherwise,

Federal. No action, suit, proceeding or claim shall have been instituted, made

Merger inadvisable in the reasonable opinion of First Financial.

8.09 Transfer by Affiliates. At or prior to thirty (30) days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall have entered into agreements with each of its
affiliates, as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, by

Merger to be consummated as contemplated thereby.

designated by First Financial, shall have examined the Company's and the
Subsidiaries' operations, properties, books, contracts, commitments, and records
and, after appropriate inquiry and examination with respect to the financial
conditions, results of operations, quality of the loan and bond portfolios and
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the affiliation audit date, First Financial shall have
received an audit report the results of which, in the reasonable opinion of
First Financial, are satisfactory to First Financial.

8.13 No Parachute Payments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary as of the Effective Time, there shall exist no contractual or other
obligations or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
provide for, or that under any circumstances would result in, payments that,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

stockholders.
<PAGE>
Therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, the parties hereto hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

1.01 Merger of the Company into FFC-Acquisition. The Company
FFC-Acquisition shall be merged into FFC-Acquisition the Company at the
Effective Time as that term is defined in the Agreement. The separate corporate
existence of the Company shall thereupon cease and FFC-Acquisition shall be the
surviving corporation. FFC-Acquisition is herein sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation." FFC-Acquisition shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "Delaware Law") and on the terms and subject to the
conditions contained in the Agreement. Simultaneously with the effectiveness of
the Merger, (a) the separate existence of FFC-Acquisition shall cease and (b)
the Company, as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), shall
continue to exist under and be governed by the Delaware Law.

1.02 Effect of the Merger. From and after the Effective Time:

(a) The separate existence of the Company FFC-Acquisition shall cease
and be merged into the Surviving Corporation, which shall possess all of the
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of a public as well as of
a private nature, and shall be subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities
and duties, of each of the Company and FFC-Acquisition; and all singular rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of each of the Company and
FFC-Acquisition, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due
to either the Company or FFC-Acquisition on whatever account, including
subscriptions to shares, and all other things in action or belonging to each of
the Company and FFC-Acquisition shall be vested in FFC-Acquisition as the
Surviving Corporation; and all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises, and all and every interest, shall be thereafter as effectually
the property of FFC-Acquisition as the Surviving Corporation as they were of the
Company and FFC-Acquisition and the title to any real estate, or interest
therein, vested by deed or otherwise, in either of the Company and
FFC-Acquisition shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the
Merger.

(b) All rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of the
Company or FFC-Acquisition shall be preserved unimpaired and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company or FFC-Acquisition shall thenceforth
attach to FFC-Acquisition as the Surviving Corporation and may be enforced
against FFC-Acquisition as the Surviving Corporation to the same extent as if
said debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it;
provided, however, that all such liens shall attach only to those assets to
which they were attached prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, instituted, pending or threatened by or against either the
Company or FFC-Acquisition or relating to their assets, liabilities or shares of
common stock shall be prosecuted as if the Merger had not taken place, and
FFC-Acquisition as the Surviving Corporation may be substituted as a party in
such action or proceeding in place of the Company FFC-Acquisition.
<PAGE>
1.03 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further assignments
or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest,
perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its
rights, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as
a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or (b) otherwise carry out the
purposes of the Agreement and this Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company and
its proper officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the
Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver
all such proper deeds, assignments and assurances in law and to do all acts
necessary or proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such
rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry
out the purposes of the Agreement and this Agreement and Plan of Merger; and the
proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized
in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action.

ARTICLE II

2.01 Name. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "First Financial
Acquisition Company."

2.02 Articles of Incorporation. From and after the Effective Time, the
Articles of Incorporation of FFC-Acquisition the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended to be in the form of the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving

2.04 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of FFC-Acquisition
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the sole directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE III

3.01 Manner and Basis of Converting Shares of FFC-Acquisition. At the
Effective Time, each share of FFC-Acquisition Common Stock which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be outstanding without
any change therein shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive
the same number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

3.02 Manner and Basis of Converting Shares of Company Stock.

(a) Any shares of Company Common Stock or any other class or series
of stock of the Company held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no First Financial Common Stock shall
be issuable or exchangeable with respect thereto.
<PAGE>
(b) Subject to Sections 9.01(g) and (h) of the Agreement, each share
of the Company's Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and represent the right to receive and be
exchangeable for such number of shares (rounded to the nearest ten thousandth of
a share) of First Financial Common Stock as shall be equal to (i) Twenty Seven
Dollars and Ten Cents ($27.10) divided by (ii) the average of the closing trade
prices ("Average Price") of First Financial Common Stock on the Nasdaq National
Stock Market during the last fifteen trading days on which reportable sales of
First Financial Common Stock took place immediately prior to, but not including,
the third business day prior to the Effective Time as defined below (the
"Exchange Ratio"). Fractions of shares of First Financial Common Stock will not
be issued. In lieu of a fraction of a share of First Financial Common Stock,
each holder of Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share
of First Financial common Stock shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash
equal to (i) the fraction of a share of First Financial Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled, multiplied by (ii) the actual market
value of First Financial Common Stock which shall be deemed to be the last per
share sales price of the First Financial Common Stock as reported on The Nasdaq
Stock Market on the fourth trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date
(as defined below). Following consummation of the Merger, no holder of Company
Common Stock shall be entitled to dividends or any other rights in respect of
any such fraction.

(c) Each of the Option Rights (as defined in the Agreement) which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
automatically into an option to purchase shares of First Financial Common Stock
in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and
otherwise subject to the terms (including those terms, if any, providing for
accelerated vesting) of the Company's 1992 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the
"Employee Plan") and the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors
(the "Director Plan"), (the option rights granted to under the Employee Plan and
the Director Plan are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Option
Rights"):

(1) The number of shares of First Financial Common Stock to be
subject to the new option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares
of FirstRock Common Stock subject to the original option and the Exchange Ratio,
provided that any fractional shares of First Financial Common Stock resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share; and

(2) The exercise price per share of First Financial Common
Stock under the new option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of
FirstRock Common Stock under the original option divided by the Exchange Ratio,
provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which are
"incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be effected
in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The duration
and other terms of the new option shall be the same as the original option,
except that all references to the Company shall be deemed to be references to
First Financial. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all
Limited Rights (as such term is defined in the Employee Plan) granted under the
Employee Plan shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon receipt
of consent to such termination from the grantees of such Limited Rights. The
Company will use its best efforts to obtain such consents from all holders of
Limited Rights.

certificates that prior thereto represented validly issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock shall surrender such certificate or certificates
to Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., the exchange agent for such shares, or another
exchange agent selected by First Financial (the "Exchange Agent"), and shall
receive in exchange therefor the applicable number of whole shares of First
Financial Common Stock, and the cash for fractional shares (without interest
thereon), if any, as provided in this Agreement and Plan of Merger.

The holder of a certificate or certificates that prior to the Merger
represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have no

surrender the certificate or certificates in exchange for the applicable number
of whole shares of First Financial Common Stock, and the cash for fractional
shares, if any. The Exchange Agent shall mark all certificates delivered
pursuant to this Section 3.05(a) as canceled and shall promptly thereafter

of whole shares of First Financial Common Stock, and the cash for fractional
shares, if any.

certificates which as of the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of

instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for First Financial Common Stock.

EXHIBIT B

First Financial Corporation
1303 Main Street
Stevens Point, Wisconsin 54481

Gentlemen:

I have been advised that I may be deemed an "affiliate" within the meaning
of paragraph (c) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") of
FirstRock Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and may be
deemed such at the time of the merger ("Merger") of First Financial Acquisition
Company, a Delaware corporation ("FFC-Acquisition") with the Company. Pursuant
to the Merger, I will acquire shares of the Common Stock ("First Financial
Common Stock") of First Financial Corporation ("First Financial") in exchange
for each share of common stock of the Company ("Company Common Stock") held by
me. I agree that I will not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the
First Financial Common Stock or Company Common Stock in violation of the Act or
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC.

I have been advised that the issuance of the First Financial Common Stock
to me pursuant to the Merger has been registered under the Act by First
Financial by the filing of a Registration Statement with the SEC. I have also
been advised that such registration does not apply to any distribution by me of
the First Financial Common Stock received by me in the Merger. I have also been
advised that, since at the effective time of the Merger, I may be deemed to have
been an "affiliate" of the Company, any offering or sale by me of any of the
First Financial Common Stock will, under current law, require either (i) the
further registration under the Act of the First Financial Common Stock to be
sold; (ii) compliance with Rule 145 promulgated under the Act; or (iii) the
availability of another exemption from such registration. In addition, I have
been advised that any transferee in a private offering or other similar
disposition will be subject to the same limitations as those imposed on me.

I represent and warrant to First Financial that:

1. I have carefully read this letter and discussed its requirements and
other applicable limitations upon the sale, transfer or other disposition of the
First Financial Common Stock to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or
counsel for the Company.
<PAGE>
2. I have been informed by First Financial that the First Financial Common
Stock must be held by me indefinitely unless (i) any of the First Financial
Common Stock received by me in the Merger and to be distributed by me is first
registered under the Act other than by the registration by First Financial
referred to above; (ii) a sale of the First Financial Common Stock is made in
conformity with the volume and other applicable limitations of paragraph (d) of
Rule 145 (which incorporates by reference paragraphs (c), (e), (f) and (g) of
Rule 144); or (iii) some other exemption from registration is available with
respect to any such proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of the First
Financial Common Stock. I will be required to deliver to First Financial
evidence of compliance with such requirements in connection with any proposed
sale, transfer or other disposition by me which may include, in the case of a
distribution under some other exemption from registration, an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to counsel for First Financial that such exemption is
available.

3. I understand that First Financial is under no obligation to register
the First Financial Common Stock that I may wish to sell, transfer, or otherwise
dispose of or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance
with an exemption from registration available.

4. If I rely on the exemption from the registration provisions contained
in Section 4 of the Act (other than that contained in Rule 144 or 145), I will
obtain and deliver to First Financial a copy of a letter from any prospective
transferee which will contain (a) representations reasonably satisfactory to
First Financial as to the nondistributive intent, sophistication, ability to
bear risk, and access to information of such transferee; (b) an acknowledgment
concerning restrictions on transfer of the First Financial Common Stock; and (c)
an assumption of the obligations of the undersigned under this paragraph 4.

5. I understand that First Financial expects that the Merger will be
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests and that Topic 2-E of staff accounting
bulletin of the SEC provides that the risk sharing requirement for the
applicability of pooling-of-interests accounting will have occurred if no
affiliate of either First Financial or the Company sells or in any other way
reduces his or her risk relative to (i) Company Common Stock within thirty (30)
days prior to the effective time of the Merger and (ii) any First Financial
Common Stock received in the Merger until such time as financial results
covering at least 30 days of post-Merger combined operations have been
published. I agree, in order to preserve pooling-of-interests accounting for the
Merger, to make no disposition of (i) any shares of Company Common Stock within
thirty (30) days prior to the effective time of the Merger, which First
Financial or the Company shall advise me in writing, and (ii) any shares of
First Financial Common Stock received in the Merger, or in any other way reduce
my risk relative to the shares of First Financial received in the Merger, until
publication by First Financial of financial results covering at least 30 days of
post-Merger combined operations in the form of a Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filing
with the SEC, the issuance of a quarterly earnings report, or any other public
issuance which includes combined net sales and net income.
<PAGE>
6. I also understand that to enforce the foregoing commitments, stop
transfer instructions will be given to the Company's transfer agent with respect
to the Company Common Stock and to First Financial's transfer agent with respect
to the First Financial Common Stock and that there will be placed on the
certificates for the First Financial Common Stock, or any substitutions
therefor, a legend stating in substance:

7. I have no present plan or intent, and as of the effective time of the
Merger shall have no present plan or intent, to engage in a sale, exchange,
transfer (other than an intrafamily gift), distribution (including a
distribution by a corporation to its shareholders), redemption, pledge (other
than a pledge replacing an existing pledge of Company Common Stock) or reduction
in any way of my risk of ownership by short sale or otherwise, or other
disposition, directly or indirectly (collectively a "Sale") with respect to any
of the shares of First Financial Common Stock to be received by me upon the
Merger. I am not aware of, or participating in any plan or intent on the part of
Company shareholders (a "Plan") to engage in Sales of the First Financial Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger such that the aggregate fair market value, as
the effective time of the Merger, of the shares subject to such Sales would
exceed 50% of the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Company Common
Stock immediately prior to the Merger (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock").
A Sale of First Financial Common Stock shall be considered to have occurred
pursuant to a Plan if, for example, such Sale occurs in a transaction that is in
contemplation of, or related or pursuant to, the Merger (a "Related
Transaction"). In addition, Company Common Stock (i) exchanged for cash in lieu
of fractional shares of First Financial Common Stock, and (ii) with respect to
which a pre-Merger Sale occurs in a Related Transaction, shall be considered to
be shares of Outstanding Company Common Stock that are exchanged for shares of
First Financial Common Stock which are disposed of pursuant to a Plan.

OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED UNTIL SUCH TIME AS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FIRST FINANCIAL

WARRANT AGREEMENT, dated as of October 26, 1994 (this "Agreement"),
between FirstRock Bancorp, Inc, a Delaware corporation ("Issuer"), and First
Financial Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation ("Grantee").

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of October 26, 1994 (the "Plan"), which was executed by
the parties hereto prior to the execution of this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Grantee's entering into the
Plan and in consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee the
Option (as defined below).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Plan, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

SECTION 1. Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional,
irrevocable warrant (the "Warrant") to purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up
to 475,246 fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $.01
per share of Issuer ("Issuer Common Stock") ( which number of shares is equal to
19.9% of the number of outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock on the date
hereof), at a price per share of $22.50 (the "Initial Price"); provided,
however, that in the event Issuer issues or agrees to issue any additional
shares of Issuer Common Stock at a price less than the Initial Price, as
adjusted pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof, such price shall be equal to such
lesser price (such price, as adjusted, is hereinafter referred to as the
"Warrant Price"). The number of shares of Issuer Common Stock that may be
received upon the exercise of the Warrant and the Warrant Price are subject to
adjustment as herein set forth.

SECTION 2. (a) Grantee may exercise the Warrant, in whole or part, at
any time and from time to time following the occurrence of a Purchase Event (as
defined below); provided that the Warrant shall terminate and be of no further
force and effect upon the earliest to occur of (i) the time immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) 18 months after the first occurrence of a Purchase
Event, (iii) 18 months after the termination of the Plan following the
occurrence of a Preliminary Purchase Event (as defined below), (iv) upon the
termination of the Plan, prior to the occurrence of a Purchase Event or
Preliminary Purchase Event, by either party pursuant to Section [9.01(a)] of the
Plan, or by Grantee pursuant to Section [9.01(d)] of the Plan (if the "Material
Adverse Change in the Company" (as defined in the Plan) did not result from a
default by the Company under the Plan or Section [9.01(e)] of the Plan), or by
Issuer pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Plan, (v) six months after the
termination of the Plan in accordance with the terms thereof, prior to the
occurrence of a Purchase Event or a Preliminary Purchase Event, except for a
termination by either party pursuant to Section [9.01(a)] of the Plan, or by
Grantee pursuant to Section [9.01(e)] of the Plan, or by Grantee pursuant to
Section [9.01(d)] of the Plan (if the Material Adverse Change in the Company did
not result from a default by the Company under the Plan), or by Issuer pursuant
to Section 9.01(c) of the Plan, (vi) 18 months after the termination of the
Plan by Grantee pursuant to Section 9.01(d) thereof as a result of any default
under the Plan by Issuer, if such default was not a willful or intentional
default by Issuer, or (vii) 24 months after the termination of the Plan by
Grantee pursuant to Section [9.01(a)] thereof as a result of any default under
the Plan by Issuer, if such default was a willful or intentional default under
the Plan by Issuer. The events described in clauses (i) - (vii) in the preceding
sentence are hereinafter collectively referred to as an "Exercise Termination
Event."
<PAGE>
(b) The term "Preliminary Purchase Event" shall mean any of the
following events or transactions occurring on or after the date hereof and prior
to an Exercise Termination Event:

(i) Issuer without having received Grantee's prior written consent,
shall have entered into any letter of intent or definitive agreement to
engage in an Acquisition Transaction (as defined below) with any person (as
defined below) other than Grantee or any of its subsidiaries (each a
"Grantee Subsidiary") or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have
recommended that the shareholders of Issuer approve or accept any
Acquisition Transaction with any Person (as the term "person" is defined in
Section 3(a)9 and 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Exchange Act") and the rules and regulations thereunder) other than
Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (x) a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving Issuer or First Federal Savings Bank,
F.S.B., a wholly owned subsidiary of Issuer (the "Bank"), (y) a purchase,
lease or other acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of
Issuer or the Bank, (z) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way
of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of Beneficial
Ownership (as the term "beneficial ownership" is defined in Regulation
13d-3(a) of the Exchange Act) of securities representing 20% or more of the
voting power of Issuer or the Bank;

(ii) Any Person (other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary)
shall have acquired Beneficial Ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Issuer Common Stock or the voting stock of the Bank ("Bank
Stock"); (iii) Any Person (other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary)
shall have made a bona fide proposal to Issuer or, by a public announcement
or written communication that is or becomes the subject of public
disclosure, to Issuer's shareholders to engage in an Acquisition
Transaction (including, without limitation, any situation in which any
Person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary shall have commenced
(as such term is defined in Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), or shall
have made a filing under applicable securities laws, with respect to a
tender offer or exchange offer to purchase any shares of Issuer Common
Stock such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would have
Beneficial Ownership of 20% or more of the then outstanding shares of
Issuer Common Stock (such an offer being referred to herein as a "Tender
Offer" or an "Exchange Offer", respectively));

(iv) There shall exist a default under the Plan by Issuer and
such default would entitle Grantee to terminate the Plan;

(v) The holders of Issuer Common Stock shall not have approved
the Plan at the meeting of such shareholders held for the purpose of voting
on the Plan after the public announcement by any person (other than First
Financial or any subsidiary thereof) of an offer or proposal to acquire
(after giving effect to the shares of Common Stock of the Company already
owned by such person) 20 percent or more of the Common Stock, or to
acquire, merge or consolidate with the Company or to purchase all or
substantially all of the Company's assets; or such meeting of shareholders
shall not have been held or shall have been canceled prior to termination
of the Plan, or Issuer's Board of Directors shall have withdrawn or
modified in a manner adverse to Grantee the recommendation of Issuer's
Board of Directors that Issuer's shareholders approve the Plan;
<PAGE>

(vi) Any Person (other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary)
shall have filed an application or notice with the Office of Thrift
Supervision ("OTS"), or other regulatory or administrative agency or

Acquisition Transaction.

(c) The term "Purchase Event" shall mean any of the following events
or transactions occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to an Exercise
Termination Event:

(i) The acquisition by any Person (other than Grantee or any
Grantee Subsidiary) of Beneficial Ownership (other than on behalf of the
Issuer) of 25% or more of the then outstanding Issuer Common Stock or Bank
Stock; or

(ii) The occurrence of a Preliminary Purchase Event described in
Section 2(b)(i) except that the percentage referred to in clause (z)
thereof shall be 25%.

(d) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence
of any Preliminary Purchase Event or Purchase Event; provided, however, that the
giving of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of Grantee
to exercise the Warrant.

(e) In the event that Grantee is entitled to and wishes to exercise
the Warrant, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the "Warrant Notice" and
the date of which being hereinafter referred to as the "Notice Date") specifying
(i) the total number of shares of Issuer Common Stock it will purchase pursuant
to such exercise and (ii) the time (which shall be on a business day that is not
less than three nor more than ten business days from the Notice Date) on which
the closing of such purchase shall take place (the "Closing Date"); such closing
to take place at the principal office of the Issuer; provided, that, if prior
notification to or approval of the OTS, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") or any other Governmental Authority is required in
connection with such purchase (each, a "Notification" or an "Approval," as the
case may be), (a) Grantee shall promptly file the required notice or application
for approval ("Notice/Application"), (b) Grantee shall expeditiously process the
Notice/Application and (c) for the purpose of determining the Closing Date
pursuant to clause (ii) of this sentence, the period of time that otherwise

connection with any Notification, the date on which any required notification
periods have expired or been terminated and (y) in connection with any Approval,
the date on which such approval has been obtained and any requisite waiting
period or periods shall have expired. For purposes of Section 2(a) hereof, any
exercise of the Warrant shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating
thereto. On or prior to the Closing Date, Grantee shall have the right to revoke
its exercise of the Warrant by written notice to the Issuer given not less than
three business days prior to the Closing Date.

(f) At the closing referred to in Section 2(e) hereof, Grantee shall
pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the number of shares of Issuer
Common Stock specified in the Warrant Notice in immediately available funds by
wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer; provided, however, that
failure or refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude
Grantee from exercising the Warrant.

(g) At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately
available funds as provided in Section 2(f) hereof, Issuer shall deliver to
Grantee a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock specified in the Warrant Notice and, if the Warrant should
be exercised in part only, a new Warrant evidencing the rights of Grantee
thereof to purchase the balance of the shares of Issuer Common Stock purchasable
hereunder.
<PAGE>
(h) Certificates for Issuer Common Stock delivered at a closing
hereunder shall be endorsed with a restrictive legend substantially as follows:

The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject
to resale restrictions arising under applicable federal and state
securities laws and to certain provisions of an agreement between FirstRock
Bancorp, Inc. and First Financial Corporation dated as of October 26, 1994.
A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of FirstRock
Bancorp, Inc. and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon
receipt by FirstRock Bancorp, Inc. of a written request therefor.

It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions
in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s)
without such reference if Grantee shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a
letter from the staff of the Governmental Authority responsible for
administering any applicable state securities laws or an opinion of counsel to
the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of applicable federal
or state securities laws; (ii) the reference to the provisions of this Agreement
in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s)
without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance
with the provisions of this Agreement and under circumstances that do not
require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed
in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both
satisfied. In addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be
required by law.

(i) Upon the giving by Grantee to Issuer of a Warrant Notice and the
tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds on the
Closing Date, unless prohibited by applicable law, Grantee shall be deemed to be
the holder of record of the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock specified in
the Warrant Notice, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of Issuer
shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of Issuer
Common Stock shall not then actually be delivered to Grantee. Issuer shall pay
all expenses and other charges that may be payable in connection with the
preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in
the name of Grantee.

SECTION 3. Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times until the
termination of this Agreement have reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
the Warrant that number of authorized and reserved shares of Issuer Common Stock
equal to the maximum number of shares of Issuer Common Stock at any time and
from time to time issuable hereunder, all of which shares will, upon issuance
pursuant hereto, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable,
and delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrances and security
interests and not subject to any preemptive rights; (ii) that it will not, by
amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through reorganization,
consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary
act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by
Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all reasonable action as may from time to time be
requested by the Grantee, at Grantee's expense including (x) complying with all
premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements specified in
15 U.S.C. Sec. 18a and regulations promulgated thereunder and (y) in the event
prior approval of or notice to the OTS, the FDIC or any other Governmental
Authority, under the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended, the Change in
Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, or any other applicable federal or state
banking law, is necessary before the Warrant may be exercised, cooperating with
Grantee in preparing such applications or notices and providing such information
to each such Governmental Authority as it may require in order to permit Grantee
to exercise the Warrant and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of
Issuer Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (iv) to take all action provided herein
to protect the rights of Grantee against dilution.

SECTION 4. This Agreement (and the Warrant granted hereby) are
exchangeable, without expense, at the option of Grantee, upon presentation and
surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other
agreements providing for Warrants of different denominations entitling the
holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions
as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Issuer
Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The terms "Agreement" and "Warrant" as used
herein include any agreements and related warrants and options for which this
Agreement (and the Warrant granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by
Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction
or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction)
of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation
of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement
of like tenor and date.

SECTION 5. The number of shares of Issuer Common Stock purchasable
upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time as follows:

(a) In the event of any change in the Issuer Common Stock by
reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations,
combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares or the like,
the type and number of shares of Issuer Common Stock purchasable upon
exercise hereof shall be appropriately adjusted and proper provision shall
be made so that, in the event that any additional shares of Issuer Common
Stock are to be issued or otherwise become outstanding as a result of any
such change (other than pursuant to an exercise of the Warrant), the number
of shares of Issuer Common Stock that remain subject to the Warrant shall
be increased so that, after such issuance and together with shares of
Issuer Common Stock previously issued pursuant to the exercise of the
Warrant (as adjusted on account of any of the foregoing changes in the
Issuer Common Stock), it equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Issuer
Common Stock then issued and outstanding.

(b) Whenever the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock
purchasable upon exercise hereof is adjusted as provided in this Section 5,
the Warrant Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Warrant Price by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock purchasable prior to the adjustment and the denominator
of which shall be equal to the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock
purchasable after the adjustment.

SECTION 6. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Purchase Event that occurs
prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee
(whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of the Warrant
(or part thereof) or of any of the shares of Issuer Common Stock issued pursuant
hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement
under applicable federal securities laws covering any shares issued and issuable
pursuant to the Warrant and shall use its best efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective, and to remain current and effective
for a period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement
first becomes effective, in order to permit the sale or other disposition of any
shares of Issuer Common Stock issued upon total or partial exercise of the
Warrant ("Warrant Shares") in accordance with any plan of disposition requested
<PAGE>
by Grantee. Grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations.
Grantee shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for
inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. In connection
with any such registration, Issuer and Grantee shall provide each other with
representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily given
in connection with such registrations. If requested by Grantee in connection
with any such registration, Issuer and Grantee shall become a party to any
underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the
extent of obligating themselves in respect of representations, warranties,
indemnities and other agreements customarily included in such underwriting
agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Grantee revokes any exercise
notice or fails to exercise any Warrant with respect to any exercise notice
pursuant to Section 2(e) hereof, Issuer shall not be obligated to continue any
registration process with respect to the sale of Warrant Shares issuable upon
the exercise of such Warrant and Grantee shall not be deemed to have demanded
registration of Warrant Shares.

(b) In the event that Grantee requests Issuer to file a registration
statement following the failure to obtain any approval required to exercise the
Warrant as described in Section 9 hereof, the closing of the sale or other
disposition of the Issuer Common Stock or other securities pursuant to such
registration statement shall occur substantially simultaneously with the
exercise of the Warrant.

(c) Concurrently with the filing of a registration statement under
Section 6(a) hereof, Issuer shall also make all filings required to comply with
state securities laws in such number of states as Grantee may reasonably
request.
SECTION 7. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Purchase Event that occurs
prior to an Exercise Termination Event, (i) at the request (the date of such
request being the "Warrant Repurchase Request Date") of Grantee, Issuer shall
repurchase the Warrant from Grantee at a price (the "Warrant Repurchase Price")
equal to the amount by which (A) the market/offer price (as defined below)
exceeds (B) the Warrant Price, multiplied by the number of shares for which the
Warrant may then be exercised and (ii) at the request (the date of such request
being the "Warrant Share Repurchase Request Date") of the owner of Warrant
Shares from time to time (the "Owner"), Issuer shall repurchase such number of
the Warrant Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the
"Warrant Share Repurchase Price") equal to the market/offer price multiplied by
the number of Warrant Shares so designated. The term "market/offer price" shall
mean the highest of (i) the price per share of Issuer Common Stock at which a
tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made after the date hereof and
on or prior to the Warrant Repurchase Request Date or the Warrant Share
Repurchase Request Date, as the case may be, (ii) the price per share of Issuer
Common Stock paid or to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with
Issuer (whether by way of a merger, consolidation or otherwise), (iii) the
average of the highest last sale prices for shares of Issuer Common Stock as
reported within the 10-day period ending on the Warrant Repurchase Request Date
or the Warrant Share Repurchase Request Date, as the case may be, and (iv) in
the event of a sale of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets, the sum of
the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the
remaining assets of Issuer as determined by an investment banking firm selected
by Grantee or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to
Issuer, divided by the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock outstanding at
the time of such sale. In determining the market/offer price, the value of
consideration other than cash shall be the value determined by an investment
banking firm selected by Grantee or the Owner, as the case may be, and
reasonably acceptable to Issuer. The investment banking firm's determination
shall be conclusive and binding on all parties.
<PAGE>
(b) Grantee or the Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right
to require Issuer to repurchase the Warrant and/or any Warrant Shares pursuant
to this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal
office, a copy of this Agreement or certificates for Warrant Shares, as
applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that Grantee or
the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase the
Warrant and/or the Warrant Shares in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 7. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 30 business days
after the surrender of the Warrant and/or certificates representing Warrant
Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, Issuer shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Grantee the Warrant Repurchase Price or to
the Owner the Warrant Share Repurchase Price or the portion thereof that Issuer
is not then prohibited from so delivering under applicable law and regulation or
as a consequence of administrative policy (including policies relating to the
maintenance of capital levels and a sound financial condition).

(c) Issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all
required regulatory, shareholder and legal approvals and to file any required
notices as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish any repurchase
contemplated by this Section 7. Nonetheless, to the extent that Issuer is
prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of
administrative policy (including policies relating to the maintenance of capital
levels and a sound financial condition), from repurchasing any Warrant and/or
any Warrant Shares in full, Issuer shall promptly so notify Grantee and/or the
Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to
Grantee and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Warrant Repurchase
Price and the Warrant Share Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer
prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which
Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if Issuer at any time
after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to Section 7(b) hereof is
prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of
administrative policy (including policies relating to the maintenance of capital
levels and a sound financial condition), from delivering to Grantee and/or the
Owner, as appropriate, the Warrant Repurchase Price or the Warrant Share
Repurchase Price, respectively, in full, Grantee or the Owner, as appropriate,
may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Warrant or the Warrant Shares either
in whole or in part whereupon, in the case of a revocation in part, Issuer shall
promptly (i) deliver to Grantee and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion
of the Warrant Purchase Price or the Warrant Share Repurchase Price that Issuer
is not prohibited from delivering after taking into account any such revocation
and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to Grantee, a new Agreement
evidencing the right of Grantee to purchase that number of shares of Issuer
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock purchasable
immediately prior to the delivery of the notice of repurchase less the number of
shares of Issuer Common Stock covered by the portion of the Warrant repurchased
or (B) to the Owner, a certificate for the number of Warrant Shares covered by
the revocation.

(d) Issuer shall not enter into any agreement with any Person (other
than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary) for an Acquisition Transaction unless the
other Person assumes all the obligations of Issuer pursuant to this Section 7 in
the event that Grantee or the Owner elects, in its sole discretion, to require
such other Person to perform such obligations.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7, the
maximum aggregate Warrant Repurchase Price or Warrant Share Repurchase Price to
be paid by Issuer pursuant to this Section 7 shall be $3,000,000.
<PAGE>
SECTION 8. (a) In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination
Event, Issuer shall enter into a letter of intent or definitive agreement (i) to
consolidate or merge with any Person (other than Grantee or a Grantee
Subsidiary), and Issuer shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of
such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any Person (other than Grantee or a
Grantee Subsidiary) to merge into Issuer, and Issuer shall be the continuing or
surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding
shares of Issuer Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or
other securities of any other Person or cash or any other property or the then
outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock shall after such merger represent less
than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged company,
or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to
any Person (other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary) then, and in each such
case, such letter of intent or definitive agreement governing such transaction
shall make proper provision so that the Warrant shall, upon the consummation of
such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be
converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute Warrant"), at the
election of Grantee, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as defined below)
or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation (the Acquiring
Corporation and any such controlling person being hereinafter referred to as the
"Substitute Warrant Issuer").

(b) The Substitute Warrant shall be exercisable for such number of
shares of Substitute Common Stock (as is hereinafter defined) as is equal to the
market/offer price (as defined in Section 7 hereof) multiplied by the number of
shares of Issuer Common Stock for which the Warrant was theretofore exercisable,
divided by the Average Price (as hereinafter defined). The exercise price of the
Substitute Warrant per share of the Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute
Purchase Price") shall then be equal to the Warrant Price multiplied by a
fraction in which the numerator is the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock
for which the Warrant was theretofore exercisable and the denominator is the
number of shares for which the Substitute Warrant is exercisable.

(c) The Substitute Warrant shall otherwise have the same terms as the
Warrant, provided that if the terms of the Substitute Warrant cannot, for legal
reasons, be the same as the Warrant, such terms shall be as similar as possible
and in no event less advantageous to Grantee, provided further that the terms of
the Substitute Warrant shall include (by way of example and not limitation)
provisions for the repurchase of the Substitute Warrant and Substitute Common
Stock by the Substitute Warrant Issuer on the same terms and conditions as
provided in Section 7 hereof.

(d) The following terms have the meanings indicated:

(i) "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing
or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other
than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or
surviving corporation, and (iii) the transferee of all or any substantial
part of Issuer's assets.

(ii) "Substitute Common Stock" shall mean the common stock issued
by the Substitute Warrant Issuer upon exercise of the Substitute Warrant.

(iii) "Average Price" shall mean the average closing price of a
share of Substitute Common Stock for the one year immediately preceding the
consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the
closing price of the shares of Substitute Common Stock on the day preceding
such consolidation, merger or sale; provided that if Issuer is the issuer
of the Substitute Warrant, the Average Price shall be computed with respect
to a share of Issuer Common Stock issued by Issuer, the corporation merging
into Issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by such
merging corporation, as Grantee may elect.
<PAGE>
(e) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall
the Substitute Warrant be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the aggregate of
the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
issuance of the Substitute Warrant. In the event that the Substitute Warrant
would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the aggregate of the shares of
Substitute Common Stock but for this clause (e), the Substitute Warrant Issuer
shall make a cash payment to Grantee equal to the excess of (i) the value of the
Substitute Warrant without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e)
over (ii) the value of the Substitute Warrant after giving effect to the
limitation in this clause (e). This difference in value shall be determined by a
nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by Grantee and the
Substitute Warrant Issuer. In addition, the provisions of Section 5(a) hereof
shall not apply to the issuance of any Substitute Warrant and for purposes of
applying Section 5(a) hereof thereafter to any Substitute Warrant the percentage
referred to in Section 5(a) hereof shall thereafter equal the percentage that
the percentage of the shares of Substitute Common Stock subject to the
Substitute Warrant bears to the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock
outstanding.

SECTION 9. Notwithstanding Sections 2, 6 and 7 hereof, if Grantee has
given the notice referred to in one or more of such Sections, the exercise of
the rights specified in any such Section shall be extended (a) if the exercise
of such rights requires obtaining regulatory approvals (including any required
waiting periods) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for
the exercise of such rights, and (b) to the extent necessary to avoid liability
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act by reason of such exercise; provided
that in no event shall any closing date occur more than 18 months after the
related notice date, and, if the closing date shall not have occurred within
such period due to the failure to obtain any required approval by the OTS, the
FDIC or any other Governmental Authority despite the best efforts of Issuer or
the Substitute Warrant Issuer, as the case may be, to obtain such approvals, the
exercise of the rights shall be deemed to have been rescinded as of the related
notice date. In the event (a) Grantee receives official notice that an approval
of the OTS, the FDIC or any other Governmental Authority required for the
purchase and sale of the Warrant Shares will not be issued or granted or (b) a
closing date has not occurred within 18 months after the related notice date due
to the failure to obtain any such required approval, Grantee shall be entitled
to exercise the Warrant in connection with the concurrent resale of the Warrant
Shares pursuant to a registration statement as provided in Section 6 hereof.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall restrict Grantee from specifying
alternative means of exercising rights pursuant to Sections 2, 6 or 7 hereof in
the event that the exercising of any such rights shall not have occurred due to
the failure to obtain any required approval referred to in this Section 9.

SECTION 10. Issuer hereby represents and warrants to Grantee as
follows:

(a) Issuer has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly approved by the Board of
Directors of Issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Issuer are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so
contemplated. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by, and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of, Issuer, enforceable against
Issuer in accordance with its terms, subject to any required Governmental
Approval, and except as enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may
be brought.
<PAGE>
(b) Issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and
reserve and to permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms will have
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the Warrant, that number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock equal to the maximum number of shares of Issuer Common Stock
at any time and from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon
issuance pursuant hereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
non-assessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens,
encumbrances and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights.

SECTION 11. (a) Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its
rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement or the Warrant
created hereunder to any other Person without the express written consent of the
other party, except that Grantee may assign this Agreement to a wholly owned
subsidiary of Grantee and Grantee may assign its rights hereunder in whole or in
part after the occurrence of a Preliminary Purchase Event. The term "Grantee" as
used in this Agreement shall also be deemed to refer to Grantee's permitted
assigns.

(b) Any assignment of rights of Grantee to any permitted assignee of
Grantee hereunder shall bear the restrictive legend at the beginning thereof
substantially as follows:

The transfer of the option represented by this assignment and the
related option agreement is subject to resale restrictions arising under
applicable federal and state securities laws and to certain provisions of
an agreement between FirstRock Bancorp, Inc. and First Financial
Corporation dated as of October 26, 1994. A copy of such agreement is on
file at the principal office of FirstRock Bancorp, Inc. and will be
provided to any permitted assignee of the Warrant without charge upon
receipt of a written request therefor.

SECTION 12. Each of Grantee and Issuer will use its reasonable efforts
to make all filings with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, applying to the
OTS, the FDIC and any other Governmental Authority for approval to acquire the
shares issuable hereunder.

SECTION 13. The parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an
inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party hereto and that
the obligations of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party
hereto through injunctive or other equitable relief. Both parties further agree
to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with the obtaining of any such equitable relief and that this provision is
without prejudice to any other rights that the parties hereto may have for any
failure to perform this Agreement.

SECTION 14. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained
in this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired
or invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines
that Grantee is not permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to
repurchase pursuant to Section 7 hereof, the full number of shares of Issuer
Common Stock provided in Section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant hereto), it
is the express intention of Issuer to allow Grantee to acquire or to require
Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible, without
any amendment or modification hereof.
<PAGE>
SECTION 15. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered
in person, by cable, telegram, telecopy or telex, or by registered or certified
mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) at the respective addresses of
the parties set forth in the Plan.

SECTION 16. This Agreement, the rights and obligations of the parties
hereto, and any claims or disputes relating thereto shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (but not
including the choice of law rules thereof).

SECTION 17. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement and shall be effective at the time
of execution and delivery.

SECTION 18. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the
parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on
its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder.

SECTION 19. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the
Plan, this Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior
arrangements or understandings with respect thereof, written or oral. The terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any
party, other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors except as
assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of
this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein.

SECTION 20. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined
herein but defined in the Plan shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the
Plan.

SECTION 21. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
authorize or require Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Plan or
any provision of law applicable to the Grantee or Issuer.

SECTION 22. In the event that any selection or determination is to be
made by Grantee or the Owner hereunder and at the time of such selection or
determination there is more than one Grantee or Owner, such selection shall be
made by a majority in interest of such Grantees or Owners.

SECTION 23. In the event of any exercise of the option by Grantee,
Issuer and such Grantee shall execute and deliver all other documents and
instruments and take all other action that may be reasonably necessary in order
to consummate the transactions provided for by such exercise.

SECTION 24. Except to the extent Grantee exercises the Warrant,
Grantee shall have no rights to vote or receive dividends or have any other
rights as a shareholder with respect to shares of Issuer Common Stock covered
hereby.
