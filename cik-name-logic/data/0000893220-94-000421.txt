FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 12, 1994

BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVES TAX SETTLEMENT
BETWEEN IRS AND COLUMBIA COMPANIES

Wilmington, Del. -- The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware today approved the tax settlement the Columbia Gas System, Inc.,
(NYSE:CG) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation entered into with the
Internal Revenue Service earlier this year.

It resolves the $553 million claim filed in 1992 by the IRS in the
companies' Chapter 11 proceedings for contested issues that arose during the
years 1983 through 1990. Under the settlement, the IRS claim is reduced to $63
million in taxes and $49 million in related interest. On an after-tax basis,
taking into account tax deductions that become available in subsequent years,
the final cost of the settlement is expected to be about $46 million.
The earnings impact of the settlement has previously been recorded.

The settlement was previously approved by the Joint Committee on
Taxation of the U.S. Congress.

The Columbia Gas System, Inc., and its principal pipeline subsidiary,
Columbia Gas Transmissions Corp., have been operating as debtors-in-possession
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code since July 31, 1991.
