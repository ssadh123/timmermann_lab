NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF ACQUISITION:

Westwood One entered into the Acquisition to purchase the Unistar
Shares for $16.6 million. In addition, the Company assumed and repaid the
Retained Debt of $84.7 million. Westwood One purchased the Unistar Shares less
the Assigned Assets and the Assumed Liabilities. In addition, INI, a
subsidiary of Infinity, purchased 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock for an
aggregate purchase price of $15 million and received a ten-year warrant to
purchase 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock, which will vest over three years, at
$3.00 per share.

NOTE B - BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet at November 30,
1993 includes the balance sheet of Westwood One at November 30, 1993 and
Unistar at December 31, 1993.

The pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the year
ended November 30, 1993 includes the results of operations of Westwood One for
the year ended November 30, 1993 and the results of operations of Unistar for
the year ended December 31, 1993.

NOTE C - PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED
CONDENSED BALANCE SHEET (in 000's except share amounts):

Amounts in parentheses represent adjustments decreasing historical 
balances.

The summary recap below reconciles Unistar's historical December 31, 1993
balance sheet to the preliminary fair values reflected for Unistar assets and
liabilities acquired, after the allocation of the $16,589 Acquisition of the
Unistar Shares plus $3,500 estimated costs of the Acquisition, aggregating
$20,089. During fiscal 1994, WWO will make its final allocation of the
aggregate consideration paid in connection with the Acquistion. Therefore, the
preliminary allocation reflected below (and the related amortization expense in
the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Operations) may differ
from the amounts and asset categories ultimately determined.

NOTE D -- PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED
CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (IN 000'S, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS):

1. To adjust amortization (i) to conform Unistar's amortization period for
goodwill to the 40 year period used by Westwood One and (ii) to amortize the
value assigned to Unistar station affiliation agreements acquired in the
preliminary purchase price allocation. The Unistar station affiliation
agreements acquired are amortized over their useful life (approximately forty
years) on an accelerated method which approximates the rate at which stations
are projected to terminate their affiliation to the network.

2. To record and adjust for the Management Agreement:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Base management fee due Infinity in connection with the Management 
Agreement........................................................ $ 2,000
Elimination of fees associated with Unistar management agreement 
and compensation and related benefits for certain management of 
Unistar and Westwood One (Chief Financial Officer) which would 
not have been incurred had the Management Agreement been in 
effect........................................................... (2,070)
Compensation expense related to the 1,500,000 Incentive Warrants 
issued in connection with the Management Agreement at various 
prices........................................................... 200
Estimated reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses expected to be 
incurred by Infinity in connection with the Management 
Agreement........................................................ 100
--------
Total adjustment to operating costs and expenses......... $ 230
========
</TABLE> 

3. To adjust historical interest expense for outstanding debt consisting of
the $125 million New Senior Loan (7 1/2% interest rate) and the 6 3/4% 
Debentures. Interest expense will increase or decrease by $156 for every 1/8% 
change in the assumed interest rate. The adjustment also includes straight-line 
amortization, over an assumed eight year period, of deferred costs of obtaining 
the New Senior Loan. The components of the adjustment are set forth below:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Interest and deferred debt cost amortization relating to the New 
Senior Loan...................................................... $ 9,688
Elimination of interest and deferred debt cost amortization 
relating to Unistar's Retained Debt and Westwood One's 9% 
Debentures and certain other debt................................ (11,827)
--------
Total adjustment to interest expense..................... $ (2,139)
========
</TABLE> 

4. To adjust weighted average number of shares outstanding to reflect the
sale of the 5,000,000 Westwood One Shares to INI and the conversion to Common
Stock of the 9% Debentures (the assumed conversion will occur subsequent to the
Closing in connection with Westwood One's redemption of its 9% Debentures).

5. No adjustment reflecting potential cost reductions which may occur as a
result of the Proposed Transaction has been made. Preliminary estimates indicate
a potential annual savings of $3,000 to $5,000 (including the eventual
elimination of any duplicate facilities, although none have yet been
specifically identified). However, no assurance can be given that such savings
will be realized.
