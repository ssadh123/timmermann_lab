Exhibit 99

USAIR PREDICTS FIRST QUARTER LOSS

ARLINGTON, VA, March 7, 1994--USAir today reported that the
negative impact of unusually severe winter weather on its
operations thus far in 1994, and continued incursions by low-cost,
low-fare airlines, cause it to expect a first quarter pre-tax loss
of approximately $200 million and a pre-tax loss for the year in
excess of the $350 million loss reported for 1993.

"While storms in January and February forced us to cancel
about eight percent of our scheduled operations, the principal
cause of our unacceptable loss is the requirement to sharply lower
fares in response to the steady expansion of low-cost carriers into
many of our east coast markets," said USAir Chairman, President and
CEO Seth E. Schofield.

Schofield also reported that British Airways has indicated
that it will not pursue further investment in USAir until it is
clear that an effective cost-reduction program is firmly in place
and USAir's financial performance improves. In the meantime, USAir
and British Airways will continue to expand their code-sharing
program from the current 34 cities to the 66 previously authorized
by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The two airlines will
also move forward with their joint efforts to develop revenue
enhancement and cost-saving synergies.

USAir also confirmed that it will hold meetings with the
leadership of its employee unions today.

Exhibit 99 

USAIR REQUESTS UNIONS TO BEGIN TALKS ON COST REDUCTIONS

ARLINGTON, VA, MARCH 7, 1994--USAir requested the leaders of
its four unions today to begin substantive talks concerning cost
reductions and productivity improvements as part of an overall plan
to return the airline to profitability.

The Company requested that discussions center on pay
reductions and productivity improvements intended to bring USAir's
operating costs closer to those of low-cost airlines that have
recently begun expanding service in many of USAir's East Coast
markets.

"Labor cost reductions are but one of many cost cutting
initiatives that we must take if USAir is to remain viable in a
low-fare competitive environment," said USAir chairman, President
and CEO Seth E. Schofield. "We recognize that we must achieve cost
efficiencies in all areas of the Company."

About 50 percent of USAir's employees are represented by four
unions: The Air Line Pilots Association, the Association of Flight
Attendants, the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers and the Transport Workers Union.

Union leaders stated that they will review the company's
request.
