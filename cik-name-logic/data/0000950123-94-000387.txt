REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Gump's, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gump's, Inc. as
of February 27, 1993 and February 29, 1992, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholder's deficit, and cash flows for the years
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Gump's, Inc. at
February 27, 1993 and February 29, 1992, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Gump's,
Inc. will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the
Company has incurred recurring operating losses, has a working capital
deficiency, and has generated negative cash flows from operating activities.
The Company has agreed to sell substantially all of the assets and certain
liabilities to a third party. The amounts which may be realized from disposal
of the remaining assets and the amounts required to settle the remaining
liabilities are not presently determinable. The operations, current financial
condition, and the asset purchase agreement of Gump's, Inc. raise substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of these uncertainties.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

FEBRUARY 27, 1993

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

On July 10, 1989, GMP Acquisition Corp. ("Company") acquired all of the
outstanding stock of Gump's, Inc., a California corporation and Gump's, Inc., a
Texas corporation for approximately $32.75 million. The transaction was
accounted for by the purchase method and the consolidated assets and
liabilities were recorded at fair values at July 10, 1989.

Since acquisition, the Company has incurred substantial operating losses, has a
working capital deficiency, and has generated negative cash flow. During
fiscal 1993, the Company, its sole shareholder and its senior lender initiated
negotiations with third party investors to pursue alternative financing
arrangements which would retire all or a portion of the outstanding debt. In
May 1993, a third party investor agreed to purchase substantially all of the
Company's assets and to assume certain liabilities at their net asset value as
defined in the agreement and to pay $1.75 million for goodwill and certain
intangibles. The liabilities assumed in the purchase agreement do not include
the amounts of principal and interest due to the bank and the sole stockholder.

While the amount of the proceeds from the sale of certain net assets to Horn &
Hardart and the amount realizable from disposal of the remaining assets are not
presently determinable, nor is it determinable the amounts that the creditors
will agree to accept in settlement of the obligations due to them, it is
reasonable to assume that such proceeds will not be sufficient to repay the
principal and interest. No adjustments have been made in the financial
statements to reflect the realizable value of the remaining assets or
liabilities after the sale of the business to Horn & Hardart. Such amounts may
differ materially from the amounts shown in the accompanying financial
statements.

The Company utilizes the 52-53 week fiscal year convention with its fiscal year
ending on a Saturday near the end of February. The accounts included in this
report reflect activity for the 52-week period ended February 27, 1993 and for
the 53-week period ended February 29, 1992.

Gump's, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED)

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Trade accounts receivable include installment accounts receivable maturing more
than twelve months from the balance sheet date in accordance with usual
industry practice. It is the Company's policy to write off receivables having
amounts over 120 days past due.

INVENTORIES

The Company uses the retail inventory method, which approximates the lower of
cost or market, to value inventory.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated on the basis of cost. Depreciation and
amortization are computed by the straight-line method using a five-year life
for furniture and fixtures, a three-year life for automobiles and the remaining
lease term for leasehold improvements and equipment under capital leases.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Since the acquisition in 1989, the Company has incurred substantial operating
losses and generated negative cash flow. At February 27, 1993, substantially
all of the Company's debt was in default and, while the Company recognized that
the value of goodwill recorded pursuant to the acquisition was impaired, the
amount of the write down could not be determined. Accordingly, the 1992
financial statements were not finalized or separately issued until the
resolution of certain issues as described below.

In May 1993, the Company agreed to sell substantially all of the assets,
certain liabilities and the business of Gump's, Inc. to subsidiaries of the
Horn & Hardart Company ("Horn & Hardart") for the net book value of these
specified assets and liabilities at

-9-
<PAGE> 15

Gump's, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)

July 12, 1993 plus $1,750,001 for the business and all related intangibles.
Because the 1993 sale of substantially all of the

business provided evidence of the amount of the impairment of goodwill at
February 29, 1992, the write-down of goodwill has been recorded in the 1992
financial statements. No amortization was recognized in the year ended
February 27, 1993, as goodwill was written down to its net realizable value.

SOFTWARE COSTS

The Company expenses all costs associated with developing and implementing
software for internal use.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

2. DEBT IN DEFAULT

The Company has three notes due to its senior bank lender aggregating $27
million. The loan agreement requires the Company to comply with certain
financial covenants. The Company has not complied with these covenants during
the two years ended February 27, 1993. The bank has not waived compliance with
these covenants and the entire long-term note payable has been classified as
current in the financial statements.

Two of these bank loans totaling $25 million are secured by a pledge of all
assets of the Company and bear interest at the bank's prime rate plus .75% or
LIBOR plus 1.75% at the Company's option. The third note payable in the amount
of $2 million accrues interest at the Fed Funds rate plus 1.75%.

The Company has a standby letter of credit for $1.7 million expiring on
September 9, 1994 which has been established in favor of the lessor of a store
and provides for an annual fee rate of 1%.

-10-
<PAGE> 16

Gump's, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

2. DEBT IN DEFAULT (CONTINUED)

At February 27, 1993, the Company had not made scheduled principal payments of
$3.4 million on the debt and had not made scheduled

interest payments on the debt or standby letter of credit of $2.6 million.

At February 27, 1993 and February 29, 1992, the Company had three subordinated
notes payable to the sole stockholder totalling $7,152,000. The notes were all
due in 1992 and accrue interest at prime plus .5% or 7.5%. No interest was
paid during 1993 or 1992 and the Company signed additional notes, representing
accrued interest, totaling $782,280 and $709,366 at February 27, 1993 and
February 29, 1992, respectively. These notes are due December 31, 1998 and
accrue interest at 10%.

3. INCOME TAXES

The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $30 million
and $31 million for financial reporting purposes and federal income tax
purposes, respectively. The net operating loss for federal tax purposes
expires primarily in 2004. The utilization of the net operating losses may be
limited under Section 352 of the Internal Revenue Code. The principal
differences between the book and tax net operating losses relate to timing
differences in the recognition of certain expenses for book and tax purposes.

The Company has adopted Financial Accounting Standard No. 96 for financial
reporting purposes. In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes". Companies are required to adopt this new method of accounting
for income taxes no later than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992.
The Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material
effect on the Company's financial position.

4. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan (Plan) that covers all hourly
employees of the Company who are members of Department Store Employees' Union,
Local 1100, who joined the Company on or

-11-
<PAGE> 17

Gump's, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

4. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED)

before their sixtieth birthday and who do not participate in any other
retirement plan to which the Company makes contributions. It is subject to the
provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

Upon normal retirement at age 65, participants are entitled to monthly benefits
for life based on credited years of service as determined under the Plan.
Participants are fully vested in these benefits after five years of service.

The Company's current funding policy is to make annual contributions to the
Plan based on the actuarial determined amount necessary to fund current service
costs and to amortize the past service liability over a 30-year period. The
minimum funding requirements as established by ERISA have been met by the Plan.

The Plan invests primarily in money market and bond and stock funds. The money
market fund consists primarily of investments made by the trustee, Wells Fargo
Bank, in variable demand notes, commercial paper, treasury bills, and
certificates of deposit. Cost approximates market on these investments. All
other investments are accounted for at fair values as measured by market prices
determined by Wells Fargo Bank.

The following table sets forth the funded status and amounts recognized in the
financial statements:

The weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligation for both years presented was 8%. The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for both years presented was
9%. This plan will be terminated effective July 12, 1993.

Effective June 1, 1991, the Company terminated its defined contribution profit
sharing plan for executive employees of the Company which covered all salaried
employees of the Company who had a job classification of assistant department
manager or above, who had completed one year of service and who were not
members of a collective bargaining unit. No contributions were made to the
plan during fiscal years ended 1993 and 1992.

5. SALE OF TRADEMARK AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DIVISION

During fiscal year 1992, the Company sold its product development division to
its sole stockholder, including the related assets of the division, for
$688,140. In addition, the Company sold the right to exclusive use of the
"Gump's" trademark in the Greater Asian Territory for $3,000,000. The gain
recognized from these transactions was $2,734,000.

6. REDEEMABLE, CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

The Preferred Stock has a 10% dividend rate which will accumulate and not be
payable until a future date to be determined by the stockholder. The Preferred
Stock is redeemable at any time at the option of the Board of Directors with
mandatory redemption on December 31, 1998. The redemption price equals $100
per share plus accrued dividends. The Preferred Stock is also convertible into
Common Stock at any time at the option of the holders of Preferred Stock. The
conversion factor is based on a Common Stock value of $169.70 per share
adjusted for future issues or sales of Common Stock.

7. STORE CLOSURE

During fiscal year 1992, the Company closed its two retail stores located in
Dallas and Houston, Texas. The closures had been anticipated at the
acquisition date in July 1989 and appropriate reserves provided. The Company
secured releases for all obligations under its real estate leases for the two
properties from its landlords.

During fiscal year 1993, the Company closed its retail store located in Beverly
Hills, California. The Company was unable to secure a release for all
obligations under its real estate leases from its landlord. The Company is
negotiating with its landlord and has established an accrual for estimated
rental and common area maintenance expenses.

8. LEASE COMMITMENTS

The Company leases computer equipment and an automobile under capital leases.
In addition, the Company leases its store and other facilities under separate
operating lease agreements. All store lease agreements require the payment of
contingent rentals based upon sales of the specific store in addition to
minimum rentals. The Company also has operating leases for equipment. The
minimum payments, under capital leases and noncancelable operating lease
obligations with initial or remaining terms of one year or more, some of which
contain renewal options and escalation clauses, consist of the following:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Gump's, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Gump's, Inc. as
of February 23, 1991 and the related consolidated statement of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended February 23, 1991.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Gump's, Inc. at
February 23, 1991 and the consolidated results of their operations and their
cash flows for the year ended February 23, 1991 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Gump's,
Inc. will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 9, the
Company has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from
operating activities and is currently negotiating with one of its principal
shareholders and senior lenders to change the capitalization of the Company.
The operations and current financial condition of Gump's, Inc. raise
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

FEBRUARY 23, 1991

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

On July 10, 1989, GMP Acquisition Corp. (referred to herein as Gump's, Inc. or
the Company) acquired all of the outstanding stock of Gump's, Inc., a
California corporation and Gump's, Inc., a Texas corporation for approximately
$32.75 million. The transaction was accounted for by the purchase method and
the consolidated assets and liabilities were recorded at fair values at July
10, 1989.

The Company utilizes the 52-53 week fiscal year convention with its fiscal year
ending on a Saturday near the end of February. The accounts included in this
report reflect activity for the 52-week period ended February 23, 1991.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Trade accounts receivable include installment accounts receivable maturing more
than twelve months from the balance sheet date in accordance with usual
industry practice. It is the Company's policy to write off receivables having
amounts over 120 days past due.

INVENTORIES

The Company uses the retail inventory method, which approximates the lower of
cost or market, to value inventory.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated on the basis of cost. Depreciation and
amortization are computed by the straight-line method which assigns a five-year
life to furniture and fixtures, a three-year life for automobiles and uses the
remaining lease term for leasehold improvements.

<PAGE> 30

Gump's, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition costs over the fair value of the net
assets acquired. Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40
years. The deferred loan fees are being amortized over the life of the related
loans. Organization costs are being amortized over 5 years.

SOFTWARE COSTS

The Company expenses all costs associated with developing and implementing
software for internal use.

2. DEBT FINANCING

The Company has a $25 million loan agreement with a bank which provides a
short-term revolving line of credit of up to $7.75 million and a long-term note
payable of $17.25 million. The bank loans are secured by a pledge of all
assets of the Company and bear interest at the bank's prime rate plus .75% or
LIBOR plus 1.75%, at the Company's option. The loan agreement requires the
Company to maintain certain financial covenants, some of which the Company was
not in compliance with at February 23, 1991. In August 1991, the bank waived
compliance with these covenants through the year ending February 1992. The
maturities of long-term debt for fiscal years subsequent to February 23, 1991
are:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

3. INCOME TAXES

The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of $20 million and $14 million
for financial reporting purposes and federal income tax purposes, respectively.
The net operating loss for federal tax purposes expires in 2002. The principal
differences between the book and tax net operating losses relate to the
recognition for tax purposes of certain expenses at the time paid.

4. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan (Plan) that covers all hourly
employees of the Company who are members of Department Store Employees' Union,
Local 1100, who joined the Company on or before their sixtieth birthday and who
do not participate in any other retirement plan to which the Company makes
contributions. It is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

Upon normal retirement at age 65, participants are entitled to monthly benefits
for life based on credited years of service as determined under the Plan.
Participants are fully vested in these benefits after five years of service.

The Company's current funding policy is to make annual contributions to the
Plan based on the actuarial determined amount necessary to fund current service
costs and to amortize the past service liability over a 30-year period. The
minimum funding requirements as established by ERISA have been met by the Plan.

The Plan invests primarily in money market and bond and stock funds. The money
market fund consists primarily of investments made by the trustee, Wells Fargo
Bank, in variable demand notes, commercial paper, treasury bills, and
certificates of deposit. Cost approximates market on these investments. All
other investments are accounted for at fair values as measured by market prices
determined by Wells Fargo Bank.

===========
</TABLE>

The weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligation was 9%. The expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets was 10%.

The Company also maintains a defined contribution profit-sharing plan for
executive employees of Gump's, Inc. which covers all salaried employees of the
Company who have a job classification of assistant department manager or above,
who have completed one year of service and who are not members of a collective
bargaining unit. No contribution was made to the plan for the current year.
Subsequent to February 23, 1991, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a
resolution to terminate this plan effective June 1, 1991.

5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

At February 23, 1991, the Company had a subordinated note payable to one of its
principal stockholders. At February 23, 1991, this note had an outstanding
principal balance of $3,000,000. This note accrues interest at prime rate plus
.5% and is due July 13, 1992. The remaining note, representing accrued
interest, has a principal balance of $643,416 at February 23, 1991. This note
is due December 31, 1998 and accrues interest at 10%.

A Company executive has options, which expire in July 1994, to purchase
additional shares of Common Stock at $169.70 per share to bring his ownership
interest up to 10 percent of the then outstanding Common Stock.

During the year ended February 23, 1991, the Company's stockholders exercised
warrants to purchase 36,964 shares of Common Stock.

6. LEASE COMMITMENTS

The Company leases all of its stores and other facilities under separate lease
agreements. All store lease agreements require the payment of contingent
rentals based upon sales of the specific store in addition to minimum rentals.
The Company also has operating leases for equipment, furniture and fixtures.
The minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under leases obligations
with initial or remaining terms of one year or more, some of which contain
renewal options, consist of the following:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

7. STORE CLOSURE COSTS

Subsequent to February 23, 1991, the Company closed the two retail stores
located in Dallas and Houston, Texas. The closures had been anticipated at the
acquisition date in July 1989. The Company secured releases for all
obligations under its real estate leases for the two properties (from its
landlords). During 1991, the Company revised its estimate of the reserve for
store closure costs and increased goodwill by $3,638,000. The reserves were
established to provide for markdowns to dispose of the inventories at the two
locations, severance costs and costs relating to the termination of real estate
leases.

8. RECAPITALIZATION OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

In July 1990, $12,000,000 of subordinated notes payable held by the principal
stockholders were exchanged for 120,000 shares of $100 par value Preferred
Stock. The Preferred Stock has a 10% dividend rate which will accumulate and
not be payable until a future date to be determined by the stockholders. The
Preferred Stock is redeemable at any time at the option of the Board of
Directors with mandatory redemption on December 31, 1998. The redemption price
equals $100 per share plus accrued dividends. The Preferred Stock is also
convertible into Common Stock at any time at the option of the holders of
Preferred Stock. The conversion factor is based on a Common Stock value of
$169.70 per share adjusted for future issue or sales of Common Stock.

One principal stockholder also purchased an additional 29,664 shares of Common
Stock for $5,000,000 and advanced the Company $3,000,000 in exchange for a
subordinated promissory note.

9. PROPOSED FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING

Since its inception in July 1989, the Company has incurred substantial
operating losses and negative cash flow. The July 1990 recapitalization
discussed in Note 8 was the first of the steps taken by management to
recapitalize the Company and to provide the Company with a solid financial
structure. Management is negotiating with its senior lender and one of its
principal stockholders to convert some of the existing debt to equity and to
provide additional financing through an equity infusion, a larger revolving
line of credit, and restructuring interest and principal repayment schedules
and various restrictive covenants in the existing senior loan agreement.

Management believes that the resulting financial structure will significantly
strengthen the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Shareholders and Directors of
Company Store Holdings, Inc. (Debtor-in-Possession):

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Company Store
Holdings, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and Subsidiaries
(Debtors-in-Possession) as of August 1, 1992 and July 27, 1991 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' investment (deficit), and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 1, 1992.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Company Store Holdings, Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of August 1, 1992 and July 27, 1991, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended August 1, 1992, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Company Store
Holdings, Inc., together with all of its subsidiaries, filed voluntary
petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in
the United States Bankruptcy Court on May 22, 1992. Although the Company and
its subsidiaries are currently operating their businesses as
debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, the
continuation of their businesses as going concerns is contingent upon, among
other things, the ability to formulate a Plan of Reorganization which will gain
approval of the creditors and confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court, and the
ability to generate sufficient cash from operations and financing sources to
meet obligations as they become due. In addition, as discussed in Note 4, the
Company is not in compliance with certain covenants of the post-petition
financing agreement. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company and its
subsidiaries will continue as going concerns and do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of reported asset

amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company or its subsidiaries be unable to continue as going concerns.
The consolidated financial statements also do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of reported asset amounts or
adjustments to the establishment, settlement and classification of liabilities
that may be required in connection with restructuring the Company and its
subsidiaries as they reorganize under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code.

COMPANY STORE HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

August 1, 1992 and July 27, 1991

1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS:

In August 1989, an investor group formed Company Store Holdings, Inc. (the
"Company") which acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Company Store,
Inc. ("The Company Store") on August 11, 1989. In June 1991, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain
liabilities of Scandia Down Corporation ("Scandia"). Consideration for the
acquisition of Scandia was $25,000 in cash and 1,000 shares of the Company's
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In connection with the acquisition of
Scandia, the Company issued shares of its common stock to certain existing
shareholders for total proceeds of approximately $1,200,000.

The acquisitions described above have been accounted for using the purchase
method whereby assets and liabilities are stated at their fair market values at
the date of acquisition and operations of the acquired companies are included
in the consolidated results from the date of acquisition. The excess purchase
price over the net assets acquired is included in other assets.

The Company Store and Scandia market down and natural fiber home furnishing
products and outerwear nationally through direct mail catalogs, national
advertising and retail stores. Substantially all of the home furnishings
products are designed and manufactured by The Company Store. Other products
are designed by The Company Store and manufactured by domestic and
international suppliers for exclusive resale.

2. PETITION FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11:

On May 22, 1992 (the petition date), the Company and all of its subsidiaries
(the "Debtors") filed petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Western District of Wisconsin (the "Bankruptcy Court") and are currently
operating their respective businesses as debtors-in-possession, subject to the
supervision of the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 filing was the result of a
sales and cash shortfall and failed negotiations with the Company's lenders.

As of the petition date, prepetition indebtedness and other contractual
obligations may not be enforced against the Debtors and litigation is stayed.
In addition, prepetition executory contracts and lease obligations may be
rejected and parties affected by these rejections may file claims with the
Bankruptcy Court. Substantially all claims against the Debtors which existed
at the petition date are reflected in the August 1, 1992 consolidated balance
sheet as

-7-
<PAGE> 47

liabilities subject to compromise. It is expected that all claims against the
Debtors as of the petition date will be dealt with in accordance with a plan of
reorganization to be voted upon by all classes of creditors and subject to
approval by the Bankruptcy Court. Management expects to file a proposed
reorganization plan by December 15, 1992. There can be no assurances the plan
will be approved by the creditors or the Bankruptcy Court.

A creditors' committee has been established by the Bankruptcy Court which has
the right to review transactions that are not in the ordinary course of
business. This committee will also participate in the formulation of any plan
or plans of reorganization.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a
going-concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.
However, as a result of the Chapter 11 filings, such realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. While under the
protection of Chapter 11, in the normal course of business, the Company may
sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for
amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
The plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and
classifications reported in the historical consolidated financial statements,
which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or
amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of a plan of
reorganization. The appropriateness of using the going-concern basis is
dependent upon, among other things, confirmation of a plan of reorganization,
and the debtors' ability to comply with the debtors-in- possession and other
financing agreements.

As discussed in Notes 4 and 5, the Company is not in compliance with certain
covenants of its post-petition financing agreement and long-term debt
agreements. In addition, unaudited interim financial statements indicate that
the Company continues to incur net losses.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

FISCAL YEAR

The fiscal year is the 52/53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to July
31. Fiscal year 1992 represents a 53-week period. Fiscal year 1991 represents
a 52-week period. Fiscal year 1990 represents the 50-week period from
acquisition (August 11, 1989) through July 28, 1990.

CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

-8-
<PAGE> 48

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized at the time of shipment. Liabilities have been
established for unfilled cash orders, and the estimated gross profit
attributable to returns under the Company's "unconditional satisfaction
guarantee" policy.

RECEIVABLES

Receivables are net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $341,000 at August
1, 1992 and $138,000 at July 27, 1991.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or
market, and include material, labor and overhead for manufactured products.
Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):

Raw materials $ 5,330 $ 7,877
Work in process 264 578
Finished goods 12,018 12,910

$ 17,612 $ 21,365
=========== ===========
</TABLE>

ADVERTISING EXPENSES

Direct mail catalog costs are deferred and amortized over the estimated periods
that the related revenues are expected to be generated. These deferred costs
of $2,490,000 at August 1, 1992 and $2,623,000 at July 27, 1991 are included in
prepaid expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All other
advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Betterment and renewals that extend
the life of an asset are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are charged to
expense as incurred.

Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over
the following estimated useful lives:

Buildings and improvements 5-31 years
Machines, equipment and furniture 3-10 years

-9-
<PAGE> 49

OTHER ASSETS

Other assets consist primarily of goodwill and franchise rights, recorded in
connection with the acquisitions described in Note 1, amortized over 25 to 40
years. Accumulated amortization of other assets was $ 2,948,000 at August 1,
1992 and $2,450,000 at July 27, 1991.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Interest paid was $2,350,000 in 1992, $1,341,000 in 1991 and $1,323,000 in
1990. There were no income taxes paid in 1992, 1991 or 1990.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Net loss per share has been computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each year. The impact of outstanding stock
options and warrants is not included as there is no dilutive effect in 1992,
1991 or 1990.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts previously reported in the 1991 and 1990 consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the 1992 presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net loss or
shareholders' investment.

4. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS:

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION FINANCING

Prior to the petition date, The Company Store had a loan agreement with a
commercial lender which provided for a revolving credit facility (the
pre-petition revolving credit agreement) with borrowings and international
letters of credit of up to $20,000,000 based upon qualified inventory and
receivable balances. Interest was payable monthly at prime plus 2 1/2%. The
revolving credit facility was to expire in August 1992 with automatic renewals
for successive one-year periods unless terminated by The Company Store or the
lender. The loan agreement also provided for a working capital loan which was
to expire in August 1992. Under the terms of the working capital loan, The
Company Store was eligible to borrow up to specified amounts throughout the
term of the agreement. Interest on the working capital loan was payable
monthly at rates ranging from prime plus 3% to prime plus 4%, based upon the
amounts outstanding. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility and
working capital loan were collateralized by a first security interest in all
inventories and receivables and a second security interest in substantially all
other assets. The loan agreement contained restrictive covenants which
required, among other matters that The Company Store maintain minimum working
capital and financial ratios. In addition, the agreement also imposed
limitations on additional indebtedness, sale of its authorized but unissued
shares of stock and creation of liens.

-10-
<PAGE> 50

As a result of the Chapter 11 filing discussed in Note 2, advances and
repayments under the above agreement ceased as of the petition date. At that
time, the Bankruptcy Court approved an interim debtors-in-possession financing
agreement between the Company and certain of its shareholders to provide the
Debtors with $1,500,000 of borrowings bearing interest at prime plus 2 1/2% to
allow the Debtors to continue to operate their businesses. On July 8, 1992,
the Bankruptcy Court approved the repayment of all borrowings under the interim
debtors-in-possession financing agreement. In addition, the Bankruptcy Court
approved an increase in the amount of available borrowings under The Company
Store's pre-petition revolving credit agreement to $25,000,000. The terms of
this agreement (the post-petition financing agreement) are substantially the
same as the pre- petition revolving credit agreement, with the exception of
certain covenants related to cumulative gross sales demand; earnings before
interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation; working capital; current ratios
and levels of slow-moving inventory. The post-petition financing agreement is
to expire on March 31, 1994 and has been approved by the Bankruptcy Court
through March 31, 1993. In addition, post-petition borrowings under this
agreement were granted a priority security interest over all claims against the
Debtors, with the exception of certain professional fees. The Bankruptcy Court
approved the application of funds received from the sale of inventory or
collection of accounts receivable against the pre-petition balance outstanding
under the revolving credit agreement. Short-term borrowings in the
accompanying 1992 consolidated balance sheet include $8,509,000 of pre-petition
borrowings. Subsequent to August 1, 1992, all pre-petition obligations under
the revolving credit agreement were repaid; therefore, the balance at August 1,
1992 is presented as a current liability not subject to compromise in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

In connection with the post-petition financing agreement, the Debtors agreed to
make payments aggregating $660,000 through January 1993 to the holders of the
secured and mortgage notes payable (see Note 5). As of August 1, 1992, $57,000
had been paid on this obligation and has been reflected as a reduction in the
balances outstanding under these notes.

Subsequent to August 1, 1992, The Company Store was not in compliance with
certain covenants of the post-petition financing agreement as a result of a
shortfall in sales. Accordingly, the lender under this agreement has the right
to lift the automatic stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Court and may exercise its
security interest in the post-petition financing agreement's collateral. As of
September 30, 1992, the lender has not exercised its right to lift the
automatic stay.

Information related to short-term borrowings under the above credit agreements
as of August 1, 1992 and July 27, 1991 is as follows (in thousands):

Long-term debt consisted of the following at July 27, 1991 (in thousands):

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Collateralized note payable with interest at 11.5%, due in
annual installments from July 1992 through March 1996 $13,037

September 2002 6,096
-------
26,037
Less - Current portion 2,717
-------
$23,320
=======
</TABLE>

As a result of the Chapter 11 filing discussed in Note 2, the ultimate payments
to settle the above obligations may be different than the balances reflected in
the accompanying 1992 consolidated balance sheet. Therefore, the amounts
outstanding under the above notes as of August 1, 1992 are reflected as
liabilities subject to compromise on the accompanying 1992 consolidated balance
sheet.

Interest on all long-term debt was payable during fiscal 1992 and 1991 only if
cash flow, as defined, exceeded certain minimum levels as provided in the loan
agreements. As a result of not meeting these cash flow requirements, as
defined, no interest was due for fiscal 1992 or 1991. Accordingly, 1991
interest accrued of $2,584,000 was included in 1991 balances shown above.
Interest of $1,678,000 for the year ended August 1, 1992 is included in
liabilities subject to compromise in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet. Contractual interest of $585,000 incurred subsequent to the petition
date has not been recognized by the Company.

-12-
<PAGE> 52

The collateralized and mortgage notes payable have first security interests in
all land, buildings, machinery, equipment and intangible assets and a second
security interest in the Company's inventories and receivables.

The collateralized and mortgages notes payable debt agreements contained
certain restrictive covenants. The Company was not in compliance with the
terms of these loan agreements as of August 1, 1992.

6. LIABILITIES SUBJECT TO COMPROMISE:

Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, certain claims against the Debtors in
existence prior to the petition date were stayed while the Debtors continued
conducting business as debtors-in-possession. These claims are reflected in
the August 31, 1992 consolidated balance sheet as liabilities subject to
compromise.

Liabilities subject to compromise consisted of the following at August 1, 1992
(in thousands):

7. REORGANIZATION ITEMS:

Reorganization items are incremental expenses and/or losses that have been
realized or incurred by the Debtors as a result of the reorganization process.
Such items consisted of the following at August 1, 1992 (in thousands):

8. INCOME TAXES:

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, as prescribed
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, whereby deferred income
tax assets and liabilities arise from differences between the tax basis of an
asset or liability and the amount reported in the consolidated financial
statements. Deferred tax balances are determined by using the tax rate
expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid

<PAGE> 53

or refunds received. As of August 1, 1992, the Company had a net operating
loss carryforward of approximately $21.5 million which expires from 2005
through 2007. The Company has provided a valuation allowance for the net
benefit of these carryforwards as their realization is not assured.

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

UNION RETIREMENT FUND AND PROFIT SHARING

Under the terms of The Company Store union agreement, The Company Store is
required to contribute 9.0% of all union employee wages to a union-sponsored
multiemployer retirement plan. Contributions to this retirement plan were
$316,000, $347,000 and $300,000 in fiscal 1992, 1991 and 1990, respectively.
The Company Store is also required to pay up to 5% of the union employee wages
as profit sharing based on net income, as defined. No payments to the profit
sharing plan were required for 1992 and 1991.

RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS PLAN

The Company has a retirement and savings plan that covers all nonunion
employees. The Company matches a portion of the participants' contributions to
the plan. Matching contributions under the plan were $65,000, $56,000 and
$18,000 in 1992, 1991 and 1990, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (SFAS No. 106), "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which requires companies to
accrue for postretirement benefits such as health care and life insurance for
employees during the years the employee renders the necessary services to be
eligible to receive such benefits. The Company is required to adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 106 not later than fiscal 1996. The Company anticipates
adopting SFAS No. 106 in the year it is required to do so. The Company has not
yet determined the impact of adopting SFAS No. 106 on future financial
statements; however, the impact is not expected to be material.

10. SHAREHOLDERS' INVESTMENT:

SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

The Company has issued 1,000 shares of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
(Preferred Stock). The Preferred Stock has preference as to dividends and
distributions upon liquidation. The holders can convert the Preferred Stock
into Common Stock of the Company at the rate of 5.4 shares of Preferred Stock
for every share of Common Stock to be issued. The conversion rate is subject
to adjustment if the Company declares any stock dividends, splits or
combinations, as defined.

<PAGE> 54

STOCK OPTIONS

The Company maintains an Incentive Stock Option Plan which provides for the
granting of stock options, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, to
certain key employees and officers to purchase shares of the Company's common
stock at the fair market value at the date of grant ($3,005-$3,125 per share
for all outstanding options). Stock option transactions were as follows for
the years ended August 1, 1992, July 27, 1991 and July 28, 1990:

11. WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK

On June 7, 1991, The Company Store issued warrants to its commercial lenders
enabling the lender to purchase up to 18 newly issued shares of The Company
Store's common stock, as defined, for $25 per share. These warrants replaced
warrants previously issued to the same lender. The newly issued warrants
expire in August 1999, and are exercisable at any time. In addition, the
holder of the warrants may require The Company Store to repurchase the warrants
beginning in August 1994. The repurchase price will be based upon the fair
market value of The Company Store, as defined, at the date of repurchase. The
Company Store may, at its option, retire the warrants anytime after August 1995
upon repayment in full of all amounts due the lender. The repurchase price
under this option is 110% of the fair market value of the common stock at the
date of repurchase.

12. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

The Company Store purchased approximately $10,515,000, $10,644,000 and
$10,150,000 of raw materials from a shareholder during 1992, 1991 and 1990,
respectively. Liabilities

-15-
<PAGE> 55

subject to compromise include approximately $791,000 of amounts due to this
vendor at August 1, 1992. Approximately $716,000 was due to this vendor at
July 27, 1991.

The Company Store had two employment agreements prior to the petition date.
Annual compensation under these agreements was approximately $144,000 for
fiscal 1992 and 1991 and $98,000 for fiscal 1990. The agreements were rejected
in conjunction with the Chapter 11 filing.

The resulting obligation of $382,000 is included in liabilities subject to
compromise in the accompanying 1992 consolidated balance sheet.

The Company Store paid $232,000 and $276,000 of consulting fees to shareholders
during 1991 and 1990. During 1992, the Company paid $98,000 of such fees and
accrued an additional $132,000 which is included within liabilities subject to
compromise.

13. NONCOMPETE AGREEMENT:

In July 1990, The Company Store filed a suit against its former principal
shareholder for breach of a noncompete and consultancy agreement. As a result,
in January 1991, The Company Store and its former principal shareholder agreed
to a revised noncompete agreement. Under the terms of the revised agreement,
the former principal shareholder was to receive annual compensation of
approximately $200,000 through June 1995 and agreed not to compete with The
Company Store through 1998. In addition, both parties agreed to dismiss all
lawsuits related to the alleged breach of the original agreement. This contract
has been rejected in conjunction with the Chapter 11 filing. Liabilities
subject to compromise in the accompanying 1992 consolidated balance sheet
include $617,000 related to this agreement.

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

OPERATING LEASES

The Company is committed under operating leases for distribution and retail
store space, and various computer, production and office equipment. The retail
store leases provide for contingent rentals based on sales performance in
excess of specified minimums. In addition to rent, the Company is also
responsible for real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating
costs associated with the leased facilities. Total rental expense under all
operating leases was $2,136,000 in 1992, $2,331,000 in 1991 and $2,298,000 in
1990. In connection with the Chapter 11 filing, the Company rejected certain
of its lease agreements. The resulting obligation of $198,000 is included in
liabilities subject to compromise in the accompanying 1992 consolidated balance
sheet.

Future minimum lease payments under the Company's remaining leases with initial
or remaining terms of more than one year are as follows (in thousands):

as of July 27, 1991 related to international purchases of merchandise and raw
material. There were no outstanding letters of credit as of August 1, 1992.
Subsequent to August 1, 1992, the Company entered into an agreement with a bank
allowing for the issuance of letters of credit up to a total of $3,000,000.
These letters of credit are to be fully secured by a cash collateral account
located at the bank at the time of the issuance of any letters of credit.

Board of Directors
Tweeds, Inc. :

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tweeds, Inc. as of January

are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Tweeds, Inc. as of January 31,
1993 and February 2, 1992, and the results of its operations and its cash flows

Notes to Financial Statements

January 31, 1993

(1) Description of Company

Tweeds, Inc. (the "Company") is a "private label" men's and women's
apparel direct mail catalog business. The Company, through its Tweeds
catalog, offers distinct lines of clothing to customers throughout the
United States. The Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to
January 31.

(2) Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
method) or market. To the extent market is less then cost, valuation
reserves are established to reduce inventories to their estimated
market value.

(b) Prepaid Catalog Costs

The cost of catalogs is deferred and recorded as prepaid expense.
These costs are amortized based on the estimated future net revenues
over the catalog's estimated useful life averaging approximately
seven months.

(c) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, or in the case of
assets under capital leases, the lower of fair market value or the
present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the
lease. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Property, plant and equipment held under capital leases and
leasehold improvements are amortized straight- line over the shorter
of the lease term or estimated life of the asset.

(d) Deferred Financing Costs

The cost of financing is deferred and recorded as a noncurrent asset.
These costs are amortized straight-line over the life of the related
loan.

-8-
<PAGE> 70

(e) Revenue Recognition

Catalog merchandise sales are recognized when the merchandise is
prepared for shipment, generally the same day shipment occurs.
Advance payments from customers received with orders are classified
as customer deposits and are included in accrued expenses.

Sales returns and customer refunds are included in accrued expenses.

(f) Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for income and expense items
that are reported in different years for financial reporting purposes
and income tax purposes. These deferred income taxes originate
principally from differences in the recognition of depreciation of
property, plant and equipment and inventories valuation.

(g) Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents include cash on deposit and highly liquid financial
instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

(3) Management Plans and Intentions

The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception which have
led to a working capital deficiency. During the current year, management
of the Company implemented a business plan which reduced losses, improved
operating cash flow and is intended to direct the Company toward
profitable operations. This plan included a substantial reduction in the
number of employees and management overhead as well as a reduction of
catalog mailings.

During 1992, the Company obtained a $6,500,000 asset-based line of credit
to finance its working capital needs (see note 5), amended the lease on
its fulfillment center (see note 10) and reestablished trade credit with
major vendors. Also during 1992, the principal investors contributed an
additional $2,000,000 of equity and provided a $2,500,000 collateralized
guarantee of the line of credit (see note 5).

The Company has prepared operating and cash flow projections for 1993 and
1994 which indicate the Company has adequate working capital facilities
to meet its current operating and cash flow requirements while beginning
to profitably grow the business without additional equity contributions
or new credit sources.

(5) Note Payable to Bank and Long-term Debt

During 1992, the Company obtained a $6,500,000 asset-based, revolving
line of credit to finance its purchases of inventories. The line of
credit, which expires in May 1995, bears interest at the lender's prime
rate plus 3 percent (9 percent at January 31, 1993) and is secured by
virtually all of the Company's assets and a $2,500,000 collateralized
guarantee of the stockholders. Availability of funds under the line is
calculated at 35 percent to 50 percent of eligible inventory, depending
on product classification, plus $2,000,000. The line of credit contains
various covenants pertaining to maintenance of working capital and equity
and limitations on the acquisition of property, plant and equipment,
issuance of additional debt, and dividend distributions. All available
cash of the Company is applied daily to the line of credit to reduce the
outstanding balance. The principal outstanding under the line of credit
at January 31, 1993 was $1,608,824.

During 1992, the Company agreed with its catalog printer to convert
$3,581,756 of accounts payable to a term loan. Monthly payments ranging
from $50,000 to $138,557 began in March 1992 and continue through
February 15,1995. The loan includes interest at a rate of prime (as
determined by First National Bank of Chicago) plus 3 percent (9 percent
at January 31, 1993). The loan is secured by a second position lien on
all of the Company's assets. The outstanding balance of the loan at
January 31, 1993 was $2,981,290.

Notes to Financial Statements

The aggregate maturities under this term loan for each year subsequent to
January 31, 1993 are $1,271,169 in 1994, $1,572,595 in 1995 and $137,526
in 1996.

(6) Stockholder's Equity

Effective May 29, 1992, all shares of outstanding Series A Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock were converted to common stock by the
preferred stockholders and all accumulated but unpaid dividends were
waived by the preferred stockholders at the time of conversion. The
Company then effected a reverse common stock split resulting in only
fractional shares. As the Corporation's by-laws prohibit fractional
shares, the recorded amount of the common and preferred stock was
transferred to additional paid-in capital.

Subsequent to the conversion and reverse split described above, 4,986,368
shares of new common stock were issued at a par value of $.01 per share.

Effective January 31, 1993, notes payable issued to investors during 1992
in the amount of $2,004,479, including accrued interest of $42,991, were
converted to 2,004,479 shares of cumulative, nonvoting preferred stock
with a par value of $.01 per share. The holder of each share of the
preferred stock is entitled to receive dividends at a rate of $.10 per
share per year. The dividends are cumulative from the effective date of
January 31,1993 and are payable when and if declared by the Board of
Directors of the Company. The Company has the option to redeem, at any
date, all or part of the preferred stock for the redemption price of
$1.00 per share plus an amount per share equal to any accrued but unpaid
dividends.

The Company has an agreement with its Chief Executive Officer wherein a
certain number of shares of common stock held by him are subject to
repurchase by the Company in the event of his termination. The number of
shares subject to repurchase, at a price of $.01 per share, declines
monthly over a twenty-three month period which began on April 1, 1992.
At January 31, 1993, there were 227,461 shares of common stock subject to
repurchase.

(7) Income Taxes

At January 31, 1993, the Company had available, to offset future taxable
income, net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26,300,000 for
book

The principal differences between book and tax net operating loss
carryforwards resulted from the acceleration of depreciation on equipment
and amortization of capital leases, and capitalization of certain costs
in inventory for tax purposes.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in
February 1992. Statement 109 requires a change from the deferred method
under APB Opinion 11 to the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Under the asset and liability method of Statement 109,
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under
Statement 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Statement 109 must be adopted in fiscal year beginning February 1, 1993.
Upon adoption, the provisions of the Statement may be applied without
restating prior years' financial statements or may be applied
retroactively by restating any number of consecutive prior years'
financial statements.

Upon adoption in fiscal year beginning February 1, 1993, the Company
plans to apply the provisions of the Statement without restating prior
years' financial

statements. It is anticipated the effect of adopting Statement 109 will
not be significant.

(8) Employee Benefit Plan

Prior to July 31, 1992, the Company sponsored a 401(k) Salary Deferral
Plan. The Company elected to match 25 percent of the first 5 percent of
qualified compensation contributed by participants. Company
contributions to the Plan for the year ended January 31, 1993 were
$2,032. Effective July 31, 1992, the Board of Directors terminated the
Plan.

(9) Stock Options

The Company has an Incentive Stock Option Plan (the Plan) under which
options are granted to key employees to purchase shares of common stock
at a price not less than the fair market value at the date of grant. The
options granted vest over a four-year period in increments of 25 percent
per year. Options granted under the Plan prior to May 1992 were
terminated in May 1992 concurrent with the recapitalization. (See note
6). At January 31, 1993, there are no outstanding options under the
Plan, however, the Company has reserved 262,349 shares of common stock
under the Plan.

Options to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock at $1.00 per share have
been issued to a former board member. These options expire in 1995.

During December 1992, options to purchase 13,384 shares of common stock
at $.01 per share were issued to a board member. The options vest over a
two-year period in increments of 50 percent per year. These options
expire in 2002.

Warrants to purchase common stock were issued in connection with certain
loans from stockholders in fiscal 1990. The warrants were terminated in
May 1992 concurrent with the recapitalization. (See note 6).

(10) Leases

In December 1989, the Company entered into a capital lease agreement to
lease computer equipment for a 60-month period. During the year ended
January 31, 1993, the monthly payments under the terms of the lease were
amended. The amended lease requires monthly payments of $11,507 through
December 1995.

Notes to Financial Statements

In October 1989, the Company entered into in agreement to lease a
fulfillment center in Virginia. The original agreement included a lease
term of 25 years from January 1, 1991, and a base rent of $920,688 per
annum. During the year ended January 31, 1993, the lease was
renegotiated. Effective January 1, 1993, the lease term was reduced to a
seven-year period beginning January 1, 1991. The base rent under the
amended lease is $600,000 per annum. On January 1, 1994, and on each
January 1 thereafter during the term of the lease, rent per annum is
subject to an increase of the greater of (a) the rent then in effect
multiplied by 110 percent, or (b) $600,000 plus 1-1/2 percent of the
excess of net sales for the fiscal year which ends in the year for which
the new rent becomes effective over $32,700,000. The original agreement
was accounted for as a capital lease. As a result of the modification of
the terms of the lease, the new agreement is accounted for as an
operating lease. The change in the accounting for the lease from capital
to operating resulted in a gain of $355,445.

In addition, the Company leases offices, operating facilities and
machinery under various operating leases.

The future minimum annual rent required for each of the next five years
and thereafter under the above agreements are as follows:

(1) Description of Company

Tweeds, Inc. (the "Company") is a "private label" men's and women's
apparel direct mail catalog business. The Company, through its
Tweeds and Smythe catalogs, offers distinct lines of clothing to
customers throughout the United States. Previously, the Company's
fiscal year ended on the Sunday nearest to June 30. Effective in
1992, the Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to
January 31. As a result of the change in the Company's year end,
the accompanying financial statements include the period from July
1, 1991 to February 2, 1992.

(2) Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Inventory

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out method) or market. To the extent market is less than
cost, valuation reserves are established to reduced inventories
to their estimated net realizable value.

(b) Catalog Costs

The cost of catalogs is deferred and recorded as prepaid
expense. These costs are amortized based on the estimated
future gross revenues over the catalog's estimated useful life
averaging approximately seven months.

(c) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, or in the
case of assets under capital leases, the lower of fair market
value or the present value of minimum lease payments at the
inception of the lease. Depreciation of property, plant and
equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Property, plant and
equipment held under capital leases and leasehold improvements
are amortized straight-line over the shorter of the lease term
or estimated life of the asset.

Notes to Financial Statements

(d) Revenue Recognition

Catalog merchandise sales are recognized when the merchandise
is prepared for shipment, generally the same day shipment
occurs. Advance payments from customers received with orders
are classified as customer deposits and are included in accrued
expenses.

Sales returns and customer refunds are generally processed upon
receipt of the returned merchandise. At February 2, 1992,
refunds to customers awaiting final processing were delayed due
to deteriorating cash flow. The total refunds due amounted to
$1,246,000 (approximately 12 days) and are included in accrued
expenses.

(e) Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for income and expense
items that are reported in different years for financial
reporting purposes and income tax purposes. These deferred
income taxes originate principally from differences in the
recognition of depreciation of property, plant and equipment
and inventories valuation.

(f) Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents include cash on deposit and overnight repurchase
agreements.

(3) Management Plans and Intentions and Subsequent Events

The Company has a working capital deficiency and has incurred
significant operating losses since its inception. During the period
ended February 2, 1992, the Company was in violation of various debt
covenants under its loan agreements including the primary line of
credit and term loan agreement. Management of the Company was able to
negotiate new agreements with the creditors and was able to comply with
the new agreements (see note 5).

Management of the Company has implemented a business plan to reduce the
losses which have occurred and direct the Company to profitable
operations. This plan includes a reduction of the number of catalog
mailings by 30 percent and a reduction in sales volume by 50 percent
for the spring and fall seasons. The Company has also substantially
reduced the number of employees and management overhead. In addition,
the Company is pursuing a sublease or assumption of the leases for a
portion of its distribution facility and corporate offices.

On May 27, 1992, the Company obtained a $6,500,000 asset-based line of
credit to finance its purchases of inventories. The line of credit is
secured by inventories and a $2,500,000 collateralized guarantee of the
stockholders.

Management believes the newly obtained working capital financing and
the recently implemented business plan provide the basis for improved
operational performance.

(4) Inventories

Inventories consist of the following at February 2, 1992:

(5) Note Payable to Bank and Long-term Debt

The Company previously had available a line of credit in the amount of
$2,000,000, bearing interest at 3/4 percent above the prime rate. On
September 23, 1991, the lender initiated a declaration of the event of
default on the line of credit. The Company subsequently entered into a
Forbearance Agreement on October 29, 1991 to repay amounts totaling
$2,441,000 under the line of credit and term loans. Subsequently, on
December 2, 1991, the Company entered into a second Forbearance
Agreement. This agreement required the repayment of the unpaid balance
of $1,328,000 in weekly installments of $100,000 through December 30,
1991 and the assignment of monthly customer list rental income. At
February 2, 1992, the remaining outstanding principal under the line of
credit and term loan amounted to $164,291. Final payment of this
amount was subsequently made in March 1992.

The Company has agreed in principal with its catalog printer to convert
$3,567,337 of accounts payable to term loan with an initial principal
payment of $60,000 due on March 15, 1992, and continuing with monthly
principal payments of $115,000 with the remaining unpaid principal
balance due on July 1, 1993. The loan will accrue interest at a rate
of prime (as determined by First National Bank of Chicago) plus 3
percent (9.5 percent at February 2, 1992). All accrued interest will
be payable with the final principal payment on July 1, 1993. The loan
will be secured by a second position lien on all of the Company's
assets.

The aggregate maturities under this term loan for each year subsequent
to February 2, 1992 are $1,210,000 in 1993 and $2,357,337 in 1994.

As previously stated in note 3, the Company obtained a $6,500,000
asset-based, revolving line of credit on May 27, 1992 to finance its
purchases of inventories. The line of credit bears interest at the
lender's prime rate plus 3 percent and contains various covenants
pertaining to maintenance of working capital and equity and limitations
on the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. All available
cash of the Company will be applied daily to the line of credit to
reduce the outstanding balance.

(6) Stockholders' Deficit

The Company is obligated to redeem one-third of the Series A and B
preferred stock and unpaid cumulative dividends in September of 1994,
1995 and 1996, or 50 percent of the Series A Preferred Stock on the
consummation of a public offering. The Series

-10-
<PAGE> 87

TWEEDS, INC.

Notes to Financial Statements

A Preferred Stock is redeemable at $84.00 per share plus unpaid
cumulative dividends of $10.08 per annum through September 9, 1989 and
$5.04 per share per annum after September 9, 1989. The Series B
Preferred Stock is redeemable at $17.50 per share plus unpaid
cumulative dividends of $1.05 per annum. The Series B Preferred Stock
is convertible to common stock at the option of the stockholder on a
one-for-one basis and carries voting rights equal to the number of
shares of common stock into which it is convertible.

Accumulated and undeclared dividends on the redeemable preferred stock
was approximately $5,425,000 at February 2, 1992.

(7) Income Taxes

At February 2, 1992, the Company had available, to offset future
taxable income, net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$25,500,000 for book purposes and $25,150,000 for tax purposes. The
carryforwards for tax purposes are scheduled to expire as follows:

The principal differences between book and tax net operating loss
carryforwards resulted from the acceleration of depreciation on
equipment and amortization of capital leases, and capitalization of
certain costs in inventory for tax purposes.

(8) Employee Benefit Plan

The Company sponsors a 401(k) Salary Deferral Plan. The Company has
elected to match 25 percent of the first 5 percent of qualified
compensation contributed by participants. Company contributions to the
Plan for the period from July 1, 1991 to February 2, 1992 were $4,916.

options are granted to key employees to purchase shares of common stock
at a price not less than the fair market value at the date of grant.
The options granted vest over a four-year period in increments of 25
percent per year. The Company reserved 200,000 shares of common stock
under this Plan. These options were subsequently terminated in May
1992 as a stipulation for obtaining the $6,500,000 line of credit (see
notes 3 and 5).

Warrants to purchase common stock were issued in connection with
certain loans from stockholders in fiscal 1990. The warrants were
subsequently terminated in May 1992 as a stipulation for obtaining the
$6,500,000 line of credit (see notes 3 and 5).

Prior to July 1, 1991, a board member was granted options to purchase
75,000 shares of common stock at $1 per share. These options expire in
1995.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPOR

Board of Directors
Tweeds, Inc.
Edgewater, New Jersey

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tweeds, Inc. as of June 30,
1991 and July 1, 1990, and the related statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Tweeds, Inc. as of June 30,
1991 and July 1, 1990, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Tweeds,
Inc. will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial
statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations since its
inception and is in violation of certain debt covenants at June 30, 1991 that
raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going
concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in
Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 1991 AND JULY 1, 1990 

1. DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY

Tweeds, Inc. (the "Company") is a "private label" men's and women's
apparel direct mail catalog business. The Company, through its Tweeds and
Smythe catalogues, offers distinct lines of clothing to customers
throughout the United States. The Company's fiscal year ends on the
Saturday nearest to June 30.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

a. Property, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment is
recorded at a cost, or in the case of assets under capital leases (Note
10) the lower of fair market value or the present value of future lease
payments. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets or the lives of the leases, whichever is less.

b. Inventory - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out method) or market.

c. Catalog Costs - The cost of catalogs is deferred and recorded as
prepaid expense. These costs are amortized based on the estimated
future gross revenues over the catalogue's estimated useful life
averaging approximately seven months.

d. Statement of Cash Flows - For the purposes of the statement of cash
flows, cash includes cash on deposit and certificates of deposit, with
an original maturity of three months or less.

3. MANAGEMENT PLANS AND INTENTION AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Company has incurred significant operating losses from operations
since its inception and was in violation of various debt covenants under
its line of credit and term loan agreement. This resulted in the
notification on September 23, 1991 from the Company's primary lender of
the non-renewal of the line of credit (see Note 5) and an available letter
of credit of $4 million (see Note 10b) at their maturity date of October
31, 1991, and the demand for repayment of the term loan (see Note 5) on
October 31, 1991. In addition, on October 28, 1991, a secondary lender
notified the Company that the available letter of credit line of $5
million (see Note 10b) was terminated and the lender demanded cash
collateral for all outstanding letters of credit. These conditions give
rise to substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern.

The Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement with its primary lender
on October 29, 1991 to repay amounts totaling $2,441,000 under the line of
credit and term loans. Subsequently, on December 2, 1991, the Company
entered into a second Forbearance Agreement. This agreement requires the
repayment of the unpaid balance of $1,328,000 in weekly installments of
$100,000 through December 30, 1991, the assignment of monthly list rental
income, and the balance to be paid on January 10, 1992. Amounts due bear
interest at the bank's prime rate plus 3%.

On November 13, 1991, the secondary lender filed proceedings against the
Company requiring the Company to post 100% cash collateral for outstanding
letters of credit or sought for the appointment for a statutory receiver
to liquidate the assets of the Company and wind up its affairs. This
lender also froze bank accounts totaling $96,000 of the Company located at
this lender's bank. On December 9, 1991, the Company settled this action
and entered into a Security Agreement which required the Company to pay
down and/or cancel letters of credit to the amount of collateral of
$916,000, and grant a first party lien on merchandise purchased with said
letters of credit by December 16, 1991.

Management of the Company anticipates that they will be able to comply
with all of the above agreements.

Management of the Company has also adopted a preliminary reorganization
plan to reduce the losses which have occurred and direct the Company to
profitable operations. These plans include a reduction of

-7-
<PAGE> 98

the number of catalog mailings by 30% and a reduction in the volume of
business by 50% for the Spring catalog season. The Company will also
substantially reduce the number of employees and management by early
January 1992. In addition, the Company is pursuing a sublease or
assumption of the leases of its distribution facility and corporate
offices.

The Company has agreed in principal with its catalog printer to convert
approximately $3.4 million of accounts payable at December 11, 1991 to a
30-month term loan with a balloon payment in 18 months. The loan will
bear interest at the prime rate plus 3%. In addition, the Company is
negotiating with this printer and other suppliers for a minimum 5%
reduction in the cost of goods and services the Company plans to purchase
for the Spring catalog season.

The Company is actively pursuing alternative sources of financing and
anticipates that it will be able to obtain an asset-based line of credit
to finance its working capital needs and an available letter of credit to
finance its purchase of inventory. Management believes that the
operations will require a $2 million line of credit and a $2 million
letter of credit line plus an equity infusion of $1,000,000.

4. INVENTORIES

Inventories consist of the following:

5. NOTES PAYABLE - BANK AND LONG-TERM DEBT

The Company has available a line of credit in the amount of $2,000,000
which bears interest at 3/4% above the prime rate through October 30,
1991. Related debt outstanding at the close of business on June 30, 1991
and July 1, 1990 was $2,000,000 and $-0-, respectively. The Company must
meet certain covenants including a minimum current ratio, debt to adjusted
funds ratio and borrowings cannot exceed 50% of the inventory on hand at
any time.

The Company's long-term debt consists of a term loan payable with interest
at 10.8%. Repayment is due in monthly installments of $13,333 plus
interest which began in July 1989 and continues through June 1993 with a
balloon payment of $173,333 at June 1993.

These loans are secured by receivables, inventory, mailing lists,
furniture, fixtures and equipment. The line of credit and term loan
agreement contain cross-default provisions.

At June 30, 1991, the Company was in default of the debt to adjusted funds
ratio and the current ratio covenants of the loan agreement. A
declaration of the event of default was initiated by the lender on
September 23, 1991. Accordingly, the long-term portion of the term loan
has been classified as long-term debt in default at June 30, 1991.

6. STOCKHOLDER'S EQUITY

The Company is obligated to redeem one-third of the preferred stock and
accumulated dividends on each September of 1994, 1995 and 1996, or 50% of
the Series A Preferred Stock on the consummation of a public offering.
The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at $84.00 per share plus unpaid
cumulative dividends of $10.08 per annum through September 9, 1989 and
$5.04 per share per annum after September 9, 1989. The Series B Preferred
Stock is redeemable at $17.50 per share plus cumulative dividends of $1.05
per annum. The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible to common stock at
the option of the stockholder on a one-for-one basis and carries voting
rights equal to the number of shares of common stock into which it is
convertible.

<PAGE> 99

Accumulated and undeclared dividends on the redeemable preferred stock was
approximately $4,550,000 at June 30, 1991 and $3,050,000 at July 1, 1990.

During the year ended July 1, 1990, the Company issued 135,560 shares of
restricted common stock at $.01 per share to certain individuals. The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined the fair value
of stock and options granted during the year ended June 30, 1991 to be
$1.00 and during the year ended July 1, 1990 to be $.01 per share. The
stock vests based on the individual's length of service and/or a formula
based on the Company's performance. In 1991, the Company repurchased
62,518 shares of restricted common stock which was not earned by the
individual receiving the stock in accordance with the vesting
requirements.

7. INCOME TAXES

At July 1, 1990, the Company had available, to offset future taxable
income, net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $17,900,000 for
book purposes and $17,285,000 for tax purposes. The carryforwards for tax
purposes are scheduled to expire as follows:

2003 3,610,000

2005 720,000
2006 10,950,000
----------

$17,285,000
===========
</TABLE>

The principal differences between book and tax net operating loss
carryforwards resulted from the acceleration of depreciation on equipment
and amortization of capital leases, and capitalization of certain costs in
inventory for tax purposes.

8. BENEFIT PLAN

The Company sponsors a 401(k) Salary Deferral Plan. The Company has
elected to match 25% of the first 5% of qualified compensation contributed
by participants for plan years ended December 31, 1991 and 1990. Company
contributions to the Plan for the years ended June 30, 1991 and July 1,
1990 were $31,755 and $64,113, respectively.

9. STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

The Company has an Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") under which
options are granted are granted to key employees to purchase shares of
common stock at a price not less than the fair market value at the date of
grant. The options granted vest over a four-year period in increments of
25% per year. The Company reserved 200,000 shares of common stock under
this Plan.

Warrants to purchase common stock were issued in connection with certain
loans from stockholders in fiscal 1990.

During 1991, certain board members were granted options to purchase 87,000
shares of common stock at $1 per share. These options expire in 1994.

A summary of the options to purchase the Company's common stock follows:

10. COMMITMENTS

a. Lease Commitments - In October 1989, the Company entered into an
agreement to lease a fulfillment center in Virginia. The lease term is
25 years from January 1, 1991. The base rent of $943,500 per annum is
based on an estimated development cost of $6,800,000 and is subject to
adjustment based on the developers' final cost. The annual base rent
will be adjusted every five years based on the change in the consumer
price index. The lease contains an option for Tweeds to purchase the
building after year five through year nine at 110% of the actual
original development cost subject to certain increases in the consumer
price index.

In 1989, the Company entered into an agreement to lease computer
equipment for a 60-month period. The lease payments included below in
other capital leases are $28,878 for the first 36 months and $2,125 per
month thereafter. The Company may purchase the equipment at the fair
market value as determined in the lease agreement.

Computer equipment, under a capital lease, which is no longer utilized
by the Company resulted in a loss of $288,027 in 1990. The Company
also terminated an office lease in 1990 which resulted in a loss of
$45,736.

The Company leases offices, operating facilities and machinery under
various capital and operating leases.
