NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER 30, 1994 AND 1993

Note 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business Activities

Moran Research Labs (the "Company"), doing business as Bioran
Medical Laboratory, performs pathological and analytical tests
for the medical profession in the New England area. Prior to
January 1, 1994, the Company had operated a hotel (The Snow Inn
Resort) and restaurant (Thompson's Clam Bar), located in
Harwichport, Massachusetts. These operations, which are
totally unrelated to the Company's clinical laboratory business,
were spun-off to the Company's shareholders on January 1, 1994
pursuant to a plan adopted in July 1993.

Interim Financial Statements

The accompanying balance sheet at September 30, 1994 and the
statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for the
nine months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993 are unaudited.
In the opinion of management, these unaudited financial state-
ments include all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the
results of operations and financial position for the respective
interim periods. The results of operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 1994 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation
is computed using both straight-line and accelerated methods
over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from
3 to 40 years. Major classifications of property and equipment
at September 30, 1994 are as follows.

Leasehold Improvements ...............$ 5,733,637
Equipment and Fixtures ............... 5,189,294
Motor Vehicles ....................... 739,326

Property and Equipment, at cost....... 11,662,257

Less: Accumulated Depreciation....... ( 4,240,176)

Property and Equipment, Net ..........$ 7,422,081

Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30,
1994 and 1993 amounted to $ 750,261 and $ 715,447, respectively.

<PAGE>

Note 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.)

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of the testing
process. Billings for service under third party payor programs,
including Medicare and Medicaid, are recorded as sales net of
allowances for differences between amounts billed and the
estimated receipts under such programs. Adjustments to the
estimated receipts, based on final settlement with the third
party payors, are recorded upon settlement.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be taxed under subchapter S of the
Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the Company is not subject
to and therefore has not provided for any Federal income taxes
as the stockholders are taxed on their proportionate share of
the Company's taxable income.

On March 2, 1989, the Company became a Massachusetts Business
Trust pursuant to a tax free reorganization under Internal
Revenue Code section 368(a)(1)(F). This reorganization did not
affect the Company's S corporation status for Federal income
tax purposes, but does subject the Company to Massachusetts
state income taxes. Therefore, a provision for state income
taxes is included in these financial statements.

In 1992, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (FAS 109), which requires
an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes.
Under this method, state deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabil-
ities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates
in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to
reverse. Under FAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period in which the change is enacted.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all short-term investments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

<PAGE>

Note 2 - STATE INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes from continuing operations
is summarized as follows:
Nine Months Ended
September 30,
1994 1993

Income from Continuing Operations
before State Income Taxes .......$ 22,910,993 $ 21,965,364

State Income Taxes:

Currently Payable ............... 1,408,800 1,245,400
Deferred ........................ ( 177,800) ( 97,500)

Total ...................$ 1,231,000 $ 1,147,900

For income tax purposes the Company prepares its tax return
using the cash basis of accounting. The deferred state income
tax liability of $508,700 and $493,000 at September 30, 1994
and 1993, respectively, results from the cash to accrual
basis adjustments.

Note 3 - PROFIT SHARING PLAN

The Company sponsors a profit-sharing plan covering all of its
employees. Contributions, which totaled $230,000 and $205,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993,
respectively, are determined by a vote of the Board of
Directors. The Company files annual plan registration and
insurance information with the Internal Revenue Service, in
compliance with requirements established by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

Note 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company's stockholders own several other businesses,
principally involved in the real estate and food distribution
industries. The Company leases certain real estate from one
of these entities, the S.A. Fennell Limited Partnership.
Rental payments to this partnership for each of the nine
months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993 totaled $630,000.
The other entities operate independently of the Company.

Note 5 - SUPPLEMENTARY DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Non-cash financing activities during 1994 consisted of the
spin-off of the net assets ($7,543,744) of the Company's
non-clinical laboratory operations effective January 1, 1994.

During the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993
income taxes paid were $587,378 and $990,491, respectively.

<PAGE>

Note 6 - LEASE COMMITMENTS

Minimum rental commitments under noncancellable operating
leases outstanding at September 30, 1994 are:

1995 ................. $ 197,905
1996 ................. 130,518
1997 ................. 76,519
1998 ................. 37,704
1999 ................. 16,248

Operating lease rental expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994 and 1993 amounted to $1,018,067 and
$905,412, respectively, including $630,000 paid to related
parties in each year (see Note 4). In addition to its
corporate facilities located in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
the Company maintains satellite operations throughout the
New England area. Many of these facilities are leased through
tenant-at-will arrangements.

Note 7 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Effective January 1, 1994 the Company spun-off its non-clinical
laboratory operations to its shareholders, pursuant to a plan
adopted in July 1993. These non-clinical laboratory operations
(restaurant and hotel) have been accounted for as discontinued
operations in the 1993 financial statements in accordance with
the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30.
Sales, loss from operations, income tax benefit and net loss
associated with these discontinued operations for the nine months 
ended September 30, 1993 are listed below:

Sales ..............................$ 2,718,248

Loss from Operations before
Income Tax Benefit ............... 2,010,203

Income Tax Benefit ................. 120,000

Net Loss from Discontinued
Operations .......................$ 1,890,203

The net loss from the measurement date through September 30,
1993 was $259,737.

<PAGE>

Note 8 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On September 8, 1994 the Company entered into an acquisition
agreement and plan of reorganization whereby all of the shares
of the Company were acquired by Corning Incorporated
("Corning"), a New York business corporation, for 5,960,967
shares of Corning common stock, in a transaction to be accounted
for as a pooling of interest. This transaction was completed
on October 9, 1994.

In October 1994, in connection with the acquisition and plan of
reorganization, the Company acquired the real property owned by
the S.A. Fennell Limited Partnership and leased by the Company
for use in its clinical laboratory operations (see Note 4) in
exchange for 8.41 shares of its common stock. The number of
shares issued was based upon the estimated fair value of the
properties.

financial statements. An audit includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
