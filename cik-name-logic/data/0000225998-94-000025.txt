Item 5. Other Events 

On July 27, 1994, Washington Energy Company made the following press release: 

THIRD-QUARTER LOSS REFLECTS CHARGES 

SEATTLE -- Washington Energy Company (NYSE:WEG) recorded third-quarter 
charges totaling $40.9 million, or $1.74 per share, as it "sets in motion the 
strategy for restoring long-term profitability," Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer and President William P. Vititoe announced today. 

As a result, the company experienced a net loss of $48.9 million, or 
$2.08 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 1994. That compares with a 
$1.7 million loss, or 7 cents per share, for the same quarter one year ago. 
Excluding the charges, Washington Energy lost $8.0 million, or 34 cents per 
share, during the quarter. 

A summary of three-month and nine-month results for the period ending 
June 30, 1994 follows: 

<TABLE>

Loss on common $ (48.9) $ (2.08) $ (33.8) $ (1.45) 

</TABLE> 

Restructuring and other charges 

After-tax charges, totaling $11.9 million, relate to restructuring and 
downsizing Washington Energy's utility subsidiary, writing off costs deemed to 
be unrecoverable and establishing reserves for certain deferred assets. 

By Sept. 30, the utility anticipates a staffing reduction of approxi- 
mately 10 percent from its level of 1,480 employees as of Oct. 1993, the 

2 

beginning of the fiscal year, Vititoe said. 

"While the specific cost savings from the downsizing are not fully 
defined at this stage, our utility's restructuring does consolidate operations 
and eliminate layers of management," said Vititoe. "We are giving our 
customers more direct access to the company and better service. 

"Our reengineering efforts have just begun, yet we already have uncov- 
ered opportunities for greater efficiency. Some require new or upgraded 
systems, while others simply require changes in existing processes. Both are 
now underway. We view this reengineering as an ongoing process that will 
result in continuing improvement in productivity," Vititoe said. 

The charge to earnings covers estimated severance costs as well as costs 
incurred in planning a new headquarters building, which now is not needed. 

In addition, the company established reserves for estimated environmen- 
tal investigation, legal and remediation costs associated with former manufac- 
tured gas plant sites and wrote off certain deferred costs. It also recog- 
nized a liability for its supplemental executive retirement plan to reflect 
recent management changes and the timing difference between payments under the 
plan and the receipt of life insurance proceeds that fund the plan. 

"Obviously, we cannot guarantee that there will be no surprises in the 
future, but we have thoroughly reviewed our books and expensed any items we 
felt would not be recoverable in rates or which represented a risk of probable 
loss in the future," Vititoe said. "In essence we have cleaned-up our balance 
sheet." 

Loss on oil and gas merger 

After-tax charges totaling $29 million relate to the merger of the 
company's oil and gas exploration subsidiary, Washington Energy Resources, 
with Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (NYSE:COG) of Houston. The charges reflect an 
after-tax loss on the merger after establishing deferred taxes of $24.0 
million and include a reserve for a purchase-price contingency. Reserves also 

3 

were established for estimated future losses on transportation contracts and 
certain natural gas futures contracts retained by Washington Energy Company. 

Vititoe explained that the merger "allows us now to concentrate on our 
natural gas utility. It establishes a clear, market-determined value for our 
substantial oil and gas investment and provides the potential for a greater 
level of income, with less risk and diversion of management focus and with no 
need to invest additional capital." 

Dividend unchanged 

Vititoe re-emphasized his commitment not to recommend to the Board of 
Directors any change in the current annual dividend. He noted the strategies 
that the company is employing -- downsizing and reengineering Washington 
Natural Gas, a more collaborative approach to the regulatory process and the 
merger of the oil and gas exploration subsidiary -- form the cornerstone in a 
strategy to improve profitability, and should support the dividend over the 
long term. 

Other factors: rates, weather, growth, merchandise sales 

The third-quarter loss also reflects a lower profit margin for Washing- 
ton Natural Gas due to a $15.4 million annual revenue decrease as a result of 
a rate order for Washington Natural Gas which went into effect in October 
1993. However, future margins will be improved with a rate increase that was 
implemented on June 4, 1994. Washington Natural Gas, with approval from the 
Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission reached a negotiated 
settlement that will increase revenues by $19 million on an annual basis. 

Also, weather during the quarter was approximately 18 percent warmer 
than normal and 1 percent warmer than a year ago. A combination of slightly 
warmer temperatures and shifting by some large-volume customers between 
classes and to alternative fuels lowered gas sales volumes, which were down 
approximately 3 percent. 

The company served 21,300, or 5 percent, more customers compared to a 
year ago, partially offsetting the effects of warmer weather. Washington 

4 

Natural Gas now serves more than 445,000 customers in the central Puget Sound 
region of western Washington. 

Although the company anticipated lower income from Washington Energy 
Company's retail merchandise sales operation, it actually incurred an operat- 
ing loss during the quarter. Most of these merchandising activities were part 
of Washington Natural Gas until Oct. 1, 1993, when the merchandise sales 
operation was reestablished in a new subsidiary . 

12-month results 

Income from continuing operations showed a loss of $1.77 per share for 
the 12 months ended June 30, 1994; excluding the third-quarter charges, the 
loss was 2 cents a share. This is down from income of $1.06 a share for the 
same period a year ago. The 12-month results reflect the same factors that 
affected quarterly earnings. In addition, lower income from retail merchan- 
dise sales operations, a loss from pipeline demand charges and brokerage 
activities and a number of other one-time charges discussed in the prior 
quarters contributed to the 12-month loss. 

The results for the 12-month period also include a charge of 44 cents 
per share for the divestiture of the Unisyn Biowaste Technology operation 
recorded in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. After discontinued 
operations, the company reported a loss of $2.21 a share. 

Summary 

"The third-quarter charges and losses will result in Washington Energy 
Company closing out its fiscal year on Sept. 30 with a loss. However, through 
the restructuring, we have repositioned the company for improved profitability 
in fiscal 1995 and beyond," Vititoe said.

In addition, Washington Energy Company made the following press release on 
July 27, 1994: 

JUDGE DIMMICK DISMISSES SHAREHOLDERS CLASS-ACTION SUIT 

SEATTLE -- A class-action lawsuit brought by two shareholders of 
Washington Energy Company was dismissed yesterday (July 26) by U.S. District 
Court Judge Carolyn R. Dimmick in Seattle. 

The suit, filed by the Hagens & Berman law firm on behalf of two 
plaintiffs, alleged that Washington Energy Company and two of its officers had 
failed to communicate to shareholders the risks associated with a 1992 general 
rate filing by the company's Washington Natural Gas subsidiary. 

In granting judgment in favor of Washington Energy Company, the Court 
noted that relevant information had been available from public records of the 
Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.
