ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On September 23, 1994 Foote, Cone & Belding Communications, Inc. and its 
subsidiary, FCB International, Inc., filed a Notice of Arbitration with the 
London Court of International Arbitration. The respondents are Publicis S.A. and
Publicis Communication, both corporations organized under the laws of France, 
and Publicis-FCB BV, a Netherlands corporation. FCB contends that one or more of
the respondents failed to comply with provisions of alliance agreements dated as
of January 1, 1989 among FCB and its subsidiary and the respondents in relation 
to certain business acquisition transactions.

The parties have agreed from the outset that disputes not otherwise 
resolved are to be settled by international arbitration in accordance with the 
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules administered by the London Court of International 
Arbitration in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The Notice seeks remedies (a) as provided in the agreements, (b) available 
under applicable law, or (c) determined by the Arbitral Tribunal to be necessary
or appropriate.

Publicis Communication owns 19.1% of the Common Stock of FCB. FCB and 
Publicis S.A. own 26% and 74%, respectively, of the common equity of Publicis 
Communication. FCB and Publicis Communication own 49% and 51%, respectively, of 
the common equity of Publicis-FCB BV. Bruce Mason, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer of FCB, is a director of Publicis Communication. Maurice Levy, a 
director of FCB, is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Publicis 
Communication and President of Publicis S.A.

FCB does not believe that its financial position or results of operations
will be materially adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings. FCB
believes the pendency of the proceedings should not materially adversely affect
the operations of Publicis-FCB BV joint venture.
