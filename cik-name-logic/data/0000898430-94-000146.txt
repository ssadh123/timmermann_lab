ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.
- ---------------------------------------------- 

Santa Anita Realty Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Realty"),
and Pacific Gulf Properties Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Pacific"), entered
into a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of November 15, 1993 (the "Purchase
and Sale Agreement"). Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Realty sold
to Pacific ten multifamily properties, containing 2,654 apartment units, located
in Southern California, Texas and the Pacific Northwest, and three industrial
properties, containing an aggregate of 185,000 leasable square feet of
industrial space, located in the State of Washington (the "Transferred
Properties"). Realty's corporate headquarters building, located in Newport
Beach, California, and related assets were also acquired by Pacific. The sale
of the Transferred Properties was consummated on February 18, 1994, following
public offerings of common stock and convertible subordinated debentures by
Pacific. Prior to such offering, Pacific was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Realty.

In the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pacific agreed to acquire Realty's
interest in an industrial property located in Baldwin Park, California ("Baldwin
Industrial Park") subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, for a minimum
price of $8.9 million payable in additional shares of Pacific common stock with
the final price dependent upon completion of negotiations with other owners of
Baldwin Industrial Park and an appraisal process.

2
<PAGE>

Management believes that Pacific's acquisition of Baldwin Industrial Park will
be completed in the second half of 1994.

In consideration of the sale of the Transferred Properties, Realty received
approximately $44.4 million in cash and 149,900 shares of the common stock of
Pacific. In addition, Realty was relieved of approximately $44.3 million of
mortgage debt on the Transferred Properties. Realty will also receive, at the 
time the acquisition of Baldwin Industrial Park is completed, approximately $1.2
million in additional common stock of Pacific as consideration for the corporate
headquarters and related assets (offset by miscellaneous liabilities assumed by
Pacific, including liabilities under employee benefit plans of Realty relating
to those officers and employees of Pacific who were formerly employees of
Realty). Realty and Pacific have also entered into a management agreement
whereby Pacific has agreed to manage certain properties retained by Realty and,
if requested by Realty, to negotiate the disposition of some or all of such
properties. Finally, with respect to the common stock of Pacific owned by
Realty, Pacific has entered into a registration rights agreement with Realty
which, under certain circumstances, allows Realty to require the registration of
the public offer and sale of such stock. To secure its obligations to acquire
Baldwin Industrial Park and pay for the corporate headquarters building and
related assets, Pacific is required to cause to be issued to Realty letters of
credit totaling not more than $2.5 million by March 31, 1994.

3
<PAGE>

The value of the consideration paid for the Transferred Properties was not
based on the book value of those properties, and no appraisals or other
valuations were obtained for any of the Transferred Properties. Rather, the
amount of consideration received by Realty resulted from the allocation of the
ownership interest in Pacific to purchasers of the common stock in Pacific's
public offering, which was equal to the percentage of annualized pro forma cash
available for distribution required to pay cash distributions resulting in an
annual distribution rate of approximately 8.55% of the public offering price per
share of $18.25. The remaining interest in Pacific was then allocated to
Realty.

Realty currently owns 150,000 shares of the Common Stock of Pacific,
comprising approximately 3.7 percent of the outstanding common shares of
Pacific. At the time of the transaction, Glenn L. Carpenter served as 
President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Realty, as well as 
President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Pacific; Donald G. Herrman
served as the Vice President -- Finance and Secretary of Realty, as well as the
Senior Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer of
Pacific; Lonnie P. Nadal served as Vice President -- Acquisitions of both Realty
and Pacific; and Robert H. Grant and Robert E. Morgan served on the Board of
Directors of Realty, as well as on the Board of Directors of Pacific. All of
these officers resigned as officers of Realty, and Mr. Carpenter resigned as a
director of Realty, on

4
<PAGE>

February 18, 1994. Messrs. Grant and Morgan continue to serve on the Boards of
Directors of both companies. All of Pacific's other employees were formerly
employees of Realty.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.
- ------- -------------

In light of the resignation of Glenn L. Carpenter as President and Chief
Executive Officer of Realty (see Item 2), the Board of Directors of Realty has
appointed Glennon E. King as acting Chief Executive Officer of Realty.

PURCHASE-SALE
-------------

2.1 Purchase and Sale. In consideration of the mutual covenants and

agreements hereinafter set forth, on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller agrees
to sell, assign, transfer and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to
purchase from Seller, subject to and in accordance with the terms, provisions,
covenants and conditions more particularly set forth in this Agreement, the
Assets. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer and convey to Purchaser (i) on the Initial Closing Date the Washington
Assets, the purchase price for which will be paid on the Closing Date, and (ii)
on the Closing Date the Nonrental Assets, the purchase price for which (the
"NONRENTAL ASSET PURCHASE PRICE") shall be calculated as specified in Section
2.2 and paid as specified in Article X.

2.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Assets (the "PURCHASE
-------------- 
PRICE") shall be the cash, Shares, assumption or repayment of indebtedness and
the assumption of the other liabilities set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto.
Within 30

9
<PAGE>

days of the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly determine the
Nonrental Asset Purchase Price, which shall equal the amount shown on the books
and records of Seller as of the Closing Date with respect to the Nonrental
Assets, less the amounts shown on such books and records for (a) accumulated
---- 
depreciation and amortization of the Nonrental Assets and (b) the liabilities
described under item D of Exhibit B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Nonrental Asset Purchase Price shall not exceed $1,200,000.00.

2.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be allocated
---------------------------- 
among the Assets in the manner set forth on Exhibit B.

2.4 Property Transfer Agreement. Seller and Purchaser are concurrently
--------------------------- 
herewith executing and delivering to each other a property transfer agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit C (the "PROPERTY TRANSFER AGREEMENT").

2.5 Treatment of Employee Benefit Plans.
----------------------------------- 

(a) Effective as of the January 1, 1994, Purchaser shall take all
action necessary and appropriate to establish two new tax-qualified plans: a
Pacific Gulf Properties Inc. Retirement Plan (the "PGP RETIREMENT PLAN"), which
will be substantially similar to the Santa Anita Operating Company and Santa
Anita Realty Enterprises, Inc. Retirement Income Plan (the "REALTY RETIREMENT
PLAN"), and a Pacific Gulf Properties Inc. Thrift Plan (the "PGP THRIFT PLAN"),
which shall be substantially similar to the Santa Anita Realty Enterprises, Inc.
and Santa Anita Operating Company Thrift Plan (the "REALTY THRIFT PLAN").

10
<PAGE>

However, Purchaser shall be under no obligation to continue to maintain the PGP
Retirement Plan or PGP Thrift Plan so that they are substantially similar to the
Realty Retirement Plan or Realty Thrift Plan, respectively. The PGP Retirement
Plan and PGP Thrift Plan shall assume all of the liabilities under the Realty
Retirement Plan and Realty Thrift Plan, respectively, with respect to the Hired
Employees. "HIRED EMPLOYEES" means those individuals who are employed by Seller
immediately before the Closing and who are hired by Purchaser on the Closing
Date.

(b) Seller will contribute to the Realty Retirement Plan an amount
which in total equals the Seller's portion of the agreed contributions for the
1993 plan year (as shown in the actuarial report prepared by the Seller's
actuary for the Realty Retirement Plan for the 1993 Plan Year). Seller will
cause the John Hancock contract held by the Realty Retirement Plan to be split
into two contracts, one of which shall be transferred to the PGP Retirement
Plan. If the sum of the value of the assets (including receivables) under the
Realty Retirement Plan as of December 31, 1993 (the "RETIREMENT ASSETS") is less
than the present value of the accrued benefits of participants on December 31,
1993, the value of the contract to be transferred to the PGP Retirement Plan
shall equal the portion of the assets that would be allocated to the Hired
Employees if the Realty Retirement Plan had been terminated on December 31, 1993
pursuant to Section 414(l) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(using the assumptions described below). Otherwise, the value of the contract
to be transferred to the PGP Retirement

11
<PAGE>

Plan shall equal the value of the Retirement Assets multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the actuarial present value of the accrued benefits of
the Hired Employees under the Realty Retirement Plan as of December 31, 1993 and
the denominator is the actuarial present value of the accrued benefits of all
participants under the Realty Retirement Plan as of December 31, 1993, but in no
event less than the amount required by the above aforesaid Section 414(l).
Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, the amount transferred shall be
adjusted to reflect gains or losses from January 1, 1994 until the end of the
month prior to the transfer. For purposes of this Section 2.5(b), the present
value of accrued benefits shall be calculated based on the following actuarial
assumptions: an 8.50% pre-retirement interest assumption, an 8.25% post-
retirement interest assumption and the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table. The
PGP Retirement Plan will give all Hired Employees credit for all of their
service with Seller for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual.

(c) Seller will contribute to the Realty Thrift Plan an amount in
cash which in total equals the matching contributions which would be required to
be made for the Hired Employees for 1993. Seller agrees to cause the Realty
Thrift Plan trustee to transfer in two steps to the PGP Thrift Plan an amount
equal to the sum of the account balances attributable to the Hired Employees as
of December 31, 1993 (after completion of allocations for the 1993 Plan Year)
plus all contributions made by or on behalf of Hired Employees to the Realty
Plan after

December 31, 1993. To the extent practicable, the transfer of the assets shall
be made in kind by splitting the insurance contracts and trustee assets held in
the Realty Thrift Plan to preserve as far as possible the investment elections
of the Hired Employees in the various investment funds under the Realty Thrift
Plan. The first transfer shall be made within 15 working days after the Closing
Date and shall be equal to the estimated transfer amount. As soon as the
allocations as of December 31, 1993 are completed, Seller shall cause to be
transferred to the PGP Thrift Plan an amount equal to the difference between the
actual transfer amount and the amount previously transferred. If the actual
transfer amount is less than the amount previously transferred, the PGP Thrift
Plan shall transfer the difference between such amounts to the Realty Thrift
Plan. The PGP Thrift Plan will give all Hired Employees credit for all of their
service with Seller for purposes of eligibility and vesting.

(d)(1) In accordance with Internal Revenue Service Procedure 84-77,
Purchaser will include on the Wage and Tax Statement (Form W-2) issued to each
Hired Employee for the year ending December 31, 1994 all wages paid to
(including "other compensation" as defined under Internal Revenue Service
regulations), and taxes withheld from, such Hired Employee by Seller during such
period.

(2) In accordance with Internal Revenue Procedure 84-77, Seller
hereby transfers to Purchaser any Employee Withholding Allowance Certificate
(Form W-4) in Seller's possession for Hired Employees.

(3) In accordance with Internal Revenue Service Regulation (S)
31.3121(a)(1)-1(b), in determining the "annual wage limitation" of each Hired
Employee for purposes of the Federal Income Contribution Act (FICA) for the year
ending December 31, 1994, Purchaser will include any remuneration received by
such Hired Employee from Seller during such period.

(4) In accordance with 8 C.F.R. (S) 274a.2(b)(viii), Seller hereby
transfers to Purchaser any Employment Eligibility Verification Forms (I-9) in
Seller's possession for Hired Employees.

(5) Seller will supply Purchaser with such information in its
possession regarding Hired Employees for the period between January 1, 1994 and
the Closing Date as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the undertakings
contained herein.

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume all of
Seller's obligations under the deferred compensation agreement between Seller
and Glenn Carpenter and Seller shall transfer to Purchaser all of Seller's
right, title and interest in that certain life insurance policy issued by
Executive Life Insurance Company covering the life of Mr. Carpenter with Seller
designated as the current beneficiary.

(f) The parties agree to cooperate fully to effectuate the terms of
this Section 2.5 including without limitation, the filing of any necessary
government reports and providing each other with such other information in their
possession as may be necessary to effectuate the terms of this Section 2.5.

14
<PAGE>

(g) Nothing in this Section 2.5 shall (i) create any third-party
beneficiary or other rights in employees of Seller or Purchaser, (ii) prevent
Purchaser from terminating at any time after the Closing the employment of any
such employee or (iii) alter the contractual or other rights and obligations, or
limitations thereof, of employees of Purchaser or Seller.

principles relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally.
(c) No consent, waiver, approval or authorization of, or filing,

under any term or condition of (A) the organizational documents of
Seller or any material agreement to which Seller is a party or by
which it is bound, except for those material agreements which require
consent to the transactions contemplated hereby, which consents have
been obtained, or (B) any terms or provisions of any judgment, decree,

(i) There are no material violations of any covenants, conditions or

<PAGE>

terms of renewal options, if any, are set forth in the rent rolls

or its predecessor-in-interest, as lessor, and, to Seller's knowledge,

right of first refusal, option right or other right to purchase all or
any portion of any of the Real Properties, (G) except as set forth in

(l) Exhibit F hereto is a complete and correct list of all material
existing management, service, equipment, supply, maintenance
agreements with respect to or affecting the Real Properties (the
"SERVICE AGREEMENTS") and each of such agreements has not been
amended, modified or supplemented. No written notice of default or
breach by Seller in the terms of any of the Service Agreements has
been received by Seller. Seller has performed, and at the Closing Date
shall have performed, all material obligations which it has under the
Service Agreements. For purposes of this subsection (l), no existing
agreement which is cancelable by Seller or, after the Closing, by
Purchaser on 60 days or less notice shall be deemed material.

(m) To Seller's knowledge, there are no material investigations, actions,
suits, proceedings or claims pending or threatened against or
affecting Seller or the Real Properties, at law or in equity, or
before or by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental
department, commission, board, agency or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign, and no such material investigation, action, suit, proceeding
or claim has been pending during the 12-month period

22
<PAGE>

preceding the date of this Agreement. Seller is not operating under
or subject to, or in default with respect to, any order, writ,
injunction or decree of any governmental authority.

Properties is in good working order and condition.

(o) To Seller's knowledge, there are no pending or threatened requests,
applications, plans, studies or proceedings by any governmental agency
or official thereof to alter or restrict the zoning, institute rent
control or implement additional use restrictions applicable to the

from a government agency that any of the Real Properties are subject
to a redevelopment plan or agreement or are to be included within any

development agreement, owner's participation agreement, or similar
agreement with any governmental or quasi-governmental authority
concerning the use and development of any of the Real Properties.

23
<PAGE>

(q) There are no material contingent liabilities or obligations relating
to the Real Properties, except those adequately covered by Seller's
insurance.

(r) To Seller's knowledge, there has been no material damage to the
Real Properties located in California as a result of the earthquakes
occurring during January 1994. In connection with this representation
and warranty, Seller's representative has visually examined the Real
Properties located in California, but has not engaged the services of
a structural engineer to inspect such properties.

(s) For purposes of the foregoing representations and warranties,
"Seller's knowledge" means the actual knowledge of Glenn L. Carpenter,
Donald G. Herrman and Robert A. Dewey and such knowledge as may have
arisen if one or more of them had conducted a reasonably prudent
investigation with respect to the matters covered by the
representations and warranties. Purchaser is entitled to rely on the
representations and warranties set forth in this Article III,
notwithstanding the fact that any or all of the identified individuals
are or will become officers or employees of Purchaser upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

In addition to the foregoing, Seller hereby represents, warrants and
acknowledges to Purchaser that (i) it has been informed that the Shares have not
been registered under the

24
<PAGE>

Securities Act or under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction;
(ii) it is acquiring the Shares for its own account and without the intention to
distribute same; (iii) it shall not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise
distribute the Shares except in compliance with the Securities Act and the
securities laws of any applicable state or other jurisdiction; and (iv) the
certificates representing the Shares shall be legended to reflect the aforesaid
restrictions on transferability, in addition to the restrictions on
transferability arising under this Agreement and the other restrictions
described in Section 6.5 hereof.

3.2 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
------------------------------------------ 
warranties in this Article III shall survive the Closing; provided, however,
that no claim or action for a breach of any representation or warranty contained
in this Article III may be maintained by Purchaser unless Purchaser shall have
delivered a Notice ("Notice of Breach") specifying the details of such breach
(including, to the extent practicable, a quantification of the damages arising
from such alleged breach) to Seller on or before 18 months after the Closing
Date, except with respect to Section 3.1(g) above which shall be 36 months after
the Closing Date. A Notice of Breach shall only be sufficient to preserve a
claim or action with respect to an alleged breach to the extent the Notice of
Breach sets forth sufficient details identifying the specific breach and a
quantification, to the extent practicable, of the damages arising therefrom.

25
<PAGE>

3.3 Indemnification. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.4 hereof,
--------------- 
Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and holds harmless Purchaser against and from
all liability, demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments,
losses, fines, penalties, costs, damages and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses) sustained
or incurred by Purchaser to the extent that the same occurs as a result of or
arises out of any inaccuracy in a representation or warranty made by Seller in
this Agreement. Seller's obligations hereunder may be satisfied by the delivery
to Purchaser of cash or Shares or any combination thereof. Any Shares delivered
to Purchaser hereunder shall be valued based upon the Current Per Share Market
Price of such Shares on the date that the amount of the obligation pursuant to
this Section 3.3 has been determined.

3.4 Limitations on Indemnification Obligations.
------------------------------------------ 

(a) Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section
3.3 hereof unless a Notice of Breach has been delivered by Purchaser within the
time period specified in Section 3.2 hereof.

(b) Seller shall not be liable under Section 3.3 hereof unless the
total amount recoverable under Section 3.3 hereof exceeds, in the aggregate,
$100,000; provided, however, that if Seller's obligation under Section 3.3
hereof exceeds $100,000 in the aggregate, Seller's obligation under Section 3.3
hereof shall be for the full amount of such obligation.

26
<PAGE>

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Seller
shall not be liable or obligated to make payments under this Agreement,
including amounts funded under Section 3.3 hereof for indemnification, to the
extent such payments in the aggregate would exceed the amount of the Purchase
Price.

(d) Indemnification of Purchaser by Seller pursuant to Section 3.3
hereof and the limited remedies in respect thereof as set forth in Section 3.4
and 3.5 hereof shall be the exclusive remedy of Purchaser (and any assignee of
Purchaser) for any breach of any representation or warranty contained herein,
and the only legal action which may be asserted against Seller pursuant to this
Article III shall be to pursue an action for damages under Section 3.5 hereof,
subject to the limitations provided in this Section 3.4.

(e) Before pursuing any claim for indemnification hereunder with
respect to the falsity of the representations contained in subsections (e), (f),
(h) or (i) of Section 3.1 hereof, including those made by virtue of Section
10.7(a) hereof, Purchaser shall first pursue to completion any claim that it may
have under the applicable title insurance policy referred to in the Property
Transfer Agreement by reason of the facts, circumstances or conditions giving
rise to the falsity of such representation.

3.5 Indemnification Notice; Right of Dispute. In the event Purchaser
---------------------------------------- 
asserts that Seller has an indemnification obligation to Purchaser under this
Article III, Purchaser shall deliver written Notice (the "Indemnification
Notice") to Seller

27
<PAGE>

describing in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to such obligation
and the amount thereof, if then capable of estimation. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, failure by Purchaser to provide the
Indemnification Notice to Seller shall not result in Purchaser's loss of
indemnification rights in favor of Purchaser as described in this Article III
except to the extent that Seller is materially prejudiced or harmed by such
failure to provide notice. If, within twenty (20) days after its receipt of an
Indemnification Notice, Seller delivers written Notice to Purchaser indicating
that Seller disputes the circumstances giving rise to or the amount of its
indemnification obligation, Purchaser may submit such matter for binding
arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII hereof. If after
receiving timely Notice of dispute from Seller, Purchaser fails to so submit the
matter for arbitration within an additional twenty (20) day period from the date
of receipt of Notice of dispute, then Seller shall be relieved of the
indemnification obligation described in the Indemnification Notice.

In the event Seller (i) receives an Indemnification Notice and either fails
to deliver timely Notice to Purchaser of its dispute as to the indemnification
obligation or fails to make payment within thirty (30) days of the delivery of
an Indemnification Notice or (ii) has an indemnification obligation to Purchaser
under this Article III as determined by arbitration pursuant to Article VIII
hereunder and Seller does not satisfy such obligation within ten (10) days after
the decision rendered

28
<PAGE>

in the arbitration, then, in either event (and only in such events), Purchaser
shall be entitled to proceed to seek recovery of such indemnification
obligation, subject to the limitations of Section 3.4 hereof. The enforcement
of any arbitration decision described in clause (ii) above may be prosecuted in
a court of law without the necessity of resorting to arbitration pursuant to
Article VIII.

If a claim for which the indemnification obligations of Seller described
herein arises and relates to a claim, litigation or other action by a third
party (a "Third Party Claim") against Purchaser and Purchaser claims
indemnification therefor, Seller may, by giving notice to Purchaser within a
reasonable time (but in no event more than 20 days) after receipt of the notice
referred to above, elect to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim at its
own expense with counsel selected by Seller. Seller's notice must contain an
acknowledgment of Seller's obligations to indemnify Purchaser with respect to
such claim, litigation or other action; provided, that any such acknowledgement
may contain a reservation of rights. Seller may not assume the defense if the
named parties to the Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include
both Seller and Purchaser and representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them, in which case Purchaser shall have the right to employ counsel reasonably
approved by Seller at the expense of Seller. If Seller timely assumes the
defense of the Third Party Claim, Seller shall not be liable for any fees and

29
<PAGE>

expenses of counsel for Purchaser incurred thereafter in connection with the
Third Party Claim. If Seller timely assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim,
Purchaser may not settle or otherwise compromise the Third Party Claim without
the consent of Seller. If Seller fails to timely assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim, Purchaser may settle or otherwise compromise the Third Party
Claim without the consent of Seller. No such settlement or compromise shall
deprive or impair Purchaser's right to indemnification in respect of a Third
Party Claim, except to the extent Seller can demonstrate that such settlement or
compromise unreasonably and unfairly prejudices the rights of Seller.

--------------------------------------------------------- 
hereby represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

fitness for use for any particular purpose, or the Real Properties'
compliance with any zoning or other rules, regulations, laws or statutes
applicable to the Real Properties, or the uses permitted on or the

33
<PAGE>

or related to the physical condition of the Real Properties or the Personal
Property Assets, including without limitation claims under California Civil
Code Section 1592, which provides: "A general release does not extend to
claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at
the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have
materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

(h) In no event shall the provisions of this Article be deemed to be
a release or waiver by Purchaser of any statutory or common law rights or
causes of action that Purchaser may have against Seller for indemnification

resolved by binding arbitration at Los Angeles County or Orange County,
California, in accordance with this Article VIII and, to the extent not
inconsistent herewith, the Expedited Procedures and Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association.

8.2 Procedures. Any arbitration called for by this Article VIII shall be
----------

(a) Either party (or any permitted assignee of any party) (the
"REQUESTING PARTY") may demand arbitration pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof

(b) Within fifteen (15) days after the giving of a Demand Notice,
each of the Requesting Party and the Responding Party shall select and
designate in writing to the other party one reputable, disinterested
individual (a "QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL") willing to act as an arbitrator of

Party and the Responding Party shall use their

43
<PAGE>

best efforts to select a present or former partner of a disinterested "Big
6" accounting firm having no affiliation or employment relationship with
any of the parties as their respective Qualified Individual to act as
arbitrator. Within fifteen (15) days after the foregoing selections have
been made, the arbitrators so selected shall jointly select a present or
former partner of a disinterested "Big 6" accounting firm having no
affiliation or employment relationship with any of the parties as the third
Qualified Individual willing to act as an arbitrator of the claim, dispute
or controversy in question. In the event that the two arbitrators
initially selected are unable to agree on a third arbitrator within the
second fifteen (15) day period referred to above, then, on the application
of either party, the American Arbitration Association shall promptly select
and appoint a present or former partner of a disinterested "Big 6"
accounting firm having no affiliation or employment relationship with any
of the parties as the Qualified Individual to act as the third arbitrator.
The three arbitrators selected pursuant to this subsection (b) shall
constitute the arbitration panel for the arbitration in question.

(c) The presentations of the parties hereto in the arbitration
proceeding shall be commenced and completed within sixty (60) days after
the selection of the arbitration panel pursuant to subsection (b) above,
and the arbitration panel shall render its decision in writing

44
<PAGE>

within thirty (30) days after the completion of such presentations. Any
decision concurred in by any two (2) of the arbitrators shall constitute
the decision of the arbitration panel, and unanimity shall not be required.

(d) The arbitration panel shall have the discretion to include in
its decision a direction that all or part of the attorneys' fees and costs
of the successful party, and/or the costs of such arbitration, be paid by
the other party. On the application of a party before or after the initial
decision of the arbitration panel, and proof of its attorneys' fees and
costs, the arbitration panel shall order the other party to make any
payments directed pursuant to the preceding sentence.

8.3 Binding Character. Any decision rendered by the arbitration panel
----------------- 
pursuant to this Article VIII, including the determination of any amount of
damages suffered by either party hereto by reason of the acts or omissions of
the other party, shall be final and binding on the parties hereto, except that
the arbitration panel shall not be authorized to award punitive damages by
reason of any such acts or omissions. Judgment on any decision rendered by the
arbitration panel pursuant to this Article VIII may be entered by any state or
federal court of competent jurisdiction.

8.4 Exclusivity. Arbitration shall be the exclusive method available for
----------- 
resolution of claims, disputes and controversies described in Section 8.1

defense to any suit,

action, or proceeding in any court or before any administrative or arbitration
tribunal with respect to any such claim, controversy or dispute. The provisions
of this Article VIII shall survive the Closing Date.

8.5. No Alteration of Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed

to give the arbitrators any authority, power or right to alter, change, amend,
modify, add to, or subtract from any of the provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX
TERMINATION
-----------

This Agreement (including Articles X and XI) may be terminated by either
Purchaser or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before February
28, 1994 unless Seller shall have consented in writing to a Closing Date
occurring after February 28, 1994, as provided in Section 6.3; provided,
however, that if failure to close is the result of a breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant by either party hereto, such party shall not be permitted
to exercise any right of termination. Any termination of this Agreement shall
be effective five (5) days after delivery of Notice of such termination by the
terminating party to the other party, unless the right of termination is
disputed by the other party and such dispute is properly submitted to
arbitration pursuant to Article VIII hereof within such five (5) days, in which
event the effective date of termination shall be delayed pending the results of
such arbitration. Any exercise of a right of termination shall not prejudice or
constitute a waiver or

46
<PAGE>

election of remedies with respect to any other right or remedy which may be
available to such terminating party under the terms and conditions hereof or
under applicable law.

ARTICLE X
BALDWIN INDUSTRIAL PARK
-----------------------

10.1 Transfer of Buyout Right. On the Closing Date, Seller shall
------------------------ 
transfer and assign to Purchaser the rights (the "PURCHASE RIGHT") of Seller set
forth in Section 9 of the Agreement of Limited Partnership of Baldwin Industrial
Properties, Ltd. (the "PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT") of Baldwin Industrial Properties,
Ltd., a California limited partnership (the "PARTNERSHIP"), which entitle Seller
to purchase at the price and subject to the terms set forth in the Partnership
Agreement, (i) the limited partner interests of the Partnership owned by Wm. P.
Willman & Associates, a California general partnership ("WILLMAN"), which
together with the limited partner interests in the Partnership owned by Seller
constitute 100% of the limited partner interests of the Partnership (the

the Partnership (the "GENERAL PARTNER INTERESTS"), all of which are owned by
W.T. Grant and Baldwin Associates, Ltd., a California limited partnership
(collectively, the "GENERAL PARTNERS"). If Purchaser has not exercised the
Purchase Right by September 30, 1994, it shall convey, transfer and assign the
Purchase Right to Seller.

10.2 Purchase of Baldwin Industrial Park. (a) Subject to the terms
----------------------------------- 
and conditions set forth in Section 10.5 hereof,

47
<PAGE>

Purchaser shall purchase for the Baldwin Price all but not less than all of the
Limited Partner Interests owned by Seller. Upon closing of such purchase,
Seller shall transfer to Purchaser, or to a designee of Purchaser, title to the
Limited Partner Interests owned by Seller. The date of the closing of such
purchase is herein referred to as the "BALDWIN CLOSING DATE." In addition to
the rights of the parties to terminate this Agreement set forth in Article IX,
if the Baldwin Closing Date shall not have occurred on or before November 30,
1994, this Article X may be terminated by either Purchaser or Seller, unless
Seller shall have consented in writing to the Baldwin Closing Date occurring
after November 30, 1994; provided, however, that if failure to close is the
result of a material breach of a representation, warranty or covenant by either
party hereto, such party shall not be permitted to exercise any right of
termination. Any such termination shall be effective as specified in Article
IX.

(b) The Nonrental Asset Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller on the
Baldwin Closing Date in the manner specified in Section 10.6.

(c) On or prior to March 31, 1994, to secure the obligations of
Purchaser under this Article X, Purchaser shall provide Seller with two letters
of credit (the "LETTERS OF CREDIT") issued by Union Bank or a commercial bank
reasonably satisfactory to Seller, which shall expire no sooner than November

$1,300,000, both of which may be drawn by Seller if Seller or Purchaser
exercises its right to terminate

48
<PAGE>

this Agreement as specified in Section 10.2(a); provided that the Letter of
Credit described in clause (ii) may be drawn only if all the conditions set
forth in Section 10.5(b) have been satisfied or, if they have not been
satisfied, the failure to satisfy any such condition was due to a material
breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of Purchaser. Upon payment of
the Baldwin Price and the Nonrental Asset Purchase Price by Purchaser to Seller
on the Baldwin Closing Date, the Letters of Credit shall be delivered to
Purchaser. If the Letter of Credit described in clause (ii) if not drawn within
five business days of a drawing on the other Letter of Credit, it shall be
returned promptly by Seller to Purchaser.

(d) IN THE EVENT THAT PURCHASER SHALL FAIL TO PURCHASE THE LIMITED
PARTNER INTERESTS OWNED BY SELLER AS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN, PURCHASER AND SELLER
AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE
DAMAGES WHICH SELLER MAY SUFFER. THEREFORE, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE
PROVISION OF THE LETTERS OF CREDIT BY PURCHASER AND THE DRAWINGS THEREON UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.2(c) SHALL BE FULL AND COMPLETE
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO SELLER FOR SUCH FAILURE AND FOR ANY AND ALL DEFAULTS ON

the Willman Property may, but need not, occur on the Baldwin Closing Date.

10.4 Covenants of Purchaser. Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees for
---------------------- 
the benefit of Seller that:

(a) on the Closing Date or as soon thereafter as practicable, subject
to the provisions of the Partnership Agreement, Purchaser shall exercise
the Purchase Right, which will allow it to acquire the General Partner

parties cannot

50
<PAGE>

agree on a price following such appraisal process, an arbitration
proceeding;

(b) if Purchaser directs Seller to exercise the option with respect to
the Willman Property, as contemplated in Section 10.3(b), Purchaser shall

term "title policy" shall mean an ALTA extended coverage owner's
policy of title insurance (Form B, 1970) dated the Baldwin Closing
Date with liability in the amount of all amounts paid by Purchaser as

marketable and indefeasible fee title to the real property covered by
such policy and the improvements thereon, subject only to those
matters constituting exceptions to and/or encumbrances against such
property as approved by Purchaser.

on a date that is two business days prior to the Baldwin Closing Date.
Certificates representing any such shares delivered to Seller shall bear the
legends required by Section 6.5(a) and be subject to the restrictions set forth

Investor requesting that Company effect the registration under the Securities
Act of all or part of the Eligible Securities held by such Investor, which
notice shall specify the number of Eligible Securities intended to be disposed
of by Investor and the intended method or methods of disposition of such
Eligible Securities, Company will use all reasonable efforts to effect (at the
earliest possible date) the registration, under the Securities Act, of such
Eligible Securities for disposition in accordance with the intended method or
methods of disposition stated in such request, provided that:
-------- 

(a) if Company shall have previously effected a registration with
respect to Eligible Securities pursuant to this Section 3.1, Company shall

(b) Company shall have the right to include in any registration
statement filed pursuant to the request of Investor securities of Company
being sold for the account of Company;

Eligible Securities, calculated by multiplying the number of shares of
Eligible Securities proposed to be offered in such offering by the Current
Per Share Market Price on the date of such notice, intended to be disposed
of by Investor thereby is less than (i) $5,000,000, or (ii), if the
acquistion by Company of the limited partnership interests owned by
Investor in Baldwin Industrial Properties, Ltd., a California limited

Securities owned beneficially by it, $2,500,000;

G-4
<PAGE>

(d) Company will not be required to effect more than three
registrations pursuant to this Section 3.1 (counting for these purposes
only registrations which have been declared or ordered effective, and which
have not been cancelled pursuant to Section 4.3(b));

(e) if, upon receipt of a registration request pursuant to this
Section 3.1, Company is advised in writing (with a copy to Investor) by an
investment banking firm selected by Company (and approved by Investor) to
act as lead underwriter in connection with a public offering of securities
by Company that, in such firm's opinion, a registration at the time and on
the terms requested would materially adversely affect such public offering
of securities by Company (other than an offering in connection with
employee benefit and similar plans) (a "COMPANY OFFERING") that had been
contemplated by Company prior to the notice by Investor requesting
registration, Company shall not be required to effect a registration
pursuant to this Section 3.1 until the earliest of (i) three months after
the completion of such Company Offering, (ii) the termination of any "black
out" period, if any, required by the underwriters to be applicable to
Investor in connection with such Company Offering and agreed to in writing

requesting registration;

(f) if, while a registration request is pending pursuant to Section
3.1, Company determines in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of Company, with the advice of counsel, that the filing of a
registration statement would require the disclosure of non-public material
information the disclosure of which would have a material adverse effect on
Company or would otherwise adversely affect a material financing,
acquisition, disposition, merger or other comparable transaction, Company
shall deliver a certificate to such effect signed by its President or any
Vice President to Investor and Company shall not be required to effect a
registration pursuant to this Section 3.1 until the earlier of (i) the date
upon which such material information is disclosed to the public or ceases
to be material or (ii) 60 days after Company makes such good faith
determination; and

---------------------------------- 
register any shares of common stock or other securities issued by it having
terms substantially similar to Eligible Securities ("OTHER SECURITIES") for
public sale under

G-5
<PAGE>

the Securities Act (whether proposed to be offered for sale by Company or by any
other Person) on a form and in a manner which would permit registration of
Eligible Securities for sale to the public under the Securities Act, it will
give prompt written notice to Investor of its intention to do so, and upon the
written request of Investor delivered to Company within fifteen (15) Business
Days after the giving of any such notice (which request shall specify the number
of Eligible Securities intended to be disposed of by Investor), Company will use
all reasonable efforts to effect, in connection with the registration of the
Other Securities, the registration under the Securities Act of all Eligible
Securities which Company has been so requested to register by Investor, to the
extent required to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended
method or methods thereof as aforesaid) of Eligible Securities so to be
registered, provided that:
-------- 

(a) if, at any time after giving such written notice of its intention
to register any Other Securities and prior to the effective date of the
registration statement filed in connection with such registration, Company
shall determine for any reason not to register the Other Securities,
Company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to
Investor and thereupon Company shall be relieved of its obligation to
register such Eligible Securities in connection with the registration of
such Other Securities (but not from its obligation to pay Registration
Expenses to the extent incurred in connection therewith as provided in
Section 3.3);

(b) Company will not be required to effect any registration pursuant
to this Section 3.2 if Company shall have been advised in writing (with a
copy to Investor) by a nationally recognized independent investment banking
firm selected by Company to act as lead underwriter in connection with the
public offering of securities by Company that, in such firm's opinion, a
registration at that time would materially and adversely affect Company's
own scheduled offering; and

(c) Company shall not be required to effect any registration of

Investor or any underwriter to consummate the disposition in such
jurisdictions of the Eligible Securities covered by such registration

statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
