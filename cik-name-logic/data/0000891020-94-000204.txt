WWP, SIERRA PACIFIC SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE MERGER PROPOSAL

SPOKANE, WASH. AND RENO, NEV.: Shareholders of The Washington Water Power
Company (NYSE: WWP) and Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP), the holding
company of Sierra Pacific Power Company, have overwhelmingly approved the
proposed merger between the two utilities, it was announced today at separate
shareholder meetings held by both companies.

"Today's vote indicates shareholders of both companies have endorsed the
vision of a merged company capable of better meeting customers' and
shareholders' expectations in the coming competitive environment," said Walter
M. Higgins, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer for
Sierra Pacific.

"It is gratifying that so many shareholders from both companies have
supported the proposed merger," said WWP board chairman, president and chief
executive officer Paul A. Redmond. "Their approval of this strategic
combination certainly validates what we have stated from the outset: That this
merger will create a stronger, more viable company better able to compete--and
succeed--in the future."

In an afternoon meeting in Spokane, Redmond announced that more than
39,000,000 of 54,017,315 common shares had been voted in favor of the proposed
merger. Of the total common shares voted, about 93 percent were voted in favor
of the merger. Preferred shareholders also overwhelmingly approved the merger.

Approval of the merger was required by at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of WWP common and preferred stock, each voting separately by
class.

Meanwhile, in a morning meeting in Reno, Higgins announced to shareholders
that the proposed merger had received nearly 22,000,000 of 29,297,550 Sierra
Pacific Resources outstanding shares of common stock voting. About 94 percent
of the shares voted supported the merger. He said 3,253,596 shares of Sierra
Pacific Power Company preferred stock were voted in favor of the merger.

Approval of the merger was required by the majority of shares of Sierra
Pacific Resources common stock. Approval by holders of at least two-thirds of
all outstanding shares of Sierra Pacific Power Company preferred stock and
majority approval of each separate class of Sierra Pacific Power Company
preferred stock was also required.

In addition to shareholder approval, the merger also requires approval by
federal and state regulatory agencies. That process is expected to be completed
in late 1995. Last month, the Montana Public Service Commission became the
first state regulatory agency to approve the merger.

WWP and Sierra Pacific announced the merger on June 28 of this year. Once
completed, the new corporation formed by the merger, Resources West Energy
Corporation, will serve 532,000 electric customers, 290,000 natural gas
customers and 66,000 water customers in five states, based on September 30,
1994, customer numbers.

Added together, the revenues of the two companies totaled about $1.2 billion
in 1993, with net income of $120 million and combined assets of $3.4 billion.
