Item 5. Other Events

On June 27, 1994, the Registrant entered into a definitive
agreement to sell certain education, business and industry (B&I)
contracts and assets of its contract food-service business to
Gardner Merchant Food Services, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of
Gardner Merchant Ltd. for a cash payment of $100 million. The
Registrant will close the remaining B&I accounts. The pre-tax
gain on the sale of the B&I accounts and the discontinuance of
the remaining accounts is expected to be approximately $35
million. The sale is expected to be completed before the end of
the Registrant's first quarter of fiscal year 1995. 

The planned sale of B&I is part of the Registrant's strategy
to invest in high growth businesses that have or can attain a
dominant market position in their respective categories. 
Proceeds from the sale will be used to fund accelerated growth
and for previously authorized share repurchases.
