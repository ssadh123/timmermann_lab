ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On March 14, 1994, Dana Corporation issued the
following press release to Business Wire, for immediate release to national
newspapers and news wire services:

"DANA CORPORATION SIGNS LETTER OF INTENT WITH METALLGESELLSCHAFT AG

"Dana Corporation announced today that it has signed a letter of intent with
Metallgesellschaft AG under which Dana will purchase Metallgesellschaft's
approximate 47% ownership of Kolbenschmidt AG.

"The purchase is subject, among other things, to applicable regulatory
approvals and final approval of the agreement by the boards of both companies.
The purchase price and closing date were not disclosed.

"Kolbenschmidt, headquartered in Neckarsulm, Germany, is recognized globally
as a pioneer of new engineering developments in engine parts. It manufactures
and distributes pistons, piston pins, friction bearings, valves, aluminum
engine blocks and oil and water pumps.

"Kolbenschmidt's 7,600 people serve a worldwide customer base from 26
facilities located in Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Brazil, and the United
States. Its current projection for 1994 sales is approximately $650 million.

"Dana Corporation is a global leader in engineering, manufacturing, and
marketing of quality products and systems for the worldwide vehicular,
industrial and mobile off-highway original equipment markets and is a major
supplier to the related aftermarkets. The company, founded in 1904 and based
in Toledo, Ohio, is pursuing a goal of being a world leader in its products,
with 50% of Dana sales coming from distribution and 50% coming from outside the
U.S. The agreement that could result from this letter of intent would
complement this long term goal.

"Dana operates facilities in 27 countries. Products include the manufacture
and distribution of Perfect Circle brand pistons, piston rings, camshafts,
cylinder sleeves and valve seals, and Victor Reinz brand gasket and oil seals.
In addition, it manufactures drivetrain components, chassis parts, vehicular
structural components, fluid power systems and industrial power transmission
products. The company also owns Dana Commercial Credit, a leading provider of
lease financing services."
