Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed

Financial Information

(1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed financial information has
been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and is not
intended to be indicative of the actual or future results of operations or
financial position of the Partnership. The unaudited pro forma condensed
balance sheet information as of September 30, 1993 has been presented on the
assumption that the sale of the Blue Cross Building (the "Property") had
occurred on September 30, 1993. The unaudited pro forma condensed statements
of operations information for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 and the
year ended December 31, 1992 have been presented on the assumption that the
title transfer of the property had occurred and were completed on January 1,
1993 and January 1, 1992, respectively.

(2) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

(a) The pro forma adjustments to and assumptions for the condensed
balance sheet information reflect transactions involved in the
transfer of the Property. The pro forma adjustments are based on
property operations as recorded under generally accepted
accounting principles for the nine months ended September 30,
1993.

(b) The pro forma adjustments to the condensed statements of
operations are applicable to the operations of the assets of the
Property during the nine months ended September 30, 1993 and the
year ended December 31, 1993. The adjustments are based upon the
Property's actual operations computed in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles for the relevant
periods.
