SUN MICROSYSTEMS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS

MOUNTAIN VIEW, California -- April 6, 1994 -- Sun Microsystems, Inc.,
(NASDAQ: SUNW) today announced that net income for the quarter ended March 27,
1994, was $57.5 million, compared with $51.7 million in the third fiscal quarter
a year ago. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.60, compared with $0.47
in the year-ago period. Revenues for the quarter were $1.196 billion, compared
with $1.141 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 1993.

Michael E. Lehman, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "As we
reported last week, we believe our revenue growth was to some extent affected by
the recent product introductions as some customers elected to wait for the new
products. As a result, total revenues grew less than five percent. However, the
effect of the product announcements appeared to be most pronounced in the
low-end of the desktop product line. As a result, we shipped a higher proportion
of more richly configured systems compared to the prior-year period. The richer
product mix resulted in a gross margin percentage of 42.8 percent, the highest
in the last six quarters, and earnings per share grew 28 percent over the prior
year period."

Sun will be reporting the details of the results of the quarter, including
an income statement and balance sheet, on April 12.
