BANKAMERICA THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS

SAN FRANCISCO, October 19, 1994 -- BankAmerica Corporation today reported
third-quarter earnings per share of $1.36, an increase of 14 percent from
$1.19 for the same period a year ago. Net income for the third quarter of
1994 was $547 million, up 13 percent from the third quarter of 1993. Earnings
for the third quarter of 1994 reflected combined operating results since the
merger with Continental Bank Corporation on August 31, 1994.

"BankAmerica Corporation's third quarter results reflected a substantial
increase in earnings per share over the third quarter of last year, continued
progress in loan growth, and expanded market share in many businesses,"
Richard M. Rosenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said. 

"The completion of the Continental merger gives us significantly improved
access to U.S. wholesale customers, particularly in the Midwest. We are
pleased that the integration of Continental's operations with BankAmerica's is
proceeding smoothly. BankAmerica has already relocated the headquarters of
its U.S. corporate banking business to Chicago and we have established Bank of
America Illinois, which will be responsible for our private banking and
middle-market services in the midwestern United States."

The corporation's earnings per share for the first nine months of 1994
were $3.95, based on year-to-date net income of $1,585 million, while earnings
per share for the first nine months of 1993 were $3.58, based on year-to-date
net income of $1,458 million.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

Net interest income for the third quarter of 1994 was up $23 million from
the amount reported for the third quarter of 1993 due to Continental, which
contributed $40 million to net interest income. The corporation's net
interest margin for the third quarter of 1994 was 4.51 percent, down 21 basis
points from the same period last year, but up slightly from the second quarter
of 1994. 

The provision for credit losses was $110 million in the third quarter of
1994, down $68 million from the amount reported in the same period last year. 
This decrease reflected continued improvement in credit quality in all
portfolio sectors. 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 1994, which included $39
million related to Continental, increased $68 million from the amount reported
in the same period last year. This growth primarily reflected an increase in
other income that was largely due to the sales of an equity interest in Burns-
Fry Holdings Corporation and a Malaysian branch, which resulted in gains of
$36 million and $34 million, respectively. 

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 1994 increased $90 million
from the amount reported in the comparable period of 1993 due to Continental,
which contributed $51 million, and to $50 million of nonrecurring merger-
related expenses. Excluding the effects of the Continental merger,
noninterest expense for the third quarter of 1994 decreased $11 million from
the third quarter of 1993.

Balance Sheet Analysis
- ----------------------

Total loans at September 30, 1994 were up $13.8 billion from the previous
quarter, resulting from $11.2 billion of loans obtained in connection with the
Continental merger, the majority of which are commercial loans, as well as
from continued portfolio growth. Excluding Continental loans, total loan
outstandings increased by 2 percent, with growth in numerous loan categories.

Total nonaccrual assets decreased $138 million, or 6 percent, from 
their June 30, 1994 level. This decrease was largely due to improved credit 
quality in most sectors of the corporation's nonaccrual portfolio and the 
sale of selected real-estate-related assets. Excluding $245 million of 
nonaccrual assets obtained in connection with the Continental merger, total 
nonaccrual assets declined $383 million, or 17 percent. In addition, net 
credit losses for the third quarter of 1994 totaled $106 million, down 
$130 million, or 55 percent, from the amount reported in the same period 
last year.

Upon consummation of the Continental merger on August 31, 1994, each
outstanding share of Continental's common stock was converted into either
BankAmerica Corporation's common stock or cash. The total amount of common
stock issued in connection with the Continental merger was 21.5 million
shares, which included 11.8 million shares of treasury stock previously
repurchased in anticipation of the merger. In addition, an aggregate amount
of approximately $950 million was paid in cash to Continental common
stockholders.

Financial Highlights

BankAmerica Corporation's financial information set forth in the
following tables reflects the effects of the merger with Continental
Bank Corporation (Continental) subsequent to its consummation on
August 31, 1994. 

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
was adopted by the corporation effective January 1, 1994. At that
time, certain held-to-maturity securities were transferred to
available-for-sale securities. In addition, certain debt-
restructuring par bonds and other instruments issued by foreign
governments were reclassified from loans to available-for-sale
securities and held-to-maturity securities, respectively. 

Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39 (FIN 39),
"Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts," was also
adopted by the corporation effective January 1, 1994. To the extent
allowed by FIN 39, the corporation nets unrealized gains and losses
on certain off-balance-sheet instruments. 

Since SFAS No. 115 does not allow retroactive application and the
corporation has elected not to restate prior periods under FIN 39,
prior period amounts have not been restated.

/a/ Due to the first-quarter 1993 adoption of SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes", core deposit intangibles (CDI)
and other identifiable intangibles that are normally deducted
from Tier 1 capital under the current guidelines of the
federal banking regulators were estimated to be $518 million
higher at September 30, 1994 and were $489 million higher at
June 30, 1994 and $516 million higher at September 30, 1993, 
with corresponding increases in deferred taxes. The federal
banking regulators have not issued final capital regulations
on the adoption of SFAS No. 109 and are currently considering
whether such increased intangibles should be deducted from
capital. Management believes that the increased amounts of
CDI and other identifiable intangibles resulting from the
adoption of SFAS No. 109 do not pose a risk to the
corporation's capital and should not be deducted from capital
in determining capital ratios. Pending final resolution of
this issue by the banking regulators, such amounts have not
been deducted from capital in determining the capital ratios
shown above.

/b/ Estimated.

/c/ This leverage ratio is based on period-end total assets rather
than average total assets as this ratio is more indicative of
future leverage ratios. The ratio using Tier 1 capital based
on average total assets was 7.02% at September 30, 1994.
