GRENADA SUNBURST SYSTEM CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the Six Months Ended June 30, 1994 and 1993

(Unaudited)

1. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the accounting policies in effect as of December
31, 1993, as set forth in the annual consolidated financial statements of
Grenada Sunburst System Corporation and subsidiaries ("GSSC", or the 
"Company"). In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a
fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements have
been included and are of a normal recurring nature.

2. The results of operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 1994
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

3. Per share data is based on weighted average shares of common stock
outstanding of 9,492,975 for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 1994
and for the quarter ended June 30, 1993. Per share data is based on weighted
average common shares outstanding of 9,348,072 for the six months ended June
30, 1993. The Company had outstanding 14,478 options on common stock at June
30, 1994 and 1993. Each option entitles the holder to purchase one share of
the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $22.375. These options are
exercisable beginning in 1995. The weighted average number of shares
outstanding at June 30, 1994 and 1993 adjusted for the assumed exercise of
all outstanding stock options using the treasury stock method would be
9,493,979 and 9,348,667, respectively for the calculation of primary earnings
per share and 9,495,112 and 9,348,765, respectively for the calculation of
fully diluted earnings per share. The assumed exercise of these options would
have a less than one-half of $.01 dilution of earnings per share.

4. On July 1, 1994 a definitive agreement was entered into between Union
Planters Corporation (UPC) and Grenada Sunburst System Corporation in which
UPC will acquire all of the outstanding stock of GSSC in a transaction valued
at approximately $361 million based on UPC's June 30, 1994 closing stock
price of $26.75. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, UPC will
exchange 1.4206 shares of UPC common stock for each common share of GSSC, if
the price of UPC common stock is within certain trading ranges. The exchange
ratio adjusts outside the trading ranges. The acquisition, which is to be
accounted for as a pooling of interests, is expected to be completed by year-
end 1994, pending approval by both companies' shareholders and regulatory
authorities and the completion of other closing conditions.
Effective March 1, 1993, GSSC, through its wholly owned Mississippi
banking subsidiary, Sunburst Bank, acquired selected net assets of Eastover
Bank for Savings ("Eastover") in a transaction accounted for as a purchase.
Had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 1993, for the three months ended
March 31, 1993, net interest income for the Company would have increased by
approximately $3,140,000, net income would have increased by approximately
$897,000, and earnings per share would have increased by approximately $.08
per share.

5. Effective January 1, 1994, GSSC adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities". This statement requires investments to be classified in
three categories and to be accounted for as follows: (i) debt securities
which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost; (ii) debt and
equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of
selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in
earnings; and (iii) debt and equity securities not classified as either held-
to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available-for-
sale securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
excluded from earnings and reported as an addition to or a deduction from
stockholders' equity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. The preceding consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
BNF BANCORP, INC. ("BNF"), formerly BANCFIRST Corporation, and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, BANKFIRST, a federal savings bank,
(collectively "the Bank").

2. The preceding consolidated financial statements at June 30, 1994 and for
the quarters and nine month periods ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 have
been prepared in accordance with instructions pursuant to Form 10-Q
Quarterly Report. The consolidated financial statements are unaudited
but, in the opinion of Management, reflect all accruals and adjustments
necessary for a fair presentation of the Bank's financial position and
results of its operations and its cash flows at the dates and for the
periods indicated. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring
nature. The results of operations for the quarter and nine month period
ended June 30, 1994 are not necessarily indicative of results to be
expected for the entire fiscal year of 1994.

3. Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares
plus equivalent shares outstanding. The dilutive effect of shares
issuable under stock options is immaterial.

4. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") Number 114,
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan and SFAS Number 115,
Accounting for Certain Investment in Debt and Equity Securities, were
issued in May, 1993. SFAS No. 114 addresses the accounting by creditors
for impairment of certain loans and applies to all loans that are
restructured in a troubled debt restructuring. It requires that
impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected cash
flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. This Statement
applies to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1994. The Bank has not yet decided if it will elect early
adoption of this Statement, but does not anticipate that adoption of
this Statement will have a material effect on the Bank's financial
statements. SFAS No. 115 addresses the accounting and reporting for
investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair
values and for all investments in debt securities. Those investments
are to be classified in three categories with each having a specified
accounting method as to carrying value and recognition of unrealized
gains and losses. The Bank adopted this Statement for fiscal year
beginning October 1, 1993. As a result of this adoption, certain
investment securities and mortgage-backed securities classified as
available for sale are carried at market value, and $355,000 of
unrealized depreciation, net of related income tax effect, on securities
available for sale is shown as a component of stockholders' equity at
June 30, 1994. Prior to this adoption, at September 30, 1993, certain
investment securities and mortgage-backed securities classified as held
for sale were stated at the lower of cost or market.

5. On January 28, 1994, BNF and Union Planters Corporation ("UPC"),
Memphis, Tennessee, announced the signing of a definitive agreement for
UPC to acquire BNF with an exchange of 1.078 shares of UPC common stock
for each share of BNF common stock. The transaction received final
regulatory approval on July 20, 1994 but remains subject to the approval
of BNF shareholders at a special shareholders' meeting scheduled for
August 29, 1994.

6. On April 18, 1994, the Bank and BANKALABAMA, Huntsville, Alabama,
announced the signing of an agreement for the Bank to acquire
BANKALABAMA's Beltline Road, Decatur, Alabama branch which consists of
approximately $600,000 in deposits and approximately $200,000 in loans
receivable as well as approximately $107,000 in fixed assets. On June
17, 1994 regulatory approval was obtained, and the transaction is
scheduled to be consummated on August 1, 1994.
