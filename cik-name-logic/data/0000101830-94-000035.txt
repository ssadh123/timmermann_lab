SPRINT, TCI, COMCAST AND COX FORGE
UNPRECEDENTED COMMUNICATIONS ALLIANCE

NEW YORK, Oct. 25, 1994 -- Sprint, Tele-Communications Inc. 
(TCI), Comcast Corporation and Cox Cable today announced a 
powerful new venture that will create an unprecedented 
communications alternative, packaging local telephone, long 
distance and wireless communications with cable services into a 
single offering for consumers and businesses.

"This alliance of non-traditional partners -- telephone and 
cable -- will revolutionize what is delivered over your telephone, 
your cable television and your computer," said William T. Esrey, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Sprint. "It is the 
single-source provider that will define telecommunications in the 
21st century. We have the infrastructure, the financial 
resources, the strategic alignment, the marketing presence and the 
strong national and local brand recognition needed to compete 
successfully.

"This venture means competition can be widely introduced in 
the local communications marketplace," he added. "Consumers can 
look forward to the widest possible array of communications 
services delivered with unsurpassed quality and with all the 
assurances and conveniences of a strong national brand."

The cable partners are upgrading their infrastructure to 
allow for delivery of broadband, digital telephone services and 
the next generation of entertainment services. Telecommunications 
products and services with the Sprint brand name and cable 
services and products branded by the cable operators will be 
cross-promoted. The joint venture will offer Sprint branded 
services, using the local cable television systems of the 
partners.

"The venture makes clear economic sense for U.S. telephone 
customers and for the partners," said John C. Malone, president 
and chief executive officer of TCI. "We have a variety of 
services beyond the venture's branded telecommunications service 
that can be packaged and sold by all partners and affiliates on a 
nationwide basis. We have set our sights squarely on a successful 
business -- 21st century broadband integrated telecommunications."

With nearly 290,000 cable miles in place, the joint venture's 
existing facilities today pass approximately one-third of American 
homes. When existing regulatory and legislative barriers to local 
telephone competition are removed, the venture could begin serving 
the first of these homes with seamlessly integrated voice, video 
and data services coupled with wireless within the next year.

"All the partners have consistently and unanimously advocated 
opening the local telephone market to competition," said Brian L. 
Roberts, president of Comcast. "As we have seen in the long 
distance and telephone equipment marketplace, consumers benefit 
when they are able to choose from multiple suppliers. This 
venture offers the best and fastest way to bring competition to 
the last telecommunications bottleneck -- the local telephone 
market. Consumers are the ones who will be hurt unless federal, 
state and local policymakers seize the opportunity to make this 
new age a universal reality and permit all Americans to enjoy the 
true benefits of competition."

The partnership will actively seek affiliations with 
additional cable companies, and it will offer incentives to cause 
other cable companies to affiliate, giving the venture broader 
reach.

James Kennedy, chairman and chief executive officer of Cox, 
said he is confident that other cable companies will realize the 
economic and marketing benefits of the partnership, adding that it 
has already received expressions of interest from possible 
additional affiliates.

"This venture offers a viable alternative for cable operators 
to remain as independent competitors," Kennedy said. "We will 
continue to prosper and grow as we participate in providing to 
consumers -- for the first time in 90 years -- an alternative to 
local telephony service. This partnership will allow us to 
continue to brand video services under the Cox name, while also 
marketing wireline and wireless telephony services under the 
Sprint name. I encourage other cable operating companies to sign 
on."

The joint venture will be owned 40 percent by Sprint, 30 
percent by TCI and 15 percent each by Comcast and Cox.

The partners have signed definitive wireless agreements and 
created partnerships to bid jointly for Personal Communications 
Services (PCS) licenses to be auctioned by the Federal 
Communications Commission in December. "The venture already 
possesses considerable wireless experience and expertise, and 
wireless is an essential component of the venture's package 
of services," said Roberts. "Sprint's long distance network, the 
cable operators' local fiber and coaxial networks and the existing 
wireless capabilities of our companies will serve as the backbone 
that will link new PCS services owned by the venture. We will 
make participation in this venture an attractive opportunity for 
PCS license holders, and we will be particularly interested in 
affiliations with designated entity groups interested in 
partnering with the premier national services provider."

The parties have also signed a detailed joint venture 
formation agreement, which provides the basis upon which they will 
develop definitive agreements for their local telephone 
activities. Additionally, the partners intend that Teleport 
Communications Group (TCG), which is owned by several cable 
television operators and is the nation's largest competitive 
access provider, will be contributed to the venture.

TCG will provide local access for long distance services, a 
direct link to business customers and experience in competing 
against local exchange companies. TCG's broadband metro network, 
which serves 19 major markets and will expand to 25 by mid-1995, 
will also link adjacent cable television systems and will continue 
to provide local access to Sprint Long Distance and other 
carriers. The cable partners are currently in discussions with 
the minority Teleport partner concerning its Teleport interest.

"TCG has demonstrated over the past decade that an 
entrepreneurial company with experienced management and the latest 
technology can successfully challenge the largest local telephone 
monopolies by satisfying consumers' demand for new, improved and 
high-value local telecommunications services," said Kennedy. 

"This partnership is a revolutionary idea in communications," 
Esrey said. "The technology is here, the economics are right and 
the time is now."
