AMERICAN BRANDS ANNOUNCES THAT FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 
WILL CHALLENGE SALE OF THE AMERICAN TOBACCO COMPANY

Old Greenwich, CT, October 27 -- American Brands, Inc. announced
today that the Federal Trade Commission has decided to challenge
the sale of The American Tobacco Company to B.A.T Industries
p.l.c. and will seek to enjoin the consummation of the
transaction. American Brands also announced that it and B.A.T
intend to oppose the FTC's determination. The parties have
agreed not to close the transaction pending the outcome of a
preliminary injunction proceeding, which we expect will be filed
by the FTC on Monday, October 31, in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York.
Commenting on the FTC's decision, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer William J. Alley said: "We are disappointed by
the FTC's decision and intend to oppose its action in court. We
continue to believe that the combination of American Tobacco and
B.A.T's Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation would be pro-
competitive and good for consumers and that the combined
organization would be a stronger competitor against the industry
leaders."
