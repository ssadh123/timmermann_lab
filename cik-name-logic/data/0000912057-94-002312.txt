by Michaels Stores, Inc. on May 23, 1994, as amended by Form 8-K/A
filed June 23, 1994 and Form 8-K/A filed June 30, 1994 (as amended,
the "Form 8-K").

There is hereby added to the Form 8-K a new Item 2
to read in its entirety as follows:

ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

LEEWARDS CREATIVE CRAFTS, INC. ACQUISITION

On May 10, 1994, Michaels Stores, Inc. ("Michaels" or the "Company")
announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement for the acquisition
(the "Leewards Acquisition") of Leewards Creative Crafts, Inc. ("Leewards"),
an Illinois-based arts and crafts retailer with approximately 100 stores
located primarily in the midwestern and northeastern United States. The
Leewards Acquisition was consummated on July 6, 1994 with the acquisition
consideration consisting of approximately $7.9 million in cash and 1,257,279
shares of Michaels common stock, par value $.10 per share ("Michaels Common
Stock"). Upon consummation of the Leewards Acquisition, Michaels also repaid
approximately $39.6 million of Leewards' indebtedness. In connection with the
Leewards Acquisition, the Company expects to close approximately 20 Leewards
stores and may close up to 10 Michaels stores due to overlapping locations.
The cash portion of the purchase price was funded by borrowings under the
Company's revolving credit facility with NationsBank of Texas, N.A.

The Company has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No.
33-53639), as amended, relating to a public offering of Michaels Common Stock,
which is expected to close July 20, 1994. The offering includes the sale by
certain Leewards stockholders of 356,213 shares of Michaels Common Stock
received by them in connection with the Leewards Acquisition.

Item 5 of the Form 8-K is hereby amended to read in its entirety as
follows:

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS

In February 1994, the Company acquired Treasure House Stores, Inc.,
("Treasure House") a chain of nine arts and crafts stores operating primarily
in the Seattle market, for 280,000 shares of Michaels Common Stock. In April
1994, the Company acquired the affiliated arts and crafts store chains of
Oregon Craft & Floral Supply Co. ("Oregon Craft & Floral") with eight stores
located primarily in the Portland, Oregon area, and H&H Craft & Floral
Supply Co., ("HCH Craft & Floral") with eight stores located in southern
California, for a total of 455,000 shares of Michaels Common Stock. The
Treasure House stores have been converted to the Michaels format and the
Oregon Craft & Floral and the H&H Craft and Floral stores are being converted
to the Michaels format with grand openings scheduled for July through August
of this year.

ANTICIPATED STORE CLOSING AND CONVERSION COSTS

Subsequent to the Leewards Acquisition, Michaels expects to close
approximately 20 Leewards stores and may close up to 10 existing Michaels
stores in connection with the elimination of stores in overlapping markets.
In addition, Michaels will integrate and reconfigure the remaining 80 Leewards
stores to be more consistent with the merchandising strategy of Michaels. The
Company has made no final decision as to which Michaels stores, if any, are
to be closed pending the evaluation of anticipated store performance and the
completion of lease negotiations. The costs associated with the closing of any
Michaels stores, which the Company believes will not exceed $7 million on a
pre-tax basis, as well as certain costs of reconfiguring the 80 continuing
Leewards stores, will be charged to earnings in the period such decisions are
made and the related costs are estimable. The costs of closing the acquired
Leewards store locations will be included as an adjustment to the purchase
price of the Leewards Acquisition. See Item 7.

NEW CREDIT FACILITY

In June 1994, Michaels entered into a new three-year, unsecured $150
million revolving credit facility to replace its former $100 million
revolving credit facility.

Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements of Michaels and Leewards

<PAGE>
PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of income of the
Company for the year ended January 30, 1994 and the quarter ended May 1, 1994
have been prepared as if the Leewards Acquisition, which will be accounted for
by the purchase method of accounting, occurred on February 1, 1993, the
beginning of fiscal year 1993. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined
balance sheet of the Company as of May 1, 1994 has been prepared as if the
Leewards Acquisition occurred on that date.

The historical financial information of the Company and Leewards has been
derived from the respective historical financial statements incorporated by
reference or included herein. Certain amounts in the statements of operations of
Leewards for fiscal year 1993 and the quarter ended May 1, 1994 included in the
pro forma combined statements of income have been reclassified to conform to the
method of presentation used by Michaels. The pro forma adjustments are
preliminary and are based upon available information and assumptions that
management of the Company believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma
combined financial statements do not purport to represent the financial position
or results of operations which would have occurred had such transactions been
consummated on the dates indicated or the Company's financial position or
results of operations for any future date or period. These unaudited pro forma
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical financial
statements of the Company and Leewards.

The pro forma combined financial statements do not include the financial
statements of 1) Treasure House, which was acquired by the Company in February
1994 and will be accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method of
accounting, or 2) Oregon Craft & Floral and H&H Craft & Floral, which were
acquired as of May 1, 1994 and will be accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting, since the acquisitions are not considered material, individually
or in the aggregate, to the operating results or financial position of the
Company. Sales of Treasure House were approximately $15.6 million and $3.8
million for the year ended January 30, 1994 and the quarter ended May 1, 1994,
respectively. Combined sales of Oregon Craft & Floral and H&H Craft & Floral for
the same periods were approximately $41.8 million and $7.4 million,
respectively.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

Adjustments to the pro forma combined statement of income to reflect the
consummation of the Leewards Acquisition as of February 1, 1993 are as follows:

(A) To eliminate revenues and related operating expenses of 20
overlapping Leewards stores to be closed subsequent to the consummation of
the Leewards Acquisition. Revenues are expected to increase in nearby
Michaels stores; however, the anticipated revenue increase has not been
reflected.

(B) To eliminate nonrecurring costs, primarily rental and related
occupancy costs, associated with the Leewards distribution center, net of
incremental costs to be incurred at the Company's distribution center. Upon
consummation of the Leewards Acquisition and completion of the conversion of
the Leewards stores, the Leewards distribution center is to be closed.

(C) To adjust selling, general and administrative expense to (i) account
for pre-opening costs incurred by Leewards consistent with the Company's
accounting policy whereby pre-opening costs are expensed in the fiscal year
in which the store opens by increasing (decreasing) expense by $2.0 million
and $(840,000) for the year ended January 30, 1994 and the quarter ended May
1, 1994, respectively, and (ii) eliminate nonrecurring costs, primarily
salaries and related benefits, associated with reductions of Leewards
corporate personnel and other costs of approximately $1.6 million and
$494,000 for the year ended January 30, 1994 and the quarter ended May 1,
1994, respectively.

(D) To amortize costs in excess of net assets acquired over a 40-year
period on a straight-line basis. The Company will assess the recoverability
of costs in excess of net assets acquired annually based on existing facts
and circumstances. The Company will measure the recoverability of this asset
on an on-going basis based on projected earnings before interest,
depreciation and amortization, on an undiscounted basis. Should the
Company's assessment indicate an impairment of this asset in the future, an
appropriate write-down will be recorded.

(E) To reduce the interest expense on the Leewards indebtedness
consisting of approximately $17 million of subordinated debentures and
short-term borrowings (average outstanding borrowings approximated $11.5
million for the year ended January 30, 1994 and $16.8 million for the
quarter ended May 1, 1994) from their stated rates of 13.5% and 7.75%,
respectively, to 4.9%, which rate approximates the Company's incremental
borrowing rate for both of the periods presented. In connection with the
Leewards Acquisition, the Leewards subordinated debentures and short-term
borrowings are required to be repaid.

(F) To reflect the tax effects applicable to the above entries,
exclusive of the amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired, at
a 40% effective tax rate.

Adjustments to the pro forma balance sheet to reflect the consummation
of the Leewards Acquisition as of May 1, 1994 are as follows:

(G) To record the costs of the Leewards Acquisition. Cash payments and
shares issued are based on a five day average stock price and closing stock
price on July 5, 1994 of $33.80 and $31.75, respectively.

Board of Directors
Leewards Creative Crafts, Inc.
Elgin, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Leewards Creative Crafts,
Inc. as of January 31, 1993 and January 30, 1994 and the related statements of
operations, of redeemable preferred stock and common stockholders' equity, and
of cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Leewards Creative Crafts, Inc. as of January
31, 1993 and January 30, 1994 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 11, the Company has entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the "Agreement") whereby it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASIS OF PRESENTATION -- The accompanying
financial statements and related footnote disclosures of Leewards Creative
Crafts, Inc. (the "Company") as of May 1, 1994 and for the three months then
ended and for the three months ended May 2, 1993 are unaudited. In the opinion
of management, these statements have been prepared on the same basis as the
audited financial statements and include all adjustments, which are of a normal
and recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. The results of operations for the three
months ended May 1, 1994 and May 2, 1993 are not necessarily indicative of the
results which may be expected for the entire year.

OPERATIONS AND RESTRUCTURING

The Company engages in the retail sale of craft and home decor products. The
Company maintained the following number of Company-operated and franchised
stores at:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
COMPANY-
OPERATED FRANCHISES TOTAL
--------------- --------------- -----
<S> <C> <C> <C>
January 31, 1993......................................................... 85 2 87
January 30, 1994......................................................... 99 3 102
</TABLE>

During the year ended January 31, 1993, the Company effected a restructuring
of its debt (Note 4), capital structure (Note 6) and ongoing operations. Costs
associated with these efforts, other than those directly associated with the
debt and capital restructurings, are included in restructuring expenses. Such
expenses include store closing, severance and other costs incurred in connection
with these efforts.

FISCAL YEAR-END -- The Company's fiscal year-end is the Sunday closest to
January 31.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents include cash; amounts
due from major credit card companies, which are collected within 1 to 2 days
after date of sale; and highly liquid investments which, at time of purchase,
have maturities of three months or less.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES -- Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower
of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market. During the year ended January 31,
1993, LIFO inventories were reduced from levels at the beginning of the year,
which reduction of LIFO inventory quantities had no material effect on 1993
operating earnings. Inventories at January 31, 1993, January 30, 1994, May 2,
1993 and May 1, 1994 were valued at market which was lower than LIFO cost.

PRE-OPENING COSTS -- Pre-opening costs incurred for the opening of retail
locations are deferred and amortized over 12 months, commencing in the month
after the location opens. Unamortized deferred pre-opening costs included in
prepaid expenses were $97,000 and $2,208,000 at January 31, 1993 and January 30,
1994, respectively.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT -- Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Buildings and improvements.................. 25-30 years
Leasehold improvements...................... Shorter of lease term or 10 years
Machinery and equipment..................... 3-10 years
</TABLE>

INTANGIBLE ASSETS -- Intangible assets, primarily the trade name, and
favorable lease agreements, are reported net of accumulated amortization. The
assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives
which range from 3 to 40 years.

INCOME TAXES -- The Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," in the year ended January 31, 1993 and, accordingly, computes deferred
taxes using the liability method.

LEEWARDS CREATIVE CRAFTS, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(a) In August 1988, the Company entered into a secured revolving credit and
term loan agreement (the "agreement") which enabled the Company to borrow up to
a maximum of $25,000,000. On June 13, 1990, the Company restructured the
agreement to provide for additional borrowings up to $32,000,000 through August
19, 1993. On April 2, 1993 the borrowing limit was reduced to $29,920,000.

4. LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)
Borrowings outstanding under the agreement are (in 000's):

<S> <C> <C>

Term loan.................................................................. 3,113 1,458
----------- -----------
Total.................................................................... $ 7,348 $ 15,525
----------- -----------
----------- -----------
</TABLE>

The borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by the assets of the
Company. Interest is payable monthly based on the rate of interest publicly
announced by Citibank in New York, New York as Citibank's "base rate" ("Base
Rate"). In the year ended January 30, 1994, the interest rate was Base Rate plus
2% for the period from February 1, 1993 to April 2, 1993 and Base Rate plus
1.75% for the period from April 3, 1993 to January 30, 1994. During the prior
year ended January 31, 1993, the interest rate was Base Rate plus 5% for the
period from February 3, 1992 to June 22, 1992 and Base Rate plus 2% for the
period from June 23, 1992 to January 31, 1993. In the year ended January 30,
1994, the interest rate fluctuated between 7.75% and 8.0% and was 7.75% at
year-end; in the prior year, the rate fluctuated between 8.0% and 11.5% and was
8.0% at year-end.

Under the revolving credit loan, as restructured, the full availability of
this credit line is contingent on the cost of collateralized inventory, less
certain adjustments. Commitment fees on the revolving loan are one-half of one
percent of the average daily unused portion of the total facility, payable
monthly.

The term loan, as restructured, requires quarterly principal payments of
$413,750 and the balance on August 19, 1994.

The Company is in the preliminary stages of negotiating a new and expanded
credit facility.

In consideration for expanding the credit facility, the Company paid a
one-time fee of $200,000 and issued warrants to Citicorp to purchase 3,250
shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, subject to adjustment
under certain antidilution provisions. The warrants are exercisable from the
date of issuance at $141.65 per share and expire the later of June 13, 1995 or
upon full payment of the credit facility.

The agreement has covenants providing for mandatory prepayment provisions
and requiring the Company to meet specified financial ratios and income tests.
Such tests include, but are not limited to, net worth and earnings before
interest, depreciation and taxes. The covenants impose limitations on, among
other things, the amount of capital expenditures for each year, creating or
incurring liens, and selling assets or granting guarantees, and prohibit
declaring or paying dividends on common stock unless specifically permitted
under the terms of the agreement. The Company has received waivers for all
events of noncompliance with such covenants during the fiscal year ended January
31, 1993. The Company was not in compliance with all covenants at January 30,
1994 and at May 1, 1994. Accordingly, at those dates, all amounts outstanding
under the agreement were due on demand (See Note 11).

(b) In August 1988, the Company sold $14,884,000 of subordinated debentures
to a related party. Interest is payable semi-annually at 13.5%. Annual principal
payments of $3,742,000 begin May 15, 1997 and the remaining balance is due May
15, 2000. Included in interest expense are $2,285,000 and $2,137,000 for the
years ended January 30, 1994 and January 31, 1993, respectively, for the
indebtedness.

The debentures contain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness,
liens, and the incurrence of other subordinated indebtedness, and restrict
payments such as dividends on common stock. The Company has received waivers for
all events of noncompliance with such covenants during the

F-11

4. LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)
fiscal year ended January 31, 1993. At January 30, 1994, and at May 1, 1994,
because of cross default provisions with respect to the agreement referred to in
(a) above, all amounts outstanding at those dates under the subordinated
debentures also were due on demand and have been classified as currently payable
(See Note 11).

(c) RESTRUCTURING -- On June 22, 1992, the subordinated debentures were
restructured and amended to provide, among other things, for the interest
payments due on May 15 and November 15, 1992 to be made in the form of
additional promissory notes ("accrual notes") in the principal amount of the
interest payable at each date. The accrual notes bear interest at 13.5% per
annum, payable semi-annually, and $1,038,000 was due on March 15, 1994 with the
balance due on November 15, 1994. All amounts due under these debentures remain
unpaid at May 1, 1994.

In addition, an acquirer of the Class C Senior Convertible Stock (Note 6)
acquired $5,000,000 of the subordinated debentures.

Scheduled principal maturities of long-term debt classified as current for
fiscal years subsequent to January 30, 1994 are as follows (in 000's):

Unamortized deferred financing costs of $892,000 and $656,000 at January 31,
1993 and January 30, 1994, respectively, consist of professional and commitment
fees incurred in connection with the Company's revolving and term loan facility
and subordinated debentures. Such costs are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the related debt.

5. PENSION PLAN
The Company has a defined benefit pension plan for its hourly workers with
benefits based on a fixed dollar rate per year of service. The plan assets are
invested primarily in short-term bonds and in equity securities. The Company's
funding policy is to contribute annually the minimum amount required by the
applicable Internal Revenue Code regulation. In April 1992, as part of a series
of cost reductions, the Company froze the hourly pension plan. As a result,
there will be no new entrants to the plan and no additional benefits accruing to
current participants beyond those earned as of the date the plan was frozen.
