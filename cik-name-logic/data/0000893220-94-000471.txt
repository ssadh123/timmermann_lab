FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE November 16, 1994

BANKRUPTCY COURT EXTENDS EXCLUSIVITY PERIODS
FOR COLUMBIA GAS COMPANIES

WILMINGTON, DEL. -- The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Delaware today extended the period during which The Columbia Gas System,
Inc., (NYSE:CG), and its principal pipeline subsidiary, Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp., have the exclusive right to advance Chapter 11
reorganization plans.

The exclusivity period was extended to the earlier of 
April 18, 1995, or 90 days after the issuance of a Delaware Federal District
Court decision (if it is issued by January 31, 1995) determining the validity
of certain intercompany transactions that occurred before the two companies
filed for Chapter 11 protection. However, if the district court's decision
occurs after January 31, 1995, the exclusivity period will extend to the
earlier of April 18, 1995, or 45 days following that decision. The Federal
District Court trial on the Intercompany Complaint ended on October 25, 1994,
and the judge is expected to render a decision in the proceedings during the
first quarter of 1995.

The Bankruptcy Court also directed all constituencies to
continue or resume settlement discussions and report to the court on the status
of those discussions on December 14, 1994, the next regularly scheduled hearing
date.

The two Columbia Gas companies have been operating as debtors
in possession under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since July 31, 1991.
The Bankruptcy Court has granted eight prior exclusivity extensions.
