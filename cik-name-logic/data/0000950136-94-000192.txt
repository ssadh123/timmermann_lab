IMPORTANT

Except as otherwise set forth in this Supplement, the Purchaser's Offer
continues to be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in its Offer
to Purchase dated October 6, 1994 and the original BLUE Letter of
Transmittal, and the information contained therein continues to be important
to each stockholder's decision with respect to the Offer. Accordingly, this
Supplement should be read carefully in conjunction with such documents, which
have been previously mailed to stockholders.

Any stockholder desiring to tender all or any portion of his Shares (and
the associated Rights) should either (1) complete and sign the original BLUE
or the revised GREEN Letter of Transmittal or a facsimile thereof in
accordance with the instructions in the revised GREEN Letter of Transmittal,
have his signature thereon guaranteed if required by Instruction 1 of either
Letter of Transmittal and mail or deliver either Letter of Transmittal or
such facsimile with his certificates evidencing his Shares and, if separate,
the certificates representing the associated Rights, and any other required
documents to the Depositary, or follow the procedure for book-entry transfer
of Shares (and Rights, if applicable) set forth in Section 4 of the Offer to
Purchase, or (2) request his broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company
or other nominee to effect the transaction for him. Stockholders having
Shares (and Rights, if applicable) registered in the name of a broker,
dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee must contact such
broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee if they
desire to tender their Shares and, if applicable, Rights so registered.
Unless and until the Purchaser, in its sole judgment, declares that the
Merger Agreement Condition is satisfied, stockholders will be required to
tender one Right for each Share tendered pursuant to the Offer in order to
effect a valid tender of such Share. A stockholder who desires to accept the
Offer and tender Shares and Rights and whose certificates for such Shares
(and Rights, if applicable) are not immediately available should tender such
Shares (and Rights, if applicable) by following the procedures for guaranteed
delivery set forth in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase.

Questions and requests for assistance may be directed to the Information
Agent or to the Dealer Manager at their respective addresses and telephone
numbers set forth on the back cover of this Supplement. Requests for
additional copies of this Supplement, the Offer to Purchase, the revised
GREEN Letter of Transmittal and other tender offer materials may be directed
to the Information Agent or to brokers, dealers, commercial banks or trust
companies.

To All Holders of Shares of Common Stock (including the Associated
Preferred Share Purchase Rights) of Magma Power Company:

INTRODUCTION

The following information amends and supplements the Offer to Purchase
dated October 6, 1994 (the "Offer to Purchase") of CE Acquisition Company,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser") and a wholly owned subsidiary
of California Energy Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CECI"). The
Purchaser is now offering to purchase 12,400,000 shares of Common Stock, par
value $0.10 per share (the "Shares"), of Magma Power Company, a Nevada
corporation (the "Company"), and (unless and until the Purchaser declares
that the Merger Agreement Condition (as defined below) has been satisfied)
the associated Preferred Share Purchase Rights (the "Rights") issued on
October 14, 1994 pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of October 6,
1994, between the Company and Chemical Trust Company of California, as Rights
Agent (the "Rights Agreement"), at $38.50 per Share (and associated Right),
net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, as amended and
supplemented by this Supplement, and in the related Letters of Transmittal
(which together with the Offer to Purchase and this Supplement constitute the
"Offer"). Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to Shares
shall include the associated Rights and all references to the Rights shall
include all benefits that may inure to holders of the Rights pursuant to the
Rights Agreement.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Supplement, the terms and conditions
previously set forth in the Offer to Purchase remain applicable in all
respects to the Offer, and this Supplement should be read in conjunction with
the Offer to Purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, capitalized
terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Offer to Purchase.

This Offer does not constitute a solicitation of proxies or consents of
stockholders of the Company. Any such solicitation which the Purchaser may
make will be made only pursuant to separate proxy or consent materials in
compliance with the requirements of Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder.

THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (1) THERE BEING VALIDLY
TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER THAT NUMBER OF
SHARES WHICH, TOGETHER WITH SHARES BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY THE PURCHASER,
REPRESENTS AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES OUTSTANDING ON A FULLY DILUTED
BASIS, (2) THE COMPANY HAVING ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT WITH
THE PURCHASER TO PROVIDE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE COMPANY PURSUANT TO THE
OFFER AND THE PROPOSED MERGER (AS DEFINED BELOW) (SUCH CONDITION BEING
REFERRED TO AS THE "MERGER AGREEMENT CONDITION"), (3) THE PURCHASER BEING
SATISFIED, IN ITS SOLE JUDGMENT, THAT THE PURCHASER HAS OBTAINED FINANCING
SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE IT TO CONSUMMATE THE OFFER AND THE PROPOSED MERGER AND
(4) AUTHORIZATION BY CECI'S STOCKHOLDERS OF THE ISSUANCE OF CECI COMMON STOCK
(AS DEFINED BELOW) SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE THE PROPOSED MERGER. SEE SECTION 12
OF THE OFFER TO PURCHASE.

The purpose of the Offer is to acquire majority control of the Company as
the first step in the acquisition of the entire equity interest in the
Company. CECI is seeking to negotiate with the Company a definitive
acquisition agreement (the "Proposed Merger Agreement") pursuant to which the
Company would, as soon as practicable following consummation of the Offer,
consummate a merger or other business combination (the "Proposed Merger")
with the Purchaser or another direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
CECI. In the Proposed Merger, each outstanding Share (other than Shares held
by CECI, the Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of CECI, Shares held in the treasury of the Company and Shares
held by stockholders who properly exercise dissenters' rights under the
Nevada General Corporation Law (the "NGCL")) would be converted into the
right to receive cash and shares of common stock, par value $0.0675 per
share, of CECI ("CECI Common Stock") having a combined cash and market value
of $38.50 per Share. The per Share amount of cash and CECI Common Stock to be
distributed in the Proposed Merger would be determined such that the blended
purchase price for all Shares acquired by the Purchaser and its affiliates in
the Offer and the Proposed Merger would be $28.50 in cash, without interest
thereon, and $10.00 in market value of CECI Common Stock, as established
within a range of certain maximum and minimum prices for the CECI Common
Stock. See Section 5 of this Supplement.

1

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

On October 25, 1994, CECI received from Credit Suisse a fully underwritten
commitment to provide the financing for the Offer and the Proposed Merger.
Such commitment is subject to customary conditions, including the execution
of definitive documentation. See Section 6 of this Supplement.

Stockholders should follow the procedures for tendering Shares set forth
in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase and Section 2 of this Supplement.
Tendering stockholders may use either the original BLUE Letter of Transmittal
and the original GREY Notice of Guaranteed Delivery for Shares accompanying
the Offer to Purchase, or the revised GREEN Letter of Transmittal and the
revised GOLD Notice of Guaranteed Delivery accompanying this Supplement.
While the original BLUE Letter of Transmittal refers to the Offer to
Purchase, stockholders using such document to tender their Shares (and
associated Rights) will nevertheless receive $38.50 for each Share (and
associated Right) validly tendered and not withdrawn and accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer. Stockholders who have previously validly tendered and not withdrawn
their Shares (and associated Rights) pursuant to the Offer are not required
to take any further action in order to receive, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Offer, the increased price of $38.50 per Share (and
associated Right) with respect to all Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer.
See Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase and Section 1 of this Supplement.

THIS SUPPLEMENT, THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTERS OF
TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY
BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

1. AMENDED TERMS OF THE OFFER. Section 1 of the Offer to Purchase is
amended and supplemented by Section 1 of this Supplement.

The Purchaser has increased the price per Share (and associated Right) to
be paid pursuant to the Offer from $35 per Share (and associated Right) to
$38.50 per Share (and associated Right), net to the seller in cash and
without interest thereon. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer (including, if the Offer is further extended or amended, the terms and
conditions of any such extension or amendment), all stockholders whose Shares
(and associated Rights) are validly tendered and not withdrawn (including
Shares tendered prior to the date of this Supplement) in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase and Section 2 of
this Supplement on or prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) will
receive the increased price. The term "Expiration Date" means 12:00 midnight,
New York City time, on Friday, November 4, 1994, unless and until the
Purchaser, in its sole judgment, shall have extended the period of time
during which the Offer is open, in which event the term "Expiration Date"
shall mean the time and date at which the Offer, as so extended by the
Purchaser, shall expire.

This Supplement, the revised GREEN Letter of Transmittal and other
relevant materials will be mailed by the Company to record holders of Shares
and Rights whose names appear on the Company's stockholder list and the list
of holders of Rights, if any, and will be furnished to brokers, dealers,
commercial banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names, or the
names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder list and list of holders
of Rights or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing
agency's security position listing for subsequent transmittal to beneficial
owners of Shares and/or Rights.

2. PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING SHARES AND RIGHTS. Section 4 of the Offer to
Purchase is amended and supplemented by Section 2 of this Supplement.

TENDERING STOCKHOLDERS MAY CONTINUE TO USE THE ORIGINAL BLUE LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL AND GREY NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY THAT WERE PROVIDED WITH
THE OFFER TO PURCHASE. Although such BLUE Letter of Transmittal indicates
that the Offer will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
Thursday, November 3, 1994, stockholders will be able to tender (or withdraw)
their Shares and Rights pursuant to the Offer until 12:00 midnight, New York
City time, on Friday, November 4, 1994 (or such later date to which the Offer
may be extended). TENDERING STOCKHOLDERS MAY ALSO USE THE REVISED GREEN
LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND GOLD NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY PROVIDED WITH
THIS SUPPLEMENT.

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES AND RIGHTS, THE LETTER
OF TRANSMITTAL AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS IS AT THE OPTION AND SOLE
RISK OF THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDERS, AND THE DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY
WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY. IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED
MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL
CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

3. PRICE RANGE OF SHARES; DIVIDENDS. Section 6 of the Offer to Purchase is
amended and supplemented by Section 3 of this Supplement.

According to publicly available information, the Company has paid no cash
dividends on the Shares since the date of the Offer to Purchase. The reported
high and low sales prices per Share on the Nasdaq National Market (the "NNM")
for the current quarter through October 24, 1994, were $37 and $34.25,
respectively. On October 20, 1994, the last full trading day prior to CECI's
issuance of the press release announcing its intention to increase the price
per Share (and associated Right) to be paid pursuant to the Offer, the
reported closing sale price per share on the NNM was $34.75. On September 19,
1994, the day of CECI's issuance of the press release announcing the
transmission of a letter to the Company containing a proposal to acquire the
Company in a transaction in which stockholders would receive cash and shares
of CECI Common Stock having a combined cash and market value of $35 per
Share, the reported closing price per Share on the NNM was $27.50. The Offer
represents a 40% premium over the reported closing sale price per Share on
September 19, 1994. STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO OBTAIN A CURRENT MARKET
QUOTATION FOR THE SHARES.

4. BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER SINCE OCTOBER 6, 1994; CONTACTS WITH THE
COMPANY. Section 10 of the Offer to Purchase is supplemented by Section 4 of
this Supplement.

On October 5, 1994, Mr. Ben Holt, a director of CECI and a record holder
of Shares, made a demand to the Company for access to the Company's
stockholder list and other stockholder information necessary to communicate
with stockholders pursuant to the NGCL.

On October 10, 1994, CECI learned through press reports that the Company's
Board had recommended that its stockholders reject the Offer and had further
stated that the Offer at a price of $35 per Share (and associated Right) was
less attractive than remaining independent.

On October 11, 1994, the Company filed with the Commission a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to the
Exchange Act, formally rejecting the Offer and disclosing, among other
things, that the Company's Board had (i) authorized the Company to enter into
"golden parachute" severance agreements with 15 of the most highly
compensated members of the Company's management, (ii) authorized the Company
to enter into indemnification agreements with each member of the Company's
Board, (iii) amended the Company's Bylaws purporting to eliminate the ability
of the Company's stockholders to act by written consent and (iv) hired
Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman") to assist the Company's Board with respect
to CECI's proposal.

On October 12, 1994, the Company informed CECI that it had denied Mr.
Holt's demand for the Company's stockholder information under the NGCL, and
that the Company would not currently provide such information to Mr. Holt.

On October 13, 1994, CECI issued the following press release announcing
the filing of a preliminary proxy statement with the Commission pursuant to
the Exchange Act:

CALIFORNIA ENERGY TO SOLICIT CALL OF SPECIAL MEETING
OF MAGMA STOCKHOLDERS

OMAHA, NEBRASKA, October 13, 1994 -- California Energy Company, Inc.
(NYSE, PSE and LSE: CE) ("CECI") announced today that in order to facilitate
consummation of its pending cash tender offer ("Offer") for 12,400,000
shares, or approximately 51%, of the common stock of Magma Power Company
(NASDAQ:MGMA) ("Magma") at a price of $35 net per share, CECI has filed
materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to solicit
written requests from Magma shareholders to require Magma to call a Special
Meeting of shareholders. A Special Meeting will provide Magma stockholders
the opportunity to consider and vote on CECI's Special Meeting proposals
which, if approved, would result in certain By-law amendments that would
facilitate CECI's proposal and the election of four (4) CECI nominees to
Magma's Board, who would be committed to removing any impediments to
shareholders being able to freely choose whether to accept the Offer and
approve the proposed merger, thereby ensuring that the Offer and proposed
merger get a full and fair hearing. As previously announced, CECI's tender
offer is to be followed by a second step merger in implementing its September
19 proposal to acquire all Magma shares for a combination of $25 in cash and
$10 in market value of California Energy common stock.

Today's announcement by CECI to commence a Special Meeting Request
Solicitation follows the decision by Magma's Board of Directors to recommend
that Magma shareholders not tender into CECI's $35 per share Offer because
remaining independent was more attractive to shareholders. In its SEC filing
recommending against CECI's Offer, Magma also disclosed that it had entered
into "Golden Parachute" severance agreements with 15 of the most highly
compensated members of Magma's management as well as indemnity agreements
with Board members in response to CECI's September 19 proposal. CECI intends
to take any appropriate action necessary to have any impediments to its Offer
set aside. David L. Sokol, California Energy's Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, stated:

"Magma's rejection of our offer, without any attempted negotiation with us,
demonstrates their disregard for Magma shareholders. Rather than maximizing
shareholder value, they have implemented Golden Parachutes for the top 15
members of management, entered into an excessive fee arrangement with Goldman
Sachs and initiated wasteful litigation. These actions alone are estimated to
cost Magma's shareholders between 0.75 and $1.00 per share. We believe that
Magma's Board of Directors have a fiduciary obligation to maximize
shareholder value, not the lifestyles of their friends and co-workers.

It is our understanding that the Magma Board Chairman, President and Chief
Financial Officer began a "road show" presentation for investors yesterday
directed at misrepresenting and discrediting our offer, disparaging
California Energy, and offering extraordinary and unsustainable projections
for Magma's future. Much of the information which Magma presented is
inaccurate, misleading and in our view in violation of the proxy solicitation
rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Magma's management, again yesterday, stated their hope to investors that we
would just go away. This will not happen unless the shareholders reject our
ultimate offer. It is our belief that Magma's shareholders recognize the
value of our offer and will not allow the Magma management to prosper to
their detriment."

The Special Meeting Request Solicitation will be made only pursuant to
definitive solicitation documents, which will be filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and mailed to Magma stockholders. Gleacher & Co. Inc.
is acting as Financial Advisor to California Energy and Dealer Manager in
connection with the tender offer and Request Solicitation and MacKenzie
Partners, Inc. is acting as the Information Agent for the tender offer and
Request Solicitation.

California Energy Company is an international developer, owner and
operator of geothermal and other environmentally responsible power generation
facilities. Its six existing facilities currently produce in excess of 325 MW
of power with an additional 300 MW under construction.

On October 13, 1994, CECI issued the following press release regarding the
Company's refusal to provide Mr. Holt with the requested stockholder
information:

MAGMA TO BE SUED TO OBTAIN RELEASE OF MAGMA STOCKHOLDER LIST

OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 13--California Energy Company, Inc. (NYSE, PSE and
LSE: CE) ("CECI") announced today that Magma Power Company (NASDAQ: MGMA)
("Magma"), in an apparent effort to delay the ability of Magma shareholders
to call a special meeting, has denied the request of one of CECI's directors
who is a long-time Magma shareholder, for the Magma shareholder list. As
previously announced, CECI is soliciting requests to call a Special Meeting
of Magma's shareholders in order to provide Magma stockholders the
opportunity to consider and vote on CECI's Special Meeting proposals which,
if approved, would result in certain By-law amendments that would facilitate
CECI's proposal to acquire Magma and the election of four (4) CECI nominees
to Magma's Board, who would be committed to removing any impediments to
shareholders being able to freely choose whether to accept CECI's pending
cash tender offer for 12,400,000 shares at $35 net per share and approve the
proposed second step merger, thereby ensuring that the offer and proposed
merger get a full and fair hearing.

David L. Sokol, California Energy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
stated:

"Magma's denial of access to the list of shareholders is, at best, an
attempt to delay the inevitable, when Magma's Board and management will have
to account for their recent actions in front of their shareholders. Such
obstructionist tactics viewed in light of recent actions to implement "Golden
Parachutes" for 15 of the most highly compensated members of management
simply serve as further evidence of management's improper entrenchment motive
in recommending against CECI's acquisition proposal." Sokol added: "This sort
of irresponsible corporate behavior simply demonstrates the fact that Magma's
management is apparently unwilling to permit its actions to be judged by the
Company's owners and will result in another wasteful lawsuit to the detriment
of Magma's shareholders."

The Special Meeting Request Solicitation will be made only pursuant to
definitive solicitation documents, which will be filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and mailed to Magma stockholders. Gleacher & Co. Inc.
is acting as Financial Advisor to California Energy and Dealer Manager in
connection with the tender offer and request solicitation and MacKenzie
Partners, Inc. is acting as the Information Agent for the tender offer and
request solicitation.

California Energy Company is an international developer, owner and operator
of geothermal and other environmentally responsible power generation
facilities. Its six existing facilities currently produce in excess of 325 MW
of power with an additional 300 MW under construction.

On October 14, Mr. Holt commenced an action in the Second Judicial
District Court for the State of Nevada in and for the County of Washoe (the
"Court"), seeking an order requiring the Company, pursuant to the NGCL, to
turn over to him the stockholder information requested in his demand letter
to the Company. The Court entered an order setting a briefing schedule which
would permit consideration of the matter on an expedited basis. See Section 7
of this Supplement.

On October 17, 1994, CECI issued the following press release announcing
that it had sued the directors of the Company's Board for, among other
things, breach of their fiduciary duties in failing to consider CECI's
proposal to acquire Magma and for taking obstructionist actions in response
to CECI's proposal:

CALIFORNIA ENERGY SUES MAGMA'S
DIRECTORS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY

OMAHA, NEBRASKA, October 17, 1994 -- California Energy Company, Inc.
(NYSE, PSE and LSE: CE) ("CECI") announced today that it has sued the
Directors of Magma Power Company (NASDAQ: MGMA) ("Magma"), for, among other
things, breach of their fiduciary duties in failing to properly consider
CECI's proposal to acquire Magma and for taking obstructionist actions in
response to CECI's proposal, such as adopting special indemnity agreements
for themselves, "Golden Parachutes" for 15 Magma executives, a discriminatory
"poison pill" and by-law amendments which are intended to impede the right of
the majority of Magma's shareholders to freely consider CECI's offer and to
entrench current Magma management. In addition, CECI's suit notes that the
Board (which includes five (5) present or former Dow employees out of an 11
member Board) breached its duties by not disclosing to Magma's shareholders
Dow's conflict of interest in the transaction due to the fact that Dow cannot
obtain the same benefit from the tender offer price as other shareholders
because of recent Dow transactions that would invoke the SEC's Section16(b)
short-swing profit disgorgement rule.

David L. Sokol, California Energy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
stated:

"We find it astounding that Magma's Board has not even given serious
consideration to a proposal which would pay shareholders a $7.50 per share
premium over Magma's trading price prior to making the proposal. Moreover,
the Board, while stating our price to be "inadequate," has declined to engage
in a discussion about what price would constitute an adequate offer. Although
we have indicated that we are prepared to negotiate all aspects of our offer,
Magma has refused to engage in price discussions, merely stating that it is
somehow in the best interest of shareholders to remain "independent." At the
same time Magma's Board has also taken actions to impede majority shareholder
action (such as adopting a poison pill and by-law amendments and refusing
access to a shareholder list) which indicate the Board's apparent belief that
shareholders shouldn't be permitted to make up their own minds as to what is
in their best economic interest and which only serve to entrench current
management.

It is also noteworthy that, while attempting to deny shareholders the
right to consider our offer, Magma's Board has taken steps to provide for
management's economic self-interest, such as approving "Golden Parachute"
severance agreements for the 15 most highly compensated members of Magma's
management. These and other obstructionist actions are estimated to cost
shareholders between $0.75 and $1.00 per share. Such actions, viewed in the
context of Dow's conflict of interest, due to its inability to fully benefit
from the tender offer as a result of Section16(b), paint a picture of
management entrenchment plain and simple."

Sokol added:

"It is curious to note that the five (5) Dow Board members recommended
against our $35 per share offer in light of Dow's liquidation of a
significant amount of its Magma holdings (3,635,000 shares) in 1993 at a net
price of $30.88 per share and Dow's recent sale in September 1994 of 857,143
Magma shares at $28.25. Assuming the Section16(b) problems which prevent Dow
from fully benefitting from our offer were fully disclosed to the independent
Magma Board members, we do find it surprising that Magma's Board could be
advised that there was not a conflict that would require the five (5) Dow
members to abstain from voting on our proposal."

As previously announced, CECI is soliciting requests to call a Special
Meeting of Magma's shareholders in order to provide Magma stockholders the
opportunity to consider and vote on CECI's Special Meeting proposals which,

CECI's proposal to acquire Magma and the election of four (4) CECI nominees

and operator of geothermal and other environmentally responsible power
generation facilities. Its six existing facilities currently produce in
excess of 325 MW with an additional 300 MW under construction.

On October 21, 1994, CECI issued the following press release announcing
that the Purchaser had increased the price per Share (and associated Right)
to $38.50 per Share (and associated Right), net to the seller in cash and
without interest thereon:

CALIFORNIA ENERGY INCREASES ITS OFFER
FOR MAGMA POWER TO $38.50 PER SHARE

Omaha, Nebraska, October 21, 1994 -- California Energy Company, Inc.
(NYSE, PSE, LSE: CE) ("CECI") announced today that it has increased its offer
to purchase Magma Power Company to $38.50 per share, consisting of $28.50 per
share in cash and $10.00 per share of CECI stock.

In connection with this enhanced proposal, CECI has extended the
expiration date of its pending cash tender offer for 51%, or 12,400,000 of
Magma's shares to Friday, November 4, 1994 and has increased the cash price
to $38.50 net per share.

CECI also confirmed its intention to solicit consents to call a special
meeting of Magma's shareholders to elect four new members to Magma's Board of
Directors who would ensure that Magma gives proper consideration to this
enhanced offer. CECI also announced it would commence a series of investor
and shareholder presentations beginning Tuesday, October 25, 1994. These
presentations would highlight to Magma shareholders the benefits of the CECI
acquisition proposal.

David L. Sokol, CECI's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "We
sincerely hope that Magma's Board of Directors will negotiate and sign a
merger agreement with us so that all Magma shareholders can receive the
benefits of our acquisition offer. In any event, we are now putting forth our
best acquisition proposal, and are beginning a consent solicitation to
provide Magma's shareholders the right to express their views directly on the
merits of our proposal. We have increased the cash price of our Tender Offer
which should provide Magma shareholders with an additional mechanism to
communicate to Magma's Board their support of CECI's acquisition offer."

California Energy Company is a leading international developer, owner
and operator of geothermal and other environmentally responsible power
generation facilities. Its six existing facilities currently produce in
excess of 325 MW of power with an additional 300 MW under construction.

On October 21, 1994, the Company announced that its local Indonesian
partner on the smaller of its two proposed development stage projects in
Indonesia, the Karaha project, had terminated its joint venture with the
Company. On October 25, 1994, CECI and the Purchaser filed their second
amended

counterclaims which, among other things, seek an injunction requiring the
Company to refrain from taking actions to damage its international
development projects, including the Karaha project. See Section 7 of this
Supplement.

On October 25, 1994, CECI issued the following press release announcing
the receipt of a fully underwritten $500,000,000 financing commitment from
Credit Suisse:

CALIFORNIA ENERGY ANNOUNCES RECEIPT OF
FULLY UNDERWRITTEN $500,000,000 FINANCING COMMITMENT
FOR MAGMA ACQUISITION

OMAHA, NE, October 25, 1994 -- California Energy Company, Inc. (NYSE,
PSE, LSE:CE) ("CECI") today announced that it has received a
fully-underwritten $500,000,000 financing commitment from Credit Suisse in
connection with CECI's proposed acquisition of Magma Power Company
(NASDAQ:MGMA) ("Magma"). The financing commitment contains two facilities and
provides funding both for the purchase of tendered Magma common shares
pursuant to CECI's pending cash tender offer for 51%, or 12,400,000 shares of
Magma at $38.50 net per share, and for permanent financing in order to
consummate a merger of the two companies.

David L. Sokol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CECI, stated,
"We believe this $500,000,000 financing commitment, together with over
$300,000,000 of existing cash on hand, demonstrates the strength of our offer
to Magma's shareholders and reinforces our capability to expeditiously
consummate the proposed transaction."

The tender offer facility has a final maturity of 12 months (extendable
to three years) and the permanent financing facility has a final maturity of
8 years with semi-annual amortization from internally-generated funds.
Pricing is based upon Libor or an alternative base rate.

California Energy Company is a leading international developer, owner
and operator of geothermal and other environmentally responsible power
generation facilities. Its six existing facilities currently produce in
excess of 325 MW of power with an additional 300 MW under construction.

Also on October 25, 1994, the Court issued an order in the action filed by
Mr. Holt, granting the relief requested by Mr. Holt by directing that the
Company turn over to Mr. Holt without delay the stockholder list and other
information sought in his demand letter.

5. PURPOSE OF THE OFFER AND THE PROPOSED MERGER. Section 11 of the Offer
to Purchase is amended and supplemented by Section 5 of this Supplement.

General. The purpose of the Offer is to acquire majority control of the
Company as the first step in the acquisition of the entire equity interest in
the Company. The purpose of the Proposed Merger is to acquire all Shares not
beneficially owned by the Purchaser following consummation of the Offer.

The Purchaser is seeking to enter into the Proposed Merger with the
Company as promptly as practicable following consummation of the Offer. Under
the Proposed Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Proposed Merger,
each outstanding Share (other than Shares held by CECI, the Purchaser or any
other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CECI, Shares held in the
treasury of the Company and Shares held by stockholders who properly exercise
dissenters' rights under the NGCL) would be converted into the right to
receive cash and shares of CECI Common Stock having a combined cash and
market value of $38.50 per Share. The per Share amount of cash and CECI
Common Stock to be distributed in the Proposed Merger will be determined such
that the blended purchase price for all Shares acquired by the Purchaser and
its affiliates in the Offer and the Proposed Merger will be $28.50 in cash
and $10.00 in market value of CECI Common Stock, subject to a collar
provision in the Proposed Merger Agreement which would provide a range of
maximum and minimum prices for CECI Common Stock. If the market value of CECI
Common Stock were to exceed the top of such range, the number of shares of
CECI Common Stock to be issued in the Proposed Merger would be based on the
maximum price for CECI Common Stock (i.e., the top of the range), and if the
market value of the CECI

8

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

Common Stock were to be less than the bottom of such range, the number of
shares of CECI Common Stock to be issued in the Proposed Merger would be
based on the minimum price for the CECI Common Stock (i.e., the bottom of the
range). The effect of the collar provision would be to increase the number of
Shares to be issued in the Proposed Merger (and therefore the value of the
stock consideration to be received in the Proposed Merger) if the market
price of the CECI Common Stock were to be greater than the top of the
established range and to decrease the number of Shares to be issued in the
Proposed Merger (and therefore the value of the stock consideration to be
received in the Proposed Merger) if the market price of the CECI Common Stock
were to be less than the bottom of the established range. CECI intends to
establish such range shortly prior to the Purchaser's entering into the
Proposed Merger Agreement.

The Preferred Share Purchase Rights. According to the Company's
Registration Statement on Form 8-A filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") on October 7, 1994, as amended by the Company's
amendment filed with the Commission on October 14, 1994 (the "Form 8-A"), the
Company's Board declared a distribution of one Right for each outstanding
Share to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 14, 1994
and for each Share issued (including Shares distributed from the Company's
treasury) by the Company thereafter and prior to the Distribution Date (as
defined below). The following description of the Rights is based on
information contained in the Form 8-A and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to such Form 8-A.

Each Right entitles the registered holder, subject to the terms of the
Rights Agreement, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share
(a "Unit") of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the
"Preferred Stock"), at a purchase price of $125 per Unit, subject to
adjustment (the "Purchase Price"). Initially, the Rights will attach to all
certificates representing Shares ("Share Certificates") and no separate
certificates representing Rights ("Rights Certificates") will be distributed.
The Rights will separate from the Shares and a "Distribution Date" will occur
upon the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement (the
date of such announcement being the "Stock Acquisition Date") that a person
or group of affiliated or associated persons (other than the Company, any
subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan of the Company or such
Subsidiary) (an "Acquiring Person") has acquired, obtained the right to
acquire or otherwise obtained beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the then
outstanding Shares (or if certain current holders of 10% or more of the
outstanding Shares have acquired, obtained the right to acquire or otherwise
obtained beneficial ownership of an additional 4% of the Shares), and (ii) 10
business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the
Company's Board prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person)
following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would
result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of the then
outstanding Shares. Until the Distribution Date, (i) the Rights will be
evidenced by Share Certificates and will be transferred with and only with
such Share Certificates, (ii) new Share Certificates issued after October 14,
1994 (also including Shares distributed from the Company's treasury) will
contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference and (iii)
the surrender for transfer of any certificates representing outstanding
Shares will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the
Shares represented by such certificates.

The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire
at the close of business on the tenth anniversary of the Rights Agreement
unless earlier redeemed by the Company as described below.

As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, Rights Certificates
will be mailed to holders of record of the Shares as of the close of the
business on the Distribution Date and, thereafter, the separate Rights
Certificates alone will represent the Rights.

In the event that (i) the Company is the surviving corporation in a merger
with an Acquiring Person and the Shares shall remain outstanding, (ii) a
person becomes the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the then outstanding
Shares (or an additional 4% in the case of certain current 10% holders),
(iii) an Acquiring Person engages in one or more "self-dealing" transactions
as set forth in the Rights Agreement, or (iv) during such time as there is an
Acquiring Person, an event occurs which results in such Acquiring Person's
ownership interest being increased by more than 1%, then, in each such case,
each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon
exercise, Units (or, in certain circumstances, Shares,

9

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a value equal to
two times the exercise price of the Right. The exercise price is the Purchase
Price multiplied by the number of Units issuable upon exercise of a Right
prior to the events described in this paragraph. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, following the occurrence of any of the events set forth in this
paragraph, all Rights that are, or (under certain circumstances specified in
the Rights Agreement) were, beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person will
be null and void.

In the event that, at any time following the Stock Acquisition Date, (i)
the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction
and the Company is not the surviving corporation (other than a merger
described in the preceding paragraph), (ii) any person consolidates or
mergers with the Company and all or part of the Shares are converted or
exchanged for securities, cash or property of any other person or (iii) 50%
or more of the Company's assets or earning power are sold or transferred,
each holder of a Right (except Rights which previously have been voided as
described above) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise,
common stock of the Acquiring Person having a value equal to two times the
exercise price of the Right.

The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Units issuable, upon
exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent
dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision,
combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Stock, (ii) if holders of
the Preferred Stock are granted certain rights or warrants to subscribe for
Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market
price of the Preferred Stock, or (iii) upon the distribution to the holders
of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding
regular quarterly cash dividends) or of subscription rights or warrants
(other than those referred to above).

With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be
required until cumulative adjustments amount to at least 1% of the Purchase
Price. The Company is not required to issue fractional Units. In lieu
thereof, an adjustment in cash may be made based on the market price of the
Preferred Stock prior to the date of exercise.

At any time until ten business days following the Stock Acquisition Date,
a majority of the Independent Directors (as defined in the Rights Agreement)
may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per
Right (the "Redemption Price"), payable, at the election of such majority of
the Independent Directors, in cash or Shares. Immediately upon the action of
a majority of Independent Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights,
the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be
to receive the Redemption Price.

Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no
rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the
right to vote or to receive dividends.

Any of the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended at any time
prior to the Distribution Date. After the Distribution Date, the provisions
of the Rights Agreement may be amended in order to cure any ambiguity, defect
or inconsistency, to make changes which do not adversely affect the interests
of holders of Rights (excluding the interests of any Acquiring Person), or to
shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement; provided,
however, that no amendment to adjust the time period governing redemption
shall be made at such time as the Rights are not redeemable.

On October 10, 1994, the Company's Board resolved that the Distribution
Date shall not occur until the earlier of (i) such later date as the
Company's Board, in its sole discretion, shall fix by resolution adopted
prior to the Distribution Date and (ii) the date the Purchaser becomes an
Acquiring Person.

UNLESS THE RIGHTS ARE REDEEMED, HAVE BEEN INVALIDATED OR ARE OTHERWISE
INAPPLICABLE TO THE OFFER AND THE PROPOSED MERGER, STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE
REQUIRED TO TENDER ONE RIGHT FOR EACH SHARE TENDERED IN ORDER TO EFFECT A
VALID TENDER OF SUCH SHARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN
SECTION 4 OF THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND SECTION 2 OF THIS SUPPLEMENT. IF
SEPARATE RIGHTS CERTIFICATES ARE NOT ISSUED, A TENDER OF SHARES WILL ALSO
CONSTITUTE A TENDER OF THE ASSOCIATED RIGHTS.

THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MERGER AGREEMENT
CONDITION BEING SATISFIED. THE PURCHASER INTENDS TO TAKE ANY ACTION NECESSARY
TO HAVE ATTEMPTED IMPEDIMENTS TO THE OFFER AND THE PROPOSED MERGER SET ASIDE.
IF THE PURCHASER ENTERS INTO THE PROPOSED MERGER AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY,
SUCH AGREEMENT WILL REQUIRE THE COMPANY'S BOARD TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION
PROVIDING, OR TAKE SUCH OTHER CORPORATE ACTION AS MAY BE REQUIRED TO ENSURE,
THAT ANY RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY PURPORT TO BE IMPOSED BY THE RIGHTS ARE
INAPPLICABLE TO THE OFFER AND THE PROPOSED MERGER. SEE INTRODUCTION OF THE
OFFER TO PURCHASE AND SECTION 12 OF THE OFFER TO PURCHASE.

6. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS. Section 13 of the Offer to Purchase is
amended and supplemented by Section 6 of this Supplement.

As a result of the increase in the price per Share to be paid pursuant to
the Offer, the Purchaser estimates that approximately $477.4 million will be
required to purchase the 12,400,000 Share and Rights sought pursuant to the
Offer. The Purchaser estimates that approximately an additional $218 million
will be required to effectuate the Proposed Merger. The Purchaser will obtain
such funds through borrowings from commercial banks and through a capital
contribution by CECI from CECI's general corporate funds, which at September
30, 1994 aggregated approximately $316 million.

The Purchaser anticipates that a substantial portion of the cash required
to purchase Shares and Rights pursuant to the Offer and the Proposed Merger
will be provided through a secured bank credit facility. CECI has received a
fully underwritten financing commitment letter from Credit Suisse (the
"Commitment Letter") which states that Credit Suisse will provide, on
specified terms and subject to customary conditions, up to $500,000,000 in
secured bank financing in connection with the Offer and the Proposed Merger.
Such funds, together with a portion of CECI's general corporate funds, will
be sufficient to pay the cash portion of the consideration for the Offer and
the Proposed Merger and related expenses.

The Commitment Letter contemplates (i) a facility of up to $250,000,000 to
capitalize the Purchaser for the purpose of financing the Offer (the "Tender
Facility") and (ii) facilities of up to $500,000,000 for, among other things,
refinancing the Tender Facility and effectuating the Proposed Merger (the
"Merger Facilities" and, together with the Tender Facility, the
"Facilities").

The term of the Tender Facility will be 12 months, extendible for a term
of up to three years from the initial funding at the mutual consent of CECI
and Credit Suisse. The Tender Facility will be a margin loan collateralized
by the Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and subject to Regulation U
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

The Merger Facilities will be composed of (i) up to a 6-year amortizing
term loan ("Term Loan A") in an expected amount of up to $500,000,000 less
the amount of Term Loan B (as defined below) and (ii) up to a 8-year
amortizing term loan ("Term Loan B") in an expected amount not to be less
than $150,000,000. The Merger Facilities are to be amortized from internally
generated funds and will be secured by an assignment and pledge of the stock
of the Company and all unencumbered assets of the Company.

Interest on loans borrowed under the Facilities will be payable at spreads
of 2.50% above LIBOR (adjusted for reserves) or 1.25% above Base Rate for
loans under the Tender Facility, 2.50% above LIBOR (adjusted for reserves) or
1.50% above Base Rate for Term Loan A, and 3.00% above LIBOR (adjusted for
reserves) or 2.00% above Base Rate for Term Loan B. CECI may elect to incur
loans at either LIBOR or Base Rate.

Credit Suisse's commitment to provide the Facilities is subject to certain
customary conditions, including without limitation (a) a capital investment
in the Purchaser in an amount and form satisfactory to Credit Suisse, (b) the
absence of certain material adverse changes and (c) Credit Suisse's
satisfaction with its due diligence with respect to CECI and the Company.

The definitive documentation relating to the Facilities will contain
representations, warranties, covenants, events of default and conditions
customary for transactions of this size and type.

CECI has agreed to pay certain fees to Credit Suisse with respect to the
Facilities which, in the aggregate, are not material to the transactions
described herein.

The foregoing description of the Commitment Letter is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the text thereof filed as an exhibit to Amendment
No. 4 to the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule 14D-1 of the Purchaser and
CECI (the "Schedule 14D-1") filed with the Commission in connection with the
Offer, copies of which may be obtained from the offices of the Commission in
the manner set forth in Section 8 of the Offer to Purchase (except that such
information will not be available at the regional offices of the Commission).
When definitive agreements relating to the Facilities are executed, copies
will be filed as exhibits to further amendments to the Schedule 14D-1.

7. CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS. Section 15 of the Offer to Purchase is amended
and supplemented by Section 7 of this Supplement.

Pending Litigation. On October 3, 1994, the Company filed a complaint
entitled Magma Power Company v. California Energy Company, Inc., Case No.
CV-N-94-06160, against CECI in the Second Judicial District Court of the
State of Nevada in and for the County of Washoe. The complaint seeks a
declaratory judgment that (i) the Company's Board properly discharged its
fiduciary obligations in adopting the Rights Agreement and an amendment to
the Company's Bylaws and, accordingly, such documents were valid and binding,
and (ii) the Merger Moratorium Statute is valid and not in violation of the
Commerce Clause and Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. CECI
removed this action to the United States District Court for the District of
Nevada (Case No. CV-N-94-00719-DWH).

On October 17, 1994, CECI filed its answer and counterclaims in response
to the Company's complaint. The counterclaims name the Purchaser as an
additional counterclaim plaintiff and the Company's directors as counterclaim
defendants in addition to the Company. CECI's counterclaims seek primarily:
(i) a declaratory judgment that certain actions taken by the Company,
including the amendment to the Company's Bylaws purporting to preclude the
Company stockholders from taking action by written consent, and
implementation of its "poison pill" Rights Agreement, are void and ultra
vires, and constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by the Company's Board; (ii)
an injunction requiring the Company's Board to rescind the amendment to the
Company's Bylaws which purports to eliminate the power of stockholders to act
by written consent, the "golden parachute" severance agreements granted to 15
members of the Company's management and the indemnification agreements
granted to each member of the Company's Board; (iii) an injunction enjoining
the operation of the "poison pill" Rights Agreement and directing the
Company's Board to redeem the Rights provided for in that Agreement; (iv) a
declaratory judgment that the Merger Moratorium Statute is unconstitutional
under the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause of the United States
Constitution; (v) an injunction enjoining the Company's Board from invoking
the terms of the Merger Moratorium Statute or otherwise obstructing the
Offer; and (vi) an injunction requiring the Company to correct all false and
misleading statements in its Schedule 14D-9 and the amendments thereto.

On October 17, 1994, the Company filed an amended complaint, which, in
addition to the relief requested in its original complaint, seeks (i)
declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to certain purportedly false
and misleading disclosures in CECI's and the Purchaser's Schedule 14D-1 and
the Offer to Purchase therein; and (ii) declaratory and injunctive relief
with respect to certain allegedly false and misleading statements made in
CECI's preliminary Request Solicitation Statement filed with the Commission
pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act on October 13, 1994.

On October 19, 1994, CECI and the Purchaser filed their answer to the
Company's amended complaint and amended their counterclaims which, in
addition to the relief requested in the original counterclaims, seek an
injunction requiring the Company to correct additional false and misleading
statements reflected in an amendment to its Schedule 14D-9 and in other
statements made by the Company.

On October 25, 1994, CECI and the Purchaser filed their second amended
counterclaims which, in addition to the relief requested in the original and
amended counterclaims, seek an injunction requiring the Company to refrain
from (i) taking actions to damage its international development projects,
including the Karaha project, or (ii) taking other actions designed to waste
corporate assets and block the Offer and the Proposed Merger.

12

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

CECI intends to take any action necessary to have attempted impediments to
the Offer and the Proposed Merger set aside.

On October 14, 1994, Ben Holt, a stockholder of the Company, and a
director of CECI, filed a complaint entitled Ben Holt v. Magma Power Company,
Case No. CV94-06432, against the Company in the Second Judicial District
Court for the State of Nevada in and for the County of Washoe (the "Court"),
alleging, among other things, that the Company has infringed the plaintiff's
right as a stockholder by denying his statutory right under the NGCL to
demand access to the Company's stockholder list and certain related material
necessary to communicate with the Company's shareholders. The plaintiff
sought an order directing the Company to comply with the demand for the
stockholder list and related information necessary to communicate with
stockholders.

On October 25, 1994, the Court issued an order directing the Company
forthwith and without delay to turn over to Mr. Holt a complete record or
list of the Company's stockholders together with certain other information
concerning stockholders of the Company requested by Mr. Holt in his demand
letter to the Company. The Court ruled expressly that Mr. Holt satisfied the
requirements of the NGCL governing requests for stockholder information in
that he had been a stockholder of the Company for more than six months as of
the time of his demand, and had complied with the Company's request for an
affidavit concerning his request; that Mr. Holt's purpose for requesting
stockholder information of the Company, which was to facilitate CECI's
request for a special meeting of stockholders of the Company and otherwise to
communicate with the other stockholders of the Company concerning CECI's
proposal to acquire the Company through the Offer and the Proposed Merger was
a proper purpose for which to request stockholder information; and that the
public interest is served by granting Mr. Holt's request for stockholder
information.

Antitrust. The required waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated by
the FTC and the Antitrust Division on October 20, 1994.

8. MISCELLANEOUS. CECI and the Purchaser have filed with the Commission an
amendment to the Schedule 14D-1 pursuant to Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and are furnishing certain supplemental information with respect
to the Offer. CECI and the Purchaser may file additional amendments to the
Schedule 14D-1. The Tender Offer Statement on Schedule 14D-1 and any and all
amendments thereto, including exhibits, may be examined and copies may be
obtained from the Commission in the same manner as described in Section 8 of
the Offer to Purchase with respect to information concerning the Company
(except that the amendments will not be available at the regional offices of
the Commission).

Except as modified by this Supplement, the terms and conditions set forth
in the Offer to Purchase remain applicable in all respects to the Offer and
this Supplement should be read in conjunction with the Offer to Purchase and
the Letters of Transmittal.

DELIVERY OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL TO AN ADDRESS OTHER THAN AS SET

THE INSTRUCTIONS ACCOMPANYING THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL SHOULD BE READ
CAREFULLY BEFORE THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IS COMPLETED.

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

This revised GREEN Letter of Transmittal or the previously circulated BLUE
Letter of Transmittal is to be completed by stockholders either if
certificates for Shares ("Share Certificates") and/or Rights ("Rights
Certificates") are to be forwarded herewith or if delivery is to be made by
book-entry transfer to the account maintained by the IBJ Schroder Bank &
Trust Company (the "Depositary") at The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"),
Midwest Securities Trust Company ("MSTC") or Philadelphia Depository Trust
Company ("PHDTC") (collectively, the "Book-Entry Transfer Facilities")
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase,
dated October 6, 1994 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and Section 2 of the
Supplement thereto, dated October 26, 1994 (the "Supplement"), of CE
Acquisition Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser") and a
wholly owned subsidiary of California Energy Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("CECI").

If the Purchaser declares that the Merger Agreement Condition (as defined
below) is satisfied, the Purchaser will not require delivery of Rights (as
defined below). Unless and until the Purchaser declares that the Merger
Agreement Condition is satisfied, holders of Shares will be required to
tender one Right for each Share tendered to effect a valid tender of such
Share. If the Distribution Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase and the
Supplement) has not occurred prior to the time Shares are tendered pursuant
to the Offer, a tender of Shares will constitute a tender of the associated
Rights. If the Distribution Date occurs and the Rights Certificates are
distributed by the Company to holders of Shares prior to the time a holder's
Shares are tendered pursuant to the Offer, in order for Rights (and the
corresponding Shares) to be validly tendered, Rights Certificates
representing a number of Rights equal to the number of Shares tendered must
be delivered to the Depositary or, if book-entry delivery is available with
respect to Rights, a book-entry confirmation must be received by the
Depositary with respect thereto. If the Distribution Date occurs and Rights
Certificates are not distributed prior to the time Shares are tendered
pursuant to the Offer, Rights may be tendered prior to a stockholder
receiving Rights Certificates by use of the guaranteed delivery procedures
described in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase and below. In any case, a
tender of Shares constitutes an agreement by the tendering stockholder to
deliver Rights Certificates representing a number of Rights equal to the
number of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer to the Depositary within five
business days after the date Rights Certificates are distributed. The
Purchaser reserves the right to require that the Depositary receive Rights
Certificates, or a Book-Entry Confirmation (as defined in the Offer to
Purchase), if available, with respect to such Rights prior to accepting the
corresponding Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer if Rights Certificates
have been distributed to holders of Shares at such time.

If a stockholder desires to accept the Offer and tender Shares and Rights
pursuant to the Offer and such stockholder's Share Certificates and, if
applicable, Rights Certificates, are not immediately available or time will
not permit all required documents to reach the Depositary prior to the
expiration of the Offer (the "Expiration Date"), or the procedures for
book-entry transfer cannot be completed on a timely basis, such Shares or
Rights may nevertheless be tendered if the guaranteed delivery procedures set
forth in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase are followed. See Instruction 2.
DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
DELIVERY TO THE DEPOSITARY.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned hereby tenders to CE Acquisition Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Purchaser") and a wholly owned subsidiary of California
Energy Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CECI"), the above described
shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Shares"), of Magma
Power Company, a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to the
Purchaser's offer to purchase 12,400,000 Shares, and (unless and until the
Purchaser declares that the Merger Agreement Condition (as defined in the
Offer to Purchase (as defined below)) is satisfied) the associated Preferred
Stock Purchase Rights (the "Rights") issued on October 14, 1994 pursuant to
the Rights Agreement, dated as of October 6, 1994, between the Company and
Chemical Trust Company of California, as Rights Agent (the "Rights
Agreement"), at a price of $38.50 per Share (and associated Right), net to
the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated October 6, 1994 (the
"Offer to Purchase"), as amended and supplemented by the Supplement to the
Offer to Purchase, dated October 26, 1994 (the "Supplement") (receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged) and in this revised GREEN Letter of Transmittal
(which, together with the Supplement, the Offer to Purchase and the original
BLUE Letter of Transmittal, constitutes the "Offer"). All references to the
Rights shall include all benefits which may inure to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to the Rights Agreement and, unless the context otherwise
requires, all references to Shares shall include the Rights. The undersigned
understands that the Purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in
whole and from time to time in part, to one or more direct or indirect
subsidiaries of CECI, the right to purchase Shares and Rights tendered
pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve
the Purchaser of its obligations under the Offer or prejudice the rights of
tendering stockholders to receive payment for Shares or Rights validly
tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer.

Subject to, and effective upon, acceptance for payment of the Shares and
Rights tendered herewith in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers
to, or upon the order of, the Purchaser all right, title and interest in and
to all the Shares and Rights that are being tendered hereby and that are
being accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer (and any and all dividends,
distributions, stock splits, other Shares, rights or other securities issued
or issuable in respect of the Shares and Rights on or after October 6, 1994)
which are payable or distributable to stockholders of record on a date prior
to the transfer into the name of the Purchaser or its nominees or transferees
on the Company's stock transfer records of the Shares and Rights purchased
pursuant to the Offer (a "Distribution"), and irrevocably constitutes and
appoints the Depositary the true and lawful attorney-in-fact and proxy of the
undersigned with respect to such Shares and Rights (and any dividends,
distributions, other Shares, rights or securities, including Distributions)
with full power of substitution and resubstitution (such power of attorney
being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest), to (a)
deliver certificates for such Shares and Rights (and any such dividends,
distributions, other Shares, rights or securities, including Distributions),
or transfer ownership of such Shares and Rights on the account books
maintained by a Book-Entry Transfer Facility, together in either such case
with all accompanying evidences of transfer and authenticity, to or upon the
order of the Purchaser upon receipt by the Depositary, as the undersigned's
agent, of the purchase price (adjusted, if appropriate, as provided in the
Offer to Purchase), (b) present such Shares and Rights (and any dividends,
distributions, other Shares, rights or securities, including Distributions)
for transfer on the books of the Company and (c) receive all benefits and
otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such Shares and
Rights (and any such dividends, distributions, other Shares, rights or
securities, including Distributions), all in accordance with the terms of the
Offer.

The undersigned understands that if the Distribution Date (as defined in
the Offer to Purchase and in the Supplement) has occurred and Rights
Certificates have been distributed by the Company to holders of Shares prior
to the time a holder's Shares are tendered herewith, then for Rights (and the
corresponding Shares) to be validly tendered, Rights Certificates
representing a number of Rights equal

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

to the number of Shares being tendered herewith must be delivered to the
Depositary, or if book-entry delivery is available with respect to Rights, a
Book-Entry Confirmation must be received by the Depositary with respect
thereto. If the Distribution Date has occurred and Rights Certificates have
not been distributed prior to the time Shares are tendered herewith, Rights
may be tendered prior to a stockholder's receiving Rights Certificates by use
of the guaranteed delivery procedures described in Section 4 of the Offer to
Purchase. In any case, the undersigned agrees to deliver Rights Certificates
representing a number of Rights equal to the number of Shares tendered
herewith to the Depositary within five business days after the date such
Rights Certificates are distributed. The undersigned understands that if the
Merger Agreement Condition is not satisfied, the Purchaser reserves the right
to require that the Depositary receive Rights Certificates, or a Book-Entry
Confirmation, if available, with respect to such Rights prior to accepting
the corresponding Shares for payment, if the Distribution Date occurs prior
to the Expiration Date. In that event, payment for Shares tendered and
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely
receipt by the Depositary of, among other things, such Rights Certificates.

The undersigned hereby irrevocably appoints David L. Sokol, Steven A.
McArthur and John G. Sylvia and each of them, or any other designees of the
Purchaser, the attorneys-in-fact and proxies of the undersigned, each with
full power of substitution and resubstitution (such power of attorney being
deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest), to vote or act
by written consent in such manner as each such attorney and proxy or his
substitute shall in his sole discretion deem proper, and otherwise to act
with respect to all the Shares and Rights tendered hereby that have been
accepted for payment by the Purchaser prior to the time of such vote or
action (and any and all non-cash dividends, distributions, other Shares,
rights or securities issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after
October 6, 1994), at any meeting of stockholders (whether regular or special
and whether or not an adjourned meeting) of the Company, or consent in lieu
of any such meeting, or otherwise. All such powers of attorney and proxies
are irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the tendered Shares and
Rights and are granted in consideration of, and are effective when, and only
to the extent that, the Purchaser accepts such Shares and Rights for payment.
Such acceptance for payment shall revoke any other proxies granted by the
undersigned at any time with respect to such Shares and Rights (and any such
non-cash dividends, distributions, other Shares, rights or other securities,
including Distributions) and no subsequent proxies or written consents will
be given (and if given will be deemed not to be effective) with respect
thereto by the undersigned.

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has
full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares and
Rights tendered hereby (and any and all dividends, distributions, other
Shares, rights or other securities issued or issuable in respect thereof,
including Distributions, on or after October 6, 1994) and that, when the same
are accepted for payment by the Purchaser, the Purchaser will acquire good
and unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all pledges, liens,
restrictions, charges, proxies and encumbrances and the same will not be
subject to any adverse claim.

Upon request, the undersigned will execute and deliver any additional
documents deemed by the Depositary or the Purchaser to be necessary or
desirable to complete the sale, assignment and transfer of the Shares
tendered hereby (and any and all dividends, distributions, such other Shares,
rights or other securities, including Distributions). In addition, the
undersigned shall promptly remit and transfer to the Depositary for the
account of the Purchaser any and all other Shares and Rights or other
securities, including Distributions, issued to the undersigned on or after
October 6, 1994 in respect of Shares and Rights tendered hereby, accompanied
by appropriate documentation of transfer, and, pending such remittance or
appropriate assurance thereof, the Purchaser shall be entitled to all rights
and privileges as owner of any such other Shares and Rights or other
securities and may withhold the entire consideration or deduct from the
consideration the amount or value thereof, as determined by the Purchaser in
its sole discretion.

All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred in this Letter of
Transmittal shall not be affected by, and shall survive, the death or
incapacity of the undersigned and any obligation of the undersigned hereunder
shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs, executors,
administrators and

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

legal and personal representatives of the undersigned. Except as stated in
the Offer to Purchase, the Supplement and the Letters of Transmittal, this
tender is irrevocable. The undersigned understands that tenders of Shares and
Rights pursuant to any one of the procedures described in the Offer to
Purchase and in the instructions hereto will constitute a binding agreement
between the undersigned and the Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer.

Unless otherwise indicated herein under "Special Payment Instructions,"
please issue the check for the purchase price and/or return any certificates
for Shares and Rights not tendered or accepted for payment in the name(s) of
the registered holder(s) appearing under "Description of Shares Tendered."
Similarly, unless otherwise indicated under "Special Delivery Instructions,"
please mail the check for the purchase price and/or return any certificates
for Shares and Rights not tendered or accepted for payment (and accompanying
documents, as appropriate) to the registered holder(s) appearing under
"Description of Shares Tendered" and "Description of Rights Tendered" at the
address shown below the undersigned's signature. If both the Special Delivery
Instructions and the Special Payment Instructions are completed, please issue
the check for the purchase price, and/or return any certificates for Shares
and Rights not tendered or accepted for payment in the name of, and deliver
said certificates and check and return such certificates to, the person or
persons so indicated. Stockholders delivering Shares and Rights by book-entry
transfer may request that any Shares and Rights not accepted for payment be
returned by crediting such account maintained at a Book-Entry Transfer
Facility as such stockholder may designate by making an appropriate entry
under "Special Payment Instructions." The undersigned recognizes that the
Purchaser has no obligation pursuant to the Special Payment Instructions to
transfer any Shares and Rights from the name of the registered holder thereof
if the Purchaser does not accept for payment any of the Shares and Rights so
tendered.

INSTRUCTIONS
FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

1. GUARANTEE OF SIGNATURES. No signature guarantee on this Letter of
Transmittal is required (i) if this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the
registered holder of the Shares or Rights (which term, for the purposes of
this document, shall include any participant in a Book-Entry Transfer
Facility whose name appears on a security position listing as the owner of
Shares) tendered herewith, unless such holder has completed either the box
entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or the box entitled "Special Delivery
Instructions" on the reverse hereof or (ii) if such Shares are to be tendered
for the account of a bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association
or other entity which is a member in good standing of the Securities Transfer
Agent's Medallion Program (collectively, "Eligible Institutions"). In all
other cases, all signatures on the Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed
by an Eligible Institution. If the Share Certificates or Rights Certificates
are registered in the name of a person other than the signer of this Letter
of Transmittal, or payment of the purchase price is to be made or
certificates for unpurchased Shares and Rights are to be issued or returned
to a person other than the registered owner, then the tendered certificates
must be endorsed or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, in either case
signed exactly as the name or names of the registered owner or owners appear
on the certificates, with the signatures on the certificates or stock powers
guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See Instruction 5.

2. DELIVERY OF LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND CERTIFICATES. This Letter of
Transmittal is to be completed by stockholders either if certificates are to
be forwarded herewith or if tenders of Shares or Rights are to be made
pursuant to the procedures for delivery by book-entry transfer set forth in
the Offer to Purchase. Certificates for all physically tendered Shares, or
timely confirmation of any book-entry transfer into the Depositary's accounts
at DTC, MSTC or PHDTC or Shares tendered by book-entry transfer, as the case

Transmittal (or facsimile thereof) with any required signature guarantees, or
an Agent's Message in the case of a book-entry delivery, and any other
documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, must be received by the
Depositary at one of its addresses set forth herein on or prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) and Rights
Certificates, or Book-Entry Confirmation of a transfer of Rights into the
Depositary's account at a Book-Entry Transfer Facility, if available
(together with, if Rights are forwarded separately from Shares, a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof)
with any required signature guarantee, and any other documents required by
this Letter of Transmittal), must be received by the Depositary at one of the
addresses set forth herein prior to the Expiration Date or, if later, within
five business days after the date such Rights Certificates are distributed.
Stockholders whose Share Certificates or Rights Certificates are not
immediately available (including, if the Distribution Date has occurred,
because Rights Certificates have not yet been distributed by the Company), or
who cannot deliver their certificates and all other required documents to the
Depositary on or prior to the Expiration Date or who cannot complete the
procedures for delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis may tender
their Shares and/or Rights by properly completing and duly executing the
Notice of Guaranteed Delivery pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedure
set forth in the Offer to Purchase. Pursuant to such procedure: (i) such
tender must be made by or through an Eligible Institution, (ii) a properly
completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in
the form provided by the Purchaser, must be received by the Depositary on or
before the Expiration Date and (iii) the certificates for all tendered Shares
and/or Rights or confirmation of any book-entry transfer into the
Depositary's account at DTC, MSTC or PHDTC of Shares and/or Rights tendered
by book-entry transfer, as the case may be, together with a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof) with
any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer,

Depositary within (a) in the case of Shares, five Nasdaq National Market

Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and (ii) five business days after Rights
Certificates are distributed to stockholders by the Company, all as provided
in the Offer to Purchase and in the Supplement. If Share Certificates are
forwarded separately to the Depositary, a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof) must accompany each
such delivery.

TENDERING STOCKHOLDERS MAY CONTINUE TO USE THE ORIGINAL BLUE LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL AND GREY NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY THAT WERE PROVIDED WITH
THE OFFER TO PURCHASE. Although such BLUE Letter of Transmittal indicates
that the Offer will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
Thursday, November 3, 1994, stockholders will be able to tender (or withdraw)
their Shares and Rights pursuant to the Offer until 12:00 midnight, New York
City time, on Friday, November 4, 1994 (or such later date to which the Offer
may be extended). TENDERING STOCKHOLDERS MAY ALSO USE THIS REVISED GREEN
LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND THE GOLD NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY PROVIDED
WITH THE SUPPLEMENT.

THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARE CERTIFICATES, RIGHTS CERTIFICATES, THIS
LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND ANY OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY
THROUGH A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY, IS AT THE OPTION AND RISK OF THE
TENDERING STOCKHOLDER AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS INSTRUCTION
2, THE DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE
DEPOSITARY. IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT
REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted and no
fractional Shares or Rights will be purchased. All tendering stockholders, by
execution of this Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), waive any
right to receive any notice of the acceptance of their Shares or Rights for
payment.

3. INADEQUATE SPACE. If the space provided herein is inadequate, the
certificate numbers and/or the number of Shares or Rights should be listed on
a separate signed schedule attached hereto.

4. PARTIAL TENDERS (NOT APPLICABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS WHO TENDER BY
BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER). If fewer than all the Shares or Rights evidenced by any
certificate submitted are to be tendered, fill in the number of Shares or
Rights which are to be tendered in the box entitled "Number of Shares
Tendered" or "Number of Rights Tendered." In such case, new certificate(s)
for the remainder of the Shares or Rights that were evidenced by old
certificate(s) will be sent to the registered holder, unless otherwise
provided in the boxes entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or "Special
Delivery Instructions" on this Letter of Transmittal, as soon as practicable
after the Expiration Date. All Shares or Rights represented by certificates
delivered to the Depositary will be deemed to have been tendered unless
otherwise indicated.

5. SIGNATURES ON LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, STOCK POWERS AND ENDORSEMENTS. (a)
If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares and Rights tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond exactly
with the name(s) as written on the face of the certificate(s) without
alteration, enlargement or any change whatsoever.

(b) If any of the Shares or Rights tendered hereby are owned of record by
two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of
Transmittal.

(c) If any tendered Shares or Rights are registered in different names on
several certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as
many separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of
certificates.

(d) If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificates or stock powers are
signed by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact,
officer of a corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or
representative capacity, such person should so indicate when signing, and
proper evidence satisfactory to the Purchaser of such person's authority so
to act must be submitted.

(e) When this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s)
of the Shares or Rights listed and transmitted hereby, no endorsements of
certificates or separate stock powers are required unless payment is to be
made to, or certificates for Shares or Rights not tendered or purchased are
to be issued in the name of, a person other than the registered holder(s).
Signatures on such certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution (unless signed by an Eligible Institution).

(f) If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered holder(s) of the Shares or Rights listed, the certificates must be
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed
exactly as the name or names of the registered holder(s) appear on the
certificates. Signatures on such certificates or stock powers must be
guaranteed by an Eligible Institution (unless signed by an Eligible
Institution).

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

(g) Unless and until the Purchaser declares the Merger Agreement Condition
to be satisfied, if Rights Certificates have been distributed to holders of
Shares, such holders are required to tender Rights Certificate(s)
representing a number of Rights equal to the number of Shares tendered in
order to effect a valid tender of such Shares. It is necessary that
stockholders follow all such signature requirements of this Instruction 5
with respect to the Rights in order to tender such Rights.

6. STOCK TRANSFER TAXES. Except as set forth in this Instruction 6, the
Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid any stock transfer taxes with respect
to the transfer and sale of purchased Shares and Rights to it or its order
pursuant to the Offer. If payment of the purchase price is to be made to, or
if certificates for Shares and Rights not tendered or purchased are to be
registered in the name of, any person other than the registered holder, or if
tendered certificates are registered in the name of any person other than the
person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any stock
transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder or such other
person) payable on account of the transfer to such person will be deducted
from the purchase price unless satisfactory evidence of the payment of such
taxes or exemption therefrom is submitted.

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS INSTRUCTION 6, IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY FOR
TRANSFER TAX STAMPS TO BE AFFIXED TO THE CERTIFICATES LISTED IN THIS LETTER
OF TRANSMITTAL.

7. Special Payment and Delivery Instructions. If a check is to be issued
in the name of, and/or certificates for unpurchased Shares or Rights are to
be returned to, a person other than the signer of this Letter of Transmittal
or if a check is to be sent and/or certificates for unpurchased Shares or
Rights are to be returned to someone other than the signer of this Letter of
Transmittal or to an address other than that shown above, the appropriate
boxes on this Letter of Transmittal should be completed. Stockholders
tendering Shares or Rights by book-entry transfer may request that the Shares
or Rights not purchased be credited to such account maintained at a
Book-Entry Transfer Facility as such stockholder may designate hereon. If no
such instructions are given, such Shares or Rights not purchased will be
returned by crediting the account at a Book-Entry Transfer Facility
designated above. See Instruction 1.

8. REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE OR ADDITIONAL COPIES. Requests for assistance
may be directed to, or additional copies of the Supplement, the Offer to
Purchase, and the revised GREEN Letter of Transmittal may be obtained from
either the Information Agent or the Dealer Manager at their respective
address set forth below or from your broker, dealer, commercial bank or trust
company.

9. IRREGULARITIES. All questions as to the validity (including time of
receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender of Shares or Rights will be
determined by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, whose determination
shall be final and binding. The Purchaser reserves the absolute right to
reject any and all tenders determined by it not to be in the appropriate form
or the acceptance for purchase of which may, in the opinion of its counsel,
be unlawful. As set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Purchaser also
reserves the absolute right to waive any of the conditions of the Offer or
any defect or irregularity in the tender of any Shares or Rights of any
particular stockholder whether or not similar defects or irregularities are
waived in the case of other stockholders. The Purchaser's interpretations of
the terms and conditions of the Offer (including these instructions) will be
final and binding. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities must be cured
within such time as the Purchaser shall determine. None of the Purchaser, the
Dealer Manager, the Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person
will be under any duty to give notice of any defects or irregularities in
tenders or shall incur any liability for failure to give any such
notification. Tenders shall not be deemed to have been made until all defects
and irregularities have been cured or waived.

10. 31% BACKUP WITHHOLDING; SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9. Under federal income tax
laws, a stockholder whose tendered Shares are accepted for payment is
required to provide the Depositary with such stockholder's correct taxpayer
identification number ("TIN") on Substitute Form W-9 below and certify under
penalties of perjury that such number is correct and that such stockholder is
not subject to backup withholding. If the Depositary is not provided with the
correct TIN and certifications are not provided, the Internal Revenue Service
may subject the stockholder or other payee to a $50 penalty. In addition,
payments that are made to such stockholder or other payee with respect to
Shares or Rights purchased pursuant to the Offer may be subject to 31% backup
withholding.

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and
certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an
exempt recipient, the stockholder must submit a Form W-8, signed under
penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt status. A Form
W-8 can be obtained from the Depositary. See the enclosed "Guidelines for
Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for
more instructions.

If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 31%
of any such payments made to the stockholder or other payee. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of persons
subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld.
If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained
from the Internal Revenue Service.

The box in Part 3 of the Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the
tendering stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a TIN or
intends to apply for a TIN in the near future. If the box in Part 3 is
checked, the stockholder or other payee must also complete the Certificate of
Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number below in order to avoid backup
withholding. Notwithstanding that the box in Part 3 is checked and the
Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number is completed, the
Depositary will withhold 31% of all payments made prior to the time a
properly certified TIN is provided to the Depositary. The stockholder is
required to give the Depositary the TIN (e.g., social security number or
employer identification number) of the record owner of the Shares or Rights
or of the last transferee appearing on the transfers attached to, or endorsed
on, the Shares or Rights. If the Shares or Rights are in more than one name
or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed "Guidelines
for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9"
for additional guidance on which number to report.

11. LOST, DESTROYED OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES. If any certificate(s)
representing Shares or Rights has been lost, destroyed or stolen, the
stockholder should promptly notify the Information Agent. The stockholder
will then be instructed as to the steps that must be taken in order to
replace the certificate(s). This Letter of Transmittal and related documents
cannot be processed until the procedures for replacing lost or destroyed
certificates have been followed.

IMPORTANT: THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL (OR A FACSIMILE THEREOF) OR AN AGENT'S
MESSAGE, TOGETHER WITH CERTIFICATES OR CONFIRMATION OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER
AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY, OR THE
NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY, ON OR PRIOR
TO THE EXPIRATION DATE.

Purchase, dated October 6, 1994 (the "Offer to Purchase"), as amended and
supplemented by the Supplement thereto, dated October 26, 1994 (the
"Supplement"), and in the revised GREEN Letter of Transmittal (which,
together with the original BLUE Letter of Transmittal, constitute the
"Offer") enclosed herewith.

If the Purchaser declares that the Merger Agreement Condition (as defined
in the Offer to Purchase and in the Supplement) is satisfied, the Purchaser
will not require delivery of Rights. Unless and until the Purchaser declares
that the Merger Agreement Condition is satisfied, holders of Shares will be
required to tender one Right for each Share tendered to effect a valid tender
of such Share. If the Distribution Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase
and in the Supplement) has not occurred prior to the time Shares are tendered
pursuant to the Offer, a tender of Shares will constitute a tender of the
associated Rights. If the Distribution Date occurs and the certificates
representing Rights ("Rights Certificates") are distributed by the Company to
holders of Shares prior to the time a

<PAGE>

holder's Shares are tendered pursuant to the Offer, in order for Rights (and
the corresponding Shares) to be validly tendered, Rights Certificates
representing a number of Rights equal to the number of Shares tendered must
be delivered to IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Company (the "Depositary") or, if
book-entry delivery is available with respect to Rights, a book-entry
confirmation must be received by the Depositary with respect thereto. If the
Distribution Date occurs and Rights Certificates are not distributed prior to
the time Shares are tendered pursuant to the Offer, Rights may be tendered
prior to a stockholder receiving Rights Certificates by use of the guaranteed
delivery procedures described in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase and
below. In any case, a tender of Shares constitutes an agreement by the
tendering stockholder to deliver Rights Certificates representing a number of
Rights equal to the number of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer to the
Depositary within five business days after the date Rights Certificates are
distributed. The Purchaser reserves the right to require that the Depositary
receive Rights Certificates, or a book-entry confirmation, if available, with
respect to such Rights prior to accepting the corresponding Shares for
payment pursuant to the Offer, if the Distribution Date occurs prior to the
expiration of the Offer (the "Expiration Date"). Holders of Shares and Rights
whose certificates for such Shares ("Share Certificates") or, if applicable,
Rights Certificates, are not immediately available (including, if the
Distribution Date has occurred, because Rights Certificates have not yet been
distributed) or who cannot deliver their Share Certificates or, if
applicable, their Rights Certificates, and all other required documents to
the Depositary on or prior to the Expiration Date, or who cannot complete the
procedures for book-entry transfer on a timely basis, must tender their
Shares and Rights according to the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth
in Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase. All references to Rights shall include
all benefits which may inure to stockholders pursuant to the Rights Agreement
and, unless the context requires otherwise, all references to Shares shall
include the Rights.

Please furnish copies of the enclosed materials to those of your clients
for whose accounts you hold Shares registered in your name or in the name of
your nominee.

affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or
imprisonment.

SUMMARY OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
UP TO $250,000,000 TENDER OFFER FACILITY

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Borrower: California Energy Company on a non-recourse basis in form satisfactory to the Agent.

Agent/Arranger/
Underwriter: Credit Suisse

Lenders: The Agent and any other financial institutions to which the facility may be syndicated by
the Agent.

Facility: Up to a $250,000,000 12-month tender offer facility (the "Facility") subject to
Regulation U and renewable/extendable for a term of up to three-years from initial
funding at the mutual consent of both the Borrower and Lenders.

Use of Proceeds: The Borrower proposes to capitalize CE Acquisition Company, Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary ("Newco"), for the purpose of tendering for 51% of the stock of Magma
Power Company (the "Target"). A condition of the tender will be the execution and
delivery of a definitive merger agreement between Newco and the Target (the "Merger
Agreement Condition"), although that condition may be waived by the Borrower as
contemplated in the Offer to Purchase of the Borrower and Newco dated October 6,
1994, as it may be amended, (the "Offer to Purchase") under the caption "The Merger
Agreement Condition." No material amendment to the Offer to Purchase shall be
effective for purposes of this term sheet without the prior written consent of the Bank.
If the Merger Agreement Condition is not waived, the form of the merger agreement
shall be satisfactory to the Agent. Funds provided by the Facility will be advanced by
the Borrower to Newco to purchase a secured note of Newco (the "Newco Secured
Tender Note"). The proceeds from the sale of the Newco Secured Tender Note will be
used, together with the Borrower's capital investment in Newco and other available
moneys which will be in an amount and form satisfactory to the Agent, to purchase the
tendered stock of the Target, and to pay related fees and costs of the transaction. The
economic terms of the Newco Secured Tender Note will mirror the terms of the Facility.

Borrowing Options: Adjusted LIBOR and Base Rate.

<PAGE>

"Adjusted LIBOR" means the average (rounded upward to the next higher 1/16 of 1%)
of the rates offered to the reference Lenders in the London interbank market for deposits
in an amount and maturity corresponding to the interest period for the advance. LIBOR
will be adjusted for reserves and other regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

"Base Rate" means the higher of the Agent's prime rate or the federal funds rate +
0.50% per annum.

Applicable
Interest Margins: LIBOR + 2.50%
Base Rate + 1.25%

Computation of
Interest: Interest on Base Rate loan segments will be payable quarterly in arrears and calculated
on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 365/366 day year.

Interest on LIBOR loan segments will be payable in arrears (i) at the end of each
applicable interest period and (ii) in the case of any interest period longer than three
months, every three months during such period. Interest on LIBOR loan segments will
be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360 day year.

Default Rate: All applicable margins will be increased by 2.00% per annum and all loan segments shall
be maintained as Base Rate loan segments effective in the case of LIBOR loan segments
at the end of each then existing period.

Scheduled
Amortization: The Facility will not be subject to a scheduled amortization prior to its maturity.

Mandatory
Prepayments: Subject to mandatory prepayment as a whole in connection with (i) any sale of any of the
ownership interest of the Target by Newco; (ii) a permanent injunction of the merger
between Newco and the Target; and (iii) the closing of the merger between Newco and
the Target. Subject to mandatory prepayment in part in an amount equal to the proceeds
of any dividends, loans, advances or other distributions from Target to Newco or from
Newco to Borrower.

Optional
Prepayments: Optional prepayments will be permitted at any time in excess of a threshold amount
without premium or penalty other than payment of applicable "breakage" costs on LIBOR
loan segments. Required notice to the Agent will be (i) one Business Day prior to the
date of prepayment of any Base Rate loan segment and (ii) three Business Days prior to
the date of prepayment of any LIBOR loan segment.

<PAGE>

Application of
Prepayments: All principal reductions shall be permanent. Prepayments will be applied first to Base
Rate loan segments and then to LIBOR loan segments. The prepayment of LIBOR loan
segments will be subject to the payment of "breakage" costs if the date of prepayment
is not the last day of an interest period unless, at the option of the Borrower, the
prepayment amount is escrowed with the Agent and invested in United States Treasury
Securities to the last day of the applicable interest period.

Security: The Facility will be secured by an assignment and a pledge of the Newco Secured Tender
Note, including the Target stock pledged as security thereunder in form satisfactory to
Agent. Payments on the collateral will be paid directly to the Agent, as collateral agent
for the Lenders. The Borrower will provide for the payment of interest on the Facility
in a manner satisfactory to the Agent. The Facility will be non-recourse to the Borrower,
and the Lenders will agree to make an appropriate election under Section 1111(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code to continue such non-recourse status in any proceeding involving
Borrower as Debtor under the Bankruptcy Code.

CORRECTING THE MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS --

WHAT MAGMA DIDN'T TELL YOU

32

<PAGE>

[CE logo appears here]

CORRECTING THE MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS

WHAT MAGMA DIDN'T TELL YOU

#1 CONSTRUCTION:

- - Magma Misstatements and Omissions

- Magma uses multiple E&C contractors and CE uses single-source
(Kiewit)

- - The Facts

- Kiewit competes for all construction opportunities on an arm's
length basis

- Since Kiewit investment, CE has used multiple contractors:
- Raytheon built Yuma (50 MW)
- Ormat building Upper Mahiao (120 MW)
- Kiewit building Mahanagdong (180 MW)
- Casecnan E&C - not selected

- Magma claim of multiple contractors not verifiable due to limited
construction activity

#2 OWNERSHIP:

- - Magma Misstatements and Omissions

- Magma retains 50% or greater ownership and CE retains 50% or less

- - The Facts

- California Energy (All operated by CE):
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Navy I 46%
Navy II 50%
BLM 48%
Desert Peak 100%
Roosevelt Hot Springs 70%
Yuma 100%
Upper Mahiao 100%
Mahanagdong 50%

- Magma Power (4 of 7 projects):
Vulcan 50%
Hoch 50%
Elmore 50%
Leathers 50%
</TABLE>

33

<PAGE>

[CE logo appears here]

#3 OPERATING PERFORMANCE:

- - Magma Misstatements and Omissions

- Magma has operated at 109% of contracted capacity in the last 4
years and CE has operated at 96% of contracted capacity 1991-1993

- - The Facts

- Since 1991, Coso has averaged 113% of contracted capacity

- Coso currently operates at 128% of contracted capacity

#4 PLANT DEPRECIATION:

- - Magma Misstatements and Omissions

- Magma depreciates plants over a 20 year period and CE over a 37.5
year period

- - The Facts

- Weighted average depreciation for ALL CE geothermal depreciable
assets is 24.6 years vs. 20 years for Magma

#5 HIGHLY LEVERAGED:

- - Magma Misstatements and Omissions

- Magma's Debt/Total Capital ratio is 24.9% and CE's is 76.1%

- - The Facts

- Net Debt/Total Capitalization: 35.3%
- Net Debt (excluding non-recourse project financing)/Total
Capitalization: 13.0%

- Magma balance sheet is unleveraged due to absence of new project
financings

#6 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:

- - Magma Misstatements and Omissions

- Magma wells experience little if any decline while new Coso wells
decline 35% to 45% in first year

34

<PAGE>

[CE logo appears here]

- - The Facts

- Average decline for Coso is currently about 11% which is in line
with original projections

- As Magma expands their use of the resource their declines will
naturally increase. Additionally, Salton Sea is a different type
of reservoir

#7 ROYALTY PAYMENTS:

- - Magma Misstatements and Omissions

- Magma's royalties are levelized, while CE's are back-end loaded

- - The Facts

- Back-end loaded royalty payments provide NPV benefits to
shareholders and are evidence of superior negotiating

#8 COST REDUCTION:

- - Magma Misstatements and Omissions

- Magma has a public plan to reduce cost to 2.5cents by 1998, while CE
has no publicly announced plan

- - The Facts

- Beginning in 1991, CE implemented cost reduction programs leading
to a current cost of 2.28cents per Kwh compared to Magma's current
cost of 4.2cents

CONCLUSION: THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES

FIVE REASONS TO ACCEPT CALIFORNIA ENERGY'S OFFER

36

<PAGE>

[CE logo appears here]

FIVE REASONS TO ACCEPT THE OFFER

REASON #1 - $38.50/SHARE REPRESENTS FAIR VALUE

- - Proof:

- 40% premium to market price prior to CE offer

- Substantial premium to Magma's discounted cash flow value
which reflects real and potential development opportunities

- DLJ indicates $35.00/share is a fair price.

- Wall Street Transcript quotes Ralph Boeker, Magma CEO: "I
don't think we're totally undervalued" on August 1, 1994
when stock price was $28.75

- Obviously, two of your top executives agree, Mr. Boeker.
They sold 10,000 shares at an average price of $34.25 in
1994.

- On October 10, 1994, Mr. Boeker said, "In making its offer
at this time, California Energy is trying to buy Magma at a
bargain price that does not remotely reflect Magma's
intrinsic value and long-term strategic promise."

WHICH WAY IS IT, MR. BOEKER?

37

<PAGE>

[CE logo appears here]

FIVE REASONS TO ACCEPT THE OFFER

REASON #2 - CE AND MAGMA COMBINATION BENEFITS ALL SHAREHOLDERS

- - Benefits include:

- Strong combined annual cash flow

- Anticipated cost reductions

- Operational efficiencies

- Increased size, stability and diversification of asset base
and geothermal resources

- Increased global development opportunities

38

<PAGE>

[CE logo appears here]

FIVE REASONS TO ACCEPT THE OFFER

REASON #3 - CE MANAGEMENT IS BEST ABLE TO MEET FUTURE CHALLENGES

- - International IPP Development Requires More than Just Caretaker
Management

- David Sokol, CEO, and his team at Ogden Projects, successfully
developed, financed and constructed 16 power projects in 6 years

- CE's management team has completed the most innovative financings
in the industry ($560mm Coso Funding, $400 million zero coupon
Senior Notes)

- CE's management team averages 10 years experience in the IPP
industry while Magma's management team averages only 3 years

- - Kiewit Beneficially Owns 43.3% of CE Stock and has been Extremely
Supportive

39

<PAGE>

[CE logo appears here]

FIVE REASONS TO ACCEPT THE OFFER

REASON #4 - OFFER CONTAINS NO SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES

- - Merger Agreement

- - Financing in Place

- CE has $300mm Cash

- Binding Bank Commitments for $500mm

- - Kiewit Votes 38% of CE Stock and Has Approved the Deal

CE PREFERS TO OFFER THE SAME CONSIDERATION TO ALL SHAREHOLDERS

40

<PAGE>

[CE logo appears here]

FIVE REASONS TO ACCEPT THE OFFER

REASON #5 - MAGMA'S SHARE PRICE IS EXPECTED TO PLUMMET
IF CALIFORNIA ENERGY RETRACTS ITS OFFER

- - No Other Offers have been Announced

- - Magma's Share Price has Declined Steadily Throughout 1994

- - Offer Price Exceeds Magma's LTM Trading Level

- - Dow Sales of Magma Stock have been at Prices Below CE's Offer

- - JP Morgan Research Analyst warns, "If the CE deal were to fall
through, Magma shares could fall significantly (possibly as low as the
pre-bid level of $27.50)"

- - CE will not Overpay for an Acquisition and is Willing to Walk Away if
the Price is Not Right (e.g., Westmoreland Energy)
