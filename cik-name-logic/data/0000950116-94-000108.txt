Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

Registrant on August 1, 1994 purchased from Pembroke
Associates Limited Partnership, a Wisconsin limited partnership
("Seller"), The Palms of Pembroke Apartments, a 348-unit garden
apartment community, in Pembroke Pines, Broward County, Florida,
for $20,496,500. The purchase price was allocated $20,096,500
for the real property and $400,000 for the personal property. In
addition, closing costs, brokers fees and other expenses paid by
Registrant aggregated approximately $1,039,000 after
apportionments. The purchase was pursuant to a Purchase and Sale
Agreement dated May 9, 1994 as amended on June 28, 1994 by and
between the Trustees of Registrant and Seller. (The Purchase and
Sale Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.7 and made a part
hereof.) There is no relationship between any Trustee, officer
or affiliate of the Registrant and any partner of the Seller.

Registrant paid cash for the apartment complex,
borrowing all the required proceeds from two banks. The
borrowing totaled $21,583,000, which included the purchase price,
closing costs, 1994 real estate taxes and miscellaneous expenses
incurred or to be incurred in connection with the acquisition. 
Of the amount borrowed, $15,000,000 was from Meridian Bank, a
Pennsylvania banking corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at
the per annum rate equal to Meridian's National Commercial Rate
for a term of one year or such later date as may be established
by written agreement; and the balance of $6,583,000 was from
CoreStates Bank, N.A., a national banking association,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania pursuant to an unsecured revolving
credit loan agreement at CoreStates' Prime Rate for a term of the
earlier of one year or three days after the closing by Registrant
of an offering of its equity securities. Both loans are general
obligations of Registrant.

Registrant anticipates spending an additional $500,000 for
installation of washers and dryers in the individual apartments,
an entry gate for controlled access, enhancements to the
landscaping and general refurbishing.

Location: The property is located on 24.5 acres on
Palms Boulevard, midway between Interstate 75 and the Florida
Turnpike. It is approximately one mile east of the Pembroke
Lakes Regional Mall and adjacent to a public park.

Description: The Palms of Pembroke was constructed in
1988 and consists of 31 two and three story buildings of concrete
block and wood frame construction, with pitched roofs and a
stucco exterior. The apartments are a mix of one, two and three
bedroom units, ranging in size from 568 to 1,159 square feet. 
Some of the two and three bedroom units are townhouses. Tenants
have the use of a club house, swimming pool, jacuzzi, fitness
center and laundry facilities, all of which are part of the
premises. Of the 348 apartment units, 112 units have either canal
or lake view.

Taxes: In 1993 the ad valorem property taxes with
maximum discount were $325,684 and the 1993 personal property
taxes with maximum discount were $14,934.

Mortgage Payable: The property is unencumbered by debt.

<PAGE>

Occupancy Percentage and Rentals: The following table
sets forth the number and types of apartment units, square
footage without balconies and the current renewal rent.

Sq. Ft. Per Unit Current Renewal
Number of Units Unit Type (without Balconies) Rent

24 Small 1 Bedroom 568 $ 600
1 Bath

--- (Townhouse)

Average 919 767
Club House 3,942

348 Aggregate Sq. Ft. 323,874
===

The apartments are generally rented for a term of one
year and then automatically renew on a month-to-month basis. At
July 31, 1994 there were seven vacancies, for an occupancy rate
of 98%, 50 notices of intention to vacate and 22 applications for
units at the complex, leaving 35 (10%) units to lease.

Competition: There are numerous apartment complexes in
the immediate vicinity of The Palms of Pembroke, some of which
have been constructed within the past three years. Of the
competing apartment complexes, some have monthly rents which are
higher and some have monthly rents which are lower. Registrant
believes that the area in which The Palms of Pembroke is located
is where 50% of Broward County's population growth is expected to
occur through the year 2000.

Environmental: Registrant had a Phase I environmental
study performed prior to its acquisition of The Palms of Pembroke. 
The property was also tested for Radon gas, which was found in 84
of the ground floor units. Registrant will perform additional
tests in an effort to determine if the level of Radon gas is
within federal and state guidelines. Radon is a naturally
occurring radioactive gas that, when it has accumulated in a
building in sufficient quantities, may present health risks to
persons who are exposed to it over time.

Management Arrangement: The apartment complex will be
managed by employees of the Registrant.

This financial statement is the responsibility of The Palms of Pembroke's

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement
is free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statement. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 1, the accompanying statement of revenue and certain 
expenses was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended
to be a complete presentation of The Palms of Pembroke's revenues
and expenses.

In our opinion, the financial statement referred to above presents fairly,
in all material respects, the revenues and certain expenses of The Palms
of Pembroke for the year ended August 31, 1993, in conformity with

insurance) except for actions for possession, damages and or rent
against defaulted tenants as disclosed in Exhibit "D" and the
actions disclosed pursuant to Section 7.3.16. Any litigation for
eviction of tenants which may be pending as of the Closing Date
shall be assumed by Buyer and Buyer shall be substituted for
Seller in such actions and Buyer's counsel shall be substituted
for Seller's counsel as counsel of record in such actions.

5.6 No Tax Assessments. To Seller's best knowledge,
there are no public improvements in the nature of off-site
improvements, or otherwise, which have been ordered to be made
and/or which have not heretofore been assessed, and, there are
neither special or general assessments currently affecting or
pending against the Property except as set forth in the Title
Binder, nor any pending threatened, or proposed changes to public
or private roads which provide access or major traffic service to
the Premises.

5.7 Premises Leases. There are no oral or written
leases or rights of occupancy or grants or claims of right, title
or interest in any portion of the Premises other than the leases
(the "Leases") listed on the rent roll which is attached hereto
as Exhibit "D" and made a part hereof. The rent roll attached
hereto as Exhibit "D" has been prepared by Seller, using its
reasonable efforts to identify (i) each unit by number, (ii)
each vacancy, (iii) each tenant of the Premises, (iv) the initial
date of that tenant's lease, (v) the expiration date of that
tenant's lease, (vi) the monthly minimum rental charge, (vii)
arrearages, if any and whether the latest rent due has been paid,
(viii) the amount of prepaid rent, if any, and (ix) the amount of
the security deposit plus all interest to which the tenant is
entitled. The rent roll shall be supplemented by a written
disclosure from Seller to Buyer to the extent such information

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 11 EXHIBIT 10.7

applies, prepared by Seller, using its reasonable efforts to
identify (i) a description of the documents constituting said
Tenant's Lease, including all modifications, if different from
the Lease Form; (ii) the amount or description of any
concessions, allowances, rebates, refunds, refunds, pet deposits,
key deposits, cleaning fees, setoffs, reduced rent, escrow or
security deposits made by the tenant under said Tenant's Lease;
(iii) any options to renew, extend, purchase, cancel or
terminate; (iv) any defaults, outstanding notices of defaults of
any kind or nature whatsoever, claims of defaults or similar
claim under Leases, (v) whether such tenant is an employee of
Seller, (vi) whether such tenant is providing or provided
occupancy on a basis other than an individual or family long-term
basis, such as in connection with a corporate or company lease
arrangement, a short-term basis or a transient basis, (vii)
whether landlord is obligated to provide special services to such
tenant, such as furnishings, housecleaning, or maid service, and
(viii) such other information as Buyer's lender may request. No
tenant has asserted in writing that Seller is in default under
any of the Leases or asserted in writing any claim or basis for
any claim for free or reduced rent or right of setoff against the
landlord or the rent under the Leases, and Seller and its agent
have no knowledge of any default or any event which has taken
place which, with the passage of time, could become an event of
default. Seller has the sole right to collect any rents under
the Leases and neither such right nor any of the Leases has been
assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered by Seller
except as additional collateral for the existing mortgage upon
the Premises which shall be satisfied at Closing. No holder of
any such collateral assignment has asserted or exercised any of
its right to collect such rents. Each of the Leases is in the
form of the Lease Form, is valid and subsisting and in full force
and effect, to Seller's best knowledge the tenant is in actual
possession in the normal course and the rents set forth in
Exhibit "D" are the actual rents, income and charges being
collected by Seller under the Leases. The amount of each
security deposit and prepaid rent contains, where required by law
or otherwise applicable, interest which has accrued in accordance
with law. No tenant or other person has any right or option to
acquire the Premises, or any part thereof, or to terminate any of
the rights currently appurtenant to the Premises, and there are
no restrictive covenants in any leases. No tenant of the
Premises under any of the Leases has, and shall not at Closing
have, prepaid any rent under any of the Leases for more than one
(1) month, except prepaid rent which shall be credited to Buyer
at Closing. Except as otherwise set forth on Exhibit "D" no
security deposits by tenants have heretofore been returned or
applied to charges against the tenants. Seller shall deliver to
Buyer at Closing an updated rent roll, certifying the same as
true, correct and complete as of the day before Closing. It is
understood that Seller has prepared the rent roll in good faith
and without any intention to misstate or omit any of the
information set forth in the rent roll. However, Buyer
acknowledges that the rent roll may contain unintentional errors
or omissions and the terms of the Leases shall control with
respect to any discrepancies between information set forth in the
Leases and information set forth in the rent roll.

5.8 Compliance with Law.

(i) To Seller's best knowledge, but without
independent investigation, the Property and the continued
maintenance, operation, and use of them comply with all
requirements of federal, state and local law, and all
requirements of all governmental bodies or agencies having
jurisdiction thereof, including, without limitation, the Fair
Housing Act, as amended from time to time; and, there are no
outstanding notices of any violations issued by governmental
authority having jurisdiction of the Property. 

(ii) To Seller's knowledge, but without
independent investigation, no Hazardous Substances (defined
below) and no Wastes (defined below) are present on the Premises
and there has been no use of the Premises that may, under any
federal, state or local environmental statute, ordinance or
regulation, require, at any time, any closure or cessation of the
use or occupancy of the Premises and/or impose, at any time, upon
the owner of the Premises any clean-up or other monetary
obligation. Seller hereby further represents and warrants that
to Seller's best knowledge, but without independent
investigation, it has not been identified in any litigation,
administrative proceeding or investigation as a responsible party
or potentially responsible party for any liability for clean-up
costs, natural resource damages or other damages or liability for
prior disposal or release of Hazardous Substances, Wastes or
other environmental pollutants or contaminants, and that no lien
or superlien has been recorded, filed or otherwise asserted
against any real or personal property of Sellers for any clean-up
costs or other responses costs incurred in connection with any
environmental contamination that is attributable, in whole or in
part, to Seller. Seller hereby indemnifies and holds Buyer
harmless from (a) any governmental authority, and (b) any other
third party, but as to such other third party only for a claim
made within the twelve months succeeding Closing, as to any and
all liability, loss or damage suffered or incurred as a result of
a claim, demand, cost or judgment arising from the deposit,
storage, disposal, burial, dumping, injecting, spilling, leaking,
or other placement or release in or on the Premises of Hazardous
Substances or Wastes arising prior to the Closing Date. This
indemnification shall not apply to any matters which are
disclosed in the environmental audit to be obtained by Seller
pursuant to this section or as to which Seller leanrs or with
reasonable diligence could have been learned of prior to Closing. 
For purposes of this Agreement, "Hazardous Substances" means
those elements and compounds which are designated as such in
Section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Response, Compensation and
Liability Act ("CERCLA"), 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 (14), as amended
through the date hereof, all petroleum products and by products,
and any other hazardous substances as that term may be further
defined in any current applicable federal state or local laws
which are in concentrations, quantities or containers which

which have not been obtained to comply with applicable laws;
which have not been obtained and excepting elements and compounds
which are present or are used in compliance with applicable law
and "Hazardous Wastes" means any hazardous waste, residential or
household waste, solid waste, or other waste as defined in

concentrations, quantities or containers which violate applicable

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 13 EXHIBIT 10.7

laws or require permits, licenses or approvals which have not
been obtained to comply with applicable laws which have not been
obtained and excepting elements and compounds which are present
or are used in compliance with applicable law. Seller has not
received any summons, citation, directive, letter or other
communication, written or oral, from any governmental or quasi-
governmental authority concerning any intentional or
unintentional action or omission on Seller's part which (a)
resulted in the releasing, spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring,
emitting, emptying or dumping of Hazardous Substances or Wastes,
or (b) related in any way to the generation, storage, transport,
treatment or disposal of Hazardous Substances or Wastes. Seller
represents and warrants that to Seller's best knowledge, without
independent investigation, the Premises have not been identified
on the federal CERLIS, the National Priorities List (40 C.F.R.
Part 300, App. B) or any state or local list of potential
hazardous waste disposal sites. Seller represents and warrants
that to Seller's best knowledge, without independent
investigation, there are no wetlands or fresh-water wetlands on
the Premises as those terms are defined in applicable state
and/or federal laws nor are there any other environmental
features present on the Premises which would inhibit the
continuation of the Current Use (defined below). Without
limiting the generality of any other provision of this Agreement,
it is specifically understood that Seller has made no independent
investigation with respect to any of the representations and
warranties set forth in this subsection 5.8. Buyer shall, at its
expense, obtain an environmental audit from a reputable
consultant, carrying liability insurance of at least $500,000,
with respect to the Property during the Inspection Period (as
defined below) which audit shall be certified to and may be
relied upon by both Seller and Buyer.

5.9 Insurance. During the inspection period, Seller
shall provide Buyer with copies of all insurance policies
affecting the Property and the operation thereof. All of said
insurance policies shall remain in full force and effect until
the completion of Closing hereunder. Seller has not received any
written notice from any insurance company board of fire
underwriters or rating organization (or other body exercising
similar functions) (i) claiming any defects or deficiencies which
have not been cured or corrected, or (ii) requesting the
performance of any repairs, alterations or other work which have
not been performed, or (iii) claiming any default which, if not
corrected, would result in a cancellation of insurance coverage. 
If assignable, Seller shall at Closing, upon Buyer's prior notice
and payment of the pro rata share of the premium, assign such
insurance policies to Buyer as the successor owner of the
Premises.

5.10 Current Use is Unrestricted. To Seller's best
knowledge, the current use of the Premises is as a 348 unit
multi-family project with accessory tennis court, swimming pools,
and offstreet parking spaces as represented on the survey
("Current Use").

5.11 Leasing Commissions. No brokerage or leasing
commission or other compensation is will at Closing be due or
payable to any person, firm, corporation, or other entity with
respect to or on account of any of the Leases, or any extensions

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 14 EXHIBIT 10.7

5.12 All Adequate Utilities. To Seller's best
knowledge, without independent investigation, usable public
sanitary and storm sewers, public water facilities, electric
facilities and, if any, gas facilities (collectively, the
"Utilities"), are installed in, and are duly connected to, the
Premises and can be used without charge except the normal and
usual metered utility charges and water and sewer charges. All
of said Utilities are installed and operating and all
installation, connection, and "tap-in" charges have been paid for
in full.

5.13 All Permits, Approvals and Certificates. To
Seller's best knowledge, without independent investigation, all
required certificates of occupancy for each unit at the Property
and all other licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals
necessary for the operation of the Property have been validly
issued and are in good standing and shall remain so upon
consummation of Closing. To Seller's best knowledge, without
independent investigation, all charges and fees for such have
been paid in full. 

5.14 Good Title to Property. Seller holds good and
marketable, indefeasible legal title to the Property, free and
clear of liens and encumbrances other than the lien of security
interests securing any existing mortgage loans, and the Permitted
Encumbrances.

5.15 All Taxes and Assessments Paid. To Seller's best
knowledge, Seller will have paid, prior to Closing, all taxes and
assessments, including assessments payable in installments, which
are to become due and payable and/or a lien on the Property,
except for taxes for the current year which shall be prorated at
Closing.

5.16 FIRPTA. Seller is not a "foreign person" as such
term is defined in Section 1445(f)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, as amended (the "Code"). In the event that Seller
is a "foreign person", or in the event that Seller fails or
refuses to deliver the certificate required pursuant to Section
12.2.1.6 hereof, or in the event that Buyer receives notice from
any "transferor's agent" or "transferee's agent" (as such terms
are defined in Section 1445(d) of the Code) that, or Buyer has
actual knowledge that, such certificate is false, Buyer shall
deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price a tax equal to 10%
thereof, as required by Section 1445 of the Code. In the event
of any such withholding, the Closing hereunder shall not be
otherwise affected, Buyer shall remit such amount to and file the
required form with the Internal Revenue Service, and Seller, in
the event of any claimed over-withholding, (i) shall be limited
solely to an action against the Internal Revenue Service for a
refund, and (ii) hereby waives any right of action against Buyer
on account of such withholding. 

5.17 Intentionally omitted.

5.18 Mechanic's Liens. To Seller's best knowledge, No
work has been performed or is in progress at, and no materials
have been furnished to the Premises which, though not presently
the subject of might give rise to mechanic's, materialmen's, or
other liens against the Premises or any portion thereof, except
that for which full and complete releases have been obtained. If
any lien for any such work is filed before or after Closing,
Seller shall promptly discharge the same or transfer it to a bond
pursuant to Florida law.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 15 EXHIBIT 10.7

this Agreement, such copies:

(i) are exact copies of the originals of said
documents, as executed and delivered by all of the
parties thereto;

(ii) to the best of Seller's knowledge,
constitute, in each case, the entire agreement between
the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter
thereof, and the original instruments in the form
delivered to the Buyer, are now in full force and
effect, and, to Seller's best knowledge, no party
thereto is in default and no claim of default by any
party has been made or is now pending and there does
not now exist any default which, after either the
giving of notice or the passing of time, or both, will
or may constitute a default, or would excuse
performance by any party thereto; and

(iii) have not been changed or amended except
for amendments, if any, specifically referred to
therein.

5.21 As used in this Agreement, the term "to the best
of Seller's knowledge" means the actual current recollection of
Ronald A. Gargano and Daniel T. Mendicino and does not include
constructive knowledge of any matters or information. This term
does not imply that Seller has undertaken any independent
investigation to determine the existence or absence of any facts
or circumstances.

B. In order to induce the Seller to enter into this
Agreement, the Buyer hereby warrants and represents to the
Seller, in addition to any other representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, that the following warranties and
representations are true now and will be true at Closing: Buyer
is a duly organized and validly existing trust formed under the
laws of Pennsylvania and is duly qualified to conduct business in
the State in which the Premises are located. Buyer has full
power, right and authority to own its properties, to carry on its
business as now conducted, and to enter into and fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement. Each of the persons executing
this Agreement on behalf of Buyer is authorized to do so. This
Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of Buyer,
enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and compliance with its
terms will not conflict with or result in the breach of any
applicable law, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, rule
or regulation of any court, administrative agent or other
governmental or quasi-governmental authority applicable to Buyer. 
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and compliance with
its terms will not conflict with or result in the breach of any
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument to which
Buyer is a party or by which it or the Premises is bound. Buyer
shall deliver to Seller such documentation as Seller may
reasonably request to evidence the foregoing.

<PAGE>

6. POSSESSION. Possession of the Premises is to be given
to Buyer, subject to the right of tenants under the Leases, on

7. BUYER'S INSPECTION AND APPROVAL.

7.1 Title Binder. Within seven (7) days after the
date of this Agreement, Seller shall deliver a title commitment
("Title Binder") from the Title Company together with true,
correct and legible copies of all recorded documents listed as
exceptions therein (collectively the "Backup Documents"). Buyer
shall have until the Inspection Period Expiration Date (as
hereinafter defined) to examine the condition of title and the
terms and provisions of all said items, documents and Survey, and
to approve or disapprove the same. If Buyer shall disapprove the
condition of title, Buyer shall notify Seller of such disapproval
("Disapproval Notice") of the condition of title to the Premises
or any of the terms, provisions or contents of said items,
documents or Survey which are disapproved by Buyer ("Title
Objections"). Subject to the provisions of the succeeding
portion of this Section 7.1, Seller shall have the right by
written notice to Buyer within three (3) business days of the
receipt of Disapproval Notice to elect to cure or eliminate all
items which Buyer disapproves in the Disapproval Notice, and to
furnish evidence satisfactory to Buyer and the Title Company that
all such items have been cured or eliminated or that arrangements
have been made with the Title Company and any parties in interest
to cure or eliminate the same at or prior to the Closing,
provided such cure must be completed within forty-five (45) days
after the date of its receipt of the Disapproval Notice ("Title
Cure Expiration Date"). At any time during the forty-five (45)
day cure period, Seller may advise Buyer in writing that Seller
has determined that it will be impractical (for economic or other
reasons) to cure or eliminate the objections. In such event, or
if Seller fails or is unable to cure or remove such objections
within the thirty (30) day cure period, Buyer, as Buyer's sole
option, may, within three (3) business days thereafter, advise
Seller in writing that Buyer has elected either to (i) accept
title to the Premises in its then existing condition, on a
Closing Date no earlier than ten (10) days after such notice, or
such earlier date as Buyer may designate or (ii) terminate this
Agreement, in which event the Deposit shall be refunded to Buyer
and thereafter this Agreement will be null and void and the
parties will have no further rights or obligations hereunder,
except with respect to obligations which expressly survive the
termination of this Agreement. If Buyer fails to give written
notice of its election as and when required, Buyer shall be
deemed to have elected option (ii). If Buyer declines or fails
to object to any condition of title during the Inspection Period,
Buyer will be deemed to have accepted and approve the form and
substance of the Title Binder and the Survey and the title to the
Premises.

7.2 Survey. Buyer may obtain a current survey (the
"Survey") of the Premises prepared by a duly licensed land
surveyor reasonably acceptable to Seller. Seller shall cooperate
with Buyer in the ordering and preparation of the Survey. Buyer
shall have until the Inspection Period Expiration Date in which
to examine the Survey and to approve or disapprove the same. If
Buyer shall disapprove of anything shown on the Survey, Buyer
shall notify Seller of such disapproval in the manner provided in
Section 7.1 on or prior to the Inspection Period Expiration Date. 
In such event, any such matters shall be treated in the same
manner as Title Objections pursuant to Section 7.1.

have the right to have performed a physical and mechanical
inspection, measurement and audit of the Property and an
inspection of all books and records and financial information
pertaining thereto, and Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and
shall furnish or make available for its inspection and
photocopying to Buyer such information, materials and documents
as Buyer may reasonably request and shall have its accountant
available throughout such period to assist in Buyer's inspection
and review. The inspection, audit and measurement of the
Property's operation, condition and maintenance shall include,
without limitation, environmental inspections, reviews and
assessments that Buyer deems appropriate. Seller shall provide
sufficient staff for Buyer to gain entry to inspect all units and
other portions of the Property from time to time. If Buyer, in
Buyer's sole judgment, shall find such inspection to be
unsatisfactory for any reason whatsoever, Buyer shall have the
right, at its option, to terminate this Agreement on or before
the Inspection Period Expiration Date, and, upon such
termination, the Deposit shall be immediately returned to Buyer
and thereupon the parties hereto shall have no further
liabilities one to the other with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement. Buyer agrees that it shall not unreasonably
interfere with Tenants in performing its inspection. In

written notice to Buyer, provided, however, Buyer may reinstate
Seller's obligations under this Agreement by prompt written
notice to Seller of Buyer's waiver of Seller's liability for such
assessment. Pending liens as of the Closing Date for assessments
related to work which has not been commenced prior to Closing

BACKGROUND

A. Buyer and Seller entered into a certain Purchase and
Sale Agreement last executed the 10th day of May, 1994.

B. The capitalized terms used in this Amendment shall have
the same meanings as in the Agreement, unless otherwise defined
herein, or the context of the Amendment clearly requires
otherwise. 

C. The Buyer and Seller desire to amend certain provisions
of that Agreement as set forth herein.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein, and with the preceding background
paragraphs incorporated by reference, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

1. Section 2.1 is amended to delete the amount "Twenty

($20,746,500)" and insert in its stead the amount "Twenty Million
Four Hundred Ninety-six Thousand Five Hundred Dollars
($20,496,500)".

2. Section 2.2.2 is amended to delete the amount
"$20,546,500" and insert in its stead the amount "$20,296,500".

3. Section 4.1 is amended to delete from the first
sentence the language "in the same fashion as performed for
buildings painted within such period and, in accordance with the
same schedule currently being followed by Seller (accordingly,
four buildings will not be painted and their landscape will not

4. Section 8 is amended by deleting the second sentence
and substituting in its place the following: "Seller shall be
liable for any breach of warranty or representation contained in
this Agreement which results in damages in excess of $50,000,

in the aggregate for the first sixty days after Closing, and
thereafter reduced to $300,000 until the end of the twelfth month

5. Section 11.2 is amended to delete the amount "$648,000"
and substitute in its stead the amount "$615,000".

6. The reduction in the Purchase Price reflected in
Paragraph 1 of this Amendment is in consideration for issues

Property. In consideration of the reduction in the Purchase
Price, Buyer hereby releases Seller of and from any and all
liability of any type or nature arising out of or in connection
with the presence of radon gas at the Property including, but not
limited to, any claims relative to radon which Buyer may make
with respect to breaches of representations and warranties in the
Agreement, any claims for a further reduction of the Purchase
Price, or any claims pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement;
provided, however, such disclaimer and waiver shall not affect
Seller's obligations to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from
(a) any governmental authority, and (b) any other third party,
but as to such other third party only for a claim made within the
twelve months succeeding Closing, as to any and all liability,
loss or damage suffered or incurred as a result of a claim,
demand, cost or judgment arising from any radon presence, or
deposit, storage, disposal, burial, dumping, injecting, spilling,
leaking, or other placement or release in or on the Premises of
Hazardous Substances or Wastes arising prior to the Closing Date.

7. This Amendment is conditioned upon receipt by Seller of
the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners of
Seller to this Amendment on or before July 13, 1994. Should
Seller be unable to obtain sufficient consents from the limited

written notice to Buyer on or before the end of business on July
13, 1994. Should Seller cancel this Amendment, Buyer may cancel
the Agreement by written notice to Seller on or before July 20,
1994 and obtain a return of all deposits in which event neither
party shall have any further liability under the Agreement except
as expressly stated in the Agreement in the event of a
termination of the Agreement.

8. Buyer and Seller hereby warrant and represent, each as
to itself, the following:

(a) The Agreement is binding and enforceable upon it
and nothing done pursuant to this Amendment shall affect the
binding nature and enforceability of the Agreement.

(b) It is in full and complete compliance with all of
its obligations under the Agreement.

(d) It has no actual knowledge of any default by the
other party under the Agreement and it does not have any actual
knowledge of any state of facts which, but for the giving of

party under the Agreement.

9. Except as otherwise modified hereby, the terms and
provisions of the Agreement shall remain unmodified and in full
force and effect.
