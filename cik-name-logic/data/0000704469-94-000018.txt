Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Kentucky Community Bancorp, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kentucky
Community Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on February 15,
1994, the Corporation merged into Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kentucky Community
Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993 the
Corporation adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" and No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities".
