ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On September 19, 1994, FFMC was declared the winning bidder to acquire
Western Union Financial Services, Inc. ("Western Union") in bankruptcy
proceedings of Western Union's parent company, New Valley Corporation ("New
Valley") in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. FFMC has
entered into a Purchase Agreement with New Valley dated as of October 20, 1994
(the "Purchase Agreement") to purchase all of the stock of Western Union, as
well as certain assets of New Valley relating to the money transfer business
conducted by New Valley and Western Union. The Purchase Agreement provides for
a cash purchase price of $893,223,000 plus the assumption by FFMC of the
Western Union Pension Plan, as to which benefit accruals have been permanently
suspended. The Purchase Agreement permits Western Union to declare a dividend
of $117,895,435 prior to the closing.

The Bankruptcy Court on November 1, 1994 entered a Confirmation Order
confirming a plan of reorganization of New Valley incorporating the Purchase
Agreement and a Sale Order authorizing the sale to FFMC of all of the stock of
Western Union and related assets pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The plan
of reorganization was approved by all classes of creditors and holders of
equity of New Valley, so no efforts to appeal or stay the Confirmation Order
are anticipated. Consummation of the Western Union acquisition is expected to
occur during November 1994 (the "Closing Date"), subject to a number of
conditions, including the obtaining of all necessary governmental approvals.
The cash portion of the purchase price will be paid (i) $643,223,000 at the
Closing Date, and (ii) $250,000,000 in January 1995.

The Purchase Agreement requires New Valley to indemnify FFMC for certain
losses arising (within eighteen months after the Closing Date in most instances
and subject to the applicable statute of limitations in other instances) from a
breach of any of the covenants, representations and warranties of New Valley.
Subject to certain exceptions, such liability will not apply until losses
exceed $2.5 million and will be limited to $45 million. Of the Purchase Price,
$45 million will be placed in escrow for thirty months following closing and
will be available to satisfy any such indemnification obligations of New
Valley, subject to reduction of the escrow amount by up to $20 million upon
completion of the audited pro forma balance sheet and payment of any related
purchase price adjustment, and subject to further reduction of up to $18
million at the end of the eighteenth month following the Closing Date.

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date Western Union and New
Valley will enter into certain related agreements providing for: a license to
New Valley to use the Western Union name and trademark in its messaging
business; the furnishing by Western Union to New Valley of certain sales,
marketing and other services related to the messaging business and other
consulting and administrative services; options granting FFMC the right to
purchase from New Valley, and New Valley the right to sell to FFMC, the
messaging business of New Valley for a purchase price of $20 million in cash
during the first quarter of 1996; and the payment by New Valley to FFMC or
Western Union of certain royalties and fees for such license and services.

Western Union, headquartered in Paramus, New Jersey, is the worldwide leader
in the nonbank immediate money transfer business with an established network of
over 24,000 agents in over 75 countries. In 1993 Western Union completed over
40 million money transfers involving the movement of over $7.8 billion. The
company has an estimated 90% of the rapid consumer, nonbank money transfer
market in the U.S. Through the use of a central computer system, information
about each transfer is readily available on-line to Western Union agents.
Transfers may be picked up, usually within minutes, at any agent location on a
"will call" basis. Western Union also provides nationwide electronic-based
bill payment services which enables customers to pay utility bills and other
obligations electronically at agent offices.

FFMC expects that Western Union will enhance its business activities due to
Western Union's worldwide leadership in payment services of a type where
significant barriers to entry exist. Western Union's network of over 24,000
agents in over 75 countries will expand FFMC's abilities to reach customer
markets throughout the world. In addition, Western Union's strength in nonbank
immediate money transfer represents an expansion of FFMC's product offerings.
Western Union's emphasis on the consumer market, rather than commercial
customers, reflects a further expansion of FFMC's overall customer base.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

February 22, 1994

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of
Western Union Financial Services, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Western
Union Financial Services, Inc., (a wholly owned subsidiary of New Valley
Corporation) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As explained in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Western
Union Financial Services, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of New Valley
Corporation, with which it has significant intercompany transactions. As
discussed in Note H, on March 31, 1993 New Valley Corporation consented to an
order for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and is
operating as a debtor-in-possession.

WESTERN UNION FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.
(A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of New Valley Corporation)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Western Union Financial Services, Inc. ("FSI"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of New Valley Corporation (the "Parent Company"), and
its subsidiaries (collectively the "Company"). All significant intercompany
transactions with FSI's subsidiaries have been eliminated.

Certain amounts in the 1991 and 1992 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1993 presentation.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. The Company defines "cash and cash
equivalents" in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as cash in banks, cash
in transit and temporary cash investments in highly liquid marketable
securities. Temporary cash investments consist primarily of commercial paper
with maturities of three months or less and money market funds.

MONEY TRANSFER. The money transfer operations of FSI require FSI to
maintain licenses in most states. Such licenses generally require the
maintenance of minimum levels of net worth and/or liquidity; these requirements
are met by FSI.

Cash received by FSI and its agents generally becomes available to FSI
within one to three days after initial receipt. The money transfer payable
represents amounts to be paid to transferees when they call for their funds,
generally within minutes of receipt by FSI of the transferor's funds.

PAYABLE TO UTILITIES. Cash and checks received by agents for
payment to utilities generally become available from one to several days after
initial receipt by the agents, depending on the number of days required to
clear checks through the banking system. The foregoing does not apply to cash
and checks received by agents and deposited directly into accounts held for the
utilities. These deposits are immediately applied to reduce the principal due
to the utilities. The amount reported as payable to utilities represents other
principal amounts due to the utilities.

RESTRICTED FUNDS. The restricted funds consist of deposits
held by insurance companies or the banking authorities of various states in
connection with the operation of the money transfer business.

10
<PAGE> 11
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Net property and equipment, which
consists mainly of computers, office equipment and furniture, is stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation.

DEPRECIATION. Depreciation on property and equipment is
computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives (5 - 10
years). A major portion of depreciation expense is related to assets held
under capital leases. As property and equipment is retired, its cost and the
related accumulated depreciation are eliminated.

GOODWILL. In 1989, Western Union National Payments Network,
Inc. ("WUNPN"), now a wholly-owned subsidiary of FSI, acquired all the
businesses of National Payments Network ("NPN"). This acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase and the excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, $13 million, was recorded as
goodwill and amortized over forty years. In 1991 and 1992, WUNPN wrote down
$6.6 million and $2.6 million of goodwill resulting from the loss of certain
NPN customers. The remaining goodwill is now being amortized over eleven years
using the straight-line method.

INCOME TAXES. In January 1993, FSI prospectively adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (FAS 109), Accounting for
Income Taxes which changes FSI's method of accounting for income taxes from the
deferred method (APB 11) to an asset and liability approach. The asset and
liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities.
Such adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's financial
statements.

The Company's Federal income tax provision is paid to the
Parent Company, which files a consolidated Federal income tax return. The
state income tax provision represents applicable taxes payable to the various
states in which FSI operations are taxable.

Federal income taxes are calculated at the statutory rate on
pretax income, excluding certain expenses which are not deductible for tax
purposes. There are no significant timing differences.

NOTE B - RETIREMENT PLAN

The Company's eligible full-time employees are covered under
the Parent Company's defined contribution retirement and savings plan, under
which the Company contributes 4% of eligible employee compensation, plus
matching contributions up to 1.2% and 4.2% of such compensation for unionized
and non-union employees, respectively, who make voluntary contributions to the
plan. Expense under this plan was $2.4, $2.3 and $2.2 million in 1993, 1992
and 1991, respectively.

Based on the current union contract and corporate policy
towards non-union employees, FSI was not required to record any liability upon
adoption of SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions", and does not expect to be required to record any
liability in the future.

OPERATING LEASES. FSI leases its headquarters facility in
Paramus, New Jersey under an operating lease which expires in 2000. FSI also
leases certain real properties, principally from the Parent Company, for use as
customer service centers and sales offices. The Company leases certain data
communications terminals, computers, office equipment and motor vehicles.
Annual rent and lease expense was $1.7 million for 1993 and 1992, and $1.8
million in 1991.

The future minimum rental payments required under operating
leases with initial terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 1993 are as
follows:

Effective January 1, 1990, the Parent Company leased certain
computer equipment to FSI under a capital lease with the result that FSI
recorded the assets, with a net book value of approximately $22 million, at the
Parent Company's historical cost basis. Subsequent thereto, the Parent Company
made an additional cash capital contribution to FSI, the proceeds of which were
used to repay the capital lease obligation.

COMMITMENTS. Data processing services are provided by
Electronic Data Systems Corporation to FSI and the Parent Company pursuant to a
contract which continues through the year 2000. FSI's expenses were $11.4
million, $10.5 million and $8.5 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
Contracted minimum payments for 1994 are $10.6 million.

NOTE E - JOINT VENTURES

In 1991, FSI formed a joint venture with a Russian bank,
initiating the first consumer instant money transfer service between the United
States and Russia. This joint venture has recently been awarded a license as a
credit institution by the Central Bank of Russia. The service is presently
available in numerous locations in Moscow as well as several other locations in
Russia and other former Soviet Republics. It is anticipated that additional
locations will be established in the future.

In 1991, FSI entered into a joint venture to develop and
operate a check-cashing services business. At December 31, 1993, FSI had
invested $5.1 million in the joint venture's operations and capital
expenditures. FSI has determined to end its commitment to fund this joint
venture and accordingly wrote off its remaining investment of $3.3 million.

In October 1992, FSI entered into a joint venture to provide
bill payment services in Argentina. The joint venture corporation is owned 25%
by FSI. The joint venture will begin operations in 1994.

NOTE F - CONTINGENCIES

In May 1990 the Parent Company filed a complaint against
Datek-InstaCard Corp. and Goldome, which has been subsequently placed under the
control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey. The complaint, which seeks
substantial damages, alleges material misrepresentations and breaches of
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the purchase of NPN.
In connection with the litigation, WUNPN has suspended payments on the $5.4
million note issued to Goldome as part of the purchase price. The Parent
Company and the defendants are also in dispute with respect to the settlement
and apportionment of funds, certain expenses and other items in connection with
the sale. In the litigation, the defendants seek damages in excess of $17
million. FSI has been added as a defendant with respect to counterclaims
asserted by Datek.

NOTE H - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Parent Company has granted FSI a royalty-bearing,
non-exclusive, perpetual license to utilize certain trademarks and service
marks including the name "Western Union".

The Parent Company provided FSI with certain administrative
services including legal, regulatory affairs, human resources, data processing,
accounting, treasury, tax management, insurance, purchasing, real estate
management and corporate communications. The related agreement provided that
the Parent Company may earn a profit on certain of those services comparable to
that earned by unaffiliated service providers. The Company is included in the
consolidated Federal income tax return of the Parent Company and is charged
with an amount equivalent to its Federal income tax computed at the statutory
rate on a separate-return basis less any applicable tax losses. The agreement
allows the Company and the Parent Company to offer certain services to each
other at market rates. FSI is reimbursed by the Parent Company and earns a
reasonable profit for providing such services.

As of December 1993, all employees of the Parent Company were
transferred to FSI and FSI has agreed to act as agent for the Parent Company in
the marketing and delivery of its commercial messaging services. FSI will also
provide any required administrative services to the Parent Company. FSI will
charge the Parent Company fees for services provided and may make a profit
while acting as an agent.

See Note C for information regarding the lease of computer
equipment to FSI by the Parent Company.

FSI paid dividends on its common stock in the amount of $16
million in 1993 and $9 million in 1991 to the Parent Company.

Certain FSI employees are covered under the Parent Company's
suspended defined benefit pension plan. In the event of a termination of this
plan by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, FSI would have joint and
several liability with the Parent Company with respect to any underfunded
obligations. FSI is also jointly and severally liable for the funding of the
Parent Company's pension plan. However, if called upon to do so, any amounts
paid may be offset against charges for services provided to it by the Parent
Company. In 1993, FSI paid the required minimum funding contributions with
respect to the pension plan and was reimbursed by the Parent Company through
offsets to billings for services provided.

The stock of WUNPN is pledged as collateral to secure the
Parent Company's 19 1/4% Senior Secured Notes which were due December 15, 1992.

On March 31, 1993, the Parent Company consented to an order
for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and is now
operating as a debtor-in-possession. FSI and other wholly-owned subsidiaries
of the Parent Company were not included in the bankruptcy proceedings and
continue to operate in the normal manner.

On February 16, 1994 the Parent Company filed an Amended Plan
of Reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court. In connection with the Plan, the
Parent Company has developed a proposal to refinance its capital structure and
improve its operating and financial flexibility. There are three other
proposed plans of reorganization being considered by the Court. No plan has
yet been approved or confirmed by the Court.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Western Union Financial Services, Inc.
("FSI"), a wholly owned subsidiary of New Valley Corporation (the "Parent
Company"), and its subsidiaries collectively (the "Company"). All significant
intercompany transactions with FSI's subsidiaries have been eliminated.

The consolidated financial statements as of September 30,
1994 presented herein have been prepared by FSI without an audit. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September
30, 1994 and the results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented
have been made. Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results for an entire year. Certain amounts in the 1993 financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.

These financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the Consolidated Financial Statements in FSI's 1993 Annual Report.

NOTE B - DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS

Debt and other obligations are as follows:

Long-term portion . . . 9,234 7,479
</TABLE>

The fair market value of the 9% Note is not determinable due
to the fact that it is currently the subject of litigation (Note C).

21
<PAGE> 22
NOTE C - CONTINGENCIES

In May 1990 the Parent Company filed a complaint against
Datek-InstaCard Corp. and Goldome, which has been subsequently placed under the
control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey. The complaint, which seeks
substantial damages, alleges material misrepresentations and breaches of
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the purchase of NPN.
In connection with the litigation, WUNPN has suspended payments on the $5.4
million note issued to Goldome as part of the purchase price. The Parent
Company and the defendants are also in dispute with respect to the settlement
and apportionment of funds, certain expenses and other items in connection with
the sale. In the litigation, the defendants seek damages in excess of $17
million. FSI has been added as a defendant with respect to counterclaims
asserted by Datek.

An unfavorable decision in this proceeding, in the absence of
full or partial recovery of the Company's claims against the defendants, could
have an adverse impact on cash flow. While it is not possible to predict the
outcome of this matter, management believes after consultation with counsel,
that it has meritorious positions with respect to the claims described above,
and it intends to defend those positions vigorously. In any event, management
believes that the outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position.

continue to operate in the normal manner.

On October 20, 1994 the Parent Company along with the Official
Committee of Secured Noteholders and the Statutory Unsecured Committee of
Unsecured Creditors of New Valley Corporation filed an Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court.

In conjunction with such plan, the Bankruptcy Court authorized
the sale of FSI to First Financial Management Corporation along with the
assumption of the Western Union Pension Plan by First Financial Management
Corporation. As a part of this plan, New Valley is assuming the $5.4 million
note payable to Datek-InstaCard and assumed all responsibilities for the
litigation described in Note C. The sale of FSI was approved in a confirmation
hearing in Bankruptcy Court on November 1, 1994.

FIRST FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying pro forma combined financial statements conform to the current
presentation format of FFMC's financial statements. The unaudited pro forma
balance sheet and statements of income reflect the combined financial position
and results of operations of FFMC and Western Union.

The pro forma balance sheet at September 30, 1994 assumes that the acquisition
of Western Union occurred on that date. The pro forma statements of income
assume that the acquisition was completed on January 1, 1993.

The pro forma statements of income assume the use of the Company's revolving
bank credit facility to provide the financing for this transaction. If
suitable conditions arise, FFMC intends to use longer term debt instruments or
other securities as the ultimate source of financing, which may have higher
average interest rates. The Company is contemporaneously filing a shelf
registration statement covering such securities.

The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the
results which actually would have occurred had the transaction been in effect
on the dates and for the periods indicated or which may result in the future.

FIRST FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

(1) Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the balance sheet and
statement of income presentation formats for Western Union to the formats
used by FFMC.

(2) Under the Purchase Agreement certain net cash payments totalling $124
million will be paid by Western Union to New Valley at closing, including
a permitted dividend of $118 million. In addition FFMC will use $100
million of its cash in the acquisition of Western Union.

(3) At closing certain transfers of assets and liabilities will occur between
Western Union and New Valley as follows:

Messaging service business assets and liabilities will be
transferred from Western Union to New Valley. Equipment and
other capital assets and related liabilities relating to
ongoing operations will be transferred from New Valley to
Western Union. New Valley will assume a $5.4 million note
payable to Datek-InstaCard, Inc. and related liabilities and
assume all responsibilities related to current litigation
between Western Union and Datek-InstaCard.

The net effect of the transfers will be to increase Western Union net 
assets by $8.2 million.

(4) Adjustment for the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. It is assumed that historical
amounts approximate fair value for tangible and identified intangible
assets acquired. Such allocations are based upon current estimates which
will be subsequently adjusted based upon final determination of the fair
values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the closing date.
The excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired (see note 7) is
as follows ($millions):

Cash purchase price $ 893.2
Pension Plan liability assumed 266.0
Acquisition costs 28.0
Less deferred tax asset related to Pension
Plan liability (106.5)
------- 
$1,080.7
=======
</TABLE>

Deferred tax liability of $58 million has been netted against the deferred
tax asset established above.

(5) Elimination of intercompany payable to New Valley ($14.3 million), and
establishment of accrual for estimated acquisition costs ($28 million).
See Note (4) above.

(6) Long-term debt related to acquisition (cash purchase price including
deferred portion payable in January 1995, net of FFMC cash used).

(7) Elimination of shareholders' equity of Western Union. The effect of all
the above adjustments, prior to applying the adjustment in note 4 above,
was to reduce shareholder's equity of Western Union to zero.

29
<PAGE> 30
(8) Adjustments to reflect the elimination of messaging service business
revenue and related expense because such business is to be retained by New
Valley. Income before tax related to the messaging service business was
$4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1993 and $1.6 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 1994.

(9) Adjustments to eliminate royalty and other fees paid to New Valley which
will not continue after the acquisition.

(10) Adjustments to reflect the amortization of the excess of cost over the
fair value of assets acquired, using a straight-line method over 40 years.
Adjustments have also been made to reflect depreciation on equipment and
other capital assets transferred to Western Union from New Valley.

(11) Adjustments to reflect additional interest expense related to $793.2
million in bank debt used to finance a portion of the cash purchase price
and interest foregone on $100 million of FFMC cash used. Interest expense
reflects borrowings under a new debt agreement entered into in connection
with the acquisition at the current rate available under such agreement of
6.2%. The current rate is higher than the comparable average rates in
1993 of 3.6% and the first nine months of 1994 of 4.9%. Interest foregone
on FFMC cash used is based on investment rates earned by the company in
1993 (3.0%) and 1994 (3.8%).

Interest rates under the debt agreement fluctuate. The impact of a 1/8
percent increase in the rate would be approximately $1 million of
additional interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1993 and
$750,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 1994.

(12) Adjustments to reflect the net periodic pension cost under the Western
Union Pension Plan, as to which benefit accruals were permanently
suspended. The 1993 amount is based on actuarial assumptions and was
previously reported in New Valley's 1993 Form 10-K. The 1994 amount is
based on similar actuarial assumptions.

(13) Tax effect of pro forma adjustments. The tax computation includes the
deductibility of the majority of goodwill amortization. New Valley has
agreed to make the necessary tax elections to allow the deductibility by
FFMC of goodwill, except for that portion associated with the assumption
of the Western Union pension plan which is deductible for tax purposes
when paid. Additionally, a pro forma adjustment has been made to increase
Western Union's state income tax from its historical rate to a rate which
excludes the benefit it received from using New Valley's tax loss
carryforwards in calculating its state income taxes.

ARTICLE I. PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES AND RELATED ASSETS; TREATMENT
OF EXCLUDED ASSETS AND SHARED ASSETS.

1.1. RELATED ASSETS; PURCHASE OF SHARES. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, on the closing date of the

affiliates (any references herein to Purchaser being deemed to include such
designated affiliates unless the context indicates otherwise), and Purchaser,

Seller, the Shares and the Related Assets owned by it or any of its

in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims (as

<PAGE> 8
"claim" is defined in Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code), security
interests of whatever kind or nature, mortgages, pledges, charges, licenses,
options, rights-of-recovery, judgments, orders and decrees of any court or
foreign or domestic governmental entity, interest, tax (including foreign,
state and local taxes), in each case, of any kind or nature, whether secured or
unsecured, choate or inchoate, filed or unfiled, scheduled or unscheduled,
noticed or unnoticed, recorded or unrecorded, contingent or non-contingent,
material or non-material, known or unknown and including all claims based on
any theory that Purchaser is a successor, transferee or continuation of Seller
or the business of Seller (collectively, "Liens" and each a "Lien") whether
arising prior to or subsequent to the date of the filing of the Chapter 11
petition of Seller, other than, in the case of the Related Assets only, the
Liens set forth in Schedule 1.1 ("Permitted Liens") (the consummation of such
transactions other than the transfers at the Second Closing referred to in
Section 2.7, if applicable, being hereinafter referred to as the "Closing").
It is the intention of the parties that, after giving effect to the sale of the
Shares and the Related Assets and the transfer of the Excluded Assets (as
defined below), Purchaser shall own, either directly or through ownership of
FSI and the FSI Subsidiaries, all interests owned by Seller and its
subsidiaries and affiliates as of the date of this Agreement and through the
Closing (and, if applicable, the Second Closing) in and to all Marks (as
defined below) incorporating the words "Western Union," regardless of when such
Marks were created, whether alone or in conjunction with other words, and
associated goodwill, as used in connection with the Business or otherwise (all
such Marks being hereafter referred to as the "Western Union Name and
Trademark"), subject to the licenses and other agreements set forth in Schedule
3.7(a), and shall own or have an interest in all of the assets and properties
reflected on the June 30, 1994 Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet (the "Pro Forma
Balance Sheet") attached hereto as Exhibit A (other than for changes in such
assets and properties pursuant to this Agreement or as may occur after the date
of such Pro Forma Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of the Business and
consistent with the terms of this Agreement).

1.2. EXCLUDED ASSETS. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause FSI
to transfer and assign to Seller or an affiliate all of the assets and
properties owned by it which are used exclusively in the conduct of the
Messaging Services Business (the "Excluded Assets") (all of which assets are
listed in Schedule 1.2), pursuant to the Bill of Sale attached as Exhibit F-2,
free and clear of all Liens in favor of, or arising through, FSI or an FSI
Subsidiary and Seller shall assume and be responsible for all liabilities and
obligations (whether fixed, contingent, matured or unmatured, known or unknown,
liquidated or unliquidated) related to the Excluded Assets. The parties hereto
understand and agree that if any Excluded Assets cannot be transferred to
Seller at or prior to the Closing Date by reason of any required consent or
approval

3
<PAGE> 9
not being obtained, FSI and Purchaser will use reasonable efforts to transfer
to Seller the benefits and burdens of such Excluded Assets so that Seller may
enjoy the use of such Excluded Assets.

1.3. SHARED ASSETS AND RELATED AGREEMENTS. The assets and
properties of FSI or Seller (including the Related Assets) which following the
Closing Date (and, if applicable, the Second Closing) shall be used in the
conduct of both the Business and the Messaging Services Business and listed in
Schedule 1.3 are hereinafter referred to as the "Shared Assets". The Shared
Assets shall be subject to (i) a Services Agreement in the form of Exhibit B-1
and (ii) a Trademark License Agreement in the form of Exhibit C-1, both of
which shall be executed at the Closing. In addition, at the Closing (or, if
applicable, the Second Closing), the parties shall execute (1) a Consulting
Services Agreement in the form of Exhibit B-2, (2) a Pension and Retiree
Benefits Administration Services Agreement in the form of Exhibit B-3, (3) a
Sales and Marketing Agreement in the form of Exhibit D, (4) a Service Mark
License Agreement in the form of Exhibit C-2, and (5) if Purchaser elects to
acquire Seller's Marks (as defined below) in a Second Closing pursuant to
Section 2.7, a Trademark License Agreement in the form of Exhibit C-3. The
foregoing agreements, with such changes therein as Purchaser and Seller may
agree to as of the Closing Date (and, if applicable, the Second Closing), are
hereinafter referred to as the "Related Agreements". Seller agrees to comply
with all of its obligations under the Related Agreements.

1.4. PERMITTED DIVIDEND. On or prior to the Closing Date,
Seller may cause FSI to declare and pay to Seller a dividend, or otherwise to
distribute to Seller, an amount in cash equal to $117,895,434 (the "Permitted
Dividend"). Seller hereby agrees that Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct
from the portion of the Purchase Price to be paid to Seller at the Closing (or,
if not determined until after the Closing, shall receive a refund from Seller
of a portion of the Purchase Price equal to) the amount, if any, by which the
aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions or payments paid or made
by FSI or any of its subsidiaries to Seller or any of its affiliates after June
30, 1994 in respect of its capital stock or otherwise (other than pursuant to
Section 1.2 and the last sentence of Section 1.5) exceeds the amount of the
Permitted Dividend.

1.5. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS. The balance of all intercompany
accounts between Seller and its affiliates other than FSI and the FSI
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and FSI and the FSI Subsidiaries, on the other
hand (the "Intercompany Accounts"), as of June 30, 1994 on a pro forma basis
and on an actual basis will not be settled but will be contributed to capital
of FSI at or prior to the Closing. Except as set forth in Schedule 1.5, from
and after July 1, 1994, FSI and the FSI Subsidiaries have not made and, after
the date of this Agreement, shall not make any payments or transfers, or incur
any liabilities to Seller or any of its

4
<PAGE> 10
subsidiaries (other than FSI or the FSI Subsidiaries) except as permitted by
Sections 1.2, 1.4 or 11.9 or as reimbursement for expenses incurred in the
ordinary course of business and recorded in the Intercompany Accounts;
provided, however, that expenses incurred by FSI in the amount of not less than
$200,000 per month for each month after June 1994 shall be allocated to Seller
as "Corporate Overhead", consistent with Seller's practice for the six months
ended June 30, 1994 and royalties or other charges in respect of the use by FSI
and the FSI Subsidiaries of any Related Assets, interest on Intercompany
Accounts, revenue sharing payments and processing fees shall each be consistent
with such charges made during the six months ended June 30, 1994. The balance
of the Intercompany Accounts as so determined shall be paid in full on the
Closing Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and Seller shall pay to FSI
at or prior to the Closing the amount of any transfers set forth in Schedule
1.5.

ARTICLE II. PURCHASE PRICE AND ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES.

2.1. PURCHASE PRICE AND ADJUSTMENTS. (a) At the Closing, in
consideration for the sale to Purchaser of the Shares and the Related Assets,
and subject to Section 2.7, (i) Purchaser shall pay to Seller $1,193,223,000
(the "Purchase Price"), of which $893,223,000 less the sum of (x) the amount of
the $10 million good faith deposit previously deposited with Seller, (y) any
interest actually earned thereon, and (z) the amount of $45 million (the
"Escrowed Funds") which shall be paid by Purchaser to the Escrow Agent (as
named in the Escrow Agreement, as defined below) shall be paid in cash and
$300,000,000 shall be paid by the assumption by Purchaser of the Western Union
Pension Plan; and (ii) FSI and/or Purchaser, as applicable, shall assume the
Assumed Liabilities (including the Western Union Pension Plan) as described in
Section 2.2. The cash portion of the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to such account
or accounts of Seller as may be designated by Seller. The Escrowed Funds shall
be held and paid pursuant to the provisions of an escrow agreement,
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit K hereto (the "Escrow
Agreement").

(b) The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment
as follows:

(1) Seller has prepared (or caused to be prepared) the
Pro Forma Balance Sheet which is a consolidated balance sheet of FSI
and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994, which: (A) is adjusted to
give effect to an assumed contribution by Seller of the Related Assets
to FSI, to an assumed assumption by FSI of the Assumed Liabilities
(other than the Pension Plan liability described in Section 2.2(a)),
to the payment of an assumed dividend in the amount of $87,895,434 as
of June 30, 1994 (rather than a payment of the Permitted Dividend) and
to

5
<PAGE> 11
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
contribution to capital of FSI of all Intercompany Accounts as of June
30, 1994, the transfer of the Excluded Assets by FSI to Seller, and
the assumption by Seller of the Excluded Liabilities; (B) reflects
consolidated Total Assets (as defined below) and consolidated Total
Liabilities (as defined below); (C) has been prepared using accounting
practices consistent with those followed on an annual basis at each
December 31, without regard to those followed on an interim basis; (D)
otherwise has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with the balance
sheets of FSI and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and June
30, 1994 included in Exhibit E; and (E) fairly presents the
consolidated financial position of FSI and its subsidiaries at June
30, 1994, after making the foregoing adjustments and all other
adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of the
consolidated financial position of FSI and its subsidiaries at that
date. The Pro Forma Balance Sheet does not reflect any liability
which may result under the Shareholders Agreement between FSI and
Elektra, S.A. de C.V. if such Shareholders Agreement is not affirmed
by FSI after the execution of this Agreement (which liability
Purchaser acknowledges is not an obligation of Seller). For the
purposes hereof, Total Liabilities" and "Total Assets" are defined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; provided,
however, that Total Liabilities do not include any liability in
respect of the Western Union Pension Plan or the Excluded Liabilities
(as defined below); and provided, furthe, that Total Assets do not
include the Excluded Assets and do not include any assets reflected in
the Pro Forma Balance Sheet at values in excess of their historical
cost less amortization; andprovided, further, that: (x) the amount of
any reserve, liability or similar item on the Pro Forma Balance Sheet
determined by any estimation methodology (the Methodology") has been
determined by use of the same Methodology used in determining the
amount included in the balance sheet of FSI and its subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1993 included in Exhibit E; (y) Total Assets do not
include any capitalized transaction costs incurred in connection with
the Acquisition, all of which, if any, incurred by FSI prior to June
30, 1994 have been expensed by FSI prior to June 30, 1994; and (z) the
Pro Forma Balance Sheet reflects full and adequate reserves against
(1) all unpaid Federal, state, local or foreign taxes (including any
interest, penalties or additions to tax that may become payable in
respect thereof) assessed against or payable by FSI with respect to
any period ending on or before June 30, 1994 and (2) unpaid or vested
sales or other incentive compensation for Covered Employees which is
earned through June 30, 1994.

6
<PAGE> 12
(2) Seller shall cause its independent certified
public accountants, Price Waterhouse ("Seller's Accountants"), to
audit the Pro Forma Balance Sheet and Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser within sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement
Seller's Accountants' draft audit report with respect thereto
(together with the Pro Forma Balance Sheet), which report shall state
that the Pro Forma Balance Sheet has been audited in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards and that the Pro Forma Balance
Sheet has been prepared in accordance with the basis of accounting
described in the notes thereto and the provisions of Section
2.1(b)(1). Purchaser's representatives, including its independent
accountants, (which shall be a "Big Six" accounting firm or other
accounting firm acceptable to Seller) ("Purchaser's Accountants"),
shall be entitled to review all workpapers of Seller's Accountants and
supporting evidence relating to such audit subject to appropriate
indemnification arrangements for the benefit of Seller's Accountants.

(3) Within forty-five (45) days after its receipt of
the Pro Forma Balance Sheet and the draft audit report of Seller's
Accountants or, if later, thirty (30) days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall notify Seller whether it accepts or disputes the
accuracy of the Pro Forma Balance Sheet. If Purchaser accepts the Pro
Forma Balance Sheet, Seller's Accountants shall be requested to issue
their final audit report thereon and the Pro Forma Balance Sheet shall
be deemed to be the audited pro forma balance sheet of FSI as of June
30, 1994 (the "Audited Pro Forma Balance Sheet"). If Purchaser
disputes the accuracy of the Pro Forma Balance Sheet, it shall in such
notice set forth in reasonable detail those items that Purchaser
believes are not fairly presented and the reasons for its opinion.
The parties shall then meet and in good faith use their best efforts
to try to resolve their disagreements over the disputed items on the
Pro Forma Balance Sheet. If the parties resolve their disagreements
in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the Pro Forma Balance Sheet
with those modifications to which the parties shall have agreed shall
be deemed to be the Audited Pro Forma Balance Sheet. If the parties
have not resolved their disagreements over the disputed items on the
Pro Forma Balance Sheet within thirty (30) days after Purchaser's
notice of dispute, the parties shall forthwith jointly select an
independent "Big Six" firm (or other firm acceptable to both parties)
of certified public accountants and such firm shall make a binding
determination of those disputed items in accordance with this
Agreement within ninety (90) days of its selection, and the Pro Forma
Balance Sheet with those modifications determined by such third
accounting firm shall be deemed to be the Audited Pro Forma Balance
Sheet. The determination of such third accounting firm shall not be
subject to judicial review. The fees and expenses of Purchaser's
Accountants

7
<PAGE> 13
shall be paid by Purchaser, the fees and expenses of Seller's
Accountants (including audit fees) shall be paid by Seller and the
fees and expenses of any third accounting firm shall be shared equally
by both parties.

(4) If FSI's consolidated Total Assets reflected in
the Audited Pro Forma Balance Sheet do not exceed FSI's consolidated
Total Liabilities reflected therein by at least $15.0 million, the
amount by which the sum of FSI's consolidated Total Liabilities plus
$15.0 million exceeds FSI's consolidated Total Assets shall be
deducted from the Purchase Price and paid by Seller to Purchaser
within two (2) business days after the Audited Pro Forma Balance Sheet
has been determined by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such account or accounts as may be designated by Purchaser.

(5) If FSI's consolidated Total Assets reflected in the
Audited Pro Forma Balance Sheet exceed FSI's consolidated Total
Liabilities reflected therein by more than $15.0 million, the amount
of such excess shall be added to the Purchase Price and paid by
Purchaser to Seller within two (2) business days after the Audited
Closing Date Balance Sheet has been determined by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be
designated by Seller.

(6) All amounts payable by Seller to Purchaser or by
Purchaser to Seller pursuant to this Section 2.1(b) shall bear
interest for the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment
of such amounts at the rate announced from time to time by Citibank,
N.A. as its base rate.

2.2. ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES. At and effective as of the
Closing, FSI and/or Purchaser, as applicable, shall assume or continue to be
responsible for, as the case may be, the following obligations and liabilities
(the "Assumed Liabilities") of Seller pursuant to the Instrument of Assumption
attached as Exhibit G:

(a) PENSION PLAN. Purchaser or a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Purchaser will adopt and become the plan sponsor of the Western
Union Pension Plan (as defined in the Amended Plan) and the trust thereunder,
including any plans and trusts resulting from the division of the Western Union
Pension Plan pursuant to Section 6.6(g), except that Seller shall remain liable
for and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and FSI and its subsidiaries
harmless against any excise tax under Chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Code,
as amended (the "Code") asserted with respect to contributions made by Seller,
FSI or Purchaser or omitted to be made to any plan of Seller or its affiliates
and any prohibited transactions during or for any plan year prior to January 1,
1995, except any excise tax imposed for failure to make the minimum

8
<PAGE> 14
contribution with respect to the 1994 plan year. Purchaser and FSI shall be
liable for and shall indemnify and hold Seller and its subsidiaries harmless
against any such excise tax asserted with respect to contributions made to the
Western Union Pension Plan and any prohibited transactions during or for any
plan year commencing on or after January 1, 1995, and for any excise tax
imposed for failure to make the minimum contribution with respect to the 1994
plan year.

(b) CERTAIN LIABILITIES. Purchaser or FSI or another
affiliate of Purchaser will assume the liabilities listed in Schedule 2.2
associated with the Related Assets.

(c) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. FSI shall
assume all of Seller's obligations in respect of active employees of the
Business under Seller's collective bargaining agreements (the "Collective
Bargaining Agreements") with the Communications Workers of America (the "CWA").

2.3. LIABILITIES NOT ASSUMED BY PURCHASER OR FSI. Except as
expressly assumed hereunder, neither Purchaser, FSI, nor any subsidiary of
either of them, shall assume or have any responsibility for or otherwise become
liable for any liabilities (whether fixed, contingent, matured or unmatured,
known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated) of Seller (the "Excluded
Liabilities"), including without limitation, (a) the Reno, Nevada Customer
Service Center lease, (b) any liability of Seller to any of its creditors or
shareholders, (c) any liability to the extent associated with the conduct of
the Messaging Services Business (including without limitation, any liability to
its employees under the Collective Bargaining Agreements or otherwise), (d) any
liability associated with the Datek litigation referred to in Note G to
Seller's financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 1994 (the "Datek
Litigation"), (e) any federal, state, local or foreign tax liabilities
(including interest and penalties) attributable to the income of FSI and its
subsidiaries included in Seller's consolidated federal and consolidated,
combined or unitary state tax returns for all periods through the Closing Date,
(f) any liability related to the Excluded Assets, (g) any liability resulting
from the failure by Seller or FSI prior to, or with respect to periods ending
on or prior to, the Closing Date properly to fund, maintain or make payments
pursuant to any benefit plans or arrangements (including governmental pension
plans) for employees who are not United States citizens, or (h) any liability
in respect of post-retirement benefits to any former employees of Seller or FSI
who retired prior to the Closing Date, other than (1) post-retirement benefits
provided under the Western Union Pension Plan expressly assumed pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) or (2) post retirement benefits for individuals who retire after
the Closing Date pursuant to any plans maintained by or applicable to Purchaser
or FSI on and after the Closing Date. Seller shall indemnify and hold
Purchaser, FSI and the FSI Subsidiaries harmless from and against any loss,

9
<PAGE> 15
liability, damage or deficiency (including, without limitation, costs,
interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from the Excluded
Liabilities.

2.4. CERTAIN OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. After the Closing Date,
Purchaser agrees that it will not, and will cause FSI not to, take any action
which would have the effect of increasing the amount of liability of Seller for
any post-retirement benefits payable to any former employees of Seller or FSI
under the Collective Bargaining Agreements.

2.5. PENSION ASSETS. (a) Seller shall indemnify and hold
Purchaser, FSI and the FSI Subsidiaries harmless from and against any decline
in the fair market value of the assets in the Western Union Pension Plan (the
"Plan Assets") from December 31, 1993 to the Closing Date (other than as a
result of the payment of plan benefits and expenses from and after December 31,
1993 and prior to the Closing Date and without giving effect to any minimum
funding contribution made by Seller during such period) as follows: Within
forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser
with a statement of the fair market value of the Plan Assets as of the Closing
Date. Purchaser shall have ten (10) days to review such statement and to give
Seller notice of any objection it may have to the value of any asset included
therein. In the event that such an objection is made and Seller and Purchaser
cannot resolve the dispute within ten (10) days thereafter, the dispute shall
be referred to a nationally recognized organization expert in pricing
securities (an "Evaluation Firm") satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser whose
opinion as to the fair market value of the disputed item(s) shall be delivered
within thirty days and shall be binding on Seller and Purchaser and whose fees
and expenses shall be borne equally by the parties. The opinion of the
Evaluation Firm shall not be subject to judicial review. In the event that the
fair market value of the Plan Assets as of the Closing Date is less than the
fair market value of the Plan Assets as of December 31, 1993 (other than as a
result of the payment of plan benefits and expenses from and after December 31,
1993 and prior to the Closing Date and without giving effect to any minimum
funding contribution made by Seller during such period), then Seller shall pay
the difference to Purchaser within three (3) days after the fair market value
of the Plan Assets as of the Closing Date is determined.

(b) For purposes of Section 2.5(a) the parties agree
that the fair market value of the Plan Assets at December 31, 1993 shall be
$288,349,000. Seller and Purchaser agree to compute and to instruct any
Evaluation Firm selected pursuant to Section 2.5(a) to compute the value of the
Plan Assets as of the Closing Date on a basis consistent with the December 31,
1993 valuation set forth above.

10
<PAGE> 16
2.6. CLOSING. The Closing shall take place at the offices of
Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon, 180 Maiden Lane, New York, New York
10038 at 11:00 a.m. New York City Time on the last business day of the calendar
month in which the conditions set forth in Article IX have been satisfied, or
at such other time or place as the parties may agree and as may be approved by
the Bankruptcy Court.

2.7. DEFERRED CLOSING ELECTION. (a) Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Purchaser may elect, on 15 days' notice to Seller prior
to the Closing, to close the purchase of all interests owned by Seller and its
subsidiaries and affiliates in those Marks and associated goodwill constituting
the Western Union Name and Trademark not held by FSI or the FSI Subsidiaries
("Seller's Marks") separately from and subsequent to the Closing of the
purchase of the Shares and the other Related Assets, provided that the date
elected by Purchaser for such subsequent closing (the "Second Closing") shall
be on or before January 15, 1995. If Purchaser so elects, (i) the Purchase
Price payable at the Closing shall be reduced by $250,000,000, (ii) at the
Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall execute and deliver a Trademark License
Agreement in the form of Exhibit C-3; and (iii) at the Second Closing:
Purchaser shall pay to Seller $250,000,000 plus a license or royalty fee on
such amount computed at the rate per annum announced from time to time by
Citibank, N.A. as its base rate from the date of the Closing to the Second
Closing; Seller shall execute and deliver to Purchaser a Bill of Sale in the
form of Exhibit F-3 and such other instruments of transfer, conveyance and
assignment as are reasonably necessary to vest in Purchaser, free and clear of
all Liens except Permitted Liens, all right, title and interest of Seller and
its subsidiaries and affiliates as of the date of this Agreement and through
the Second Closing in and to Seller's Marks; and Seller shall cause to be
delivered to Purchaser written opinions of Seller's General Counsel and Mudge
Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon, counsel to Seller, addressed to Purchaser,
substantially in the forms attached hereto as Exhibits H and I, respectively,
as specified therein with respect to the Second Closing. It is understood and
agreed among the parties that if the Closing occurs each party shall be
absolutely and unconditionally obligated to complete the Second Closing and
this obligation shall be a separate independent covenant and agreement and
shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including (1) any
set-off, claim, counterclaim, defense or other right which Purchaser may have
against Seller or Seller may have against Purchaser, any failure on the part of
any party to comply with this Agreement or any Related Agreement or any
validity or unenforceability thereof, (2) any defect in title, condition,
operation, merchantability or fitness for use of the Shares or any Related
Assets, (3) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceedings
by or against any party or any other person, or (4) any other circumstance or
event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

11
<PAGE> 17
(b) Each party acknowledges that the rights of the other
party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.7 are
special, unique and of extraordinary character, and in the event that a party
violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by it in
this Section 2.7 then the other party may be without adequate remedy at law.
Each party agrees, therefore, that nothing in this Agreement, including the
provisions of Section 11.11, shall be deemed to limit the right of a party, in
the event that the other party violates, fails or refuses to perform any
covenant or agreement by it in this Section 2.7, to institute or prosecute an
action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce specific performance
of such covenant or agreement or seek any other equitable relief. The seeking
of specific performance or injunctive relief from a court shall not constitute
a waiver of the right of any party, including the claimant in any such action,
to arbitrate any other controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement.

ARTICLE III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER.

Seller hereby represents, covenants and warrants to Purchaser as
follows:

3.1. CORPORATE ORGANIZATION; ETC. Each of Seller and FSI is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has full corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and to own the
properties and assets it now owns; is duly qualified or licensed to do business
as a foreign corporation in good standing in every jurisdiction in which
ownership of property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except jurisdictions in which its failure to qualify to do
business would not have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects,
operations, properties, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of FSI and
the FSI Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) or the Business taken as a whole
(a "Material Adverse Effect"). The copies of the Certificate of Incorporation
and By-Laws of each of Seller and FSI heretofore made available to Purchaser
are complete and correct copies of such instruments as are presently in effect.

3.2. CAPITALIZATION OF FSI. The authorized capital stock of FSI
consists of 20,000 shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, of which
1,000 shares are issued and outstanding and no shares are held in the treasury
of FSI. The Shares constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of FSI and are owned beneficially and of record solely by Seller.
All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of FSI are validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. There are no outstanding (a) securities
convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock of FSI; (b) options,
warrants or other rights to purchase or subscribe

12
<PAGE> 18
to capital stock of FSI or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
capital stock of FSI; or (c) contracts, commitments, agreements, understandings
or arrangements of any kind relating to the issuance or voting of any capital
stock of FSI, any such convertible or exchangeable securities or any such
options, warrants or rights.

3.3. SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES. Schedule 3.3 sets forth the
name and jurisdiction of incorporation of each subsidiary of FSI (the "FSI
Subsidiaries"). Seller does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock
or other equity interest in any corporation or other entity which has any
interest in the Business or any Related Assets not listed in Schedule 3.3.
Except as and to the extent set forth in Schedule 3.3, all the outstanding
capital stock of each FSI Subsidiary (i) is owned directly or indirectly by FSI
and at the Closing Date will be held free and clear of all Liens, and (ii) is
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no outstanding
options, rights or agreements of any kind relating to the issuance, sale or
transfer of any capital stock or other equity securities of any FSI Subsidiary.
Each FSI Subsidiary (1) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; (2) has
full corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and to own the properties and assets it now owns; and (3) except as
provided in Schedule 3.3, is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign corporation in good standing in every jurisdiction in which ownership
of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
jurisdictions in which the failure to qualify to do business would have no
Material Adverse Effect. Seller has heretofore made available to Purchaser
complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
each FSI Subsidiary, as presently in effect.

3.4. AUTHORIZATION, ETC. Seller has full corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the Related Agreements and to carry
out the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement and the Related
Agreements have been duly approved by an order of the Bankruptcy Court
determining that the Purchase Price and the other consideration to be paid by
Purchaser is the highest and best offer for the Business and authorizing Seller
to perform the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Agreements in accordance with the terms of such order and subject to
confirmation of the Amended Plan. The Board of Directors of Seller has taken
all action required by law and the Bankruptcy Court to be taken by them to
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and

lease entitling any party to terminate such lease, and the continuation,

will in no way be affected, altered or impaired by the consummation of the
Acquisition. True and complete copies of all such leases, including all

real property.

3.9. TAXES. As used in this Agreement, "taxes" or "tax

interest, additions to tax and penalties.

and its subsidiaries has filed all required tax returns, and has paid all taxes
shown thereon as owing. Such returns are correct and complete in all material
respects.

and its subsidiaries has withheld and paid all taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party.

Seller nor any director, officer, or employee responsible for tax matters of
Seller or FSI is aware of any proposed tax assessment by any tax authority for
additional taxes for any period for which tax returns have been filed; and (ii)

or any consolidated or combined or unitary group filing a state tax return,
other than a group the common parent of which is Seller.

(e) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.9, Seller has on
behalf of its affiliated group including FSI filed all required tax returns
required for any period during which FSI or any of its subsidiaries has been a

3.10. INSURANCE. Schedule 3.10 contains a description of all
material policies of fire, liability, workmen's compensation and other forms of

Business. All such policies are in full force and effect, all premiums with
respect thereto covering all periods up to and including the date of this
Agreement have been paid, and as of the Closing will have been paid, and no
notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any
such policy. True and complete copies of all policies listed in Schedule 3.10
have been made available to Purchaser. All such policies are of a scope and,
in the opinion of management, in an amount to insure all material assets of FSI
relating to the Business as is usual and customary for businesses engaged in
the Business and are sufficient for compliance in all material respects with
all requirements of law and all agreements relating to the Business to which
FSI or any of its subsidiaries is a party. All material notices relating to
the Business required to have been given by Seller, FSI or any of their
subsidiaries to any insurance company have been timely and duly given, and no
insurance company has asserted (or reserved its right to assert) that any
unsatisfied judgment or any pending or asserted action, suit or other claim
relating to the Business is not covered by the applicable policy relating
thereto.

3.11. BENEFIT PLANS. (a) Schedule 3.11 contains a true and
complete list of Seller's and FSI's "employee benefit plans" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA") and all stock option, deferred compensation, incentive and
similar plans (the "Benefit Plans"). Each Benefit Plan is in writing, and
Seller has previously made available to Purchaser a true and correct copy of
each Benefit Plan together with a true and complete copy of the relevant trust
instruments, the most recently filed Internal Revenue Service Form 5500, the
most recently received IRS determination letter, and the most recently prepared
actuarial

20
<PAGE> 26
report and financial statement. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.11, no
Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated and no proceeding
has been initiated to terminate any Benefit Plan with respect to which
Purchaser would be expected to incur any liability, direct or indirect,
contingent or otherwise, under Title IV of ERISA. Neither the Shares nor the
Related Assets are the subject of any lien arising under Section 302(f) of
ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code and neither Seller nor FSI is the subject
of any lien arising under Section 302(f) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code
or has been required to post any security under Section 307 of ERISA or Section
401(a)(29) of the Code with respect to any Benefit Plan. Except as disclosed
in Schedule 3.11, to the best knowledge of Seller, no action or claims (other
than routine claims for benefits made in the ordinary course of administration
of the Benefit Plans) are pending, threatened or imminent against or with
respect to any Benefit Plan, or any sponsor or fiduciary (as defined in Section
3(21) of ERISA) of any Benefit Plan. Neither Seller nor FSI has engaged in a
transaction described in Section 4069 of ERISA. Neither Seller, FSI nor any
Benefit Plan has engaged in any prohibited transactions (as defined in Section
406 or 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) for which a statutory
exemption is not available. Except as otherwise provided in Articles II and
VI, Purchaser and Seller agree that Purchaser expressly does not assume any
liability, including contingent liabilities, under any Benefit Plan. No
Benefit Plan under which Seller or FSI has any liability or other obligation is
or was a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the
Code, or a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. All
continuation health care coverage and notice requirements under Section 4980B
of the Code and Sections 601 and 608 of ERISA have been satisfied with respect
to all Covered Employees or prior employees of Seller and FSI and any
"qualified beneficiary" (within the meaning of Section 4980B(g) of the Code) of
such employees.

(b) Each Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined to be so qualified by the
Internal Revenue Service and nothing has occurred since the date of the last
such determination which has resulted or is likely to result in the revocation
of such determination. Each Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its respective terms and applicable
law.

appropriate documents as provided by the laws of the State of New Jersey
relating to conveyances of interests in real estate, no consent, approval or

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or to enable
Purchaser, FSI and the FSI Subsidiaries to conduct the Business after the
Closing as and where it is currently being conducted.

neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Seller, FSI or any FSI Subsidiary,
or violate, or be in conflict with, or constitute a default (or event which
with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a default)
under, or cause the acceleration of the maturity of any debt or obligation
pursuant to, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation or imposition of any
security interest, Lien, encumbrance, claim or adverse interest of any kind or
nature whatsoever on any of the Related Assets or the assets or property of FSI
or any subsidiary pursuant to, any agreement or commitment to which Seller, FSI
or any FSI Subsidiary is a party or by which Seller, FSI or any FSI Subsidiary
is bound or any of their properties is subject, or violate any statute or law
or any judgment, decree, order, regulation or rule of any court or governmental
authority, except for such violations, defaults or other events as would not
individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.

3.14. GOOD TITLE CONVEYED, ETC. Upon approval by the Bankruptcy
Court of an order confirming the Amended Plan (the "Confirmation Order") and an
order approving this Agreement and authorizing the sale of the Shares and the
Related Assets under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code substantially in the
form of Exhibit L (the "Sale Order") and expiration of the period for stay of
the Sale Order without a stay of the Sale Order having been granted and not
lifted, Seller will have complete and unrestricted power and the unqualified
right to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Purchaser, and, at the Closing
Date (and, if applicable, as to Seller's Marks, the Second Closing), Seller and
its affiliates will transfer good, valid and marketable title, free and clear
of all Liens, to the Shares and, except for Permitted Liens, the Related
Assets. The Bill of Sale in the form attached as Exhibit F-1 and the deeds,
endorsements, assignments and other instruments to be executed and delivered to
Purchaser by Seller at the Closing (and, if applicable, the Second Closing)
will be legal, valid and binding obligations of Seller enforceable in
accordance with their terms, subject as to enforcement to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to
or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles and will
effectively vest in Purchaser good, valid and marketable title to all the
Related Assets, subject to Permitted Liens.

(b) Seller agrees to permit Purchaser and its
authorized representatives to have or cause them to be permitted to have, after
the date hereof and until the Closing, full access to the premises, books and
records of Seller and its subsidiaries at reasonable hours, and the officers of
Seller and its subsidiaries will furnish Purchaser with such financial and
operating data and other information with respect to the Business and the
Related Assets as Purchaser shall from time to time reasonably request. Seller
will request its auditing firm to permit Purchaser and its representatives,
including its auditing firm, to review the work papers of the auditing firm of
Seller relating to their examination of the consolidated audited financial
statements of Seller and its subsidiaries, subject to appropriate
indemnification arrangements for the benefit of the auditing firm of Seller.
No investigation by Purchaser heretofore or hereafter made shall affect the
representations and warranties of Seller and each such representation and
warranty shall survive any such investigation, subject to Article VIII.

31
<PAGE> 37
5.4. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each party hereto will hold all
confidential information in accordance with the terms of the letter agreement
dated June 30, 1994 between Seller and Purchaser which agreement shall remain
in full force and effect.

5.5. INSTRUMENTS OF CONVEYANCE. To effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and subject to Section 2.7, Seller shall
execute and deliver to Purchaser at or prior to the Closing (and, if
applicable, the Second Closing), the Bill of Sale attached as Exhibit F-1 (and,
if applicable, the Bill of Sale attached as Exhibit F-3) and all deeds,
documents or instruments of sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance, and
following the Closing shall execute such other documents and do such other
things, as Purchaser shall reasonably deem necessary or appropriate to vest in
Purchaser good, valid and marketable title to the Shares and, subject to
Permitted Liens, the Related Assets, including all interests owned by Seller
and its subsidiaries and affiliates in the Western Union Name and Trademark.
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent or waiver of
any person whose consent or waiver may be necessary to effectuate the sale of
the Related Assets. Purchaser agrees to cooperate with Seller and supply
relevant information to governmental agencies and third parties in order to
assist Seller in obtaining any such consents or waivers or causing such
assignment or transfer to become effective, provided that the costs, if any, of
assuming and assigning such contracts, including the costs of curing any breach
in respect of such contracts, shall be borne by Seller. If and so long as any
such consent or waiver shall not have been obtained, Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts, to the extent permissible under law and the terms of
the pertinent asset, to keep such asset in full force and effect and to provide
to Purchaser the benefit of the asset to the same extent as if such asset had
been transferred to Purchaser. If Seller provides Purchaser with such
benefits, then Purchaser shall perform Seller's obligations and shall pay all
amounts Seller is obligated to pay under the terms of such asset (excluding any
amounts payable with respect to, or resulting from, the use of such asset prior
to the Closing Date). In addition, at Purchaser's request, Seller shall provide
Purchaser with (a) such releases as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in
order to carry out the terms of this Agreement and (b) appropriate
documentation to demonstrate Seller's right, title and interest in the Shares
and the Related Assets and Purchaser's right, title and interest in and to any
of the assets and properties reflected on the Audited Pro Forma Balance Sheet.

5.6. NONCOMPETITION. (a) For a period of five (5) years after
the Closing (the "Restricted Period"), Seller and its affiliates shall not
engage, directly or indirectly, in the Business anywhere in the world or,
directly or indirectly, own an interest in, manage, operate, join, control,
lend money or render financial or other assistance to or participate in or be
connected with, as a partner, stockholder, consultant or otherwise, any

32
<PAGE> 38
natural person or entity that competes with FSI, any FSI Subsidiary or the
Business; provided, however, that, for the purposes of this Section 5.6,
ownership of securities having no more than five percent of the outstanding
voting power of any competitor which are listed on any national securities
exchange or traded actively in the national over-the-counter market shall not
be deemed to be in violation of this Section 5.6 so long as Seller has no other
material relationship with such competitor.

(b) As separate and independent covenants, Seller
agrees with Purchaser that: (i) for a period of five (5) years following the
Closing, Seller and its affiliates will not in any way, directly or indirectly,
for the purpose of conducting or engaging in the Business, call upon, solicit,
advise or otherwise do, or attempt to do, business with any customers of the
Business with whom Seller or any subsidiary thereof had any dealings prior to
the Closing Date, or take away or interfere or attempt to interfere with any
custom, trade, business or patronage of the Business, FSI or any FSI
Subsidiary; and (ii) for a period of three (3) years following the Closing,
Seller will not in any way, directly or indirectly, interfere with or attempt
to interfere with any officers, employees, representatives or agents of the
Business, FSI or any FSI Subsidiary or induce or attempt to induce any of them
to leave the employ of FSI or any FSI Subsidiary or violate the terms of their
contracts, or any employment arrangements, with FSI or any FSI Subsidiary.

(c) The Restricted Period shall be extended by the
length of any period during which Seller is in breach of the terms of this
Section 5.6.

(d) Seller acknowledges that the covenants of Seller
set forth in this Section 5.6 are an essential element of this Agreement and
that, but for the agreement of Seller to comply with these covenants, Purchaser
would not have entered into this Agreement. Seller acknowledges that this
Section 5.6 constitutes an independent covenant and shall not be affected by
performance or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement by
Purchaser.

5.7. COMPLIANCE WITH WARN ACT. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall cause FSI to take all actions necessary to comply with its obligations
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Section
2101 et seq.) and any regulations adopted thereunder with respect to any plant
closing or mass layoff before the Closing Date or the contemplated closing of
FSI's customer service center in Reno, Nevada, including discharging all
obligations to the employees of Seller, FSI or any of their subsidiaries under
such Act, resulting from the termination of employment of employees of Seller,
FSI or any of their subsidiaries in connection with the closing of FSI's
customer service center in Reno, Nevada subsequent to the Closing, and Seller
shall be

33
<PAGE> 39
responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless against any
liability or damages whatsoever relating to, any failure to take any such
action.

ARTICLE VI. EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

6.1. COVERED EMPLOYEES; PRIOR SERVICE. (a) Purchaser or an
affiliate shall offer employment to, or shall cause FSI to continue to employ,
commencing on the Closing Date, all those individuals who are employees of FSI
or an FSI Subsidiary on the Closing Date, except those identified by Purchaser
as "Excluded Employees" in Schedule 6.1, which shall be delivered by Purchaser
to Seller at the Closing. Those employees not actively at work with FSI due to
illness or injury in benefit payment status on the Closing Date shall not be
offered employment at the Closing and shall continue to draw payments related
to such disability from Seller or Seller's Benefit Plans. Upon rehabilitation,
such employees shall be offered employment with Purchaser, FSI or an affiliate;
provided, however, that unless all interests of Seller and its subsidiaries in
any reserves or cash collected under any insurance policy for the purpose of
paying any claim made with respect to such disability for treatment or other
disability payments after such employee's return to work are transferred to
Purchaser or FSI, Seller shall remain liable for any payments related to such
disability after such employee's return to work. Within 15 days from the date
hereof, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a preliminary list of all employees
of FSI or an FSI Subsidiary, with a final list to be provided at least two
weeks prior to the Closing. Such employees so hired or continued in employment
by Purchaser, FSI or an affiliate are collectively referred to as "Covered
Employees". Seller agrees to employ all Excluded Employees following the
Closing Date or to pay any amounts of severance pay or amounts under the
Benefit Plans (other than the Western Union Pension Plan) to which they are
entitled.

(b) If Purchaser elects to include Covered Employees
in any employee benefit plan of Purchaser or an affiliate, Purchaser shall
recognize service with Seller, FSI or any FSI Subsidiary for the purposes of
eligibility, vesting and qualification for benefit payments in such employee
benefit plans.

(c) Schedule 6.1 lists all employment, severance or
similar agreements or arrangements to which Seller or any subsidiary is a party
or by which any of them are bound. If any Covered Employee is a party to an
employment, severance or similar agreement or arrangement with FSI or Seller,
Purchaser will, or will cause FSI to, assume such agreement or arrangement and
relieve Seller of any further obligation thereunder.

34
<PAGE> 40
6.2. BENEFITS, COMPENSATION AND WORKING CONDITIONS. As of the
Closing Date, all Covered Employees eligible to participate in Seller's
employee benefit plans shall be immediately eligible to participate in all of
Purchaser's employee benefit plans, which are generally applicable to
comparable Purchaser employees, or, at Purchaser's option, shall be eligible to
participate in plans the benefits of which are comparable to the benefits of
current FSI Benefit Plans.

6.3. VACATION. Purchaser shall allow the exercise of any
accumulated but unused vacation by Covered Employees for the 1994 calendar
year. Covered Employees will be eligible for Purchaser's vacation schedule
beginning January 1, 1995, or at Purchaser's option will continue in the
current FSI vacation plan. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
Seller shall provide Purchaser with a listing of vacation eligibility for all
Covered Employees.

6.4. INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS. (a) Seller shall be liable
for unpaid or vested incentive compensation for Covered Employees or other
employees of FSI and the FSI Subsidiaries which is earned through June 30, 1994
and Purchaser shall be liable for incentive compensation earned thereafter.
Seller agrees to pay all incentive compensation awards earned by Covered
Employees or other employees of FSI and the FSI Subsidiaries according to the
terms and conditions of the various FSI incentive plans up through June 30,
1994. Incentive compensation will include all awards for employees covered
under the Senior Management Incentive Plan, the Management Incentive Plan, Long
Term Incentive Plan I and the various Sales and Marketing Incentive Plans
effective for the 1994 calendar year.

(b) Seller and Purchaser agree that, to the extent any
liability for incentive compensation is reflected on the Audited Pro Forma
Balance Sheet, Seller shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligation
hereunder to make such payment, and Purchaser will, or will cause FSI to,
actually make the payment to the employee in accordance with the terms of the
relevant incentive plan. It is the intention of the parties that incentive
obligations to Covered Employees as of June 30, 1994 will be so reflected on
the Audited Pro Forma Balance Sheet and that incentive obligations to all other
employees of Seller or FSI or any of the FSI Subsidiaries will be removed from
said Audited Pro Forma Balance Sheet and actually paid by Seller.

6.5. SEVERANCE BENEFITS. (a) Purchaser agrees that the
continued employment by Purchaser, FSI, or an affiliate thereof, of the Covered
Employees shall not be considered a severance of employment by Seller, and
Seller agrees that transfer from FSI to Seller and continued employment by
Seller of persons who are not Covered Employees shall not be considered a
severance of employment by Purchaser or FSI, for purposes of any severance,
salary continuation or similar policy, plan, program or arrangement of

35
<PAGE> 41
Seller.

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
provide a severance benefit plan for Covered Employees that is comparable to
the plan for similarly situated Purchaser employees, or at Purchaser's option
Covered Employees may remain in the current FSI severance plan.

6.6. BENEFIT PLANS. (a) As of the Closing Date, in respect of
all Covered Employees who are participants in any Benefit Plan that is an
"individual account plan" within the meaning of Section 3(34) of ERISA (a
"Seller Individual Account Plan"), Seller and Purchaser shall take such actions
as shall be necessary to cause the accounts of Covered Employees in all Seller
Individual Account Plans to be transferred into Purchaser's individual account
plan ("Purchaser's Savings Plus Plan"), maintaining the accounts of
participants in such plans as a separate subpart or subparts of such
Purchaser's Savings Plus Plan. Such separate subpart or subparts of
Purchaser's Savings Plus Plan shall have the same trustee, contribution,
eligibility, vesting and loan provisions and investment choices as applied to
each such participant in the Seller Individual Account Plan from which such
accounts were transferred, each such subpart being referred to as a "mirror
subpart." Purchaser agrees to maintain each mirror subpart that is similar to a
Seller Individual Account Plan referred to in a Collective Bargaining Agreement
during the current term of such agreement. Purchaser agrees to maintain each
other mirror subpart for a reasonable transition period, provided, however,
that maintenance of such subpart shall not endanger, in Purchaser's judgment,
the qualification of Purchaser's Savings Plus Plan. In lieu of transferring
accounts to become a subpart of Purchaser's Savings Plus Plan, Purchaser may
establish a separate individual account plan having the same trustee,
contribution, eligibility, vesting and loan provisions and investment choices
as one of Seller's Individual Account Plans. If Purchaser establishes such a
separate plan, Purchaser agrees to continue such separate plan during the
transition period described in Section 410(b)(6)(C)(ii) of the Code.

(b) As of the Closing Date, in respect of all Covered
Employees who are participants in any Benefit Plan that is a "defined benefit
plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA) and that is maintained by
Purchaser, FSI or an affiliate after the Closing, including the Western Union
Pension Plan, Purchaser shall take such actions as shall be necessary to cause
such Benefit Plan (i) to provide that Covered Employees may not commence
receiving any benefits for which they are eligible under the terms of such
Benefit Plan unless employment with Purchaser, FSI and their affiliates is
terminated, and (ii) to recognize service with Purchaser, FSI and their
affiliates on and after the Closing Date under any such Benefit Plan, to the
extent and under the terms and conditions recognized under such Benefit Plan,
solely

36
<PAGE> 42
for purposes of vesting and eligibility for retirement benefits. Seller agrees
that prior to the Closing Date it shall take such actions as shall be necessary
to cause such Benefit Plan to provide that any transfer of employment from
Seller, FSI or an FSI Subsidiary to Purchaser, FSI or an affiliate of Purchaser
shall not be deemed a termination of employment for purposes of such Benefit
Plan with respect to any individual who after the Closing continues to perform
essentially the same services with Purchaser, FSI or an affiliate of Purchaser
as he or she performed prior to the Closing.

(c) As of the Closing Date, with respect to those
employees of FSI on the Closing Date who are participants in the Western Union
Pension Plan and who continue as employees of Seller or its affiliates on or
after the Closing Date, Purchaser will cause such Pension Plan to be amended to
provide that (i) such employees may not commence receiving any benefits for
which they are eligible under the terms of such Benefit Plan unless employment
with Seller and its affiliates is terminated, and (ii) employment with Seller
and its affiliates on and after the Closing Date shall be recognized under such
Pension Plan for purposes of vesting and eligibility for retirement benefits.

(d) As of the Closing Date, Covered Employees shall
cease to participate in any Benefit Plan that is a "welfare plan" (within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA), and Seller shall be responsible for all
claims of such employees relating to any treatment which was performed prior to
the Closing Date and which are payable under the terms and conditions of any
such Benefit Plan. As of the Closing Date, Seller shall take such actions as
shall be necessary to transfer the accounts of Covered Employees who are
participants in Benefit Plans funded under the Western Union Corporation
Preservation Trust for Employee Welfare Benefits and the Western Union
Corporation Conservation Trust for Employee Related Programs to trusts
maintained by Purchaser, FSI or an affiliate pursuant to comparable welfare
plans of Purchaser, FSI or an affiliate. With respect to Covered Employees,
Purchaser shall cause each applicable "welfare plan" of Purchaser, FSI or their
affiliates to waive any pre-existing conditions exclusions, physical
examination requirements and actively-at-work requirements, except that claims
of any such Covered Employee who is hospitalized on the Closing Date will
remain the responsibility of Seller until the hospitalization is ended, and to
provide that any expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date shall be taken
into account under such plans for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions with respect to calendar year
1994 and for purposes of applying any annual, lifetime or other benefit
limitation. Claims of Covered Employees who are receiving ongoing out patient
services for alcohol/substance abuse or psychiatric reasons shall remain the
responsibility of Seller until the earlier of recovery or rehabilitation or the
exhaustion of benefits for that cause and time period.

37
<PAGE> 43
(e) Seller shall remain responsible for all
liabilities and obligations in connection with claims for post-employment
medical and dental benefits that may be required under Section 4980B of the
Code made by or in respect of any employee of Seller or any of its subsidiaries
whose employment terminated prior to the Closing Date and any "qualified
beneficiary" (within the meaning of Section 4980B of the Code) of any such
employee who is receiving post-employment medical and dental benefits, or is
eligible to elect such benefits as of the Closing Date. Seller shall also be
responsible for medical or other benefits under the Benefit Plans for any
employees of Seller or any of its subsidiaries who retire prior to or as of the
Closing Date. On and after the Closing Date, active Covered Employees shall
accrue no further benefits under any of Seller's Benefit Plans, and Seller
shall cease to have any further liability or obligation for medical or other
benefits with respect to Covered Employees under any Benefit Plan, except as
set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.6(d).

(f) As to any governmental pension plan to which
Seller makes contributions for employees who are not U.S. citizens, Seller
shall prepare a schedule listing all such employees who are Covered Employees,
the name of the governmental pension plan or plans to which contributions are
made for such Covered Employees, the current amount of the contribution made by
Seller and the employee, if any, and the formula or method used to determine
the amount of the contribution made by Seller and the employee to such plans.
Such schedule shall be delivered to Purchaser prior to the Closing Date.
Seller shall make any contributions required to be made by Seller to such plans
through the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to comply, or to cause FSI to
comply, with all applicable legal requirements regarding the maintenance,
modification or termination of such arrangements on and after the Closing Date.
Seller further agrees that it shall take such actions as shall be necessary and
permissible under applicable law to cause any transfer of employment from
Seller, FSI or an FSI Subsidiary to Purchaser, FSI or an affiliate of Purchaser
incident to the Closing to be deemed not a termination of employment for
purposes of any such governmental plan or arrangement with respect to any
individual who after the Closing continues to perform essentially the same
services with Purchaser, FSI or an affiliate of Purchaser as he or she
performed prior to the Closing.

(g) On or before December 1, 1994, Seller, upon
request by Purchaser, will file appropriate notice with the Internal Revenue
Service on Form 5310 as to the division effective December 31, 1994 of the
assets and liabilities of the Western Union Pension Plan into two plans, one
benefitting the retired and vested terminated former employee participants and
one benefitting the active employee participants of such plans and the division
shall be effective on December 31, 1994 if the Closing shall occur on or before
such date. If the Closing Date is postponed beyond December 31, 1994, Seller
will use its reasonable best efforts to

38
<PAGE> 44
take all actions necessary or appropriate to permit the above described
division of the Western Union Pension Plan to be effected as of the Closing
Date.

6.7. PURCHASER'S PLANS. To the extent that Purchaser elects to
have Covered Employees participate in Purchaser's benefit plans, no Covered
Employee shall be entitled to any pension or welfare benefit from Purchaser
except to the extent such benefits accrue after his or her employment with
Purchaser or an affiliate commences. However, for purposes of eligibility for
benefits under Purchaser's pension or retirement plans, Purchaser shall
recognize Covered Employees' service with Seller and its affiliates for those
Covered Employees deemed by Purchaser to be participants in Purchaser's non
union pension plan(s). Purchaser shall recognize and give credit to Covered
Employees in respect of Covered Employees' service with Seller and its
affiliates for purposes of vacation accrual, medical, dental, disability and
life insurance benefits and eligibility under any qualified individual account
plan to the extent such service is recognized under any Benefit Plan, program
or arrangement in effect as of the Closing Date.

6.8. PLANS SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. (a)
Seller shall pay any contributions in respect of any Benefit Plan that covers
any employee of Seller and its affiliates and is required pursuant to the terms
of collective bargaining agreements listed in Schedule 3.24 with respect to
periods ended on or before the Closing Date and those portions of contributions
due and payable with respect to periods ended after the Closing Date as are
allocable to the portions of such periods from the first day thereof to the
Closing Date. On and after the Closing Date, Seller shall cease to have any
liability or obligation for benefits in respect of Covered Employees under any
such Benefit Plan. Any arrearages in such Benefit Plans up to the Closing Date
are the responsibility of Seller.

(b) As of the Closing Date, in respect of all Covered
Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement who are participants in
any Benefit Plan that is a "defined benefit plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(35) of ERISA), and that is maintained by Purchaser, FSI or an
affiliate after the Closing, Purchaser shall take such actions as shall be
necessary to cause such Benefit Plan to recognize service of such Employees
with Purchaser, FSI and their affiliates on and after the Closing Date under
any such Benefit Plan, to the extent and under terms and conditions recognized
under such Benefit Plan, solely for purposes of vesting and eligibility for
retirement benefits and subject to applicable current collective bargaining
agreements.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall require
Seller or any of its subsidiaries to breach any collective bargaining agreement
listed in Schedule 3.24.

39
<PAGE> 45
6.9. OBLIGATIONS OF PURCHASER AND SELLER. Purchaser and Seller
shall cooperate and Purchaser shall make appropriate arrangements for the
payment of benefits in respect of Covered Employees that become due and payable
under the terms and conditions of any Benefit Plans on or after the Closing
Date. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, pertinent information from personnel and other employment records
in respect of Covered Employees that is required in order to carry out
Purchaser's obligations.

6.10. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. Except as provided in Section 6.6(a),
Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that, other than as required by any collective
bargaining agreement listed in Schedule 3.24, nothing in this Article VI shall
be construed as (i) requiring Purchaser or FSI or any of the FSI Subsidiaries
to continue the employment of any Covered Employee or prohibiting the
termination of or change in terms of employment of any Covered Employee, (ii)
vesting in any Covered Employee any right to continued employment, (iii)
requiring Purchaser or FSI or any of the FSI Subsidiaries to continue any
particular employee benefit plan, program, policy or practice for any
particular period of time after the Closing or (iv) prohibiting or in any way
limiting Purchaser or FSI or any of the FSI Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any such plan, program, policy or practice after the Closing.

ARTICLE VII. BANKRUPTCY MATTERS.

7.1. CONFIRMATION AND SALE ORDERS. Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the
Confirmation Order and the Sale Order as soon as practicable following the
hearing on confirmation of the Amended Plan, both in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and to have included in the Confirmation
Order provisions which: (a) permanently enjoin the assertion against Purchaser
or FSI or any of the FSI Subsidiaries of any claims that are subject to
discharge under Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code; and (b) provide that if
the Closing does not occur on or prior to December 31, 1994, the Internal
Revenue Service and all state or local tax authorities shall be required to
assert any claims for unpaid taxes due with respect to any taxable year which
includes any period through the Closing Date, as a claim against Seller, or be
forever barred from assertion of such claim against any other person; provided,
however, that if Seller is unsuccessful in its efforts to obtain inclusion of
these provisions in the Confirmation Order, such failure shall not be deemed a
breach of this Agreement.

Sale Order.

(c) Seller shall provide actual notice of any hearing
on the Confirmation Order or any other matter before the Bankruptcy Court that
may materially affect the consummation of the Acquisition, in each case in form

briefs, hearing transcripts, reports and other pleadings filed in the
Bankruptcy Court or in related court proceedings as Purchaser may reasonably
request.

(d) Seller shall comply in all material respects with
the Bankruptcy Code and all other laws, rules, regulations, decrees and orders
promulgated thereunder.

taxable year in accordance with Section 505 of the Bankruptcy Code.

7.3. CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY UNDERTAKINGS BY PURCHASER. Purchaser
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Seller to

ARTICLE X. SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION; LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.

10.1. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.7, 3.14,
3.18 and 3.22 and all representations and warranties of Seller regarding tax
liabilities shall survive until the applicable statute of limitations has
expired; all other representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser
contained in this Agreement shall survive for a period of 18 months following
the Closing Date.

10.2. INDEMNIFICATION. Purchaser on the one hand and Seller on
the other hand each agree to indemnify and hold harmless the other and
their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents from and
against any loss, liability, damage or deficiency (including, without
limitation, costs, interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees) arising
out of or due to any breach of any covenant or any surviving representation or
warranty made by such party in this Agreement. There shall be no limitation
whatsoever on indemnification for any breaches by Seller of any provisions of
Article I, Article II or Section 3.7 hereof or for any breaches of
representations, warranties or covenants of Seller under this Agreement
regarding tax liabilities, but the total amount due for all breaches of other
representations, warranties and covenants of Seller under this Agreement shall
in no event exceed $45 million. In addition, no claim for indemnification shall
be made by the Purchaser under this Section 10.2 for the failure to list a Lien
in Schedule 1.1 to the extent such Lien would be discharged by the
satisfaction by Purchaser or FSI of (i) an Assumed Liability or (ii) a
liability of FSI if the existence of such liability would not be a breach of
Section 3.19. Promptly after the receipt by any party hereto of notice of any
claim or the commencement of any action or proceeding, such party will, if a 
claim with respect thereto is to be made against any party obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party"), give such Indemnifying
Party written notice of such claim or the commencement of such action or
proceeding, but any failure to timely notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent it was prejudiced thereby. Such Indemnifying Party shall have the right,
at its option to compromise or defend, at its own expense and with its own
counsel, any such claim, action or proceeding involving the asserted liability
of the party seeking such indemnification (the "Indemnified Party"). If any
Indemnifying Party undertakes to compromise, settle or defend any such asserted
liability, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to
do so, and the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate fully with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise of, or defense against,
any such asserted liability. The Indemnified Party may appoint, at its own
expense, associate counsel to participate in the joint defense of any such
matter. No Indemnified Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or 

46
<PAGE> 52
proceeding except with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). All indemnification by the Seller
under this Article X, other than indemnification for any breaches by Seller of
any provisions of Article I, Article II or Section 3.7 hereof or for any
breaches of representations, warranties or covenants of Seller under this
Agreement regarding tax liabilities, shall be made first from the Escrowed
Funds in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

10.3. LIMITATIONS. (a) Purchaser shall not be entitled to make
any claim against Seller under Section 10.2 unless and until the aggregate
amount of losses, liabilities, damages and deficiencies (including costs,
interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees) with respect to all such
claims exceeds $2.5 million, in which event, Purchaser may assert its right to
indemnification to the extent such claims exceed $2.5 million.

(b) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Article, the limitations on amounts contained in Section 10.2 and in paragraph
(a) of this Section 10.3 shall not apply to the breach of any provisions of
Article I, Article II or Section 3.7 hereof or for any breaches of
representations, warranties or covenants of Seller under this Agreement
regarding tax liabilities.

10.4. TREATMENT OF CLAIMS FOR INDEMNITY. An Indemnified Party's
claim for indemnification hereunder shall be treated as an allowed
administrative expense under Section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code entitled to
priority under Section 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.

10.5. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. (a) Whether or not the Acquisition is
consummated, Seller acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser has made a
substantial investment of management time and incurred substantial
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the effort to consummate the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is
not consummated and a "Liquidated Damages Event" (as defined below) shall have
occurred, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the sum of (i)
$25,000,000 plus (ii) the aggregate amount of expense reimbursement payable by
Seller to Purchaser under Section 11.6 ("Liquidated Damages"). As used herein,
a "Liquidated Damages Event" shall be a termination of this Agreement by Seller
or Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(d), provided Purchaser is not in default
hereunder at the time of such termination.

(b) Upon the occurrence of a Liquidated Damages Event,
Purchaser shall provide written notice to Seller of Purchaser's entitlement to
Liquidated Damages and Seller shall be liable for the payment of Liquidated
Damages and shall pay to Purchaser within 10 business days thereafter the
Liquidated Damages by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by Purchaser. Until Seller's obligation to pay
Liquidated Damages

47
<PAGE> 53
is fully and indefeasibly discharged, Purchaser's claim for Liquidated Damages
shall be treated as an allowed administrative claim pursuant to section 503(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code entitled to priority under section 507(a)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

ARTICLE XI. MISCELLANEOUS.

Agreement is not assignable without the prior written consent of each of the
parties hereto; provided, however, that Purchaser may assign its rights under
this Agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary without such prior written consent,
but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations

connection with its due diligence investigation of the Business, the
negotiation and preparation of this Agreement, the carrying out of the

Pension Plan, and which shall be determined in accordance with Section 338(b)

reasonable manner determined by Purchaser in accordance with Legal Requirements
and consented to by Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld by
Seller, and to file all tax returns in a manner consistent with such
allocation. The parties agree to make such allocations as soon as possible
after the Closing and in all events no later than 60 days prior to the last
date (determined with regard to extensions) on which a Section 388(h)(10)
election may be filed with any applicable Federal, State, local or foreign
governmental authority. If Purchaser makes the deferred closing election of
Section 2.7, the parties agree to file all income tax returns treating the sale
of the Western Union Name and Trademark as having occurred at the Second
Closing.

(c) Seller shall bear and pay all transfer, stamp or
other similar taxes (if they are not exempted under section 1146 of the
Bankruptcy Code) imposed in connection with the Acquisition.

(d) Seller will indemnify and hold Purchaser and FSI
harmless against (1) any and all liability for Federal, state, local or foreign
taxes (including any interest, penalties or additions to tax that may become
payable in respect thereof) assessed against or payable by FSI with respect to
any period ending on or before the Closing Date or any period ending on or
before the last day of the taxable year of Seller's consolidated group in which
the Closing occurs, to the extent apportioned under Section 11.9(b); and (2)
any liability for Federal, state, local or foreign taxes (including any
interest, penalties or additions to tax that may become payable in respect
thereof) assessed against FSI pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) with respect to any
period ending on or before the last day of the taxable year of Seller's
consolidated group in which the Closing occurs provided, however, that
Purchaser shall not be indemnified for tax liabilities properly accrued and
reflected on the Audited Pro Forma Balance Sheet; and provided, further, that
to the extent any payment which, but for the provisions of this Section
11.8(d), would be payable to Seller by FSI also constitutes an undisclosed
liability which is taken into account in determining the amount payable to
Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.1(b), Seller shall be absolved of any such
liability to Purchaser under this Section 11.8(d).

(e) Purchaser shall pay to Seller, as a post-closing
Purchase Price adjustment, an amount equal to FSI's separate tax liability for
the period July 1, 1994 through the day preceding the Closing Date, determined
in accordance with the Agreement respecting Consolidating Federal Income Tax
Return Allocation of

51
<PAGE> 57
Taxes and Payment for Tax Benefits Utilized dated March 23, 1976 between Seller
and its subsidiaries (the "Tax Sharing Agreement"), less the total amount of
payments made for such period pursuant to Section 11.9, and Seller shall pay to
Purchaser as a post-closing Purchase Price adjustment any amount by which the
payments by FSI to Seller pursuant to Section 11.9 for the period July 1, 1994
through the Closing Date exceeded the amounts payable with respect thereto
pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement.

11.9. TAX PROCEDURES.

(a) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any tax sharing
agreement, including the Tax Sharing Agreement, between Seller and any of FSI
and its subsidiaries shall be terminated as to FSI and its subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date and shall have no further effect for any taxable year. FSI
and its subsidiaries may make payments pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement
with respect to the period from July 1, 1994 through the Closing Date, but from
and after July 1, 1994 through the Closing Date FSI and its subsidiaries have
not made and shall not make any other payments to Seller under any such
agreements, including any such other payments with respect to any taxable year
within which the Closing Date occurs.

(b) Tax Returns and Payment. Seller shall include the
income of FSI and its subsidiaries in Seller's consolidated federal and
consolidated, combined, or unitary state tax returns for all periods through
the Closing Date and pay any federal, state or local income taxes attributable
to such income. Income and tax liability of FSI and its subsidiaries shall be
apportioned to the period through the Closing Date by closing the books of FSI
and its subsidiaries as of the end of the Closing Date. Seller shall allow FSI
an opportunity to review and comment on any tax returns to be filed for any
period which includes the Closing Date.

(c) Audits. Seller shall allow FSI and its
representatives to participate in any audits and any tax contests of Seller's
consolidated, combined, or unitary tax returns to the extent such returns
related to FSI and its subsidiaries. Seller shall not settle any such audit in
a manner which would adversely affect FSI or its subsidiaries after the Closing
Date without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld. To the extent reasonably required by Seller,
Purchaser will, and will cause FSI and its representatives to, cooperate with
and assist Seller in connection with any such audits or tax contests covering
any period prior to the Closing or any period during which FSI and the FSI
Subsidiaries were members of the consolidated group of which Seller was the
parent.

11.10. WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS; NON-CONTRACTUAL REMEDIES;
PRESERVATION OF REMEDIES. This Agreement may be amended, superseded, canceled,
renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may

52
<PAGE> 58
be waived, only by a written instrument signed by authorized representatives of
each of the parties or, in the case of a waiver, by an authorized
representative of the party waiving compliance. No such written instrument
shall be effective unless it expressly recites that it is intended to amend,
supersede, cancel, renew or extend this Agreement or to waive compliance with
one or more of the terms hereof, as the case may be. No delay on the part of
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any such
right, power or privilege, or any single or partial exercise of any such right,
power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other such right, power or privilege.

11.11. ARBITRATION. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out
of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance
with the then-prevailing Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. Such arbitration shall be held before a panel of
three (3) arbitrators, one selected by Purchaser, one selected by Seller and
the third selected by mutual agreement of the first two arbitrators. Each
arbitrator shall be independent and impartial. Judgment upon any award
rendered by the arbitrators may be entered into by any court of competent
jurisdiction. The determination of which party (or combination of them) bears
the costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in
connection with any such arbitration proceeding shall be made by the
arbitrators.

Loans and/or Eurodollar Loans (each a "type" of Syndicated Loan). The Company
may Convert Syndicated Loans of one type into Syndicated Loans of the other
type (as provided in Section 2.09 hereof) or Continue Syndicated Loans of one
type as Syndicated Loans of the same type (as provided in Section 2.09 hereof).
There may be no more than fifteen different Interest Periods for both
Syndicated Loans and Money Market Loans outstanding at the same time (for which
purpose Interest Periods described in different lettered clauses of the
definition of the term "Interest Period" shall be deemed to be different
Interest Periods even if they are coterminous).

2.02 Borrowings of Syndicated Loans.

(a) The Company shall give the Agent (which shall promptly
notify the Banks) notice of each borrowing hereunder as provided in Section
4.05 hereof. Not later than 1:00 p.m. New York time on the date of each
borrowing of Syndicated Loans, each Bank shall, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, make available the amount of each Syndicated Loan
to be made by it on such date to the Agent, at account number
NYAO-DI-900-9-000002 maintained by the Agent with Chase at the Principal
Office, in immediately available funds, for account of the Company. The amount
so received by the Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, be made available to the Company by depositing the same on the date
received, in immediately available funds, in an account of the Company
maintained with Chase at the Principal Office designated by the Company.

(b) At any time from the date on which a Swingline Loan is
made until such Swingline Loan shall have been paid in full, the Swingline Bank
may, and the Company hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers (which power is
coupled with an interest) the Swingline Bank to, deliver, on behalf of the
Company, to the Agent a notice of borrowing of Syndicated Loans that are Base
Rate Loans in an amount equal to the then unpaid principal amount of such
Swingline Loan. The proceeds of such Syndicated Loans shall be applied solely
to refinance the Swingline Loan and the Company shall be deemed to have
advanced the proceeds of such Syndicated Loans to FFB. In the event that the
power of the Swingline Bank to give such notice of borrowing on behalf of the
Company is terminated for any reason whatsoever (including,

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 28
- 24 -

without limitation, a termination resulting from the occurrence of an event
specified in clause (g) or (h) of Section 9 hereof with respect to the
Company), or the Swingline Bank is otherwise precluded for any reason
whatsoever from giving a notice of borrowing on behalf of the Company as
provided in the preceding sentence, each Bank shall, upon notice from the
Swingline Bank, promptly purchase from the Swingline Bank a participation in
(or, if and to the extent specified by the Swingline Bank, a direct interest
in) such Swingline Loan in the amount of the Base Rate Loan it would have been
obligated to make pursuant to such notice of borrowing. Anything in Sections
2.02(a) or 4.05 hereof to the contrary notwithstanding, each Bank shall, not
later than 4:00 p.m. New York time on the Business Day on which such notice is
given (if such notice is given by 2:15 p.m. New York time) or 9:00 a.m. New
York time on the next succeeding Business Day (if such notice is given after
2:15 p.m. New York time), make available the amount of the Base Rate Loan to be
made by it (or the amount of the participation or direct interest to be
purchased by it, as the case may be) to the Agent at the account specified in
Section 2.02(a) hereof and the amount so received by the Agent shall be made
available to the Swingline Bank by depositing the same, in immediately
available funds, in an account of the Swingline Bank maintained with Chase at
the Principal Office designated by the Swingline Bank. Promptly following its
receipt of any payment in respect of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Bank shall
pay to each Bank that has acquired a participation in such Loan such Bank's
proportionate share of such payment.

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding
(including, without limitation, in Section 6.02 hereof), the obligation of each
Bank to make its Base Rate Loan (or purchase its participation or direct
interest in the Swingline Loan, as the case may be) pursuant to this Section
2.02(b) is unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever and shall
not be subject to set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment that such Bank
may have or have had against the Company, FFB, the Agent, the Swingline Bank or
any other Bank and, without limiting any of the foregoing, shall be
unconditional irrespective of (i) the occurrence of any Default, (ii) the
financial condition of the Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company,
the Agent, the Swingline Bank or any other Bank or (iii) the termination or
cancellation of the Commitments. The Company and FFB agree that any Bank so
purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in such Swingline Loan may
exercise all rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim or similar rights
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a direct
holder of a Swingline Loan in the amount of such participation.

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 29
- 25 -

If any Bank shall default in its obligation to make its Base
Rate Loan to refinance the Swingline Loan (or purchase its participation or
direct interest in such Swingline Loan, as the case may be) pursuant to the
first paragraph of this Section 2.02(b), then for so long as such default shall
continue, the Agent shall at the request of the Swingline Bank, withhold from
any payments received by the Agent under this Agreement or any Note for account
of such Bank the amount so in default and the Agent shall pay the same to the
Swingline Bank up to the amount and in satisfaction of such defaulted
obligation, which amount the Swingline Bank will apply to the repayment of the
principal of such Swingline Loan (if such Bank defaulted in its obligation to
make its Base Rate Loan) or otherwise to the purchase of the participation or
direct interest to be purchased by such Bank.

2.03 Changes of Commitments; Extension of Commitment
Termination Date.

(a) Optional. (1) The Company shall have the right to
terminate or reduce the aggregate unused amount of the Commitments (for which
purpose the amount of any Money Market Loans or Swingline Loans shall be deemed
to be a pro rata (based on the Commitments) utilization of each Bank's
Commitment) at any time or from time to time in accordance with the provisions
of Sections 4.04 and 4.05 hereof.

(2) The Company shall have the right to terminate the
Commitment of any Bank ("Terminated Bank") in whole but not in part at any time
upon not less than five Business Days' notice to the Terminated Bank and the
Agent; provided that (i) the aggregate amount of the Commitments of all
Terminated Banks pursuant to this provision shall not exceed $100,000,000; (ii)
after giving effect to such termination the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of Loans shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments; (iii)
no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of any such
termination; (iv) (A) no Loan shall be outstanding hereunder at the time of
such termination or (B) if any Loan is outstanding hereunder at such time, then
the consent of the Majority Banks to such termination shall have been obtained;
and (v) all principal of, and interest on, the Loans made by the Terminated
Bank, and all other amounts then owing to such Terminated Bank hereunder
(including, without limitation, any amounts payable under Section 5.05 hereof),
shall be paid at the time of such termination; provided further that, at any
one time during the one-year period following the Restatement Date, the Company
shall have the right to terminate the Commitment of any one Bank having a
Commitment not in excess of $50,000,000 without complying with clause (iv)
above so long as at the time of such termination the Company shall have
unsecured, unguaranteed long-term senior debt securities outstanding with a

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 30
- 26 -

rating by Moody's of not less than Baa3 and also by S&P of not less than BBB-
and the Company shall not be on "credit watch" with a view to downgrading by
either of such rating agencies.

(b) Mandatory. The aggregate amount of the Commitments shall
be automatically reduced to zero on the Commitment Termination Date.

(c) Extension of Commitment Termination Date. The Company
may, by notice to the Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy thereof to
each of the Banks) not less than 60 days and not more than 150 days prior to
the date one year prior to the Commitment Termination Date then in effect (the
"Current Termination Date"), request that the Commitment Termination Date be
extended to the date falling one year after the Current Termination Date;
provided that in no event may the Company request more than two such extensions
pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) after the Restatement Date. If the Company
shall so request such an extension, each Bank, acting in its sole discretion,
may, by notice to the Company and the Agent not less than 30 days prior to the
date one year prior to the Current Termination Date (the "Consent Date" with
respect to such requested extension), advise whether or not such Bank agrees to
extend the Commitment Termination Date to the date falling one year after the
Current Termination Date; provided that any Bank that does not advise the Agent
and the Company on or before the Consent Date shall be deemed to have agreed to
such requested extension (each Bank that advises the Agent and the Company that
it does not agree to a requested extension is herein called a "Non-Consenting
Bank"). The election of any Bank to agree to such extension shall not obligate
any other Bank to agree.

The Company shall have the right on or before the Current
Termination Date, to replace each Non-Consenting Bank with one or more other
banks (which may include any Bank, each an "Additional Commitment Bank"), each
of which Additional Commitment Banks shall have entered into an agreement in
form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the Agent pursuant to which
such Additional Commitment Bank shall undertake all or any portion of the
Commitment(s) of one or more Non-Consenting Banks (if any such Additional
Commitment Bank is a Bank, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Bank's
Commitment hereunder on such date. Each Additional Commitment Bank shall
thereupon become a "Bank" for all purposes of this Agreement.

If Banks holding Commitments (not including the Commitments of
the Additional Commitment Banks) that aggregate more than 66-2/3% of the
aggregate amount of the Commitments (not including the Commitments of the
Additional Commitment Banks) shall, by the Consent Date, have agreed (or be
deemed to have

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 31
- 27 -

agreed as provided above) to extend the Current Termination Date, then,
effective as of the Consent Date, the Commitment Termination Date shall be
extended to the date falling one year after the Current Termination Date
(provided, if such date is not a Business Day, then such Commitment Termination
Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Current
Termination Date shall not be effective unless (i) no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing either on the date of the notice requesting such
extension or on the Consent Date, (ii) each of the representations and
warranties of the Company in Section 7 hereof shall be true and complete in all
material respects on and as of each of the date of such notice and the Consent
Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as each such date (or, if
any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of
a specific date.

Even if the Current Termination Date is extended as aforesaid,
the Commitment of each Non-Consenting Bank shall terminate on the Current
Termination Date and all principal of and interest on the Loans made by each
such Non-Consenting Bank, and all other amounts then owing to such
Non-Consenting Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, any amounts
payable under Section 5.05 hereof), shall be paid on the then Current
Termination Date.

Without affecting the rights or obligations of the Company or
any Bank under this Section 2.03(c) (and without liability to the Company or
any Bank for any failure to do so), the Agent will endeavor to remind the
Company, not less than 90 days prior to the date one year prior to the Current
Termination Date, of any right the Company may have under this Section 2.03(c)
to extend the Current Termination Date.

If the Company causes one or more Additional Commitment Banks
to become party hereto at any time that there are Syndicated Loans outstanding,
the Company shall cause such Additional Commitment Banks to make Syndicated
Loans to the Company and/or shall prepay the then outstanding Syndicated Loans,
in accordance with Section 4.02 hereof, so that, after giving effect to such
Syndicated Loans and prepayments, the Syndicated Loans shall be held by the
Banks pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts of their Commitments.

If any Non-Consenting Bank is a Reference Bank (or whose
Applicable Lending Office is a Reference Bank, as the case may be), such
Reference Bank shall cease to be a Reference Bank at the close of business on
the date five (5) Business Days prior to the then Current Termination Date and,
if as a result of the

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 32
- 28 -

foregoing, there shall be less than three Reference Banks remaining, then the
Agent (with the consent of the Company) shall, by notice to the Company and the
Banks, designate additional Bank(s) as Reference Bank(s), so that there shall
at all times be at least three Reference Banks.

If the Swingline Bank is a Non-Consenting Bank the provisions
of Section 2.10 hereof shall cease being available on the then Current
Termination Date unless another Bank shall have agreed to be the Swingline
Bank.

(d) No Reinstatement. The Commitments once terminated or
reduced may not be reinstated.

2.04 Money Market Loans.

(a) In addition to borrowings of Syndicated Loans, at any
time prior to the Commitment Termination Date, the Company may, as set
forth in this Section 2.04, request the Banks to make offers to make
Money Market Loans to the Company in Dollars. The Banks may, but
shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the Company may, but
shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set
forth in this Section 2.04. Money Market Loans may be LIBOR Market
Loans or Set Rate Loans (each a "type" of Money Market Loan), provided
that:

(i) there may be no more than fifteen different
Interest Periods for both Syndicated Loans and Money Market
Loans outstanding at the same time (for which purpose Interest
Periods described in different lettered clauses of the
definition of the term "Interest Period" shall be deemed to be
different Interest Periods even if they are coterminous);

(ii) the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market
Loans, together with the aggregate principal amount of all
Syndicated Loans and Swingline Loans, at any one time
outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Commitments at such time; and

(iii) the Interest Period for any Money Market Loan shall
end on a date no later than the Commitment Termination Date.

(b) When the Company wishes to request offers to make Money
Market Loans, it shall give the Agent (which shall promptly notify the
Banks) notice (a Money Market Quote Request") so as to be received no
later than 11:00 a.m. New York time on (x) the fourth Business Day
prior to the date of borrowing proposed therein, in the case of a
LIBOR Auction or (y) the Business Day next preceding the date

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 33
- 29 -

of borrowing proposed therein, in the case of a Set Rate Auction (or,
in any such case, such other time and date as the Company and the
Agent, with the consent of the Majority Banks, may agree). The
Company may request offers to make Money Market Loans for up to three
different Interest Periods in a single notice (for which purpose
Interest Periods in different lettered clauses of the definition of
the term "Interest Period" shall be deemed to be different Interest
Periods even if they are coterminous); provided that the request for
each separate Interest Period shall be deemed to be a separate Money
Market Quote Request for a separate borrowing (a Money Market
Borrowing"). Each such notice shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit G hereto and shall specify as to each Money Market Borrowing:

(i) the proposed date of such borrowing, which shall be
a Business Day;

(ii) the aggregate amount of such Money Market Borrowing,
which shall be at least $25,000,000 (or in larger multiples of
$500,000) but shall not cause the limits specified in Section
2.04(a) hereof to be violated;

(iii) the duration of the Interest Period applicable
thereto;

(iv) whether the Money Market Quotes requested for a
particular Interest Period are to be quotes for LIBOR Market
Loans or Set Rate Loans; and

(v) if the Money Market Quotes requested are to set
forth a Money Market Rate, the date on which the Money Market
Quotes are to be submitted if it is before the proposed date
of borrowing (the date on which such Money Market Quotes are
to be submitted is called the "Quotation Date").

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.04(b), no Money Market
Quote Request shall be given within five Business Days (or such other
number of days as the Company and the Agent, with the consent of the
Majority Banks, may agree) of any other Money Market Quote Request.

(c) (i) Each Bank may submit one or more Money Market
Quotes, each containing an offer to make a Money Market Loan in
response to any Money Market Quote Request; provided that, if the
Company's request under Section 2.04(b) hereof

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 34
- 30 -

specified more than one Interest Period, such Bank may make a single
submission containing one or more Money Market Quotes for each such
Interest Period. Each Money Market Quote must be submitted to the
Agent not later than (x) 2:00 p.m. New York time on the fourth
Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the case of a
LIBOR Auction or (y) 10:00 a.m. New York time on the Quotation Date,
in the case of a Set Rate Auction (or, in any such case, such other
time and date as the Company and the Agent, with the consent of the
Majority Banks, may agree); provided that any Money Market Quote
submitted by Chase (or its Applicable Lending Office) may be
submitted, and may only be submitted, if Chase (or such Applicable
Lending Office) notifies the Company of the terms of the offer
contained therein not later than (x) 1:00 p.m. New York time on the
fourth Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the
case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) 9:45 a.m. New York time on the
Quotation Date, in the case of a Set Rate Auction. Subject to
Sections 5.02(b), 5.03, 7.02 and 10 hereof, any Money Market Quote so
made shall be irrevocable except with the consent of the Agent given
on the instructions of the Company. Except for submissions to the
Agent as provided above, no Bank shall, directly or indirectly,
communicate with any other Bank regarding the terms contained in, or
under consideration for, any Money Market Quote. Chase shall not
consider the terms of any other Bank's Money Market Quote in deciding
the terms of any Money Market Quote it may decide to submit to the
Company.

(ii) Each Money Market Quote shall be substantially in the form
of Exhibit H hereto and shall specify:

(A) the proposed date of borrowing and the Interest
Period therefor;

(B) the principal amount of the Money Market Loan
for which each such offer is being made, which principal
amount shall be at least $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of
$500,000; provided that the aggregate principal amount of all
Money Market Loans for which a Bank submits Money Market
Quotes (x) may be greater or less than the Commitment of such
Bank but (y) may not exceed the principal amount of the Money
Market Borrowing for a particular Interest Period for which
offers were requested;

(C) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, the margin above
or below the applicable LIBO Rate (the Money Market Margin")
offered for each such Money Market Loan, expressed as a
percentage (expressed to the

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 35
- 31 -

nearest 1/10,000 of 1%) to be added to or subtracted from the
applicable LIBO Rate;

(D) in the case of a Set Rate Auction, the rate of
interest per annum (expressed to the nearest 1/10,000 of 1%)
offered for each such Money Market Loan (the "Money Market
Rate"); and

(E) the identity of the quoting Bank.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Agent and the Company, no Money Market
Quote shall contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or
propose terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the
applicable Money Market Quote Request and, in particular, no Money
Market Quote may be conditioned upon acceptance by the Company of all
(or some specified minimum) of the principal amount of the Money
Market Loan for which such Money Market Quote is being made.

(d) The Agent shall (x) in the case of a Set Rate Auction, as
promptly as practicable after the Money Market Quote is submitted (but
in any event not later than 10:15 a.m. New York time on the Quotation
Date) or (y) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, by 4:00 p.m. New York
time on the day a Money Market Quote is submitted, notify the Company
of the terms (i) of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank that is
in accordance with Section 2.04(c) hereof and (ii) of any Money Market
Quote that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a
previous Money Market Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the
same Money Market Quote Request. Any such subsequent Money Market
Quote shall be disregarded by the Agent and the Company unless such
subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted solely to correct a
manifest error in such former Money Market Quote. The Agent's notice
to the Company shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of the
Money Market Borrowing for which offers have been received and (B) the
respective principal amounts and Money Market Margins or Money Market
Rates, as the case may be, so offered by each Bank (identifying the
Bank that made each Money Market Quote).

(e) Not later than 11:00 a.m. New York time on (x) the third
Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the case of a
LIBOR Auction or (y) the Quotation Date, in the case of a Set Rate
Auction (or, in any such case, such other time and date as the Company
and the Agent, with the consent of the Majority Banks, may agree), the
Company shall notify the Agent of its acceptance or nonacceptance of
the offers so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.04(d) hereof (and
the failure of the Company to give such notice by such

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 36
- 32 -

time shall constitute nonacceptance) and the Agent shall promptly
notify each affected Bank. In the case of acceptance, such notice
shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each
Interest Period that are accepted. The Company may accept any Money
Market Quote in whole or in part (provided that, except for
acceptances in part contemplated by the penultimate sentence of this
Section 2.04(e), any Money Market Quote accepted in part shall be at
least $5,000,000 or in larger multiples of $100,000); provided that:

(i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money
Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set
forth in the related Money Market Quote Request;

(ii) the aggregate principal amount of each Money
Market Borrowing shall be at least $25,000,000 (or in larger
multiples of $500,000) but shall not cause the limits
specified in Section 2.04(a) hereof to be violated;

(iii) acceptance of offers may be made only in
ascending order of Money Market Margins or Money Market Rates,
as the case may be, in each case beginning with the lowest
rate so offered; and

(iv) the Company may not accept any offer where the
Agent has advised the Company that such offer fails to comply
with Section 2.04(c)(ii) hereof or otherwise fails to comply
with the requirements of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, Section 2.04(a) hereof).

If offers are made by two or more Banks with the same Money Market
Margins or Money Market Rates, as the case may be, for a greater
aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers
are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of
Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall
be allocated by the Company among such Banks as nearly as possible (in
amounts of at least $5,000,000 or larger multiples of $100,000) in
proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers.
Determinations by the Company of the amounts of Money Market Loans
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(f) Any Bank whose offer to make any Money Market Loan has
been accepted shall, not later than 1:00 p.m. New York time on the
date specified for the making of such Loan, make the amount of such
Loan available to the Agent at account

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 37
- 33 -

number NYAO-DI-900-9-000002 maintained by the Agent with Chase at the
Principal Office in immediately available funds, for account of the
Company. The amount so received by the Agent shall, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, be made available to the
Company by depositing the same on the date received by the Agent, in
immediately available funds, in an account of the Company maintained
with Chase at the Principal Office designated by the Company.

(g) Except for the purpose and to the extent expressly stated
in Sections 2.03(a) and 2.05(a) hereof, the amount of any Money Market
Loan made by any Bank shall not constitute a utilization of such
Bank's Commitment.

2.05 Fees.

(a) Facility Fee. The Company shall pay to the Agent for
account of each Bank a facility fee on the amount of such Bank's Commitment
(whether or not utilized) for the period from and including the Amendment
Effective Date to but not including the earlier of the date such Commitment is
terminated and the Commitment Termination Date, at a rate per annum equal to
the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage. Accrued facility fee shall be payable
on each Quarterly Date and on the earlier of the date such Commitment is
terminated and the Commitment Termination Date.

(b) Money Market Quote Request Fee. The Company shall pay to
the Agent a solicitation fee equal to $2,000 for each Money Market Quote
Request made by the Company. Accrued solicitation fees shall be payable on
each Quarterly Date and on the earlier of the date the Commitments are
terminated and the Commitment Termination Date.

2.06 Lending Offices. The Loans of each type made by each
Bank shall be made and maintained at such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for
Loans of such type.

2.07 Several Obligations; Remedies Independent. The failure
of any Bank to make any Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor
shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to make its Loan on such
date, but neither any Bank nor the Agent shall be responsible for the failure
of any other Bank to make a Loan to be made by such other Bank. The amounts
payable by the Company at any time hereunder and under the Notes to each Bank
shall be a separate and independent debt and each Bank shall be entitled to
protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and the Notes, and
it shall not be necessary for any other Bank or the Agent to consent to, or be

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 38
- 34 -

joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes. The
provisions of the preceding sentence shall apply mutatis mutandis to the
Swingline Loans made by the Swingline Bank to FFB.

2.08 Notes.

(a) The Syndicated Loans made by each Bank shall be evidenced
by a single promissory note of the Company in substantially the form of Exhibit
A-1 hereto, dated the Restatement Date, payable to such Bank in a principal
amount equal to the amount of its Commitment as originally in effect and
otherwise duly completed. The date, amount, type and interest rate of each
Syndicated Loan made by each Bank to the Company, and each payment made on
account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Bank on its books
and, prior to any transfer of such Note held by it, endorsed by such Bank on
the schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof; provided that
any failure by any Bank to make such endorsements on the schedule attached to
the Note held by it shall not affect the validity of the Company's obligation
to repay the unpaid principal amount of the Loans made by such Bank with
interest thereon in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) The Money Market Loans made by any Bank shall be
evidenced by a single promissory note of the Company in substantially the form
of Exhibit A-2 hereto, dated the Restatement Date, payable to such Bank and

date of each Money Market Loan made by each Bank to the Company, and each
payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such
Bank on its books and, prior to any transfer of such Note held by it, endorsed
by such Bank on the schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof;
provided that any failure by any Bank to make such endorsements on the schedule
attached to the Note held by it shall not affect the validity of the Company's
obligation to repay the unpaid principal amount of the Loans made by such Bank
with interest thereon in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(c) The Swingline Loans made by the Swingline Bank shall be
evidenced by a single promissory note of FFB in substantially the form of
Exhibit A-3 hereto, dated the Restatement Date, payable to the Swingline Bank
and otherwise duly completed. The date, amount and interest rate of each
Swingline Loan made to FFB, and each payment made on account of the principal
thereof, shall be recorded by the Swingline Bank on its books and, prior to any

schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof; provided that any
failure by

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 39
- 35 -

the Swingline Bank to make such endorsements on the schedule attached to the
Note held by it shall not affect the validity of FFB's obligation to repay the
unpaid principal amount of the Swingline Loans with interest thereon in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(d) Neither the Swingline Bank nor any Bank shall be entitled
to have its Notes subdivided, by exchange for promissory notes of lesser
denominations or otherwise, except in connection with a permitted assignment of
all or any portion of such Bank's Commitment, Loans and Notes pursuant to
Section 5.01(e) or Sections 11.06(b), (e) or (g) hereof.

2.09 Optional Prepayments and Conversions or Continuation of
Loans. Subject to Section 4.04 hereof, the Company shall have the right to
prepay Syndicated Loans and subject to the terms thereof, Money Market Loans
(without premium or penalty but subject to the provisions of Section 5 hereof),
in such order as it may select as between Syndicated Loans, and subject to the
terms thereof, Money Market Loans or to Convert Syndicated Loans of one type
into Syndicated Loans of another type or Continue Syndicated Loans of one type
as Syndicated Loans of the same type, at any time or from time to time,
provided that: (i) the Company shall give the Agent notice of each such
prepayment, Conversion or Continuation as provided in Section 4.05 hereof; and
(ii) Eurodollar Loans may be prepaid or Converted only on the last day of an
Interest Period for such Loans.

2.10 Swingline Loans.

(a) FFB may, on any Business Day prior to the Commitment
Termination Date, request the Swingline Bank (i) to make an offer on such
Business Day to make a Swingline Loan (an "Uncommitted Swingline Loan"), or

Swingline Request for an Uncommitted Swingline Loan, FFB shall within five
minutes of receipt of such Swingline Quote notify the Swingline Bank of its
acceptance or nonacceptance of such Swingline Quote; provided that a failure of
FFB so to notify the Swingline Bank shall be nonacceptance of such Swingline
Quote.

within an hour of a Swingline Request for a Committed Swingline Loan, the
Swingline Bank shall make the amount of the Swingline Loan to be made by it on

purposes of the foregoing, one for each type or Interest Period). Each
reduction of Commitments in accordance with Section 2.03(a) hereof shall be in
an aggregate amount at least equal to $1,000,000. Anything in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, the aggregate principal amount of Eurodollar
Loans having the same Interest Period shall be at least equal to $10,000,000
and, if the aggregate amount of Eurodollar Loans having the same Interest
Period would otherwise be in a lesser aggregate principal amount for any
period, such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans during such period.

Conversion, Continuation or prepayment (which shall be a Business Day) and, if
such Loans are Eurodollar Loans, the duration of the Interest Period

Credit Agreement

therefor. The Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of the contents of each
such notice. In the event that the Company fails to select the type of
Syndicated Loan, or the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Loan, within the time period and otherwise as provided in this Section 4.05,
such Loan (if outstanding as a Eurodollar Loan) will be automatically Converted
into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period for
such Loan or (if outstanding as a Base Rate Loan) will remain as, or (if not
then outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan.

4.06 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Agent
shall have been notified by a Bank or the Company (the "Payor") prior to the
date on which the Payor is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (in the
case of a Bank) the proceeds of a Loan to be made by it hereunder or (in the
case of the Company) a payment to the Agent for account of one or more of the
Banks hereunder (such payment being herein called the "Required Payment") which
notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make
the Required Payment to the Agent, the Agent may assume that the Required
Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not
be required to) make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient(s)
on such date and, if the Payor has not in fact made the Required Payment to the
Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment shall, on demand, repay to the Agent
the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each
day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available
by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum
equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day and, if such recipient(s) shall
fail promptly to make such payment, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such
amount, on demand, from the Payor, together with interest as aforesaid.

4.07 Sharing of Payments, Etc.

(a) The Company agrees that, in addition to (and without
limitation of) any right of set-off, bankers' lien or counterclaim a Bank may
otherwise have, each Bank shall be entitled, at its option, to offset balances
held by it for account of the Company at any of its offices, in Dollars or in
any other currency, against any principal of or interest on such Bank's Loan,
or any other amount payable to such Bank hereunder, which is not paid when due
(regardless of whether such balances are then due to the Company), in which
case it shall promptly notify the Company and the Agent thereof, provided that
such Bank's failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof.

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 47
- 43 -

(b) If any Bank shall obtain payment of any principal of or
interest on any Syndicated Loan made by it to the Company under this Agreement
through the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or
similar right, debit pursuant to Section 4.01(b) hereof, or otherwise, and, as
a result of such payment, such Bank shall have received a greater percentage of
the principal or interest then due hereunder by the Company to such Bank in
respect of Syndicated Loans than the percentage received by any other Bank, it
shall promptly purchase from the other Banks participations in (or, if and to
the extent specified by any such other Bank, direct interests in) the
Syndicated Loans made by such other Banks (or in interest due thereon, as the
case may be) in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time
as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Banks shall share the benefit of
such excess payment (net of any expenses which may be incurred by such Bank in
obtaining or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in accordance with the
unpaid principal and/or interest on the Syndicated Loans held by each Bank. To
such end all the Banks shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by
the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or
must otherwise be restored.

(c) The Company agrees that any Bank purchasing a
participation (or direct interest) in the Syndicated Loans made by other Banks
(or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in accordance with Section
4.07(b) hereof may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim
or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank
were a direct holder of Loans in the amount of such participation.

(d) Nothing contained herein shall require any Bank to
exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Bank to exercise, and
retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other
indebtedness or obligation of the Company. If, under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Bank receives a secured claim
in lieu of a set-off to which this Section 4.07 applies, such Bank shall, to
the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in
a manner consistent with the rights of the Banks entitled under this Section
4.07 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

Section 5. Yield Protection and Illegality.

5.01 Additional Costs.

(a) The Company shall pay directly to each Bank from time to
time such amounts as such Bank may determine to be necessary to compensate it
for any costs which such Bank determines are attributable to its making or
maintaining of any Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make any Fixed Rate
Loans hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank
hereunder in respect of any of such Loans or such obligation (such increases in
costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Additional
Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change which:

(i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to
such Bank under this Agreement or its Note in respect of any of such
Loans (other than taxes imposed on or measured by the overall net
income of such Bank or of its Applicable Lending Office for any of
such Loan); or

(ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or
similar requirements (other than the Reserve Requirement utilized in
the determination of the Fixed Rate for such Loan) relating to any
extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other
liabilities of, such Bank (including such Loan or any deposits
referred to in the definition of "Fixed Base Rate" in Section 1.01
hereof), or any commitment of such Bank (including the Commitment of
such Bank hereunder); or

(iii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or
any of its Notes (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities)
or its Commitments.

If any Bank requests compensation from the Company under this Section 5.01(a),
the Company may, by notice to such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), suspend the
obligation of such Bank to make or Continue its Loans of the type with respect
to which such compensation is requested, or to Convert its Base Rate Loan into
a Loan of such type, until the Regulatory Change giving rise to such request
ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof
shall be applicable).

(b) Without limiting the effect of the provisions of Section
5.01(a) hereof, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Bank
either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a
specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of
such Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the interest

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 49
- 45 -

rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a
category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which includes
Eurodollar Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such
a category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if such Bank so
elects by notice to the Company (with a copy to the Agent), the obligation of
such Bank to make or Continue, or to Convert its Base Rate Loan into, a
Eurodollar Loan hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change
ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof
shall be applicable).

(c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions
of this Section 5.01 (but without duplication), the Company shall pay directly
to each Bank from time to time on request such amounts as such Bank may
determine to be necessary to compensate such Bank for any costs which it
determines are attributable to the maintenance by such Bank (or any Applicable
Lending Office), pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation,
directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) of any court or
governmental or monetary authority (i) following any Regulatory Change or (ii)
implementing any risk-based capital guideline or requirement (whether or not
having the force of law and whether or not the failure to comply, therewith
would be unlawful) heretofore or hereafter issued by any government or
governmental or supervisory authority implementing at the national level the
Basle Accord, of capital in respect of its Commitment or any of its Loans (such
compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to any reduction
of the rate of return on assets or equity of such Bank (or any Applicable
Lending Office) to a level below that which such Bank (or any Applicable
Lending Office) could have achieved but for such law, regulation,
interpretation, directive or request).

(d) Each Bank will notify the Company of any event occurring
after the date of this Agreement that will entitle such Bank to compensation
under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 5.01 as promptly as practicable, but
in any event within 45 days, after such Bank obtains actual knowledge thereof;
provided that (i) if any Bank fails to give such notice within 45 days after it
obtains actual knowledge of such an event, such Bank shall, with respect to
compensation payable pursuant to this Section 5.01 in respect of any costs
(including, without limitation, Additional Costs) resulting from such event,
only be entitled to payment under this Section 5.01 for costs incurred from and
after the date 45 days prior to the date that such Bank does give such notice
and (ii) each Bank will designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the
Loan of such Bank affected by such event if such designation will avoid the
need

for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole
opinion of such Bank, be disadvantageous to such Bank, except that such Bank
shall have no obligation to designate an Applicable Lending Office located in
the United States of America. Each Bank will furnish to the Company a
certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Bank for
compensation under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 5.01. Determinations
and allocations by any Bank for purposes of this Section 5.01 of the effect of
any Regulatory Change pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b) hereof, or of the
effect of capital maintained pursuant to Section 5.01(c) hereof, on its costs
or rate of return of maintaining Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or on
amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of the amounts required to
compensate such Bank under this Section 5.01, shall be prima facie evidence
thereof, provided that such determinations and allocations are made on a
reasonable basis.

(e) If any Bank (an "Affected Bank"), claims compensation
from the Company under Section 5.01(a), 5.01(b) or 5.01(c) hereof (without
prejudice to any amounts then due to such Bank under said Sections), the
Company may exercise any one of the following options:

(i) The Company may request one or more of the non-Affected
Banks to take over all (but not part) of such Affected Bank's then
outstanding Syndicated Loans and to assume all (but not part) of such
Affected Bank's Commitment and obligations hereunder. If one or more
Banks (each, an "Assenting Bank") shall so agree, pursuant to such
documentation as is satisfactory in form and substance to the Company,
such Affected Bank, each Assenting Bank and the Agent (x) the
Commitment to make Syndicated Loans of each Assenting Bank and the
obligations of such Assenting Bank with respect to Syndicated Loans
under this Agreement shall be increased by its respective share of the
Commitment to make such Loans and of the obligations of such Affected
Bank with respect to Syndicated Loans under this Agreement taken over
by such Assenting Bank and (y) each Assenting Bank shall make
Syndicated Loans to the Company,pro rata according to such Assenting
Bank's respective share of the Commitment of such Affected Bank to
make such Loans taken over by such Assenting Bank, in an aggregate
principal amount equal to such share of the outstanding principal
amount of such Loans of such Affected Bank and otherwise on the same
terms as such Loans, on a date mutually acceptable to the Assenting
Banks, such Affected Bank and the Company. The proceeds of such
Loans, together with funds of the Company, shall be used to prepay
such Loans of such Affected Bank, together with all interest accrued
thereon, and all

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 51
- 47 -

other amounts owing to such Affected Bank hereunder in respect of the
Syndicated Loans and, upon such assumption by the Assenting Banks and
prepayment by the Company, such Affected Bank shall cease to be a
"Bank" for purposes of this Agreement in respect of the Syndicated
Loans and shall no longer have any obligations hereunder in respect of
the Syndicated Loans.

(ii) The Company may designate a bank acceptable to the Agent
to assume all (but not part of) the Commitment and the obligations of
each such Affected Bank hereunder, and to purchase the outstanding
Notes of such Affected Bank and such Affected Bank's rights hereunder
and with respect thereto (a Replacement Bank"), in each case on a date
mutually acceptable to the Replacement Bank, such Affected Bank, and
the Company, without recourse upon, or warranty by, or expense to,
such Affected Bank, for a purchase price equal to the outstanding
principal amount of the Loans of such Affected Bank plus all interest
accrued thereon and all other amounts owing to such Affected Bank
hereunder, and upon such assumption and purchase by the Replacement
Bank, such Replacement Bank shall be deemed to be a Bank" for purposes
of this Agreement and such Affected Bank shall cease to be a "Bank"
for purposes of this Agreement and such Affected Bank shall no longer
have any obligations hereunder.

(iii) So long as no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Company may terminate such Affected Bank's Commitment
and prepay all of such Affected Bank's Loans, together with all
interest accrued thereon, and all other amounts owing to such Affected
Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, all amounts payable
under Sections 5.01 and 5.05 hereof).

If any Affected Bank that ceases being a "Bank" for purposes of this Agreement
is a Reference Bank (or whose Applicable Lending Office is a Reference Bank, as
the case may be), such Reference Bank shall cease to be a Reference Bank and,
if as a result of the foregoing, there shall be less than three Reference Banks
remaining, then the Agent (with the consent of the Company) shall, by notice to
the Company and the Banks, designate additional Bank(s) as Reference Bank(s),
so that there shall at all times be at least three Reference Banks.

5.02 Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any Fixed
Base Rate for any Interest Period:

(a) the Agent determines (or any Bank that has outstanding a
Money Market Quote with respect to a LIBOR Market Loan determines),
which determination shall be conclusive, that quotations of interest
rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of
"Fixed Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof are not being provided in the
relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of
determining rates of interest for any type of Fixed Rate Loans as
provided herein; or

(b) the Majority Banks determine (or any Bank that has
outstanding a Money Market Quote with respect to a LIBOR Market Loan
determines), which determination shall be conclusive, and notify (or
notifies, as the case may be), the Agent that the relevant rates of
interest referred to in the definition of "Fixed Base Rate" in Section
1.01 hereof upon the basis of which the rate of interest for
Eurodollar Loans (or LIBOR Market Loans, as the case may be), for such
Interest Period is to be determined are not likely to cover adequately
the cost to such Banks (or such quoting Bank) of making or maintaining
such type of Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Company and each Bank prompt notice thereof, and
so long as such condition remains in effect, the Banks (or such quoting Bank)
shall be under no obligation to make additional Eurodollar Loans (or a LIBOR
Market Loan, as the case may be), to Continue Eurodollar Loans or to Convert
Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and the Company shall, on the last day(s)
of the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Loans (or
LIBOR Market Loans), either prepay such Loans or Convert such Loans into Base
Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.09 hereof.

5.03 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Bank or its Applicable
Lending Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans or
LIBOR Market Loans hereunder, then such Bank shall promptly notify the Company
thereof (with a copy to the Agent) and such Bank's obligation to make or
Continue, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan shall be
suspended until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain a Eurodollar
Loan (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable),
and such Bank shall no longer be obligated to make any LIBOR Market Loan that
it has offered to make.

5.04 Treatment of Affected Loans under Certain Circumstances.
If the obligation of any Bank to make or Continue, or to Convert a Base Rate
Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan or LIBOR Market Loan is suspended pursuant to
Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof, such Bank's Eurodollar Loan

Credit Agreement

- 49 -

or LIBOR Market Loan shall be automatically Converted into a Base Rate Loan on
the last day of the then current Interest Period for its Eurodollar Loan or
LIBOR Market Loan (or, in the case of a Conversion required by Section 5.01(b)
or 5.03 hereof, on such earlier date as such Bank may specify to the Company
with a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such Bank gives notice as
provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof
which gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

(a) to the extent that such Bank's Eurodollar Loan or LIBOR
Market Loan has been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of
principal which would otherwise be applied to such Bank's Eurodollar
Loan or LIBOR Market Loan shall be applied instead to its Base Rate
Loan; and

(b) a Loan which would otherwise be made or Continued by such
Bank as a Eurodollar Loan shall be made or Continued instead as a Base
Rate Loan and the Base Rate Loan of such Bank which would otherwise be
Converted into a Eurodollar Loan shall remain as a Base Rate Loan.

If such Bank gives notice to the Company (with a copy to the Agent) that the
circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof which gave rise to the
Conversion of such Bank's Eurodollar Loan or LIBOR Market Loan pursuant to this
Section 5.04 no longer exist (which such Bank agrees to do promptly upon such
circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans are then
outstanding, such Bank's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on
the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loans
so that, after giving effect thereto, to the extent possible all Syndicated
Loans held by the Banks are Eurodollar Loans.

5.05 Compensation. The Company shall pay to the Agent for
account of each Bank, upon the request of such Bank through the Agent, such
amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense which such Bank reasonably
determines are attributable to:

(a) any payment, prepayment or Conversion (other than
pursuant to Section 5.01 (b) or 5.03 hereof) of a Fixed Rate Loan or a
Set Rate Loan made by such Bank for any reason (including, without
limitation, the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 9
hereof) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for
such Loan; or

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 54
- 50 -

(b) any failure by the Company for any reason (other than as
a consequence of the delivery by such Bank of the notice referred to
in Sections 5.01(a), 5.01(b), 5.02 or 5.03 hereof but including,
without limitation, the failure of any of the conditions precedent
specified in Section 6 hereof to be satisfied) to borrow a Fixed Rate
Loan or a Set Rate Loan (with respect to which, in the case of a Money
Market Loan, the Company has accepted a Money Market Quote) from such
Bank on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant notice
of borrowing given pursuant to Section 2.02 or 2.04(b) hereof.

Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall
include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
which otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or
Converted or not borrowed for the period from the date of such payment,
prepayment, Conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current
Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the
Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date specified
for such borrowing) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided
for herein over (ii) the interest component of the amount such Bank would have
bid in the London interbank market (if such Loan is a Eurodollar Loan or a
LIBOR Market Loan) or the United States secondary certificate of deposit market
(if such Loan is a Set Rate Loan) for Dollar deposits of leading banks in
amounts comparable to such principal amount and with maturities comparable to
such period (as reasonably determined by such Bank).

5.06 Withholding Tax Exemption; Etc. Each Bank which is
organized outside of the United States of America shall deliver to the Company
(with a copy to the Agent) such certificates, documents or other evidence as
may be required from time to time, including, without limitation, any
certificate or statement of exemption required by Treasury Regulation Section
1.1441-4(a) or Section 1.1441-6(c) or any subsequent version thereof, properly
completed and duly executed by such Bank, to establish that such Bank is not
subject to withholding under Section 1441 or 1442 of the Code, or comparable
successor provisions, because payments to such Bank are effectively connected
with the conduct by such Bank of a trade or business in the United States of
America or exempt from United States tax under a provision of an applicable tax
treaty. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Company
shall not have any obligation to pay to any Bank any amount which the Company
is liable to withhold due to failure of such Bank to timely file with the
Company such certificate or statement of exemption by such time or times as set
forth in such Regulations or otherwise.

properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries subject to the restrictions
contained in Sections 8.05(c) and/or 8.06 hereof is represented by properties

fulfilled their respective obligations under the minimum funding standards of
ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan and are in compliance in all
material respects with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the

projections and pro forma financial information, no information, report,

Company to the Agent and the Banks in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement or included therein or delivered pursuant thereto contains any untrue
statement of material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading which untrue statement or omission (i) has
not been corrected in a certificate of the Company furnished to the Agent and
the Banks at least one Business Day prior to the Closing Date or (ii) if not so
corrected, relates to matters that would have (or have had) a Material Adverse
Effect. All information furnished after the date hereof by or on behalf of the
Company to the Agent and the Banks in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby will be true and accurate in every material
respect on the date as of which such information is stated or certified unless

in) all of its properties and assets, free and clear of all Liens or other
encumbrances of any nature other than Liens expressly permitted by Section 8.06
hereof.

waived by the Borrowers; and (ii) in the case of the occurrence of an Event of

presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by the Company.

Section 10. The Agent.

10.01 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Bank and the
Swingline Bank hereby irrevocably appoint and authorize the Agent to act as its
agent hereunder and under the other Basic Documents with such powers as are
specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of this Agreement and of the
other Basic Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The Agent (which term as used in this sentence and in
Section 10.05 and the first sentence of Section 10.06 hereof shall include
reference to its affiliates and its own and its affiliates' officers,
directors, employees and agents): (a) shall have no duties or responsibilities
except

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 80
- 76 -

those expressly set forth) in this Agreement and in the other Basic Documents,
and shall not by reason of this Agreement or any other Basic Document be a
trustee for any Bank or the Swingline Bank; (b) shall not be responsible to the
Banks or the Swingline Bank for any recitals, statements, representations or
warranties contained in recitals or in any other Basic Document, or in any
certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by
any of them under, this Agreement or any other Basic Document, or for the
value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Agreement or any other Basic Document or any other document referred to or
provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the Company or any other
Person to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder; (c) shall not
be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings
hereunder or under any other Basic Document, except for enforcement of the
Company Guarantee at the request of the Majority Banks; and (d) shall not be
responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or
under any other Basic Document or under any other document or instrument
referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or
therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for
the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected
by it in good faith. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the
holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Agent, together
with the consent of the Company to such assignment or transfer and the Agent
shall have consented to such assignment or transfer.

10.02 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by
telephone) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or
sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected
by the Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement
or any other Basic Document, the Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and thereunder in accordance
with instructions signed by the Majority Banks, and such instructions of the
Majority Banks and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding on all of the Banks and the Swingline Bank.

10.03 Defaults. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default unless the Agent has
received notice from a Bank, the Swingline Bank or any Borrower specifying such
Default and stating that such notice is

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 81
- 77 -

a "Notice of Default". In the event that the Agent receives such a notice of
the occurrence of a Default, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the
Banks and the Swingline Bank. The Agent shall (subject to Sections 10.01 and
10.07 hereof) take such action with respect to such Default as shall be
directed by the Majority Banks, provided that, unless and until the Agent shall
have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Banks and the
Swingline Bank.

10.04 Rights as a Bank. With respect to its Commitments and
the Loans made by it, Chase (and any successor acting as Agent) in its capacity
as a Bank (including, for these purposes, the Swingline Bank) hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise
the same as though it were not acting as the Agent, and the term "Bank" or
"Banks" or "Swingline Bank" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates,
include the Agent in its individual capacity. Chase (and any successor acting
as Agent) and its affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any
Bank) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust or other business with the Company (and any of their affiliates)
as if it were not acting as the Agent, and Chase and its affiliates may accept
fees and other consideration from, the Company for services in connection with
this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to the
Banks.

10.05 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 11.03 hereof, but without
limiting the obligations of the Company under said Section 11.03) ratably in
accordance with the Commitments of the Banks (or, if the Commitments have been
terminated), ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the
Loans made by the Banks for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Basic Document or any other documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, the costs and expenses which the Company is
obligated to pay under Section 11.03 hereof, but excluding, unless a Default
has occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses
incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder and excluding all
out-of-pocket expenses and costs of the Agent referred to in Section
11.03(a)(i) except to the extent that the Company is obligated to reimburse the
Agent for such expenses and costs) or

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 82
- 78 -

the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other
documents, provided that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to
the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
party to be indemnified.

10.06 Non-Reliance on Agent and other Banks. Each Bank
agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the Agent or any
other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement
or any of the other Basic Documents. The Agent shall not be required to keep
itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Company of this
Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents or any other document referred to
or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other
documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by
the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any of their affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Agent or any
of its affiliates.

10.07 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required
of the Agent hereunder and under the other Basic Documents, the Agent shall in
all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder and
thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction from
the Banks of their indemnification obligations under Section 10.05 hereof
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action.

10.08 Resignation or Removal of Agent. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, the Agent
may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Company,
and the Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority
Banks. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Banks shall have the
right to appoint a successor Agent which shall be a Bank or, with the prior
consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), any
other bank. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 83
- 79 -

Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Banks' removal of the
retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks and the
Swingline Bank, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Bank or, with the
prior consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
any other bank which has an office in New York, New York with a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring
Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this
Section 10 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent.

10.09 Consents Under Basic Documents. Without the prior
consent of the Majority Banks, the Agent will not consent to any modification,
supplement or waiver under the Company Guarantee, provided that without the
prior consent of each Bank and the Swingline Bank, the Agent will not release
the Company from any of its obligations under the Company Guarantee.

Section 11. Miscellaneous.

11.01 Waiver. No failure on the part of the Agent, any Bank
or the Swingline Bank to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of
dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or
any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any Note
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not
of any remedies provided by law.

of its Subsidiaries of the proceeds of any of the Loans, including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in
connection with any such investigation or litigation or other proceedings (but
excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by
reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be
indemnified).

11.04 Amendments, Etc. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or

11.06 Assignments and Participations.

(a) A Borrower may not assign any of its rights or
obligations hereunder or under the Notes without the prior consent of all of
the Banks, the Swingline Bank and the Agent.

(b) Any Bank may assign any of its Loans, its Notes or its
Commitment with the prior consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) of the Company and the Agent; provided that (i) without the consent
of the Company or the Agent, any Bank may assign to another Bank all or
(subject to the clauses (iii) and (iv) below) any portion of its Commitment,
Notes or Loans; (ii) no such assignment shall be made to any Person that is not

shall be in a minimum amount of $15,000,000 (or, in the case of an assignment

permitted by the preceding sentence (which notice shall identify the assignee
Bank and the amount of the assigning Bank's Commitment or Loans assigned in
detail

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 86
- 82 -

reasonably satisfactory to the Agent) and upon the effectiveness of any
assignment consented to by the Company and the Agent, the assignee shall have,
to the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise provided such assignment
with the consent of the Company and the Agent), the obligations, rights and
benefits of a Bank hereunder holding the Commitment (or portion thereof) as the
case may be, assigned to it (in addition to the Commitment or Loans, as the
case may be, theretofore held by such assignee) and in the event that an
assignment of a Bank's Commitment (or portions thereof) is made, the assigning
Bank shall, to the extent of such assignment, be released from the Commitment
(or portions thereof) so assigned. Upon each such assignment, the assigning
Bank shall pay the Agent an assignment fee of $2,500.

(c) A Bank may sell or agree to sell to one or more other
Persons a participation in all or any part of its Commitment, Syndicated Loans
or its Money Market Loans held by it or the Syndicated Loans or its Money
Market Loans made or to be made by it, in which event each such participant
shall not, except (in the case of a participant that is a Bank) to the extent
provided by Section 4.07(c) hereof, have any rights or benefits under this
Agreement or any Note (the participant's rights against such Bank in respect of
such participation to be those set forth in the agreement (the "Participation
Agreement") executed by such Bank in favor of the participant). All amounts
payable by the Company to any Bank under Section 5 hereof shall be determined
as if such Bank had not sold or agreed to sell any participations in such Loan
and as if such Bank were funding all of such Loan in the same way that it is
funding the portion of such Loan in which no participations have been sold. In
no event shall a Bank that sells a participation be obligated to the
participant under the Participation Agreement to take or refrain from taking
any action hereunder or under such Bank's Note except that such Bank may agree
in the Participation Agreement that it will not, without the consent of the
participant, agree to (i) the increase in the amount or extension of the term,
or the extension of the time or waiver of any requirement for the reduction or
termination, of such Bank's Commitment, (ii) the extension of any date fixed
for the payment of principal of or interest on the related Loan or any portion
of any fees payable to the participant, (iii) the reduction of any payment of
principal thereof, (iv) the reduction of the rate at which either interest is
payable thereon or (if the participant is entitled to any part thereof)
facility fee is payable hereunder to a level below the rate at which the
participant is entitled to receive interest or facility fee (as the case may
be) in respect of such participation, or (v) except as contemplated by Section
10.09 hereof, release the Company from any of its obligations under the Company
Guarantee.

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 87
- 83 -

(d) A Bank may furnish any information concerning the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Bank from time to time to
assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and participants),
subject, however, to the provisions of Section 11.12 hereof.

(e) In addition to the assignments and participations
permitted by the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.06, any Bank may
assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal
Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating
Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release
the assigning Bank from its obligations hereunder. The provisions of this
Section 11.06(e) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Swingline Loans made by
the Swingline Bank to FFB.

(f) Anything in this Section 11.06 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire (by assignment, participation or
otherwise), and no Bank may assign or participate to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any interest in any Commitment or Loan.

Sections 2.02(b) and 11.06(e) hereof) assign or sell participations in all or
any part of its Swingline Loans or the Swingline Note; provided that, with the
prior consent of the Agent and the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Swingline Bank may assign to another Bank
all of its obligations, rights and benefits in respect of the Swingline Loans

assignee shall have the obligations, rights and benefits of the Swingline Bank
hereunder holding the Swingline Loans and Swingline Note assigned to it.

Sections 5.01, 5.05 and 11.03 hereof, and the obligations of the Banks under
Section 10.05 hereof, shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the
termination of the Commitments.

section headings appearing herein are included solely for convenience of
reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of

banking practices, any non-public information supplied to it by each Borrower

Bank or the Agent be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by
