Item 5. Other Events

On Tuesday, April 5, 1994, Southwestern Bell Corporation
(SBC) announced it has terminated plans to form a cable
partnership with Cox Cable Communications (Cox) in the United
States. SBC said it took the action because of the likely impact
of increasingly stringent government regulation on the cable
industry's cash flow characteristics.

SBC and Cox announced on December 7, 1993 that they had
signed a memorandum of understanding to form a $4.9 billion cable
partnership. Under that memorandum, SBC was to commit
$1.6 billion in capital to the partnership and Cox was to
contribute 21 cable systems. The companies had been negotiating
definitive agreements since the December 7, announcement.

SBC expects to continue its cable partnership with Cox in
the United Kingdom.
