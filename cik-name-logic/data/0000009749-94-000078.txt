FRIDAY, JULY 22, 1994

BANKERS TRUST REPORTS SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME OF $181 MILLION, OR
$2.09 PER SHARE; RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 16%

New York, July 22, 1994 -- Bankers Trust New York Corporation
earned $181 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1994, or $2.09
primary earnings per share. In the second quarter of 1993, the
Corporation earned $251 million, or $2.90 primary earnings per
share. Return on average common equity for the second quarter of
1994 was 16%.

"Trading revenue rebounded from the first quarter, but declined
versus the strong results achieved in last year's second quarter,
as market conditions continued to be difficult during the most
recent three months," said Chairman Charles S. Sanford, Jr. 
"This quarter's return on equity of 16% reflected significant
levels of revenue from our corporate finance and fiduciary and
funds management businesses. Also noteworthy were a continued
improvement in asset quality and a 17% increase in book value per
common share from the second quarter of 1993."

Revenue
Net interest revenue totaled $309 million, up $10 million from
the second quarter of 1993. 

The Corporation views trading revenue and trading-related net
interest revenue in combination, as quantified below (in
millions):
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Trading- 
Related 
Net 
Trading Interest 
Revenue Revenue Total 
<S> <C> <C> <C> 
Second Quarter 1994 $124 $121 $245 

Second Quarter 1993 $405 $122 $527 
</TABLE>

The $282 million decrease in this combined total from the results
achieved in the second quarter of 1993 was primarily attributable
to sharply lower revenue from proprietary trading and positioning
activities, as generally rising interest rates and related
volatility in the United States and European markets made
positioning activities difficult. In addition, these market
conditions contributed to lower revenue during the second quarter
for the Firm's traditional interest rate and currency risk
management products.

On April 15, 1994, a debt exchange took place between the
Brazilian government and its commercial bank creditors, including
the Corporation, thereby completing the long-awaited refinancing
of Brazil's medium- and long-term debt. Subsequent sales of
these Brady bonds and Past-Due Interest bonds by the Corporation
have had a significant positive impact on trading revenue and, to
a lesser extent, net interest revenue for the second quarter of
1994. 

Fiduciary and funds management revenue totaled $187 million for
the second quarter, up $11 million, or 6%, from the same period
last year. The increased revenue reflected higher levels of
global private banking assets under management as well as new
business in cash and securities processing, retirement services
and corporate trust, offset in part by lower performance-based
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

fees from foreign exchange funds managed.

Fees and commissions of $195 million increased by $22 million, or
13%, from the second quarter of 1993. Corporate finance fees of
$115 million increased by $13 million to their second highest
level in nearly five years, led by higher revenue from financial
advisory, private placement and merger and acquisition
activities. These results were partially offset by lower 
leasing syndication and securities underwriting fees. Also
impacting fees and commissions was higher fees from the
structuring of products for employee benefit plans.

Other noninterest revenue totaled $112 million, up $42 million
from the prior year's quarter. This increase was due to several
factors including the impact of an insurance settlement related
to the January 1993 fire at 280 Park Avenue, higher insurance
premium revenue from operations in Chile and a gain from the
revaluation of non-trading foreign currency investments, versus a
loss in the prior year. 

Expenses
Total noninterest expenses of $688 million decreased by $61
million from the second quarter of 1993. Incentive compensation
and employee benefits expense decreased $111 million, or 35%,
almost entirely due to lower bonus expense reflecting the reduced
earnings. Salaries expense increased $22 million, or 13%, from
the second quarter of 1993. The average number of employees
increased by 4% versus the same period, to 13,833.

All other expenses totaled $297 million for the quarter, up $28
million, or 10%, from last year's second quarter. Increases in
the provision for policyholder benefits, service bureaus and
agency personnel fees were offset in part by a decrease in other
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

real estate expense.

Asset Quality
The Corporation recorded $5 million of net charge-offs and no
provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 1994. In
the prior year's quarter, net charge-offs of $51 million and a
provision for credit losses of $23 million were recognized.

Cash basis loans declined by $118 million, or 14%, to $744
million during the second quarter. Total nonperforming assets,
including renegotiated loans, declined for the tenth consecutive
quarter to $1.152 billion. The allowance for credit losses at
June 30, 1994 was $1.340 billion, representing 180% of cash basis
loans.

Six Months Results
For the first six months of 1994, the Corporation's net income
was $345 million, or $3.99 primary earnings per share. For the
six months ended June 30, 1993 the Corporation earned $481
million before cumulative effects of accounting changes, or $5.54
primary earnings per share. The Corporation's return on average
common equity for the first half of 1994 was 15%.

Effects of Accounting Changes
On January 1, 1994, the Corporation adopted FASB Interpretation
No. 39, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts." 
The Interpretation requires that unrealized gains and losses on
swaps, forwards, options and similar contracts be recognized as
assets and liabilities, except where such gains and losses arise
from contracts covered by qualifying master netting agreements. 
It was the Corporation's former policy to record such unrealized
gains and losses on a net basis on the balance sheet. As the
result of this adoption, at June 30, 1994 the Corporation's
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

consolidated total assets and total liabilities each increased by
$14 billion. In the first quarter of 1993, the Corporation
adopted accounting standards for postretirement benefits other
than pensions (SFAS 106) and postemployment benefits (SFAS 112).

Capital
The Corporation estimates that its ratios of Tier 1 Capital and
Total Capital to risk-adjusted assets were approximately 8.50%
and 13.90%, respectively, at June 30, 1994. The Leverage Ratio
was 5.97% at that same date. Total stockholders' equity of
$4.793 billion increased by $48 million from the first quarter of
1994.
