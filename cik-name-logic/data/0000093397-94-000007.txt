INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT

Item 5. Other Events

On April 15, 1994, the Superior Court of the State of California,

County of Los Angeles, entered a new judgment for a total of

$107,609,032.20 in favor of Amoco Chemical Company and Amoco Reinforced

Plastics Company, subsidiaries of Amoco Corporation, against certain

underwriters at Lloyd's of London and various other British and European

insurance carriers, in AMOCO CHEMICAL COMPANY, et al, vs. CERTAIN

UNDERWRITERS AT LLOYD'S OF LONDON, et al. In that case, Amoco alleged

that the defendant insurers wrongfully refused to pay for the defense and

settlement of product liability lawsuits arising from Amoco Reinforced

Plastics Company's manufacture of irrigation and sewer pipe in the

1970's. The new judgment reflects a court-ordered reduction in the

punitive damages award included in the prior judgment from

$376,545,097.64 to $71,488,910.00. The compensatory damages award was

unchanged.

The judgment remains subject to appeal by the defendants and the

reduced punitive damages award is subject to appeal by the plaintiffs.

Accordingly, it is impossible at this time to predict the ultimate

outcome of this case or its impact, if any, on the financial position,

results of operations, and cash flows of Amoco Corporation.
