DLA LIFTS BARD SUSPENSION

MURRAY HILL, NJ - December 28, 1994 - C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE-BCR)
announced today that it has been notified by the Defense Logistics
Agency that it has been reinstated as a federal contractor,
effective immediately. Acting on behalf of all United States
Government departments and agencies, the DLA action makes all Bard
subsidiaries and divisions, except the USCI division, eligible to
bid on and obtain government contracts. The decision required a
finding by DLA that Bard is a responsible contractor and that it is
in the public interest to resume contracting with the Company. It
is anticipated that Bard's re-entry into the government marketplace
will benefit all government agencies which use Bard products and
will benefit from the presence of Bard as a competitor of
government business. Bard was suspended as a contractor in
December, 1993, after entering a plea of guilty to charges arising
out of conduct at its USCI division, headquartered in
Massachusetts.

When notified of the long-awaited action by DLA, Bard's President
and Chief Executive Officer, William Longfield, said, "We are
delighted to be able to resume our relationship with the
government. We sincerely appreciate the painstaking efforts of the
DLA to evaluate our responsibility. I am grateful that the
thousands of Bard employees who are daily demonstrating their
commitment to quality, integrity and service will be able to begin
the new year knowing that this important customer relationship has
been re-established." Mr. Longfield went on to observe that, "We
view this action by the government as an important milestone in our
ongoing effort to improve every aspect of our business and to
fostering public recognition of Bard as a leader in the industry,
in every sense of the word."

In a related development, the DLA issued a notice of proposed
debarment to Bard's USCI division. This action effectively
continues the governmentwide suspension against the USCI division
only. The notice gives USCI 30 days in which to demonstrate that
the substantial remedial programs and other administrative changes
at USCI have removed any basis for concern about USCI's
responsibility as a contractor.

Regarding the status of USCI, Mr. Longfield said, "While we
understand the government's reluctance to reinstate USCI at this
time, we are hopeful that measures we have taken at USCI will be
recognized to warrant resumption of business with USCI. We are
extremely proud of the team now in place at USCI and of their
commitment to the highest standards of business ethics in making
state-of-the-art products. We will continue to work with the DLA
to respond to any residual concerns it may have."

C. R. Bard, Inc. headquartered in Murray Hill, NJ, is a leading
multinational developer, manufacturer and marketer of health care
products.
