'TRADITIONAL' UTILITY RATEMAKING A STEP AWAY FROM 
OBSOLESCENCE, SAYS SDG&E;
COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCES $80 MILLION WRITEDOWN

SAN DIEGO, July 5, 1994 -- An administrative law judge approved late
Friday a precedent-setting ratemaking plan for San Diego Gas & Electric (NYSE:
SDO) which now requires final approval from the California Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC), perhaps as early as August, company officials announced 
today.

The so-called "Performance-Based Rates" plan would align shareholders' and
customers' interests through a revenue-sharing mechanism allowing both groups to
benefit when the company's financial performance results in earnings in excess
of the authorized rate of return plus 1 percent. Company shareholders absorb 
the full impact if earnings fail to meet the authorized rate of return -- 
with no risk whatsoever to customers.

The plan also ties SDG&E's earnings to its ability to meet a number of
performance measures -- including keeping its prices among the lowest in
California among investor-owned utilities.

-- MOST COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE-BASED PLAN IN THE NATION --

"The CPUC's approval of the Administrative Law Judge Mark Wetzell's July 1
recommendation would make SDG&E's performance-based plan the nation's most
comprehensive," said SDG&E President, Chairman and CEO Thomas A. Page.

"This is the next-to-last step in breaking the long-standing practice of
setting rates based on expenses and sheer volume of money invested -- with a
built-in shareholder return -- in facilities built on customers' behalf," Page
said. "As the commission takes action on this proposal, the next chapter is
opened in making California's electric industry more competitive, because 
keeping rates down is the universal goal of the plan."

Under the proposal, SDG&E's earnings will depend on cost control and its
performance in key areas of employee safety, customer satisfaction, system
reliability and rate comparison. These key targets provide SDG&E with the
opportunity to receive up to an additional $19 million in rewards, or as much as
$21 million in penalties. This gives SDG&E tangible incentives to keep its
prices competitive with national and state rates while ensuring its high levels
of service and reliability are maintained or improved.

-- A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT: CONSUMER GROUPS ENDORSED PLAN LAST FALL --

Last fall, a settlement of this plan was reached with two groups
representing customers -- the Public Utilities Commission's Division of 
Ratepayer Advocates and the Federal Executive Agencies, representing the 
U.S. Navy, the company's largest customer.

SDG&E currently charges the lowest overall (system average) rates among
investor-owned utilities in California. In its most recent survey of 1993 
summer residential electric rates, the National Association of Regulatory 
Utility Commissioners placed SDG&E 43rd highest among nearly 200 utilities, 
below the rates charged by Pacific Gas & Electric, based in San Francisco, 
and Southern California Edison, based in Rosemead, California.

Two other PBR mechanisms have already been approved by the PUC. The 
"competitive gas procurement" and "electric generation and dispatch" mechanisms
involve beating market-based benchmarks associated with buying natural gas and
other fuel and purchased power resources -- as well as improving overall 
electric system performance. Significant customer savings have been accrued
since implementation of the two mechanisms on Aug. 1, 1993.

-- SDG&E REPORTS SERIES OF WRITEDOWNS: DIVIDEND NOT AFFECTED -- 

In an unrelated event, the company today announced a series of writedowns
related to the utility and its subsidiaries for the second quarter. The total
amount of the one-time charges is approximately $80 million after-tax, or 67
cents per common share.

"This one-time writedown does not have an impact on SDG&E's current
dividend," said Page.

"The purpose of one of the company's goals of increasing earnings per share
is to allow dividend growth at about the industry average," Page added. The
SDG&E board of directors reviews the dividend on at least an annual basis, which
typically occurs prior to the annual meeting in April.

Wahlco Environmental Systems, Inc., 80-percent owned by SDG&E, will incur
a one-time charge of approximately $56 million after-tax, which will reduce
SDG&E's earnings per share by approximately 47 cents.

This one-time charge consists primarily of a $50 million reduction in
goodwill with the balance representing write-downs of patents and other
intangible assets (based on Wahlco's expectations in light of a depressed air
pollution control market and increased competitive and margin pressures), assets
associated with closed operations that are being reduced to net realizable 
value, costs associated with severance payments, and other costs associated 
with closing facilities.

Phase One Development, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, will incur a 
one-time charge of approximately $11 million after-tax, or 9 cents per SDG&E
common share. The charge relates to the write-down of properties to market
value. Phase One operates business parks in Colorado Springs and in San Diego,
and the Belmont commercial mall in San Diego.

The utility will record a charge of approximately $13 million after-tax, or
11 cents per share. The charge results primarily from writing down non-earning
assets, partly in response to the rapidly changing electric services industry in
California.

SDG&E will announce its second quarter results on July 25 and Wahlco will
announce its second quarter results during the week of Aug. 1, 1994.
