WILMINGTON, Del., July 27 -- DuPont reported net 
income for the second quarter of 1994 of $792 million, or $1.16 
per share, a record high for any quarter, up 53 percent from the 
$516 million, or $.76 per share, earned in the second quarter 
1993.
Earnings per share for the first six months of 1994 
were $2.10, also a record, compared to $1.49 earned in 1993. 
Excluding nonrecurring charges from both periods, second quarter 
1994 net income was up 56 percent, and first half 1994 net 
income was up 48 percent.
"This impressive performance reflects tremendous 
efforts by our employees to improve productivity and grow our 
businesses, while maintaining tight constraints on spending in a 
very competitive market," said chairman Edgar S. Woolard Jr. 
"Strong earnings and spending controls have generated 
$900 million of net cash flow for the first half of this year."
Sales for the second quarter were $10.2 billion, up 
6 percent from prior year. Petroleum segment sales were up 
6 percent on higher oil volumes outside the United States and 
improved U.S. refinery operations. Combined segments other than 
Petroleum were up 7 percent, reflecting 10 percent higher 
volume, partly offset by 3 percent lower selling prices.

Petroleum segment earnings of $201 million were up 
$23 million, or 13 percent. After adjusting 1993 results to 
exclude a nonrecurring after-tax charge of $21 million related 
to the sale of petroleum producing properties, earnings were up 
slightly, despite significantly lower refined product margins 
and lower crude oil prices. Upstream earnings were 
$153 million, up 19 percent, reflecting higher volumes, 
principally outside the United States, and lower operating and 
dryhole costs, partly offset by lower crude oil prices. 
Downstream earnings were $48 million, down 31 percent, on lower 
worldwide refined product margins.
Chemicals segment earnings were $101 million, up 
$10 million, or 11 percent, reflecting 4 percent higher sales 
and lower costs. Sales volume increased 9 percent, while 
selling prices declined 5 percent.
Fibers segment earnings of $177 million were up 
$67 million, or 61 percent, reflecting improvements in nylon, 
aramids, and nonwovens. Segment sales were 13 percent higher. 
Excluding additional sales from the acquisition of ICI's nylon 
business, sales were up 3 percent, reflecting 6 percent higher 
volume, partly offset by 3 percent lower prices.
Polymers segment earnings were $183 million, up 
$76 million, or 71 percent from last year. Packaging, indus- 
trial, and engineering polymers improved, reflecting lower

costs and higher sales. Adjusting for the absence of sales from 
the divested acrylics and polyethylene businesses, segment sales 
increased 13 percent, due to 16 percent higher volume, partly 
offset by 3 percent lower prices.
Diversified Businesses segment earnings totaled 
$208 million, including an after-tax charge of $47 million, or 
$.07 per share, reflecting an update of the estimate of costs 
related to the recall of "Benlate" DF 50 fungicide. This update 
is based on recent trial results, settlement experience, and the 
rate of spending on litigation associated with the recall. 
Excluding this charge, earnings were $255 million, up 
$134 million, or 111 percent from the prior year. This reflects 
higher sales and lower costs in crop protection chemicals, a 
significant turnaround in printing and publishing, and recovery 
of coal earnings which were adversely affected last year by 
strikes. Segment sales were up 10 percent after adjusting for 
prior-year divestiture of the sporting goods business. Higher 
sales volume, up 14 percent, was partly offset by 4 percent 
lower prices.
Net income for the first six months of 1994 was 
$1.4 billion, or $2.10 per share, compared to $1.0 billion, or 
$1.49 per share, in the same period last year. First half sales 
totaled $19.4 billion, up 4 percent.

"Most of our businesses performed very well during the 
current quarter, particularly in the United States and Europe, 
even though selling prices remain under pressure and are below 
last year's levels," said Woolard. "We are continuing our focus 
on profitable growth opportunities and productivity improvement, 
and, absent a slowdown in worldwide economies, we expect 
continued earnings gains compared to last year."
