Item 5. Other Events

As a result of the continuing delinquency in the payment of 1992 and 1993
real estate taxes, the Partnership initiated steps to enforce its rights
and remedies against the owner of the Cypress Run property in Tampa,
Florida, which secures the Partnership's $15,750,000 First Mortgage Bond
("FMB"). These remedies included acceleration of the loan and the drawing
on an irrevocable Letter of Credit in the sum of $350,000, which was issued
on behalf of the owner, as security for the owner's obligations under the
Rental Performance Agreement. In response, the owner of the property filed
a Voluntary Petition for Relief under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code. At this time, the owner continues to conduct its business
and affairs as a Debtor-in-Possession pending a hearing by the Bankruptcy
Court. The filing of the Voluntary Petition operates as a stay against the
enforcement of the foreclosure action. The Partnership intends to petition
the court to, among other things, allow the Partnership to receive net cash
flow from the property as debt service payments during the bankruptcy. 
There is no assurance the court will grant such request. The Cypress Run
Bond represents approximately 11.1% of the Partnership's total assets, and
the owner of the Cypress property owns no other properties which secure the
Partnership's other FMB's.
