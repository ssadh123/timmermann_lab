FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

UNION PLANTERS CORPORATION ANNOUNCES RECORD OPERATING EARNINGS

Memphis, Tennessee -- Union Planters Corporation today announced
net earnings and record first quarter operating earnings of $17.3 million. 
This compares to operating earnings of $13.5 million for the first quarter of 
1993. Last year's first quarter net earnings of $18.5 million included a 
benefit of $5.0 million from the adoption of required accounting changes.
For the first quarter 1994, fully diluted net earnings per common 
share were up 14% to $.65 compared to fully diluted earnings per common share
before accounting changes of $.57 in the first quarter of 1993. Fully diluted 
earnings per common share for the first quarter of 1994 is based on 3.1 
million more shares than the same period in 1993, primarily as a result of
shares issued for acquisitons. The Corporation's return on assets for the 
quarter was 1.05% compared to .90% in 1993, and the return on equity was 15.44%
compared to 14.61%.
As of March 31, 1994, total assets had increased from March 31, 1993 by
approximately $500 million to $6.7 billion, total loans had increased by 
approximately $300 million to $3.1 billion, total deposits had increased by 
approximately $300 million to $5.6 billion, and shareholders' equity exceeded
$500 million for the

first time, ending at $513 million. Shareholders' equity to total assets at 
quarter end was 7.63% compared to 6.88% at March 31, 1993.
For the quarter, net interest income increased to $58.9 million
compared to $57.6 million for the same quarter a year ago and $57.3 million 
for the fourth quarter of 1993. The net interest margin for the quarter was 
4.13% compared to 4.19% in the fourth quarter and 4.42% for the same quarter 
a year ago. Loan demand is increasing and excluding the impact of acquisitions,
total loans increased approximately 9% from the same quarter a year ago and 2%
from the fourth quarter of 1993.
Noninterest income for the quarter was $19.9 million compared to $19.8
million for the same quarter a year ago. Last year's first quarter included 
investment securities gains of $880,000 compared to $100,000 for this year.
Noninterest expenses for the first quarter of 1994 declined to $54.2
million from $54.6 million in the same quarter a year ago. Expense reductions 
more than offset the expense increase from the newly acquired banks.
At quarter end, nonperforming assets were down $21.2 million from
$50.1 million at March 31, 1993. Nonperforming assets represented .93% of 
total loans and foreclosed properties at quarter end compared to 1.82% a year 
ago. The allowance for losses on loans as a percentage of total loans was 
2.82% at March 31, 1994 compared to 2.90% a year ago. The Corporation 
experienced

net loan recoveries in the first quarter of $1.1 million compared to net 
charge-offs of $2.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. The allowance for 
losses on loans increased to $87 million at March 31, 1994 from $80 million a 
year ago. As a result of the increase in the allowance for losses on loans 
and the substantial decrease in nonperforming assets, the Corporation did not 
make a loan loss provision during the quarter.
Last year's earnings have been restated for the acquisitions of Bank of
Goodlettsville in Goodlettsville, Tennessee; Bank of Weiner in Weiner, 
Arkansas; Central State Bank in Lexington, Tennessee; and First State Bank in 
Brownsville, Tennessee, which were accounted for as poolings of interests. This
year's first quarter earnings include the results of Simpson County Bank in 
Franklin, Kentucky; Adairville Banking Company in Adairville, Kentucky; The 
Peoples Bank of Elk Valley in Fayetteville, Tennessee; First Citizens Bank in 
Franklin, Tennessee; Anderson County Bank in Clinton, Tennessee; and First 
National Bank of Shelbyville, Tennessee, which were acquired during the quarter.
Union Planters Corporation is a multi-bank holding company with 39
banks in Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky and Alabama. Union 
Planters National Bank, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, is the 
Corporation's lead bank with $3.4 billion in total assets.
