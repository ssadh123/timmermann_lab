Item 5. Other Events.

Jones Intercable, Inc., a Colorado corporation (the
"Registrant") has entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of May 31,
1994 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") with Bell Canada International Inc.
("BCI") pursuant to which the Registrant has agreed, among other things, to
sell to BCI 7,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of Registrant at a price
per share of $27.50. By virtue of its acquisition of 2,500,000 shares of Class
A Common Stock of Registrant at $22.00 per share in March 1994, BCI is an
approximate 13% shareholder of Registrant as of this date. In addition, BCI
has agreed to purchase for cash 30% of any Class A Common Stock sold by the
Registrant to third parties in the future at a price per share equal to the
price received by the Registrant from such third parties until such time as BCI
has invested an aggregate of $400 million in the Registrant. Upon the closing
of the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, BCI would
hold approximately a 30% equity interest in Registrant. The agreements between
the Registrant and BCI also contemplate that BCI will have certain rights with
respect to the governance of the Registrant, including the right to nominate up
to three directors to the Board of Directors and to jointly nominate, with
Jones International, Ltd., up to three independent directors to the Board. The
Stock Purchase Agreement is filed as an Exhibit to this Form 8-K and is hereby
incorporated herein by reference.

In addition, Jones International, Ltd., a Colorado corporation
("International") which is wholly-owned by Glenn R. Jones, and Glenn R. Jones
personally (collectively, the "Grantors") have entered into a Transaction
Agreement dated as of May 31, 1994 (the "Transaction Agreement"), among
themselves, BCI, and Jones Spacelink, Ltd., a Colorado corporation which is the
parent company of Registrant ("Spacelink") pursuant to which the Grantors have
agreed, among other things, to grant an option to BCI to acquire in the future
the shares of Common Stock of Registrant which represent the controlling
interest in Registrant. The option will be acquired by BCI for a payment of
$19 per share. Except in limited circumstances generally involving the death,
incapacitation or resignation of Mr. Jones, the option will only be exercisable
during the eighth year after closing under the Stock Purchase Agreement. If
exercised, BCI would then hold a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock of
Registrant to enable it to elect seventy-five percent (75%) of the Board of
Directors of Registrant. The Transaction Agreement is filed as an Exhibit to
this Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Definitive agreements have also been reached whereby BCI will
invest in certain affiliates of International. The agreements provide for BCI
to invest $18 million

-2-
<PAGE> 3

in Jones Education Networks, Inc. in return for shares of Class A Common Stock
of such company representing an approximate 15% interest. Jones Education
Networks, Inc. owns approximately 51% of Mind Extension University, Inc., a
Colorado corporation in which the Registrant has an approximate 25% interest.
In addition, BCI will invest $5 million in Jones Lightwave, Ltd. in return for
shares of Class A Common Stock of such company representing an approximate 50%
interest. Jones Lightwave, Ltd. is engaged in the alternative access
telecommunications business. BCI will also invest $7 million in Jones
Entertainment Group, Ltd. which is engaged in the acquisition, production and
distribution of original film and entertainment programming, in exchange for
shares of Class A Common Stock of such company. This will result in BCI owning
an approximate 20% interest in Jones Entertainment Group, Ltd.

The Registrant has also entered into an Exchange Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization and Liquidation (the "Exchange Agreement") with
Spacelink. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Registrant has agreed to
issue 4,100,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of Registrant in exchange for
the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Spacelink and the
assumption of all liabilities of Spacelink. Following the consummation of the
sale of Spacelink's assets, Spacelink would liquidate and distribute the shares
of Class A Common Stock of Registrant received by it in the acquisition and the
shares of Common Stock of Registrant currently owned by it to its shareholders
on a pro rata basis. In addition, International, which is the majority
shareholder of Spacelink, has agreed in the Exchange Agreement to allocate a
portion of the Class A Common Stock received by it upon the liquidation of
Spacelink to the minority shareholders of Spacelink. After giving effect to
this allocation, and assuming the exercise of all outstanding options, each
non-dissenting minority shareholder of Spacelink would receive .09629 shares of
Registrant's Class A Common Stock and .03567 shares of Registrant's Common
Stock for each share of Spacelink stock held on the closing date. The Exchange
Agreement is filed as an Exhibit to this Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated
herein by reference.

The closings of all of the foregoing transactions are expected
to occur simultaneously in late 1994. Closing of the BCI investment in the
Registrant and closing of the reorganization of Registrant and Spacelink are
subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the shareholders
of Registrant, and with respect to the reorganization between Spacelink and
Registrant, the approval of the shareholders of Spacelink and the receipt of a
favorable tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. If such tax ruling is
not received, and that condition to closing of the transaction is not waived,
the reorganization between Registrant and Spacelink would not occur, and
Spacelink would continue to exist as a separate entity. In that event,
Spacelink, rather than International and Mr. Jones, would grant the option to
BCI on

-3-
<PAGE> 4
the Common Stock of Registrant owned by it, in return for an option payment of
$19 per share of Common Stock.

A registration statement covering the 4,100,000 shares of
Class A Common Stock to be issued to Spacelink, and a joint proxy statement of
Registrant and Spacelink will be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. A meeting of the shareholders of the Registrant to approve the
Stock Purchase Agreement and the Exchange Agreement is expected to be held in
late summer of 1994. A meeting of the Spacelink shareholders to approve the
Exchange Agreement will also be held.

Jones Financial Group, Ltd., a subsidiary of International,
will receive a fee of $2 million from Registrant in connection with its
services in arranging and negotiating the transactions between Registrant and
BCI. In addition, Registrant shall pay BCI $600,000 as reimbursement of
certain expenses incurred by it in connection with the transaction. Such fees
shall be payable upon the closing of the transaction wherein BCI makes its
investment in Registrant.

discussing or considering a transaction between the Company and the Purchaser,
or any other matter for which the attendance of such observer would not be in

Board or the independent directors. The Company shall provide such observer
with the same notice of meetings of the Board of Directors as that provided to
directors of the Company.

5.4 Interim Financing. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if the Company believes that prior to the Closing its sources
of funds may be insufficient to meet its projected cash requirements, the
Company will discuss with the Purchaser the potential sources of financing to
fund such projected shortfall. If after such discussions the Company
reasonably believes that equity financing is its preferred alternative, the
Company may sell up to 1,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock,

-38-
<PAGE> 44
provided that prior to any such sale it first offers such shares to the
Purchaser pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) below.

(b) In the event the Company wishes to sell shares pursuant to this
Section 5.4, the Company will deliver a written notice (a "Sale Notice") to the
Purchaser setting forth the number of shares of Class A Common Stock proposed
to be sold (the "Notice Shares"), the proposed purchase price per share (the
"Notice Price") and the other terms and conditions of such sale. Purchaser
shall have the right for ten Business Days from the date of receipt of a Sale
Notice (the "Notice Period") to agree to purchase any or all Notice Shares at
the Notice Price, by delivery of written notice to the Company. If Purchaser
so notifies the Company of its intent to purchase any Notice Shares, the
closing for the purchase and sale of such Notice Shares will take place not
more than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice to the Company.
If Purchaser fails to notify the Company prior to the expiration of the Notice
Period of its intent to purchase all Notice Shares, the Company will have the
right, for a period of 20 Business Days after the expiration of the Notice
Period, to sell any Notice Shares that Purchaser has not purchased or agreed to
purchase to any Person in the open market, and otherwise to any Person that is
not primarily engaged in the cable television or telecommunications business in
the United States, Canada or Mexico, at a price per share not less than 90% of
the Notice Price, provided that if during such period the Company wishes to
sell shares at a price per share less than such amount, the Company will
deliver an amended Sale Notice to the Purchaser setting forth the amended
Notice Price. The provisions of the immediately preceding three sentences
shall apply to any such amended Sale Notice, except that the Notice Period will
be five Business Days.

(c) Any shares of Class A Common Stock sold to the Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 5.4 will be sold pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act and will be subject to the
registration rights to be granted to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.9 of
the Shareholders Agreement.

Re: Financial Services Agreement 

Gentlemen:

This will confirm the understanding and agreement between Jones
Financial Group, Inc., a Colorado corporation ("FinCo") and Jones Intercable,
Inc., a Colorado corporation ("Intercable"), as follows:

1. Intercable hereby engages FinCo on an exclusive basis to render
financial advisory and related services in connection with the direct or
indirect acquisition and disposition of, and investment in, any Core Business
(as defined in the Shareholders Agreement, dated (Closing Date), 1994, among
Intercable, Glenn R. Jones, Jones International, Ltd. (, Jones Spacelink, Ltd.)
and Bell Canada International Inc. (the "Shareholders Agreement")) in the
United States other than acquisitions or dispositions of, or investments in,
cable television systems owned by partnerships managed by Intercable or its
affiliates ("Transactions").

2. FinCo hereby accepts the engagement and, in that connection,
agrees to:

(a) provide advisory services, including general business and
financial analysis, transaction feasibility analysis and pricing and
terms of the proposed Transactions;

(b) assist in negotiations and related strategies with respect to
Transactions;

(c) supervise the conduct of due diligence in respect of the
proposed Transactions;

(d) assist in corporate capital planning, including the
identification of available financing and the negotiation of credit
facilities and strategic partner and/or joint venture relationships;
and

(e) provide such other advisory and investment services in
connection with the Transactions as are mutually agreed upon between
Intercable and FinCo from time to time.
<PAGE> 61
3. (a) As compensation for the services rendered by FinCo
hereunder, Intercable shall pay FinCo a fee equal to 90% of the fees that would
be charged to Intercable by unaffiliated third parties for the same or
comparable services. FinCo shall provide to Intercable at or prior to the time
FinCo commences its services for Intercable with respect to a Transaction such
information as Intercable may reasonably request regarding the fees charged by
third parties for the same or comparable services as those to be performed by
FinCo. The fees payable to FinCo shall be paid at the closing of each
Transaction.

(b) Intercable shall also reimburse FinCo for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred hereunder with respect to services rendered or
to be rendered by it. Out-of-pocket professional expenses shall include, but
not be limited to, reasonable fees and disbursements incurred by FinCo in
connection with the provision of services hereunder, and shall be payable by
Intercable upon receipt of an invoice thereof together with such supporting
documentation as Intercable shall reasonably request.

(c) Intercable shall pay FinCo annually on June 1 of each year a
retainer in the amount of $1,000,000 as an advance against payments due to it
under subparagraphs (b) and (c), above. FinCo acknowledges that it has
received the retainer for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1994.

(d) Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated May 31, 1994
between Intercable and Bell Canada International Inc., Intercable has paid to
FinCo the sum of $2,000,000 for financial advisory services performed by FinCo
in connection with the transaction contemplated thereby. Such fee is in lieu
of the fees otherwise payable to FinCo under paragraphs 3(a), (b) and (c)
hereof, it being agreed that the compensation arrangements provided for in this
Agreement shall not apply to such transaction and are superseded by the terms
of the Stock Purchase Agreement.

4. (a) Intercable shall:

(i) indemnify FinCo and hold it harmless against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities to which FinCo may become subject
arising in any manner out of or in connection with the rendering of
services by FinCo hereunder, unless it is finally judicially
determined that such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arose
primarily out of the gross negligence or bad faith of FinCo; and
<PAGE> 62
(ii) reimburse FinCo immediately for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating, preparing
to defend or defending any lawsuits, claims or other proceedings
arising in any manner out of or in connection with the rendering of
services by FinCo hereunder; provided, however, that in the event a
final judicial determination is made to the effect specified in
subparagraph 4(a)(i), above, FinCo will remit to Intercable any
amounts reimbursed under this paragraph 4(a)(ii). 

Intercable agrees that the indemnification and reimbursement commitment set
forth in this paragraph shall apply whether or not FinCo is a formal party to
any such lawsuits, claims or other proceedings and that such commitments shall
extend, upon the terms set forth in this paragraph, to any controlling person,
director, officer, employee, consultant or agent of FinCo (each an "Indemnified
Person").

(b) Upon receipt by an Indemnified Person of actual notice of a
claim, action or proceeding against such Indemnified Person in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder, such Indemnified Person shall promptly
notify Intercable with respect thereto. Intercable may, and at the request of
an Indemnified Person will, assume the defense of any litigation or proceeding
in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, including the employment
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Finco and the payment of the fees and
expenses of such counsel. In any such litigation or proceeding the defense of
which Intercable shall have so assumed, any Indemnified Person shall have the
right to participate in such litigation or proceeding and to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such Indemnified Person unless (i) Intercable and such Indemnified Person shall
have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the
named parties to any such litigation or proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include Intercable and such Indemnified Person and representation of
both parties by the same counsel would, in the opinion of counsel to such
Indemnified Person, be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between Intercable and such Indemnified Person, provided that in no
event will be Company be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel to more
than one Indemnified Person in connection with any such litigation or
proceeding.

5. This Agreement shall extend from the date hereof through the
earlier of , 2002 or the Option Termination Date (as defined in the
Shareholders Agreement), unless sooner terminated by mutual agreement of the
parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing any payment obligations of Intercable
under paragraph 3 through such termination date and the provisions of
paragraphs 4, 6 and 7 hereof shall survive any expiration or termination of
this Agreement.
<PAGE> 63
6. Except as contemplated by the terms hereof or as required by
applicable law, FinCo shall keep confidential all material nonpublic
information provided to it hereunder by Intercable or any of its affiliates and
shall not disclose such information to any third party, other than such of its
employees and advisors as FinCo reasonably determines to have a need to know.

7. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by a
writing executed by the parties hereto and shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado.

8. In case any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

9. The parties acknowledge that FinCo may perform in the future
financial advisory and related services for third parties.

If the foregoing corrected sets forth the understanding and
agreement between Intercable and FinCo, please so indicate in the space
provided for the purpose below, whereupon this letter shall constitute a
binding agreement as of the date first above written.

THE COMPANY OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE. If Executive's employment shall be
terminated during the Term (i) by death, (ii) by Disability or (iii), subject
to clause (f) below, by the Company other than for Cause, Executive shall be
entitled to the following benefits:

(a) LUMP SUM PAYMENT OF UNPAID BASE SALARY FOR ENTIRE REMAINING
TERM OF AGREEMENT. Within 30 days from the date of termination of Executive's
employment ("Termination Date"), the Company shall, at Executive's option, (i)
continue to pay Executive his Base Salary (including the increases
contemplated by Section 7(b) hereof) until the eighth anniversary of the
Effective Date or (ii) make a lump sum payment to Executive in an amount equal
to the total cumulative Base Salary that would have been payable to Executive
under

4
<PAGE> 68
this Agreement for each of the remaining years in the Term of this Agreement;
provided, however, that, for the purposes of determining the amount of such
lump sum payment, and notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 above, (i)
the Term of this Agreement shall be eight years from the Effective Date; (ii)
for purposes of determining the Increase Percentage for any year in the Term
of this Agreement following the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the Denver Metropolitan
Area shall be deemed to be the average of such increases for the five
calendar years immediately preceding the Termination Date; and, (iii) the
amount of such lump sum payment, as determined above, shall be discounted to
present value based on the interest rate, at the time of determination, of
United States Treasury bonds, notes or bills, as the case may be, having a
remaining maturity equal to the time remaining until the eighth anniversary
of the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive's
employment is terminated by Disability, Executive shall not receive such lump
sum payment, but shall continue to receive his Base Salary (including the
increases contemplated by Section 7(b) hereof) until the eighth anniversary of
the Effective Date.

(b) CONTINUATION OF FRINGE BENEFITS. The Company shall continue
to provide Executive and/or his eligible dependents and beneficiaries with all
Fringe Benefits set forth in Section 4 throughout the remaining unexpired
Term of the Agreement, as if Executive's employment under the Agreement had
not been terminated. If, as the result of termination of Executive's
employment, Executive and/or his otherwise eligible dependents or
beneficiaries shall become ineligible for benefits under any one or more of
the Company's benefit plans, the Company shall continue to provide Executive
and his eligible dependents or beneficiaries with benefits at a level at least
equivalent to the level of benefits to which Executive and his dependents and
beneficiaries were entitled with respect to such plans pursuant to this
Agreement immediately prior to the Termination Date.

(c) EXCISE TAX GROSS-UP. In the event that Executive is terminated
by the Company during the Term other than for Cause (excluding any termination
by the Company due to Disability, termination due to death or termination by
the Executive for any reason), and Executive becomes entitled to the benefit
payments provided under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 7 ("Benefit
Payments"), and if any of the Benefit Payments will be subject to any excise
tax imposed under section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended from time to time ("Code"), or successor sections thereto ("Excise
Tax"), the Company shall pay to

5
<PAGE> 69
Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net
amount retained by Executive as to the Benefit Payments, after deduction of
any Excise Tax on the Benefit Payments and any federal, state and local income
tax and Excise Tax upon the Benefit Payments, shall be equal to the amount of
the Benefit Payments. Such Gross-Up Payment shall be computed in accordance
with Annex I hereto.

(d) NO MITIGATION REQUIRED; NO OTHER ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS UNDER
AGREEMENT. Executive shall not be required in any way to mitigate the amount
of any payment provided for in this Section 7, including, but not limited to,
by seeking other employment, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for
in this Section 7 be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as the
result of employment with another employer after the Termination Date, or
otherwise. Except as set forth in this Section 7, following a termination
governed by this Section 7, Executive shall not be entitled to any other
compensation or benefits set forth in this Agreement, except as may be
separately negotiated by the parties and approved by the Board of Directors of
the Company in writing in conjunction with the termination of Executive's
employment.

(e) TERM. For purposes of this Section 7, the Term of this
Agreement shall be deemed to continue until eight years from the Effective
Date.

(f) TERMINATION OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE. For purposes of this
Agreement, a termination of Executive's employment by the Company shall be
deemed to be a termination other than for Cause only if a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors who are Independent Directors (as defined in
the Shareholders Agreement) or directors nominated by Investor shall have
voted for such termination under circumstances when neither Cause nor a
Disability shall exist.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall the Company be obligated to pay Executive any amount or provide
Executive with any benefits hereunder as a result of, or in connection with,
any termination of employment occurring coincident with or following the
expiration of the Term.

6
<PAGE> 70
(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Executive
shall commit suicide, he shall be entitled to receive only those payments he
would have received had he been terminated for Cause.

8. REFERRAL, CONFIDENTIALITY.

(a) For a period of one year following the termination of
Executive's employment hereunder, other than a termination by the Company
other than for Cause, Executive shall be subject to the obligation to refer
business to the Company set forth in Section 3.3 of the Shareholders
Agreement, provided that such referral obligation shall not last beyond the
Term of this Agreement (or beyond the Option Termination Date, as defined in
the Shareholders Agreement).

(b) Executive acknowledges that as Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company he may receive confidential information regarding the
Company. Executive agrees that for a period of two years following the

ANNEX I

For purposes of determining whether any of the Benefit Payments will
be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) the Benefit
Payments and any other payments or benefits received or to be received by
Executive in connection with a change described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i)(I)
or (II) of the Code ("Change in Control") or the termination of Executive's
employment (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan,
arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a
Change in Control or any person affiliated with the Company or such person)
shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of section
280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning
of section 280G(b)(l) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise
Tax, unless in the written opinion of tax counsel (which opinion shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Executive) selected by the Company's independent
auditors and reasonably acceptable to Executive the Benefit Payments and/or
such other payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute
parachute payments, including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code,
or such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable
compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of section
280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the Base Amount (as defined in section
280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are
otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax; (ii) the amount of the Benefit
Payments which shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to
the lesser of (A) the total amount of the Benefit Payments or (B) the amount of
excess parachute payments within the meaning of section 280G(b)(l) of the Code
(after applying clause (i), above); and (iii) the value of any non-cash
benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the
Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of sections
280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the
Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the
highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which
the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the
highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of Executive's
residence on the Termination Date, net of the maximum reduction in federal
income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local
taxes based on the marginal rate referenced above. In the event that the
Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into
account hereunder at the Termination Date, Executive shall repay to the
Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally
determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction
(plus that portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and
federal, state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being
repaid by Executive to the extent that such repayment results in a reduction in
Excise Tax and/or a federal, state or local income tax deduction) plus interest
on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B)
of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the
amount taken into account hereunder at the time of the termination of
Executive's employment (including by reason of any payment the existence or
amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the
Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess
(plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by Executive with respect to
such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. 
Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in
connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the
existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with respect to the Benefit
Payments.

fiduciary duties, will fill any such vacancy with a person designated by the
Shareholder (or Shareholders in the case of a Joint Nominee) entitled to

determining the presence of a quorum at such meetings.

directly or indirectly, in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
a majority of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Control Block")
to a Person that is not a JI Group Entity (the "Control Purchaser"), unless (i)
the Control Purchaser agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as a JI
Shareholder or (ii) prior to any such sale such Control Purchaser offers to
purchase for cash all (but not less than all) of the shares of Capital Stock,
and other debt or equity securities, issued by the Intercable Group Entities
to, and then held by, the Bell International Group Entities (the "Owned
Securities") at the Buy-Out Price pursuant to the procedures of this Section

for cash all (but not less than all) of the Owned Securities at the Buy-Out
Price.
<PAGE> 95
(c) A Control Purchaser that offers to purchase the Owned
Securities for the Buy-Out Price pursuant to this Section 2.8 will deliver a

purchase from the public any class of Owned Securities, the Buy-Out Price for
such Owned Securities will be such offer price.

(d) If the Control Purchaser and Investor are unable to agree on a
mutually satisfactory Buy-Out Price, the Control Purchaser and the relevant JI
Group Entity will make a public announcement that the Control Purchaser is
negotiating to purchase the Control Block. In such event, the Buy-Out Price
for each class of Owned Securities will be equal to the Market Value of such
class of Owned Securities, calculated pursuant to Section 3.8(h) and (i) and
assuming that the Trigger Date is the tenth trading day immediately after the
day of such public announcement.

(e) After the Market Value of each class of Owned Securities has
been determined, if the Control Purchaser wishes to proceed with the proposed
transaction to purchase the Control Block and the Owned Securities, it will (or
after the eight anniversary of the Closing Date, it may), by written notice to
Investor, irrevocably offer to purchase all of the Owned Securities at the
Buy-Out Price. If Investor fails to deliver a written acceptance notice within
10 Business Days after receipt of such written offer from the Control
Purchaser, Investor will be deemed to have declined an offer from a Control
Purchaser, including for purposes of determining whether an Event Date has
occurred.

(f) The purchase and sale of the Owned Securities will take place
simultaneously with the purchase of the Control Block. The purchase price for
the Owned Securities purchased pursuant to this Section 2.8 will be paid by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to a bank account designated by
the relevant Bell International Group Entity not less than three Business Days
prior to closing.

(g) At any closing hereunder, the relevant Bell International Group
Entity will deliver to the Control Purchaser good and valid title to the Owned
Securities, free and clear of any Lien.

COVENANTS

3.1. Investment Commitment. (a) Investor will purchase for cash
30% of any Class A Shares sold by the Company to unaffiliated third parties
after the date hereof, at a price per share equal to the price per share
received by the Company from such third parties in connection with any such
sales (net of selling commissions and underwriter's discounts), provided that
the obligation of Investor under this Section 3.1 will terminate at such time
(the "Commitment Termination Time") as the aggregate purchase price of all
equity securities, and securities that are convertible or exchangeable into
equity securities (including any Convertible Debentures), purchased by the Bell
International Group Entities from the Company or any Intercable Group Entity
prior to, on or after the date hereof (including any New Securities purchased
pursuant to this Section 3.1) equals $400,000,000. The parties hereto
acknowledge that after taking into account the purchase of 2,500,000 Class A

hereof pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Bell International Group
Entities have purchased from the Company Class A shares having an aggregate
purchase price of ($261,250,000), and that Investors's remaining investment
commitment is ($138,750,000).

(b) In the event the Company proposes to offer and sell any Class A
Shares prior to the termination of the purchase commitment described in
paragraph (a), it will give Investor not less than ten Business Days' written
notice of its intention, describing the material terms of the proposed sale,
including the manner of sale and a range of proposed prices and numbers of
Class A Shares to be sold to unaffiliated third parties and to Investor. The
Company will deliver to Investor copies of all prospectuses and other related
offering and closing documents prepared by the Company and its advisors in
connection with the proposed sale and will keep Investor informed as to
material developments during the offering process. The closing for the
purchase and sale of any Class A Shares purchased by Investor pursuant to this
Section 3.1 will take place on the later to occur of (i) the date on which such
third parties purchase Class A Shares, (ii) the date on which the Purchase
Conditions have been satisfied, or waived by Investor in its sole discretion
(provided that if Investor has not purchased the Class A Shares 40 days after
the third party closing, the Company may sell such shares to a third party) or
(iii) such other time as Investor and the Company agree. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, any Class A Shares purchased by Investor under
this Section 3.1 will be purchased pursuant to the same terms and conditions as
the unaffiliated third parties.
<PAGE> 97
(c) At Investor's request, Investor may purchase for $50,000,000 in
cash a Convertible Debenture, provided that the Company may postpone such
purchase until such time as it wishes to sell any New Securities. For purposes
of this Section 3.1, "Convertible Debenture" means a convertible unsecured
subordinated debenture of the Company having terms and conditions that would be
obtained from the Company by an unaffiliated institutional investor at the time
of such purchase pursuant to a public offering (such terms and conditions to be
mutually agreed by the parties), provided that (i) such debenture will convert
automatically into Class A Shares two years after the date of issuance, unless
earlier converted at the option of the holder and (ii) the indenture relating
to such debenture will contain the consent rights set forth in Section 2.6 and
the termination provisions set forth in Sections 2.7 and 7.1.

3.2. Consultation on Business Strategies. (a) The Company will
regularly advise and consult with Investor as to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, which consultation will include the review of (i)
strategic, operating and financial plans, including plans for acquisitions and
sales of cable television systems (both as they relate to owned and managed
systems), (ii) equity, debt, joint venture and other financing strategies,
(iii) business plans for operations, marketing and technology deployment and
(iv) personnel, compensation and related decisions.

(b) Each year, management of the Company will present to the Board
for approval a business plan that includes the elements described in paragraph
(a) of this Section 3.2.

3.3. Obligation to Refer Business Opportunities. (a) Subject to
the provisions of this Section 3.3, each of Investor, Jones and International
will refer, and will cause each of their Subsidiaries to refer, to the Company
business opportunities in the following lines of business:

(i) any business that is primarily engaged in a Core Business in
the United States of America at such time,

(ii) any business that is primarily engaged in wireline local
communications services (including exchange, access and value-added
services, such as call waiting, call forwarding and similar services)
in geographic markets in the United States where the Company does not
own or operate a cable television or wireline local communications
business at such time, and has a fair market value less than the then
market capitalization (equity and long-term debt) of the Company at
such time, and
<PAGE> 98
(iii) such other businesses as may be agreed in writing by
Investor and Jones from time to time. The parties hereto acknowledge
that the foregoing businesses do not include (x) inter-active or
multi-media services, or programming networks or (y) competitive
access provider services similar to those provided by Jones Lightwave,
Ltd. and its Subsidiaries.

(b) Investor, Jones and International will not, and will cause each
of their Subsidiaries not to, purchase, finance or otherwise participate in the
acquisition of a business described in paragraph (a) of this Section 3.3 (an
"Opportunity") without first complying with the following procedures:

(i) The Person referring the Opportunity (an "Offering Party") will
notify the Company of the Opportunity, and deliver to the Company a
report setting forth in reasonable detail the material terms and
conditions of such Opportunity.

(ii) The Company will then promptly convene a special meeting of
the Board to consider whether the proposed Opportunity is in the best
interests of the Company.

(iii) If the Board determines that the Company should pursue the
Opportunity, the Company will so notify the Offering Party (and each
of Jones and Investor), and thereafter none of the Offering Party, any
Bell International Group Entity (or a Subsidiary thereof) nor any JI
Group Entity will pursue, or participate in, such Opportunity,
provided that the Offering Party will be free to pursue, or
participate in, such Opportunity if (A) the Company is unable to raise
financing in respect of such Opportunity (unless the Offering Party is
a Bell International Group Entity (or a Subsidiary thereof) and
Investor exercised its consent rights under Section 2.6 in respect of
any such proposed financing, in which case the Offering Party may not
pursue or participate in such Opportunity), (B) the Company is unable
to pursue or participate in such Opportunity because a law, rule or
regulation of a Governmental Authority prevents (or materially
restricts) the participation by the Intercable Group in such
Opportunity or (C) the Company otherwise subsequently elects not to
pursue, or participate in, such Opportunity. Nothing in this
subparagraph (iii) will affect the consent rights of Investor in
Section 2.6.
<PAGE> 99
(iv) If the Board fails to approve the pursuit by the Company of an
Opportunity or the Company otherwise elects not to pursue such
Opportunity, the Offering Party will be free to pursue such
Opportunity without any further obligation to the Company, provided
that the Offering Party may not pursue, or participate in, any such
Opportunity if (A) the Offering Party is a Bell International Group
Entity (or a Subsidiary thereof) and Investor exercised its consent
rights under Section 2.6 in respect of such Opportunity or (B) the
Offering Party is a JI Group Entity and a majority of the Jones
Nominees that are not Independent Directors voted against the pursuit
by the Company of such Opportunity.

(c) Each Shareholder agrees to keep confidential (as provided in
Section 3.10) any Opportunities that it receives notice of pursuant to this
Section 3.3. If an Offering Party is permitted to pursue an Opportunity
pursuant to this Section 3.3, Shareholders that are not Affiliates of such
Offering Party, and Subsidiaries of such Shareholders, will not be permitted to
pursue, or participate in, such Opportunity unless they lawfully acquire
knowledge of such Opportunity from sources other than the Offering Party or an
Affiliate of such Offering Party. In the event an Opportunity is offered by a
Bell International Group Entity (or a Subsidiary thereof), and Investor elects
to exercise its consent rights under Section 2.6 in respect of such
Opportunity, the JI Group Entities will be free to pursue such Opportunity.

(d) The Company will use reasonable efforts to keep Investor and
Jones informed as to the geographic markets served by the cable television and
wireline local communications businesses owned or operated by the Intercable
Group Entities.

(e) The provisions of this Section 3.3 will terminate on the Option
Termination Date.

3.4. Supplier Arrangements. The Company will give Investor,
International and their respective Affiliates the first opportunity to supply
services, compatible network equipment and systems to the Company on
competitive terms and conditions which will, at the Company's discretion, be
made pursuant to competitive bidding or other processes. Nothing herein will
adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain services, equipment and
systems on open and competitive terms.

3.5. Programming Services. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary: (a) The JI Group Entities shall have the
right to distribute, on a full-time (or, if requested from time to time by
Jones or International, part-time, to be extended or restored, as applicable,
to full-time upon his or its request), daily basis, programming packaged (as
opposed to brokered) by, created by or created primarily for a JI Group Entity
("Jones Programming") on such number of channels (not to exceed six
<PAGE> 100
at any one time) on the Systems as Jones or International may designate from
time to time (with the Mind Extension University programming to be carried on a
VHF channel (i.e., channel 2 through 12)). The Bell International Group
Entities shall have the right to distribute, on a full-time (or, if requested
from time to time by Investor, part-time to be extended or restored, as
applicable to full time upon Investor's request), daily basis, programming
packaged (as opposed to brokered) by, created by or created primarily for a
Bell International Group Entity ("Investor Programming") on such number of
channels (not to exceed two at any one time) on the Systems as Investor may
designate from time to time.

(b) Prior to exercising its distribution right with respect to any
programming under this Section 3.5, the relevant JI Group Entity or Bell
International Group Entity (each a "Programmer") will present to the Board a
reasonably detailed business plan that, among other things, describes (i) the
general content of such programming, (ii) the marketing strategy for such
programming, including service level (such as basic, tier or a la carte) and
(iii) pricing for such service levels. The Jones Programming and the Investor
Programming shall be carried and priced by the Intercable Group Entities on
such level or levels of services as such programming is intended to be carried
under the business plan for such programming.

(c) Notwithstanding the rights granted pursuant to paragraph (a)
above:

(i) the Intercable Group Entities shall not be required to delete
from any System any programming acquired from any third-party
programmer prior to the expiration of the term of the program carriage
agreement with such third-party programmer in order to carry any
Investor Programming or Jones Programming,

(ii) in the event there is insufficient channel capacity to carry
Jones Programming or Investor Programming, carriage of such Jones
Programming or Investor Programming on a System shall be given
priority over any third party programming not then carried by such
System and over any third party programming then carried by the System
at such time as the initial or then current renewal term, as
applicable, is scheduled to expire, provided that (x) such priority
shall not apply to off-air programming carried by the four major
broadcast networks or mandated by law, or the 20 most widely viewed
third party programs as then carried by the System at the time as
reported by (NAME OF APPLICABLE TRADE PUBLICATION), and (y) in
addition to the foregoing requirements, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to add Jones Programming and Investor
Programming to the Systems whenever opportunities to do so arise,
<PAGE> 101
(iii) in the event there is insufficient channel capacity to carry
both the Jones Programming and Investor Programming, Jones Programming
will be given priority over carriage of Investor Programming,

(iv) Jones, International and Investor, as the case may be, shall
give the Company at least four months' prior notice of any proposed
commencement or termination of use of any channel and

(v) the Bell International Group Entities shall have no rights under
this Section 3.5 to distribute programming that has substantially
similar content as any Jones Programming.

(d) During the Validation Period (as defined herein), the license
fee payable by the Intercable Group Entities for any unit of Jones Programming
(excluding Mind Extension University, Health Care Network, Jones Computer
Network and Product Information Network) or Investor Programming ("New
Programming") shall be such license fee as the Programmer establishes in good
faith based on its reasonable estimate of the market value of such New
Programming. A Programmer shall notify the Company and the Independent
Directors in writing promptly following the end of the Validation Period
whether the Programmer has entered into an agreement providing for (a) the
distribution of such New Programming by a cable television operator or other
distributor of video programming (a "Distributor") having at least 400,000
subscribers ("Validating Distributor") and (b) the payment of a license fee by
such Validating Distributor at a rate equal to or greater than the license fee
payable by the Intercable Group Entities ("Validating Programming Agreement").
If no Validating Programming Agreement has been entered into during the
Validation Period, the Company or any Independent Director may, by written
notice given within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company and the
Independent Directors of the above-referenced notification, require that such
Programmer reduce the license fee payable by the Intercable Group Entities for
such New Programming to the greater of (i) a license agreement approved by the
Independent Directors, (ii) the average license fee charged by the applicable
Programmer to all Distributors for such New Programming and (iii) the Agreed
Rate in effect at such time. For purposes of this Section 3.5, "Agreed Rate"
means, at any time, the rate set forth in the Affiliate Agreement between Mind
Extension University, Inc. and the Company dated December 28, 1993, as amended
as of June 1, 1994. Thereafter, the license fee payable by the Intercable
Group Entities for such New Programming shall be subject to such adjustments as
are similar to adjustments in the license fee permitted by the Validating
Programming Agreement or, if there is no such agreement in effect, by the
programming agreement pursuant to which such New Programming is carried by the
largest Distributor
<PAGE> 102
serving fewer than 400,000 subscribers. A Programmer may elect at any time to
terminate carriage of such unit of New Programming upon not less than ninety
days prior written notice to the Company if it does enter into a Validating
Programming Agreement during the Validation Period. "Validation Period" shall
mean, as to any New Programming, the fifteen (15) month period commencing with
the first month with respect to which a license fee is payable by an Intercable
Group Entity for the right to distribute such New Programming.

(e) The Intercable Group Entities shall carry Jones Programming and
Investor Programming on the Systems for a period of 15 years after the date
hereof (or the expiration date of the applicable programming agreement with the
Company) in accordance with this Section 3.5, provided that if Investor does
not purchase the Optioned Shares pursuant to the Option Agreements, the rights
of the Bell International Group Entities will terminate on the Option
Termination Date.

(f) No JI Group Entity nor any Bell International Group Entity may
sell or assign (other than to an Affiliate) its unused right of distribution to
the Systems pursuant to this Section 3.5, provided that in the event any
Programming is being distributed pursuant to this Section 3.5, such Programming
will continue to have the distribution rights provided herein if the relevant
JI Group Entity sells or assigns (i) any network or networks carried on a
System or any such Programming or (ii) any entity directly or indirectly owning
or controlling such network(s) or Programming. In the event of any such sale
or assignment by a JI Group Entity or a Bell International Group Entity, the
continuing distribution rights of such Programming will count towards the
number of channels permitted to be designated by such JI Group Entity or Bell
International Group Entity pursuant to paragraph (a) above.

(g) Each of Investor and International shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its designees to the Board, subject to their fiduciary duties
under applicable law as advised by counsel, to approve the carriage by the
Intercable Group Entities of the other party's Programming in accordance with
this Section 3.5.

3.6. Transactions with Affiliates. (a) Investor acknowledges that
prior to the date hereof certain services have been provided by the Intercable
Group Entities to the JI Group Entities and by the JI Group Entities to the
Intercable Group Entities. Investor agrees that the services described in the
Affiliate Agreements or the Current SEC Filings (as defined in the Stock
Purchase Agreement) may continue to be provided for a period of eight years
following the date hereof, on terms and conditions consistent with those
described in such Current SEC Filings or as set forth in the Related
Agreements.
<PAGE> 103
(b) Except for transactions described in Section 3.5 or paragraph
(a) of this Section 3.6, or undertaken pursuant to the terms of the Related
Agreements or the Affiliate Agreements, each Shareholder agrees that neither it
nor any of its Affiliates will engage in any transaction, or enter into, amend
in any material respect or renew any agreement, with an Intercable Group Entity
unless the material terms of such transaction are fully and fairly disclosed to
the Board, and approved by a majority of the Unrelated Directors.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement "Unrelated Directors" means:

(i) in the case of a transaction or agreement between an 
Intercable Group Entity and a JI Group Entity, the three Investor 
Nominees and the three Joint Nominees,

(ii) in the case of a transaction or agreement between a BCE 
Group Entity and an Intercable Group Entity, the directors that are
not Investor Nominees, and

(iii) in the case of a transaction or agreement among an 
Intercable Group Entity, a JI Group Entity and a BCE Group Entity, 
the directors that are Independent Directors.

3.7. Information. (a) The Company will permit Investor (or a
representative of Investor) to visit and inspect any of the properties of any
Intercable Group Entity, including the books of account and other records of
such Intercable Group Entity (and make copies thereof and take extracts
therefrom), and to discuss its affairs, finances and accounts with the relevant
officers and, after notice to the Company, its independent public accountants
and counsel, all at such reasonable times and as often as Investor may
reasonably request.

(b) As soon as available and in any event within 45 days after the
close of each quarterly accounting period ending after the date hereof, the
Company will deliver to Investor the consolidated balance sheet of the Company
as of the end of such quarterly period, and the related consolidated statements
of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for such quarterly period and
for the elapsed portion of the fiscal year ended with the last day of such
quarterly period, and in each case setting forth comparative figures for the
related periods in the prior fiscal year, all of which shall be certified by
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles (subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments).
<PAGE> 104
(c) As soon as available and in any event within 90 days after the
close of each fiscal year of the Company, the Company will deliver to Investor
the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such fiscal year
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
cash flows for such fiscal year, in each case setting forth comparative figures
for the preceding fiscal year, and certified by Arthur Andersen & Co., or other
independent certified public accountants of recognized national standing to
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States.

(d) The Company will provide Investor with such assistance as
Investor reasonably requests from officers, employees and auditors of the
Company to enable Investor to account for its investment in the Company in its
financial statements, including assistance in the calculation and presentation
of any adjustments required to reflect generally accepted accounting principles
in Canada.

(e) The Company will furnish to Investor copies of (i) all reports,
registration statements, proxy statements or other filings made by an
Intercable Group Entity with the SEC, promptly after any such filing and (ii)
all reports, notices or other written communications (other than routine
correspondence and responses to routine inquiries) sent to holders of equity or
debt securities of, or lenders to, the Company, promptly after any such
communications are sent.

3.8. Preemptive Rights. (a) The Company hereby grants to Investor
the preemptive right to purchase Investor's Ownership Percentage of any New
Securities which the Company may propose to sell or otherwise issue from time
to time (other than Class A Shares issued pursuant to any Convertible Debt or
Convertible Debentures). The procedures described in this Section 3.8 do not
apply to purchases of Class A Shares by Investor pursuant to Section 3.1.
Investor may exercise its preemptive right with respect to any or all of the
New Securities offered to Investor pursuant to this Section 3.8.

(b) In the event the Company proposes to sell or otherwise issue
any New Securities it shall give Investor not less than 30 days' prior written
notice (a "Rights Notice") of its intention, describing the material terms of
the proposed sale, including the type of New Securities proposed to be issued,
the manner of sale and a range of proposed prices and number of shares
(including over-allotments) or other securities to be sold or issued. If the
New Securities are traded, or proposed to be traded, on a national securities
exchange, the high and low end of such range will be no greater than 110%, or
lower than 90%, of the midpoint. Investor shall have 20 days (10 days in the
case of New Securities to be offered by the Company pursuant to a shelf
registration statement) from the date of receipt of a Rights Notice to agree to
purchase up
<PAGE> 105
to Investor's Ownership Percentage of such New Securities, by delivery of
written notice to the Company. If the Company determines that the price or
number of New Securities to be sold or issued is not within the range specified
in the Rights Notice, or that there have been other material changes to the
transaction described in the Rights Notice, the Company will promptly deliver
an amended Rights Notice to Investor, setting forth the revised ranges for the
price and number of securities to be offered, or any other revised material
terms. Investor will have 10 Business Days after receipt of any such amended
Rights Notice to agree to purchase up to its Investor's Ownership Percentage of
such New Securities, upon the revised terms and conditions set forth in the
amended Rights Notice, by delivery of a written notice to the Company.

(c) In the case of any New Securities sold for cash, the price for
any New Securities purchased by Investor pursuant to this Section 3.8 will be
the proceeds received by the Company in connection with such sale, net of
selling commissions and underwriters discounts. In the case of any issuance of
New Securities for consideration other than cash, including issuances in
connection with an acquisition of a business (a "Special Issue"), the price at
which Investor shall purchase such New Securities shall be the Market Value of
such New Securities, calculated as described in paragraph (h) below where the
applicable "Trigger Date" is the tenth trading day immediately after the public
announcement of the agreement giving rise to the Special Issue (or if there is
no public announcement the date the transaction agreement is executed and
delivered). In the case of a Special Issue, Investor shall have five Business
Days after the determination of the Market Value to determine whether or not to
purchase Investor's Ownership Percentage of such New Securities.

(d) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, any New
Securities purchased by Investor under this Section 3.8 will be purchased
pursuant to the same terms and conditions as such New Securities are issued to
third parties, provided that so long as Investor is using its reasonable
efforts to consummate the closing promptly, Investor may postpone such closing
until such time as the Purchase Conditions have been satisfied or waived by
Investor, provided further that if such Purchase Conditions have not been
satisfied or waived within 90 days after the third party closing, Investor's
rights to purchase such New Securities hereunder will terminate and the Company
will be free to sell such New Securities without regard to Investor's rights
under this Section 3.8.
<PAGE> 106
(e) In the event Investor fails to exercise its preemptive right in
accordance with the terms of this Section 3.8, the Company shall have 120 days
after the latest of (i) 20 days after delivery of a Rights Notice, (ii) 10
Business Days after delivery of an amended Rights Notice, (iii) if applicable,
the expiration of the five Business Day period described in paragraph (c)
above, or (iv), if applicable, 20 days after the expiration of the 90 day
period referred to in Section 3.8(d), to sell, or enter into an agreement to
sell (containing customary conditions), the New Securities proposed to be sold
in the Rights Notice (or the amended Rights Notice), at a price and upon
general terms no more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in
such notice. In the event the Company has not sold, or entered into such an
agreement to sell, such New Securities prior to or within said 120-day period,
the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any such New Securities without
first offering such securities to Investor in the manner provided above.

(f) In the case of Employee Options granted by the Company,
Investor's preemptive rights will be exercisable following each calendar year.
Promptly after December 31 of each calendar year, the Company will deliver to
Investor a list of the Employee Options granted during such calendar year. For
a period of 30 days after receipt of such list, Investor will have the right to
purchase from the Company a number of Class A Shares equal to the product of
(i) the highest level of Investor's Ownership Percentage during the calendar
year in question and (ii) the aggregate number of Class A Shares into which
such Employee Options are exercisable. The purchase price for such purchases
of Class A Shares will be the Market Value of the Class A Shares, calculated as
described in paragraph (h) below where the applicable "Trigger Date" is
December 31 of the calendar year in question.

(g) All sales pursuant to this Section 3.8 shall be made pursuant
to arrangements reasonably determined by the Company in order to ensure
compliance with the Securities Act.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, "Market Value" of a share of
any security means the average of the daily closing prices on the NASDAQ
National Market System (or other principal exchange on which shares of such
security is listed or approved for trading) for the shares of such security for
the 20 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the applicable Trigger
Date. The daily closing price for each such trading day shall be the closing
price, if reported, or, if the closing price is not reported, the average of
the closing "bid" and "asked" prices as reported by NASDAQ (or other principal
exchange). If the daily closing price per share of such New Security is
determined during a period following the declaration of a dividend,
distribution, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction, then
the Market Value shall be properly adjusted to take into account ex-dividend
trading.
<PAGE> 107
(i) In the event that a New Security is not traded on a national
securities exchange, promptly after delivery of a Rights Notice
Investor and the Company shall in good faith negotiate the Market
Value of such New Security. If they are unable to reach agreement
within 10 Business Days, each of Investor and the Company shall
promptly select a nationally recognized independent investment banking
firm to determine the Market Value of such New Security. If 20
Business Days after their selection such firms cannot agree as to such
Market Value, within 10 Business Days they shall mutually select a
third nationally recognized independent investment banking firm which
shall be engaged to make such determination, which Market Value shall
be within the range of values suggested by the two investment banking
firms. Such third investment banking firm shall make such
determination by written notice to Grantor and Purchaser within 20
Business Days of its engagement and its judgment as to all matters
relating to its determination shall be binding upon the parties
hereto. Each party will pay the fees and expenses of the initial
investment banking firm hired by such party. The fees and out-of-
pocket expenses of the third investment banking firm shall be paid
equally by the Company and Investor.

(j) For purposes of this Agreement, "Purchase Conditions" means:

(i) The waiting period (including any extension thereof resulting
from additional inquiries, if any) under the HSR Act applicable to the
purchase by Investor of the subject securities shall have expired or
been earlier terminated.

(ii) All other actions by, in respect of or filings with any
Governmental Authority required to permit the consummation of the
closing shall have been taken or obtained, as the case may be, and
shall be in full force and effect.

(iii) There shall not then be in effect any applicable law, rule or
regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree that has one
or more of the effects described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of the
following paragraph (iv).

(iv) There shall not then be instituted or pending any action or
proceeding before any federal or state court or other Governmental
Authority brought by a Governmental Authority challenging the
consummation of the closing or seeking to (a) prevent Investor from
exercising the Control
<PAGE> 108
Option, (b) require Investor to divest, or otherwise limit Investor's
ability to exercise full rights of ownership over, the shares of
Capital Stock owned by Investor and its Affiliates, the Control Option
or the Optioned Shares or (c) require, after the exercise of the
Control Option, the Intercable Group to divest any material business
or assets or would impose a material limitation on the conduct of
Intercable Group's business.

(v) The Intercable Group Entities shall have received all material
third party consents, if any, required to be obtained in connection
with the closing, in each case in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Investor.

3.9. Registration Rights. The Company grants to Investor and each
other BCE Group Entity that has agreed to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement the registration rights set forth in Exhibit A. If Investor
exercises the Control Option, the Company will grant to the JI Group
Shareholders registration rights on the same terms and conditions as the rights
set forth in Exhibit A.

3.10. Confidentiality. Each party to this Agreement will hold in
confidence and not use, and will use its reasonable efforts to cause its
respective Affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold in confidence
and not use, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process
or by other requirements of law, all documents and information received from
the other parties to this Agreement (and Affiliates of such other parties) in
connection with any information exchange contemplated by this Agreement, except
to the extent that such information can be shown to have been (i) previously
known by such party on a nonconfidential basis, (ii) in the public domain
through no fault of such party or (iii) later lawfully acquired by such party
on a non-confidential basis from sources other than another party to this
Agreement (or an Affiliate of such other party). The obligation of each party
to hold any such information in confidence shall be satisfied if they exercise
the same care with respect to such information as they would take to preserve
the confidentiality of their own similar information.

3.11. Certain Brokerage Fees. The parties hereto acknowledge that
any brokerage or similar fees payable pursuant to the partnership agreements of
the Cable Partnerships will be paid to an Intercable Group Entity. The
provisions of this Section 3.11 will terminate on the Option Termination Date
if Investor does not exercise the Control Option.
<PAGE> 109
3.12. Purchases of Additional Shares of Capital Stock. (a) After
the Closing, the Bell International Group Entities and the JI Group Entities
shall be entitled to purchase additional shares of Capital Stock in the open
market or otherwise, and the Company will not interfere with or otherwise take
action to restrict such purchases, provided that in the event any BCE Group
Entity proposes to take an action that would increase Investor's Ownership
Percentage above 79%, Investor will conduct (or cause another BCE Group Entity
to conduct) (i) a Qualifying Tender Offer or (ii) a Qualifying Merger to
implement such increase.

(b) Prior to or on the tenth anniversary of the Option Termination
Date, "Qualifying Tender Offer" means a tender offer that has the following
elements: (i) the offer is for all of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock
not owned by a BCE Group Entity, (ii) the offer is for cash, (iii) the offeror
has received a written opinion from a nationally recognized investment bank
that such price is fair to the holders of Capital Stock from a financial point
of view, (iv) the offer has a minimum condition that 51% of the outstanding
shares of Capital Stock not owned by a BCE Group Entity shall have been validly
tendered and (v) the offer will provide that it will be extended for ten
Business Days after the offeror has publicly announced that such minimum
condition has been satisfied. After the tenth anniversary of the Option
Termination Date, "Qualifying Tender Offer" means a tender offer for all of the
outstanding shares of Capital Stock not owned by a BCE Group Entity.

(c) Prior to the time that Investor or its Affiliates have
purchased shares of Capital Stock pursuant to a Qualifying Tender Offer,
"Qualifying Merger" means a merger or similar transaction that has been
approved by (i) a majority of the members of a special committee consisting of
all the Independent Directors (which special committee may hire outside
advisors if it so chooses) and (ii) the holders of a majority of the shares of
Capital Stock not beneficially owned by a BCE Group Entity. After Investor or
any of its Affiliates have purchased shares of Capital Stock pursuant to a
Qualifying Tender Offer, "Qualifying Merger" means a merger or similar
transaction.

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that in the event the JI Group
Entities elect not to purchase the Control Option pursuant to Section 7.2(b) of
the Option Agreements, the Company will be given the opportunity to make such
purchase on the same terms and conditions as the JI Group Entities under such
Section 7.2(b).

3.13 Termination of Article III. (a) The provisions set forth in
Section 3.1, 3.3, 3.5, 3.9, 3.11, 3.12 will terminate as provided therein.
<PAGE> 110
(b) The provisions of Sections 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 will
terminate on the Event Date.

(c) The provisions of Section 3.10 will survive any termination of
this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND OFFER PROCEDURES

4.1. Transfer Restrictions. (a) No Bell International Shareholder
and no JI Group Shareholder will Transfer any shares of Capital Stock or New
Securities to an Affiliate of such transferor unless such Affiliate has agreed
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as a Shareholder and has delivered
an executed counterpart of this Agreement to the Company, Jones and Investor,
provided that after the Option Termination Date this Section 4.1 will apply
only to Transfers of shares of Common Stock.

(b) During the Option Period, without the consent of Investor each
of Jones and International will not, and will cause each other JI Group Entity
not to, sell any Class A Shares or Common Shares that are not Optioned Shares
except (i) to other JI Group Entities pursuant to paragraph (a) above, (ii) to
Jones Family Members that have agreed to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement as a JI Shareholder, (iii) pursuant to pledges to financial
institutions to secure bona fide borrowings by such JI Group Entity (provided
that any foreclosure transferee's interest in such shares will be subject to
the provisions of this Agreement), (iv) to BCE Group Entities or (v) pursuant
to the procedures set forth in Section 4.2. Nothing in this paragraph (b) will
be construed as restricting a JI Group Entity from making gifts to charitable
institutions, family members or other Persons.

(c) If Investor does not purchase the Control Option pursuant to
the Option Agreements, between the Option Termination Date and an Event Date no
JI Group Shareholder will Transfer any shares of Common Stock to a Person that
is not a JI Group Entity or a BCE Group Entity unless (i) such Transfer is
pursuant to an underwritten public offering or Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act, (ii) such transferee has agreed to be bound by the terms of
this Agreement as if such transferee was a JI Shareholder and has delivered an
executed counterpart of this Agreement to the Company and Investor or (iii)
such Transfer is pursuant to a pledge to a financial institution to secure bona
fide borrowings by such Person (provided that any foreclosure transferee's
interest in such shares of Common Stock will be subject to the provisions of
this Agreement). In addition to the foregoing, during such period of time the
JI Group Entities may Transfer up to an aggregate of 200,000 Common Shares to
charitable institutions and pursuant to gifts; to the extent any such Transfers
exceed 50,000 individually or 200,000 in the aggregate, such Transfers may only
be made if the charitable institution or donee agrees to be bound by the terms
of this Agreement as a JI Shareholder.

(d) Any attempt by a JI Group Entity or a Bell International Group
Entity to effect a Transfer of shares of Capital Stock (including the Optioned
Shares) not in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Option
Agreements shall be null and void and neither the Company nor any transfer
agent shall give any effect in the Company's stock records to such attempted
Transfer.

4.2. Sales of Class A Shares by Jones. (a) During the Option
Period, the JI Group Entities may sell up to an aggregate of 15,000 Class A
Shares in any single calendar month without any obligation to offer such shares
to Investor.

(b) During the Option Period, if any JI Group Entity wishes to sell
(x) a number of Class A Shares that, when added to the sales of all JI Group
Entities during such calendar month, exceeds 15,000 or (y) any Common Shares
that are not Optioned Shares, such sale shall be made pursuant to the following
procedures:

(i) The relevant JI Group Entity (the "Offeror") shall deliver to
Investor an irrevocable written notice in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B (the "Sale Offer Notice") specifying the number of Class A
Shares or Common Shares offered for sale by such Offeror (the "Offered
Shares") and the average of the closing "bid" and "asked" prices for
Class A Shares or Common Shares, as the case may be, as reported by
the NASDAQ for the Business Day immediately preceding the Business Day
on which the Sale Offer Notice is delivered (the "Offer Price").
During the Offer Period (as defined below), Investor will have the
right to purchase (at its election) 100% or 50% of the Offered Shares
at a price per share equal to the Offer Price by delivery to the
Offeror of a written notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C
(the "Purchase Notice"). For purposes of this Section 4.2, the "Offer
Period" means the period beginning at the time Investor receives the
Sale Offer Notice and ending 24 hours after such time, provided that
the Offer Period will end five Business Days after such time if the
sum of (x) the aggregate proposed purchase price of the Offered Shares
and (y) any other amounts paid by Investor to any JI Group Entity
pursuant to this Section 4.2 during the 30 days immediately preceding
delivery of the Sale Offer Notice, exceeds $10,000,000.

(ii) If Investor fails to deliver a Purchase Notice to the Offeror
on or prior to the expiration of the Offer Period, the Offeror will
have the right, for a period of 30 calendar days after receipt of the
Sale Offer Notice, to sell the Offered Shares in the open market or to
any Person that is not primarily engaged in the cable television or
telecommunications business in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
<PAGE> 112
(iii) If Investor timely delivers a Purchase Notice to the Offeror,
(x) the closing for the purchase and sale of the Offered Shares
covered by such Purchase Notice will take place five Business Days
after the delivery of such Purchase Notice pursuant to the procedures
set forth in Section 4.4, provided that Investor will have 30 days to
close such purchase in cases where the Offer Period is five Business
Days, (y) the Offeror will have the right to sell any remaining
Offered Shares (A) to any person that is not primarily engaged in the
cable television or telecommunications business in the United States,
Canada or Mexico or (B) in the open market and (z) Investor will
purchase in the open market a number of Class A Shares equal to the
number of Offered Shares purchased pursuant to such Purchase Notice,
at a price per share not to exceed the Offer Price to the extent such
Class A Shares are available for purchase at such price during the 60
calendar days after the delivery by Investor of a Purchase Notice.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, without Investor's prior written
consent during the Option Period the JI Group Entities may not sell more than
900,000 Class A Shares in the aggregate during any period of twelve consecutive
calendar months, calculated on a cumulative basis and adjusted for prior sales
of Class A Shares by the JI Group Entities. If the JI Group Entities wish to
sell more than an aggregate of 900,000 Class A Shares in any such twelve month
period for tax, estate planning or other unanticipated bona fide liquidity
needs, the JI Group Entities will have the right to sell such Class A Shares;
Jones and such JI Group Entity will consult with Investor and the Company as to
the proposed plan of distribution and such JI Group Entity shall use its
reasonable best efforts to develop a plan of orderly disposition of such Class
A Shares. Such plan shall take into account any projected offerings by the
Company of Capital Stock during the next 12 month period.

4.3. Purchases of Class A Shares by Bell International Group
Entities. During the Option Period, the Bell International Group Entities may
purchase up to an aggregate of 15,000 Class A Shares in any single calendar
month without any obligation to offer to purchase such Class A Shares from any
other Shareholder. During the Option Period, if any Bell International Group
Entity wishes to purchase a number of Class A Shares that, when added to the
purchases of all Bell International Group Entities during such calendar month,
exceeds 15,000, Investor or the relevant Bell International Group Entity (the
"Purchaser") will first offer to purchase of such Class A Shares from Jones (or
any JI Group Entity designated by Jones) pursuant to the following procedures:
<PAGE> 113
(i) Purchaser shall deliver to Jones an irrevocable written notice
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Purchase Offer Notice")
specifying the number (the "Purchase Number") of Class A Shares that
Purchaser is offering to purchase, and the average of the closing
"bid" and "asked" prices for Class A Shares as reported by NASDAQ for
the Business Day immediately preceding the Business Day on which the
Purchase Offer Notice is delivered (the "Proposed Price"). For a
period of 48 hours after receipt of a Purchase Offer Notice, Jones
(and any JI Group Entity designated by Jones) will have the right to
sell to Purchaser an aggregate number of Class A Shares equal to (but
not less than) the Purchase Number, at a price per share equal to the
Proposed Price, by delivery to Investor of a written notice in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Sale Notice").

(ii) If Jones (or his designee) fails to deliver a Sale Notice to
Purchaser prior to the expiration of the 48 hour time period specified
in paragraph (i), Purchaser will have the right, for a period of 30
calendar days after delivery of the Purchase Offer Notice, to purchase
a number of Class A Shares equal to or less than the Purchase Number.

(iii) If Jones (or his designee) timely delivers a Sale Notice
to Purchaser, (x) the closing for the purchase and sale of the Class A
Shares will take place five Business Days after delivery of such Sale
Notice pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 4.4 and (y)
Purchaser will purchase in the open market a number of Class A Shares
equal to the Purchase Number at a price per share not to exceed the
Proposed Price to the extent such Class A Shares are available for
purchase at such price during the 60 calendar days after the receipt
by Investor of a Sale Notice.

4.4. General Offer Procedures. (a) The delivery of a Purchase
Notice or a Sale Notice will constitute a contract between the relevant Bell
International Group Entity and the relevant JI Group Entity for the purchase
and sale of (i) in the case of a Purchase Notice, the Offered Shares at a price
per share equal to the Offer Price, and (ii) in the case of a Sale Notice, a
number of Class A Shares equal to the Purchase Number at a price per share
equal to the Proposed Price.
<PAGE> 114
(b) So long as Investor is using its reasonable efforts to
consummate a closing under this Article IV promptly, Investor may postpone a
closing pursuant to Section 4.2 (but not Section 4.3) until such time as the
following conditions have been satisfied or waived by Investor:

(i) The waiting period (including any extension thereof resulting
from additional inquiries, if any) under the HSR Act applicable to the
purchase by Investor of the subject securities shall have expired or
been earlier terminated.

(ii) All other actions by, in respect of or filings with the Federal
Communications Commission (or similar federal agency), if any,
required to permit the consummation of the closing shall have been
taken or obtained, as the case may be, and shall be in full force and
effect.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Purchase Conditions have
not been satisfied or waived within 40 days after the delivery of a Purchase
Notice, the relevant Offeror will be free to sell the Offered Shares without
restriction.

(d) The purchase price for any Class A Shares purchased pursuant to
Sections 4.2 or 4.3 will be paid by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to a bank account designated by the relevant JI Group Entity not less
than three Business Days prior to closing, provided that upon the mutual
agreement of Investor and such JI Group Entity all or a portion of the purchase
price may be paid in shares of common stock of BCE Inc. or another BCE Group
Entity.

(e) At any closing hereunder, the relevant JI Group Entity will
deliver to Investor good and valid title to the Class A Shares or other shares
of Capital Stock being sold, free and clear of any Lien.

(f) The parties hereto recognize that the offer periods in Sections
4.2 and 4.3 are short and that written communications will be delivered by
facsimile transmission. Any party delivering a notice pursuant to Sections 4.2
and 4.3 will use reasonable efforts to contact by telephone a representative of
the other party to notify him or her of the content of such notice.

4.5 Termination of Article IV. The provisions of Sections 4.2, 4.3
and 4.4 will terminate on the Option Termination Date and the provisions of
Section 4.1 will terminate as provided therein.

exchangeable into, Common Shares except (i) pursuant to employee options
granted to Glenn R. Jones or (ii) to Investor.

(b) During the Option Period, Investor will have the right to
purchase (or cause to be purchased) an option on any Common Shares, or any
options to purchase Common Shares, owned by any JI Group Entity, on the same

5.2. Consents and Approvals For Exercise of Control Option. (a)
During the Option Period, the Company, Investor and Jones will, and to the

Investor cooperate in obtaining, all consents and approvals of, giving all

with, any Governmental Authority organized within a country where the
Intercable Group conducts business or third party that are necessary in
connection with the exercise by Investor of the Control Option.

(b) During the Option Period, if any Intercable Group Entity renews
an existing Franchise Agreement, or in connection with an acquisition seeks a

reasonable efforts at such time to obtain any consents or approvals that are
required under such Franchise Agreement in connection with the exercise by
Investor of the Control Option.

(c) During the Option Period, the Company will not make, nor allow
any Intercable Group Entity to make, a material acquisition without first (i)
reviewing the likely effect of the exercise of the Control Option on any
Franchise Agreements, contracts or other rights proposed to be acquired in

with a representative of Investor.
<PAGE> 116
(d) During the Option Period, without the prior written consent of
Investor, no Intercable Group Entity will enter into a new credit (or other
financing) agreement or other contract (other than Franchise Agreements)
material to the Intercable Group if such agreement or contract contains a
provision that would, as a result of the exercise by Investor of the Control
Option, (i) require any consent or other action by any Person, (ii) give rise
to an event of default, right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
thereunder or (iii) cause a loss of any material benefit to which an Intercable
Group Entity is entitled.

5.3. Further Assurances. In the event Investor exercises its right
to purchase the Optioned Shares, the Company, Jones, International and Investor
will each execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered all further
documents and instruments and use their reasonable efforts to secure such
consents and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary in
order to consummate the exercise of the Control Option and the purchase of the
Optioned Shares, and to enable Investor to thereafter enjoy all benefits and
rights in respect of the Optioned Shares, provided that this Section 5.3 will
not apply to approvals that Investor and its Affiliates may need from
Governmental Authorities in Canada or in any country in which the Company does
not conduct business.

5.4. No Proxies or Encumbrances on Optioned Shares. Except as
contemplated by this Agreement and the Option Agreements, without the consent

stockholders) or enter into any voting trust or other agreement or arrangement
with respect to the voting of any Optioned Shares, (ii) sell, assign, transfer,
encumber or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to the direct or indirect sale,
assignment, transfer, encumbrance or other disposition of, any Optioned

clauses (i) and (ii). Jones or International will notify Investor promptly
(and provide all details reasonably requested by Investor) if Jones or
International is approached or solicited, directly or indirectly, by any Person
with respect to any of the foregoing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
prevent or restrict Jones, International or any other JI Group Entity from
voting the Optioned Shares in its sole discretion on all matters, except as
otherwise agreed in this Agreement.

5.5. Deemed Exercise. For all purposes of this Agreement, Investor
will be deemed to have exercised the Control Option and purchased the Optioned
Shares if a financial institution acting as agent of Investor exercises the
Control Option and purchases the Optioned Shares pursuant to the terms of the
Option Agreements.
<PAGE> 117
5.6. Trading in Class A Shares. Neither Investor, Jones,
International nor the Company, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, nor
any Persons acting on behalf or at the direction of such Persons, shall

any period during which they know that "Market Value" is being determined
pursuant to the Option Agreements.

5.7. Certain Information. (a) Investor (or any of its successors)
will notify the Company and Jones if any equity interests in Investor become

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

SECTION 2.1. Demand Registration. (a) At any time after the
date hereof, one or more Selling Shareholders may make a written request for
registration under the Securities Act of all or part of the Registrable
Securities owned by such Selling Shareholder (a "Demand Registration"),
provided that the Company shall not be obligated to effect (i) any Demand
Registration covering less than 500,000 shares of Registrable Securities, (ii)
more than one Demand Registration pursuant to the provisions of this Section
2.1 in any nine-month period and (iii) more than six Demand Registrations
during the term of this Exhibit A. Any request for a Demand Registration will
specify the aggregate number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be
sold by the Selling Shareholder and will also specify the intended method of
disposition thereof.

(b) A registration will not count as a Demand Registration
until it has become effective. In addition, if more than 50% of the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered pursuant to this
Section 2.1 are excluded from the offering in accordance with Section 2.3, such
offering will not count as a Demand Registration.

(c) If the offering of such Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Demand Registration is an underwritten offering, the Selling Shareholders
shall select the book-running managing Underwriter and any additional
investment bankers and managing Underwriters to be used in connection with the
offering, provided that such Underwriters and investment bankers must be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

-2-
<PAGE> 129
SECTION 2.2. Piggy-Back Registration. If during the term of this
Agreement, the Company proposes to file a registration statement under the
Securities Act with respect to an offering of any shares of Capital Stock (i)
for the Company's own account (other than a registration statement on Form S-4
or S-8 (or any substitute form that may be adopted by the SEC)) or (ii) for the
account of any of its respective securityholders, then the Company shall give
written notice of such proposed filing to each Selling Shareholder as soon as
practicable (but in no event less than 10 days before the anticipated filing
date), and such notice shall offer each Selling Shareholder the opportunity to
register such number of shares of Registrable Securities as each Selling
Shareholder may request on the same terms and conditions as the proposed
offering (a "Piggy-Back Registration"). A Selling Shareholder will have five
business days after receipt of any such notice to notify the Company as to
whether it wishes to participate in a Piggy-Back Registration and, if so, the
number of Registrable Securities proposed to be included in such offering. The
Company shall use its best efforts to cause the managing Underwriters of a
proposed underwritten offering to permit the Registrable Securities to be
included in a Piggy-Back Registration to be included on the same terms and
conditions as any similar securities of the Company included therein.

SECTION 2.3. Reduction of Offering. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein, if the book-running managing Underwriter of an offering
described in Section 2.1 or Section 2.2 states that, in its good faith judgment
(i) the size of the offering that the Selling Shareholder, the Company and any
other Persons intend to make or (ii) the combination of securities that the
Selling Shareholder, the Company and such other Persons intend to include in
such offering are such that the success of the offering is reasonably likely to
be materially and adversely affected by the inclusion of the Registrable
Securities, then:

(a) if the size of the offering is the basis of such
Underwriter's opinion, the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be
offered for the account of the Selling Shareholders shall be reduced to the
extent necessary to reduce the total amount of securities to be included in
such offering to the amount recommended by such Underwriter, provided that (x)
in the case of a Demand Registration, the amount of Registrable Securities to
be offered for the account of the Selling Shareholders shall be reduced only
after the amount of securities to be offered for the account of the Company and
any other Persons that are not Selling Shareholders has been reduced to zero,
and (y) in the case of a Piggy-Back Registration, if securities are being
offered for the account of Persons other than the Company, then the proportion
by which the aggregate

-3-
<PAGE> 130
amount of such Registrable Securities intended to be offered for the account of
the Selling Shareholders is reduced shall not exceed the proportion by which
the amount of such securities intended to be offered for the account of such
other Persons is reduced; and

(b) if the combination of securities to be offered is the
basis of such Underwriter's opinion, the Registrable Securities to be included
in such offering shall be reduced as described in clause (a) above, except that
in the case of a Piggy-Back Registration, if the actions described in
sub-clause (y) of the proviso in such clause (a) would, in the judgment of the
managing Underwriter, be insufficient to substantially eliminate the adverse
effect that inclusion of the Registrable Securities requested to be included
would have on such offering, such Registrable Securities will be excluded from
such offering.

SECTION 2.4. Registration Expenses. In connection with any
Demand Registration or Piggy-Back Registration, the Company shall pay the
following expenses incurred in connection with such registration: (i) all SEC,
stock exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
registration and filing fees, (ii) fees and expenses of compliance with
securities or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the Registrable
Securities), (iii) printing expenses, (iv) fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the listing of the Registrable Securities on the NASDAQ
National Market System (or, if no shares of Capital Stock are listed for
trading on such system, such other principal exchange or market where shares of
Capital Stock are listed or otherwise admitted for trading), (v) fees and
expenses of counsel and independent certified public accountants for the
Company (including fees and expenses associated with the delivery of special
audits or comfort letters), (vi) the reasonable fees and expenses of any
additional experts retained by the Company in connection with such registration
and (vii) internal expenses of the Company (including salaries and expenses of
officers and employees). The Selling Shareholder shall pay any underwriting
fees, discounts or commissions attributable to the sale of Registrable
Securities.

ARTICLE III

REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

SECTION 3.1. Filings; Information. Whenever the Selling
Shareholder requests that any Registrable Securities be registered pursuant to

-4-
<PAGE> 131
Article II hereof, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to effect the
registration and sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the
requested method of disposition thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable,
and in connection with any such request:

(a) The Company will as expeditiously as possible prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on any form for which the
Company then qualifies and which counsel for the Company shall deem
appropriate and available for the sale of the Registrable Securities to be
registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method of
distribution thereof, and use its reasonable efforts to cause such filed
registration statement to become and remain effective for a period of not
more than six months (or such shorter period which will terminate when all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement have been
sold (but not before the expiration of the period referred to in Section
4(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder, if applicable)) after
the date of the original filing or such other period as is necessary to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act, provided that if the
Company shall furnish to the Selling Shareholder a certificate signed by
the Company's Chairman, President or any Vice-President stating that in his
good faith judgment it would be detrimental or otherwise disadvantageous to
the Company or its shareholders for such a registration statement to be
filed as expeditiously as possible, the Company shall have a period of not
more than 180 days within which to file such registration statement
measured from the date of the Company's receipt of the Selling
Shareholder's request for registration in accordance with Section 2.1.

(b) The Company will, if requested, prior to filing such
registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish to
the Selling Shareholder and each applicable managing Underwriter, if any,
copies thereof, and thereafter furnish to the Selling Shareholder and each
such Underwriter, if any, such number of copies of such registration
statement, amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all
exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) and the
prospectus included in such registration statement (including each
preliminary prospectus) as the Selling Shareholder or each such Underwriter
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of the Registrable
Securities.

(c) After the filing of the registration statement, the
Company will promptly notify the Selling Shareholder of any stop order
issued or,

-5-
<PAGE> 132
to the Company's knowledge, threatened to be issued by the SEC and take all
reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to
remove it if entered.

(d) The Company will use reasonable efforts to register or
otherwise qualify the Registrable Securities for offer and sale under such
other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the United
States as the Selling Shareholder reasonably requests, and to do any and
all other acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to consummate
the requested disposition of the Registrable Securities, provided that the
Company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for
this paragraph (d), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such
jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such
jurisdiction.

(e) The Company will as promptly as practicable notify the
Selling Shareholder, at any time when a prospectus relating to the sale of
the Registrable Securities is required by law to be delivered in connection
with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, or the occurrence of any event
requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus
so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable
Securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and promptly make
available to the Selling Shareholder and to the Underwriters any such
supplement or amendment. The Selling Shareholder agrees that, upon receipt
of any notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind
described in the preceding sentence, the Selling Shareholder will forthwith
discontinue the offer and sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the
registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until receipt
by the Selling Shareholder and the Underwriters of the copies of such
supplemented or amended prospectus. In the event the Company shall give
such notice, the Company shall extend the period during which such
registration statement shall be maintained effective as provided in Section
3.1(a) hereof by the number of days during the period from and including
the date of the giving of such notice to the date when the Company shall
make available to the Selling Shareholder such supplemented or amended
prospectus.

-6-
<PAGE> 133
(f) The Company will enter into customary agreements
(including an underwriting agreement having representations and closing
documents consistent with underwriting agreements heretofore entered into
by the Company) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in
order to expedite or facilitate the sale of such Registrable Securities.

(g) The Company will make available for inspection by the
Selling Shareholder, any Underwriter participating in any disposition
pursuant to such registration statement and any attorney, accountant or
other professional retained by the Selling Shareholder or Underwriter
(collectively, the "Inspectors"), all financial and other records,
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company (collectively,
the "Records") as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise
their due diligence responsibility, and cause the Company's officers,
directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by
any Inspectors in connection with such registration statement. Records
which the Company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which
it notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed by the
Inspectors unless (i) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid
or correct a misstatement or omission in such registration statement or
(ii) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other
order from a court of competent jurisdiction. The Selling Shareholder
agrees that it will, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is
sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, give notice to the Company and
allow the Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action to
prevent disclosure of the Records deemed confidential.

(h) The Company will furnish to the Selling Shareholder and
each Underwriter a signed counterpart, addressed to the Selling Shareholder
or such Underwriter, of (i) an opinion or opinions of counsel to the
Company and (ii) a comfort letter or comfort letters from the Company's
independent public accountants, each in customary form and covering such
matters of the type customarily covered by opinions or comfort letters, as
the case may be, as the Selling Shareholder or the managing Underwriter
reasonably requests.

(i) The Company will otherwise use its reasonable efforts to
comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make
available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an

-7-
<PAGE> 134
earnings statement covering a period of 12 months, beginning within three
months after the effective date of the registration statement, which
earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

(j) The Company will use its reasonable efforts to cause all
such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities exchange or
trading system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then
listed.

The Company may require the Selling Shareholder to furnish in
writing to the Company such information regarding the Selling Shareholder, the
plan of Distribution of the Registrable Securities and other information as the
Company may from time to time reasonably request or as may be legally required
in connection with such registration.

ARTICLE IV

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

SECTION 4.1. Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent permitted by law, the Selling
Shareholder, its officers and directors, and each Person, if any, who controls
the Selling Shareholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration
statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities (as amended or
supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements
thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by (i) any such untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon
information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Selling
Shareholder expressly for use therein or (ii) the Selling Shareholder's failure
to comply with a prospectus delivery requirement imposed on it under applicable
law, if any, including any failure to deliver, after delivery of a preliminary
prospectus, a prospectus containing corrected, modified or amended disclosure
with respect to any material fact. The Company also agrees to indemnify any
Underwriters of the Registrable

-8-
<PAGE> 135
Securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of
the Selling Shareholder provided in this Section 4.1.

SECTION 4.2. Indemnification by the Selling Shareholder. The
Selling Shareholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
officers and directors, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company
within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnify from the Company
to the Selling Shareholder, but only with reference to information relating to
the Selling Shareholder or the plan of distribution furnished in writing by or
on behalf of the Selling Shareholder expressly for use in any registration
statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. The Selling
Shareholder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriters of the
Registrable Securities, their officers and directors and each Person who
controls such Underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the
indemnification of the Company provided in this Section 4.2

SECTION 4.2. Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. In case any
proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted
involving any Person in respect of which indemnify may be sought pursuant to
Section 4.1 or Section 4.2, such Person (the "Indemnified Party") shall
promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnify may be sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") in writing and the Indemnifying Party, upon the request
of the Indemnified Party, shall assume the defense of such proceeding and
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to represent
such Indemnified Party and any others that Indemnifying Party may designate in
such proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the
named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include
both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at
any time for all such Indemnified Parties, and that all such reasonable fees
and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such
separate firm for the Indemnified Parties, such

-9-
<PAGE> 136
firm shall be designated in writing by the Indemnified Parties and shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
prior written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there be a final
judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold
harmless such Indemnified Parties from and against any loss or liability (to
the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Party
shall have requested an Indemnifying Party to reimburse the Indemnified Party
for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the third sentence of this
paragraph, the Indemnifying Party agrees that it shall be liable for any
settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such
settlement is entered into more than 30 business days after receipt by such
Indemnifying Party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such Indemnifying Party
shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Party in accordance with such request
prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any
pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is
or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by
such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
proceeding.

SECTION 4.4. Contribution. (a) If the indemnification provided
for in this Article IV is unavailable to the Indemnified Parties in respect of
any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then each such
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) as between the Company and
the Selling Shareholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other, in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by
the Company and the Selling Shareholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on
the other from the offering of the Registrable Securities, or if such
allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits but also the relative
fault of the Company and the Selling Shareholder on the one hand and of the
Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations and (ii) as between the Company on the one
hand and the Selling Shareholder on the other, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company and of the Selling
Shareholder in connection with

-10-
<PAGE> 137
such statements or omissions, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations.

(b) The relative benefits received by the Company and the
Selling Shareholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be
deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering
(net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses)
received by the Company and the Selling Shareholder bear to the total
underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each
case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the prospectus. The
relative fault of the Company and the Selling Shareholder on the one hand and
of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or the omissions or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Company and the Selling Shareholder or by the
Underwriters. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the
Selling Shareholder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such party, and the parties' relative intend,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.

(c) The Company and the Selling Shareholder agree that it
would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4.4
were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated
as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does
not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a
result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the
immediately proceeding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article IV, no
Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount
by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it
and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of
any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason
of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and
the Selling Shareholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable
Securities were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which
the Selling

-11-
<PAGE> 138
Shareholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribute from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

ARTICLE V

MISCELLANEOUS

5.1. Participation in Underwritten Registrations. No Selling

sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar
rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC ("Rule 144"). Upon the request
of the Selling Shareholder, the Company will deliver to it a written statement
as to whether it has complied with such reporting requirements.

such securities, including a sale pursuant to Rule 144, during the 14 days

5.4. Restrictions on Public Sale by the Company. The Company
agrees, if and to the extent requested by the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in the case of an underwritten offering, not to effect any public

accordance with a Demand Registration or a Piggy-Back Registration, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities,
during the 14 days prior to, and during the 90-day period beginning on, the
effective date of any registration statement (except as part of such
registration as permitted by Article II) or the commencement of a public
distribution of Registrable Securities.

5.5. Successors and Assigns. In addition to the assignment
rights granted pursuant to Section 7.2, the Selling Shareholders may transfer
the rights and obligations under this Exhibit A to an unaffiliated third party
that has not issued debt or equity interests to, nor invested in or lent money
to, Persons primarily engaged in the cable television, telecommunications or
educational programming businesses other than the Company or any of its

provision of such services and equipment upon the terms and conditions
hereafter contained.

so as if the same were obligations of BCI.

2. ANNUAL FEE

In consideration for BCI providing Jones with access to the expert

of three (3) man-years on an annual basis, BCI shall be entitled to
and Jones agrees and undertakes to pay to BCI, an annual fee of

The waiver, express or implied, by either party hereto of any right
hereunder or of any failure to perform or breach hereof by the other party
hereto shall not constitute or be deemed as a waiver of any other right
hereunder or of any failure to perform or breach hereof by such other
party, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature thereto.

8. NO PARTNERSHIP

Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute either party as partner, agent
or representative of the other. Neither BCI nor any Affiliate of BCI

Colorado, but the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may keep and maintain
offices wherever the business of the corporation may require.

ARTICLE II
MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

(1) Time and Place: Any meeting of the shareholders may be held at
such time and such place, within or without the State of Colorado, as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors or as shall be specified in the notice of the
meeting or in the waiver of notice thereof.

(2) Annual Meeting: The Annual meeting of the shareholders shall
be held on the last Friday in October of each year or at such other dates and
times as the Board of Directors may determine.

(3) Special Meetings: Special meetings of the shareholders, for
any purpose or purposes, may be called by the Chief Executive Officer,
President, the Board of Directors, or the holders of not less than one-tenth of
all of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting (regardless of the number of
votes such shares are entitled to cast at such meeting).

(4) Record Date: For the purpose of determining shareholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any
adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in
order to make a determination of shareholders for any proper purpose, the Board
of Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such
determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than fifty
days and, in the case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten days
prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination
of shareholders, is to be taken.
<PAGE> 152
(5) Voting List: After fixing a record date for a shareholders
meeting, the Secretary of the corporation shall make or cause to be made a
complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order, with the address and number of shares held by each
shareholder. Said list shall be kept on file at the principal office of the
corporation beginning the earlier of ten days before the meeting date or two
business days after notice of the meeting is given, shall be produced and kept
open at the meeting and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at
such principal office or during the course of the meeting.

(6) Notices: Written or printed notice stating the place, day and
hour of the meeting and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than ten nor more
than fifty days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail,
by or at the direction of the President, the Secretary, or the officer or
persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at
such meeting, except that if it is proposed that the authorized shares of the
corporation be increased, at least thirty days' notice shall be given. If
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the shareholder at his
address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the corporation.

(7) Quorum: Except as otherwise provided by law, a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group constitutes a
quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. If, however, a quorum
shall not be present or represented, the shareholders present in person or by
proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until the requisite number of shares to constitute
a quorum shall be present. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is
represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at
the meeting of which notice originally was given. The shareholders present or
represented at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave
less than a quorum.

(8) Voting: (a) A shareholder may vote either in person or by
proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his duly authorized
attorney-in-fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the
corporation before or at the time of the meeting. Voting shall be oral, except
as otherwise provided by law, but shall be by written ballot if such written
vote is demanded by any shareholder present

2
<PAGE> 153
in person or by proxy and entitled to vote. Except as otherwise provided by
law, or the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or these bylaws, action on a

action exceed the votes cast within the group opposing the action.

holders of shares of Class A Common Stock, $.01 par value, shall be entitled to
vote as separate classes on any plan of merger or plan of consolidation of the
corporation, on any proposal to liquidate the corporation, on any proposal to
sell all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation not in the
ordinary course of business, on any proposed amendment to the Articles of
Incorporation affecting the relative rights of that class of stock, and on all
matters specified in the Colorado Corporation Code as requiring a separate
class vote.

(9) Waiver: Attendance of a shareholder of the corporation, either
in person or by proxy, at any meeting, either annual or special, shall
constitute waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a shareholder attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. A written
waiver of notice or manner of calling any such meeting signed by a shareholder
or shareholders entitled to such notice, whether before, at or after the time
stated therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. The
signatures of the shareholders in person or by proxy subscribed to the minutes
of any meeting shall be deemed to be a written waiver of notice hereinabove
provided for.

(10) Action Without Meeting: Any action which is required to or
which may be taken at a meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a
meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject
matter thereof.

ARTICLE III
DIRECTORS

(1) Number: The number of Directors of this corporation shall be
thirteen; pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation, the holders of shares of
Common Stock, $.01 par value, will be entitled to elect nine Directors and the
holders of shares of Class A Common Stock, $.01 par value, will be entitled to
elect four Directors. In the event the number of Directors is decreased
(whether pursuant to an

3
<PAGE> 154
amendment to these bylaws or otherwise), such decrease will not change the term
of any Director then in office.

(2) Election: The Board of Directors shall be elected at the
annual meeting of the shareholders or at a special meeting called for that
purpose.

(3) Term: Each Director shall be elected to hold office until the

(4) Removal and Resignation: Any Director may be removed at any
time, with or without cause, if the number of votes cast in favor of removal
exceeds the number of votes cast against removal at a meeting expressly called
for that purpose. Only the shareholders of the voting group that elected the
Director may participate in the vote to remove the Director. Any Director may
resign at any time by giving written notice to the President or to the
Secretary, and acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective.

(5) Vacancies: Any vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors and
any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the size of the Board
of Directors shall be filled by the remaining directors though less than a
quorum of the Board of Directors, unless the remaining directors elect to call
a special meeting of the shareholders for the purpose of filling such vacancy.
If the vacancy is to be filled by directors, it shall be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors elected by the same voting
group remaining in office or if the vacancy is to be filled by the
shareholders, only the holders of shares of that voting group shall be entitled
to vote to fill the vacancy. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold
office during the unexpired term of his predecessor in office. A director
elected to fill a position resulting from an increase in the Board of Directors
shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his
successor shall have been elected and qualified.

may thereafter be held without further notice. Special meetings of the Board
of Directors may be called by the Chief Executive Officer, President or any two

4
<PAGE> 155
of Directors shall be given the opportunity to participate by telephone.

(7) Notices: Two days' notice of special meetings shall be given
to each member of the Board of Directors by the Secretary, the President or the
members of the Board calling any meeting thereof. Any such notice shall state
the time and place of the special meeting and shall include a description of
the general nature of the business to be transacted at such special meeting and
no other business may be transacted at such special meeting.

Notices will be sent to each Director by (i) hand delivery, (ii)
express mail (or an overnight courier service such as Federal Express, Airborne
or DHL) addressed to each Director at the residence or usual place of business
of such Director as such may appear on the books of the corporation or (iii)
facsimile transmission to a facsimile machine at the residence or usual place
of business of any Director. Notice by hand delivery will be deemed to be given
when such notice is delivered to the Director, by express mail (or overnight
courier service) on the business day immediately following the day on which
such notice was deposited in the mails (or given to the courier) and by
facsimile when transmitted.

(8) Quorum: A majority of the number of directors fixed by these
Bylaws shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act
of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is
present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as otherwise
specifically required by law. If less than such majority is present, the
director or directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without
further notice.

(9) Waiver: Attendance of a Director at a meeting shall constitute
a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a Director attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because
the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. A written waiver of notice or
manner of calling any such meeting signed by the Director or Directors entitled
to such notice, whether before, at or after the time stated therein, shall be
equivalent to the giving of such notice. The signatures of the Directors
subscribed to the minutes of any meeting shall constitute such a written waiver
of notice.

(10) Attendance by Telephone: Any director shall be deemed present
at a meeting of directors, and will be counted for quorum and voting purposes,
if that director is present by telephone, if he can hear the other directors
and

5
<PAGE> 156
if he can be heard by the other directors, throughout the meeting.

(11) Action Without Meeting: Any action which is required to or
which may be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without
a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by all of the Directors.

(12) Committees: The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed
by a majority of the whole Board, designate one or more committees, each
committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The
Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of
the committee. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of
the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and
authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and
affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be
affixed to all papers which may require it, provided that no such committee
shall have the power or authority to (i) authorize distributions, (ii) approve

requires to be approved by shareholders, (iii) fill vacancies on the board of
directors or on any of its committees, (iv) amend articles of incorporation,

board of directors may authorize a committee or an officer to take the actions
described in this clause (viii) within limits specifically prescribed by the
Board. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the
same to the Board of Directors.

No action taken by any such committee shall be valid unless taken at
a regular meeting or a special meeting for which adequate notice has been duly
given as described in Section (7) above, or waived by the members of such
committee. Any such notice for a special meeting shall include a description
of the general nature of the business to be transacted at such special meeting
and no other business may be transacted at such meeting. Any committee member
unable to participate in person at any meeting shall be given the opportunity
to participate by telephone.

6
<PAGE> 157
Each committee may determine its manner of acting and fix the time
and place of its meetings, unless the Board shall otherwise provide. A
majority of the members of each committee shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business by such committee, and the act of a majority of the
members of each committee present at a meeting at which a quorum shall be
present shall be the act of such committee.

certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or
certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost,

authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of
Directors, the Secretary or the transfer agent may, in his or its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificate of his legal

Dear Sirs:

I am Vice President/General Counsel of Jones Intercable, Inc., a
Colorado corporation (the "Company"), and have served as counsel for the
Company in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Stock
Purchase Agreement dated as of April __, 1994 (the "Agreement") between the
Company and Bell Canada International Inc., a corporation incorporated under
the Canada Business Corporations Act (the "Purchaser"). Unless otherwise
defined herein, terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in the
Agreement.

I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to my satisfaction, of the Agreement, the Spacelink Agreement, the
Related Agreements, the certificate of incorporation, by-laws and resolutions
of the Board of Directors of the Company and such other documents, corporate
records, certificates of public authorities and other documents and instruments
as I have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering the
opinions hereinafter expressed. In my examination, I have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as certified or photostatic
copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents. As to various
questions of fact material to the opinions hereinafter expressed, I have relied
upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the
Agreement, and certificates, representations and statements of officers of the
Company and its affiliates and of public officials. I have also assumed that
the representations and warranties of the Purchaser in the Agreement are true
and correct.
<PAGE> 164
On the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of Colorado and has all corporate powers
and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be
so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the
Agreement, the Spacelink Agreement and the Related Agreements, are within the
Company's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company. Each of the Agreement, the
Spacelink Agreement and the Related Agreements has been duly executed and
delivered by, and constitutes the valid and binding agreement of, the Company.

3. Except as listed on Schedule 3.3 of the Agreement, the
execution, delivery and performance by Company of the Agreement, the Spacelink
Agreement and the Related Agreements require no action of any Intercable Group
Entity by or in respect of, or filing by any Intercable Group Entity with, any
Governmental Authority organized within the United States of America, other
than any such action or filing as to which the failure to make or obtain would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

4. Except as listed on Schedule 3.4 of the Agreement, the
execution, delivery, and performance by the Company of the Agreement, the
Spacelink Agreement and the Related Agreements do not (i) violate (x) the
articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or (y) the articles of
incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement or other organizational document
(as applicable) of any other Intercable Group Entity, (ii) violate any
applicable law, rule, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree, (iii)
require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default
under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any right or obligation of any Intercable Group Entity under, or cause a
loss of any benefit to which such Intercable Group Entity is entitled under,
any agreement or other instrument binding upon any Intercable Group Entity or
any Franchise Agreement, license,

2
<PAGE> 165
permit or other similar authorization held by any Intercable Group Entity or
(iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of any
Intercable Group Entity, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), to
the extent that any such violation, failure to obtain any such consent or other
action, default, right, loss or Lien would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5. Schedule A hereto accurately states as of the date hereof the
authorized capitalization of the Company and the number of shares of each class
of Capital Stock issued and outstanding, or reserved for issuance. All
outstanding shares of Capital Stock (including the Spacelink Shares) have been
duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and have been
offered, issued, sold and delivered by the Company in compliance with
applicable federal and state securities laws. The Shares have been duly
authorized and, when the Purchase Price is paid to the Company as contemplated
by the Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. At
the Closing, the Company will transfer and deliver to Purchaser valid title to
the Shares, free and clear of any Lien.

6. Each Subsidiary identified as a corporation on Schedule 3.6 to
the Agreement is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Each Subsidiary identified as a
partnership on Schedule 3.6 to the Agreement is a partnership duly organized
and validly existing as a partnership under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. Each Subsidiary has all corporate or partnership powers, as the
case may be, and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents
and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or partnership and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for
those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

7. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.13 to the Agreement or the
Current SEC Filings, to my knowledge, there are no claims, action, suits,
proceeding or investigations pending by or against or threatened against any
Intercable Group Entity or any of their respective businesses, properties
assets or any of the capital stock of any Intercable Group Entity at law or in
equity, before or by any Governmental Authority, which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
or which in any manner challenges or

3
<PAGE> 166
seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions or the exercise by the Purchaser of the Control Option.

8. The (describe proxy/registration statement) (the
"Proxy/Registration Statement") (except for financial statements and schedules
included therein as to which I do not express any opinion) complies as to form
in all material respects with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

9. Each document incorporated by reference in the
Proxy/Registration Statement (except for financial statements and schedules
included therein as to which I do not express any opinion) complied when so
filed as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act.

10. The Company has taken all action required by law, its articles
of incorporation and its by-laws or otherwise to (i) approve the Intercable
Proposals, (ii) approve and adopt the by-laws attached as Exhibit F to the
Agreement and (iii) increase the number of members of the Board of Directors of
the Company to 13. Schedule B hereto lists the persons that have been duly
designated to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company until the next
annual meeting of Shareholders.

I am a member of the Bar of the State of Colorado. I express no
opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than Colorado or the federal
law of the United States.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
CONCERNING SPACELINK

The Company represents and warrants to the Purchaser:

1. Corporate Existence and Power. At the time the Spacelink

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and was in good standing in each jurisdiction
where such qualification was necessary, except for those jurisdictions where
failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
heretofore delivered to the Purchaser true and complete copies of the articles
of incorporation and bylaws as in effect at the time the Spacelink Transaction
was consummated.

2. SECONDMENT SERVICES

2.1. BCI shall have the right to second an agreed number of
qualified personnel of BCI or any Affiliate thereof, at
appropriate levels of responsibility into various business
disciplines of Jones (collectively, the "Secondment
Services"). More particularly, without restricting the
generality of the foregoing, BCI shall have the right to
second persons for up to 10 positions. Such positions shall 
be mutually agreed from time to time by BCI and Jones and
shall initially include the positions described in Schedule A 
attached hereto;

<PAGE> 181
2.2. Subject to the terms and conditions of Clause 2.1, the parties
acknowledge and agree that:

2.2.1 BCI and Jones shall collaborate on the purpose, scope
and expected duration of the secondment of personnel
and the identity of the employees to be seconded and
BCI shall provide such information regarding the
Employment Costs and terms and conditions of
employment relating to such employees as Jones may
reasonably require;

2.2.2 One (1) of the employees to be seconded to Jones will
interface with Jones Financial Group, Inc. to
identify and pursue investment opportunities for
Jones;

2.2.3 Each seconded employee shall remain an employee of
BCI or any Affiliate thereof, as the case may be, and
notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement,
nothing herein shall make any such employee an
employee of Jones provided, however, that each
seconded employee shall be managed by Jones, shall
perform such duties and provide such services at
such times and at such places as Jones may from time
to time reasonably require, shall carry out such
reasonable directions as may be given to him or her
from time to time by Jones and shall act in
accordance with and subject to the reasonable
instructions of Jones;

2.2.4 Subject to the terms and conditions of Clause 2.3 of
this Agreement, BCI shall itself, or, as the case may
be, shall procure, that any Affiliate of BCI shall,
in relation to each seconded employee, pay such
employee's Employment Costs;

2.2.5 Jones shall take the same degree of care in respect 
of such seconded employee as if he or she were an
employee of Jones and, in any event, no greater than
required by applicable laws of the United States of 
America;

2.2.6 BCI shall have the right upon reasonable notice to 
inspect during normal business hours the working 
environment of a seconded employee;

2.2.7 BCI or the relevant Affiliate of BCI shall retain the
absolute right to discipline and dismiss any seconded
employee and Jones shall not and shall not purport to 
exercise any such right, provided that at any time
Jones may require BCI to procure that any seconded
employee cease to provide services to Jones and
leave any premises owned or occupied by Jones if
Jones in its reasonable discretion believes that the
seconded employee has committed any act or omission
which would entitle Jones to dismiss such employee
had he or she been employed by Jones on the terms 
and conditions under which he or she is employed by
BCI or a BCI Affiliate, or if Jones in its reasonable
discretion believes that such employee has conducted
himself or herself in a manner which is contrary to
or otherwise not in the best interest of Jones;

<PAGE> 182
2.2.8 If Jones requires that any seconded employee cease 
providing services to Jones during the duration of 
secondment in accordance with Clause 2.2.7 of this 
Agreement, or if any such employee is unable due to 
illness, accident or other incapacity to perform his
or her duties, BCI shall use all reasonable
endeavours to provide a substitute employee, but
shall be under no obligation to do so. Jones shall
provide BCI with all reasonable assistance as is
necessary to enable the disciplinary process of BCI
or the relevant Affiliate of BCI to operate in
respect of any seconded employee.

2.2.9 To the extent that such employees are not covered by 
an equivalent policy of BCI or the relevant Affiliate
of BCI (and that the cost thereof is not included in 
Employment Costs of such employee), Jones shall
ensure that all seconded employees are insured in
the same manner as its own employees in comparable
positions against all insurable risks (other than
insurance which, by its terms or by law, is not
available to persons who are not employees) arising
while any seconded employee is attending at the 
premises or other facilities of Jones pursuant to 
this Agreement;

2.3. Jones shall reimburse BCI or any Affiliate thereof, as the
case may be, within 30 days of the date of BCI's or its
Affiliate's invoice, all Employment Costs in respect of each
seconded employee appointed in accordance with Clause 2 of
this Agreement, calculated and apportioned on a daily basis.
Such invoices shall be submitted to Jones on a monthly basis;

2.4. BCI shall use its best endeavours to notify Jones, not less
than 30 days prior to the implementation thereof, of any
change in the Employment Costs of any seconded employee (and
the effective date thereof) during the period of secondment
and thereafter the amounts payable by Jones under Clause 2.3
shall be adjusted accordingly. Jones shall have the right to
require BCI to procure that any seconded employee cease to 
provide services to Jones in the event that the Employment
Costs of such employee have substantially increased beyond
those originally contemplated under Clause 2.2.1. BCI shall
use all reasonable endeavours to provide a substitute
employee, but shall not be under any obligation to do so;

2.5. Each party will ensure that it keeps accurate records of the
amounts charged and paid (including the method of calculation)
pursuant to Clauses 2.3 and 2.4 and, at the other's expense,
will allow the other all reasonable access thereto.

2.6. Jones may within 60 days of the end of each full year of this
Agreement or, if earlier, within 60 days of termination of
this Agreement require that the Employment Costs charged to
Jones in relation to employees seconded pursuant to Clause 2.1
during the preceding year be subject to audit in order to
establish whether the Employment Costs of such seconded
employees have been

<PAGE> 183
calculated correctly. Such audit shall be carried out by the
auditors of BCI (the "Auditors") in accordance with Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles. The parties shall
give the Auditors all reasonable assistance. If the Auditors
shall reasonably determine that the amounts charged to Jones
exceeded by five percent (5%) the actual relevant Employment
Costs, then BCI shall, or shall procure that the relevant 
Affiliate of BCI shall, repay any excess to Jones. Where the
Auditors determine that the amounts so charged exceeded such
Employment Costs by five percent (5%), the reasonable
professional costs of the Auditors shall be borne by BCI, 
failing which the professional costs of the Auditors shall be
borne by Jones.

3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Any Intellectual Property developed or created by any employee of BCI or
any Affiliate thereof, while on secondment to Jones which directly relates
to or concerns the business of Jones from time to time, shall confer on
Jones the same rights in respect thereof as would have accrued to Jones
had the relevant employee been in the employment of Jones at the relevant
time. BCI shall use its reasonable efforts to procure that the said
employee shall at the written request and expense of Jones do all things
which, in the reasonable opinion of Jones, may be necessary or desirable
to vest all such Intellectual Property in favour of Jones. Any other
Intellectual Property developed or created by an employee shall belong at
all times to that person's employer.

4. LIABILITY CLAUSE

4.1. BCI shall ensure that and shall procure that BCI's
Affiliate(s) ensure that the Secondment Services shall be
provided by BCI or any Affiliate thereof, as the case may be,
or any such seconded employee with reasonable care and skill
and shall be of a standard normally adopted and practiced by
BCI or the relevant Affiliate of BCI or expected of such
employees with respect to its own business and affairs,
provided that, (i) BCI and the relevant Affiliates of BCI
shall not be liable on account of anything done by them or
any seconded employee in good faith in accordance with or
pursuant to the direction of Jones, and (ii) neither BCI nor
any Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to Jones for any error
of judgment or for any loss suffered by Jones in connection
with the subject matter of this Agreement (howsoever any such
loss may have occurred) unless such loss arises from gross
negligence, bad faith, fraud, intentional misconduct or
willful default in the performance or non-performance by BCI
or any Affiliate thereof or any seconded employee of its
obligations or duties under or pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

4.2. Each party shall be liable hereunder only for direct damages
incurred by the other and in no event shall either party be
liable for any consequential or indirect damages.
<PAGE> 184
5. ASSIGNMENT

Each party hereto agrees not to assign or dispose of any of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement without the prior consent of the other

hereunder to an Eligible Assignee upon mere written notice to Jones.

6. WAIVER

The waiver, express or implied, by either party hereto of any right
hereunder or of any failure to perform or breach hereof by the other party
hereto shall not constitute or be deemed as a waiver of any other right
hereunder or of any failure to perform or breach hereof by such other
party, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature thereto.

7. NO PARTNERSHIP

Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute either party as partner, agent
or representative of the other. Neither BCI nor any Affiliate of BCI nor,
unless otherwise agreed to, any employee seconded to or providing services
to Jones hereunder shall have any authority to negotiate, enter into or
amend or terminate contracts on behalf of Jones.

otherwise prohibits Purchaser from delivering an Exercise Notice after (or as a
result of) the occurrence of a Jones Bankruptcy Event.

(b) The notices delivered pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and

using its reasonable efforts to consummate the Closing promptly, and subject to
Section 3.6 hereof, Purchaser may postpone the Closing until such time as the
following conditions have been satisfied or waived by Purchaser:

(i) The waiting period (including any extension thereof

have expired or been earlier terminated.

taken or obtained, as the case may be, and shall be in full force and
effect.

(iii) There shall not then be in effect any applicable law,
rule or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree that
has one or more of the effects described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of
the following paragraph (iv), provided that if after the date hereof
Bell Canada International Inc. ("BCI") or any of its Affiliates enters
into a new line of business and at such time there is a law, rule or
regulation that has, or is reasonably expected to have, one or more of
such effects, then this clause (iii) will not apply to any such law,
rule or regulation.

(iv) There shall not then be instituted or pending any action
or proceeding before any federal or state court or other Governmental
Authority brought by a Governmental Authority challenging the
consummation of the Closing or seeking to (a) prevent Purchaser from
exercising the Control Option, (b) require Purchaser to divest, or
otherwise limit Purchaser's ability to exercise full rights of
ownership over, the shares of Capital Stock owned by Purchaser and its
Affiliates, the Control Option or the Optioned Shares or (c) require,
after the exercise of the Control Option, the Intercable Group to
divest any material business or assets or would impose a material
limitation on the conduct of Intercable Group's business, provided
that if after the date hereof BCI or any of its Affiliates enters into
a new line of business and at such time there is a law, rule or
regulation that has, or is reasonably expected to have, one or more of
the foregoing effects, then this clause (iv) will not apply to actions
or proceedings that seek to enforce such law, rule or regulation.

(v) The Intercable Group Entities shall have received all
material third party consents required to be obtained in connection
with the Closing, in each case in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser.

<PAGE> 32
SECTION 3.3. Purchase Price For the Optioned Shares.

(a) The purchase price per Optioned Share will be calculated as follows:

(i) (A) if the Trigger Date occurs prior to or on the
(18th)(1) day after the date hereof, ___% of the Market Value of a
share of Class A Common Stock on the applicable Trigger Date, or (B)
if the Trigger Date occurs after such (18th) day, the sum of (x)
two-thirds of the Option Price on the applicable Trigger Date and (y)
one-third of 120% of the Market Value of a share of Class A Common
Stock on the applicable Trigger Date(2), in each case reduced by

(ii) the amount (or in the case of property other than cash,
fair market value) of any dividends and distributions other than stock
dividends paid, declared or otherwise distributed by the Company in
respect of the Optioned Shares between the date hereof and the date of
Closing. In the event any such dividends or distributions are made in
property other than cash, the fair market value of such dividends or
distributions will be determined pursuant to the valuation procedures
described in Section 3.4(b).

(b) The applicable "Trigger Date" will depend on the Exercise Period
under which Purchaser is delivering an Exercise Notice and will be earliest of
the following days:

(i) in the case of an Exercise Period described in clauses
(i) or (ii) of Section 3.1(a), the day of an Event or Resignation
Event, as the case may be;

(ii) in the case of an Exercise Period described in clause
(iii) of Section 3.1(a), the day immediately preceding the day on
which Grantor delivers a Grantor's Notice;

(iii) in the case of an Exercise Period described in clause
(iv) of Section 3.1(a), the day immediately preceding the day on which
Purchaser delivers an Exercise Notice; or

(1)Insert day which is six months after closing.

(2)As an example of the calculation described in clause (i)(B), if on the
applicable Trigger Date the Option Price were $50 per Share and the Market
Value of a share of Class A Common Stock were $60 per share, the purchase price
would be 2/3 of $50 ($33.3333) plus 1/3 of 120% of $60 ($24), or $57.3333
(computed to four decimal places).

9
<PAGE> 33
(iv) in the case of an Exercise Period described in clause
(v) of Section 3.1(a), the day immediately preceding the day of a
Jones Bankruptcy Event.

SECTION 3.4. Determination of Market Value. (a) For purposes of
this Agreement, "Market Value" of a share of Class A Common Stock means, on any
Trigger Date, the average of the daily closing prices on the NASDAQ National
Market System (or other principal exchange on which shares of Class A Common
Stock are listed or approved for trading) for the shares of Class A Common
Stock for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Trigger
Date. The daily closing price for each such trading day shall be the closing
price, if reported, or, if the closing price is not reported, the average of
the closing "bid" and "asked" prices as reported by NASDAQ (or other principal
exchange). If the daily closing price per share of Class A Common Stock is
determined during a period following the declaration of a dividend,
distribution, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction, then
the Market Value shall be properly adjusted to take into account exdividend
trading.

(b) In the event that the shares of Class A Common Stock are not
traded on a national securities exchange, promptly after delivery of an
Exercise Notice Grantor and Purchaser shall in good faith negotiate the Market
Value on the applicable Trigger Date. If they are unable to reach agreement
within 10 Business Days, each of Grantor and Purchaser shall promptly select a
nationally recognized independent investment banking firm to determine the
Market Value of a share of Class A Common Stock, which will be based on a
public market valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if the Class A
Shares were traded on the NASDAQ National Market System and a non-controlling
block of approximately 1,000,000 Class A Shares had been purchased on the
Trigger Date by a willing institutional purchaser. If 20 Business Days after
their selection such firms cannot agree as to such Market Value, each firm will
submit to Grantor and Purchaser a proposed Market Value and within 10 Business
Days they shall mutually select a third nationally recognized independent
investment banking firm which shall be engaged to make such determination,
which Market Value shall be within the range of values proposed by the two
investment banking firms. Such third investment banking firm shall make such
determination (the "Final Determination") by written notice to Grantor and
Purchaser within 20 Business Days of its engagement and its judgment as to all
matters relating to its determination shall be binding upon the parties hereto.
Each party will pay the fees and expenses of the initial investment banking
firm hired by such party. The fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the third
investment banking firm shall be paid equally by

10
<PAGE> 34
Grantor and Purchaser, provided that if Purchaser withdraws an Exercise Notice
pursuant to the following paragraph (c), Purchaser shall pay the fees and
expenses of such third investment banker.

(c) At any time prior to 10 Business Days after the receipt by
Purchaser of a written determination of the Market Value pursuant to the
immediately preceding paragraph (b) (the "Withdrawal Period"), Purchaser shall
have the right to withdraw its Exercise Notice by written notice to Grantor.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event the investment
banking firm selected by Purchaser submits a proposed Market Value pursuant to
such paragraph (b), Purchaser may withdraw its Exercise Notice only for 10
Business Days after the receipt by Purchaser of such proposed Market Value,
provided that if (but only if) the Final Determination is greater than 110% of
such proposed Market Value, Purchaser will have 10 Business Days after the
receipt by Purchaser of such Final Determination to withdraw its Exercise
Notice. If Purchaser does not withdraw such Exercise Notice pursuant to this
paragraph (c), Purchaser will notify Grantor within five Business Days after
the expiration of such Withdrawal Period as to the time and place of the
Closing, which shall be not more than 20 Business Days after the expiration of
such Withdrawal Period, provided that, subject to Section 3.6, Purchaser may
postpone such closing until such time as the conditions described in Section
3.2(b) have been satisfied or waived by Purchaser.

SECTION 3.5. Closing. (a) At the Closing, Grantor shall deliver
to Purchaser a certificate or certificates or other documentation representing
the Optioned Shares, accompanied by stock powers duly executed in blank or
other appropriate assignment documentation reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Grantor an amount in
cash equal to the purchase price for such Optioned Shares, calculated pursuant
to Section 3.3(a). Such purchase price will be paid by wire transfer to a bank
account designated by Grantor not later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the mutual agreement of Purchaser
and Grantor, all or a portion of the Purchase Price may be paid in shares of
common stock of BCE Inc.

SECTION 3.6. Termination of Control Option. (a) The Control Option
shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. Denver time when the first Exercise Period
described in clauses (i), (iii) or (iv) of Section 3.1 expires (the
"Termination Time"), provided that, subject to the following paragraph (b), the
Control Option will not terminate if

11
<PAGE> 35
Purchaser has previously delivered to Grantor an Exercise Notice. The Control
Option shall also terminate (A) at such time as Purchaser withdraws an Exercise
Notice pursuant to Section 3.4(c), or (B) if the Closing has been postponed
pursuant to Section 3.2(b), ten Business Days after Grantor has delivered
written notice to Purchaser stating that it believes Purchaser is not using its
reasonable efforts to consummate the Closing promptly (which notice will set
forth the basis for such claim) and Purchaser has failed to use its reasonable
efforts prior to the expiration of such period to cure the problem identified
by Grantor. The Control Option will not terminate upon the expiration of the
Exercise Periods described in clauses (ii) and (v) of Section 3.1.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
if an Exercise Period is extended pursuant to the proviso in Section 3.1(a),
the Termination Time will occur twenty Business Days after such stay or
prohibition has been lifted and Purchaser has received notice of such action
and (ii) each Exercise Notice shall terminate, and be of no further force or
effect, 18 months after its delivery, unless a Closing shall have occurred by
such time.

SECTION 3.7. Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger.
If any change in the Company's capital stock shall occur by reason of stock
dividends, stock splits, mergers, consolidations, recapitalizations,
combinations, conversions, exchanges of shares, dividends or other changes in
the corporate or capital structure of the Company, the number and kind of
shares or securities subject to the Control Option and the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted so that Purchaser shall receive upon exercise of the Control Option
the number and class of shares or other securities or property that Purchaser
would have received in respect of the Optioned Shares purchasable upon exercise
of the Control Option if the Control Option had been exercised immediately
prior to such event.

ARTICLE IV

performance by Grantor of this Agreement requires no action by Grantor in
respect of, or filing by Grantor with, any Governmental Authority other than

such action or filing as to which the failure to make or obtain would not
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material

creation or imposition of any Lien on any material asset of Grantor, except in
the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), to the extent that any such

SECTION 5.6. Finder's Fees. Except as disclosed to Purchaser,
there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary which has
been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Grantor or its Affiliates
who might be entitled to any fee or commission from Purchaser or any Intercable
Group Entity in connection with the grant or exercise of the Control Option.

SECTION 5.7. Validity, Perfection and Priority of Security
Interest. (a) Upon the delivery of the certificates representing the Optioned
Shares to Purchaser in accordance with Section 9.2, Purchaser will have a valid
and perfected security interest in the Collateral subject to no prior Lien. No
registration, recordation or filing with any governmental body, agency or
official is required in connection with (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or necessary for the validity or enforceability hereof (except as
covered in Sections 5.4 and 5.5) or (ii) for the perfection or enforcement of
the Security Interest. Neither Grantor nor any of its Affiliates has performed
or will perform any acts which would prevent Purchaser from enforcing any of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement or which would materially limit
Purchaser in any such enforcement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that in matters relating to Franchise

an Affiliate of Grantor will not be in breach of the immediately preceding
sentence if it is in compliance with its obligations under Section 5.2 of the
Shareholders Agreement concerning such matters.

set forth in Section 10.4. Under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in

Offer Notice).

PLEDGE OF OPTIONED SHARES

SECTION 9.1. The Security Interest. In order to secure the
performance of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof,
and to secure the performance of all the obligations of Grantor hereunder:

(a) Grantor hereby assigns and pledges to Purchaser and grants to
Purchaser a security interest in the Optioned Shares, and all of its rights and
privileges with respect to the Optioned Shares, and all income and profits
thereon (other than dividends paid by the Company in respect of the Optioned
Shares prior to any exercise by the Purchaser of its remedies hereunder, which
will paid over to Grantor as provided in Section 9.4) and all proceeds of the
foregoing, and any and all property referred to in Section 9.1(b) (the
"Collateral").

(b) In the event any change in the Company's capital stock
described in Section 3.7 shall occur, Grantor will immediately pledge and
deposit with Purchaser any securities (and any share certificates or other
instruments evidencing such securities) issued by the Company in respect of the
Optioned Shares, and all income and profits thereon (other than dividends paid
by the Company in respect of the

20
<PAGE> 44

Optioned Shares prior to any exercise by the Purchaser of its remedies
hereunder), as additional security for the Secured Obligations. All such
securities, share certificates, instruments and other property constitute
Collateral and are subject to all provisions of this Agreement.

(c) The Security Interest is granted as security only and shall not
subject Purchaser to, or transfer or in any way affect or modify, any
obligation or liability of Grantor with respect to any of the Collateral or any
transaction in connection therewith.

(d) In the event Grantor fails to perform any Secured Obligation,
Purchaser shall be entitled to exercise all rights of a secured party under the
Uniform Commercial Code (whether or not in effect in the jurisdiction where the
rights are exercised) and such other rights as may otherwise be provided to a
secured party under applicable law.

SECTION 9.2. Delivery of Collateral. All certificates representing
Optioned Shares (or securities described in Section 9.1(b)) delivered to
Purchaser by Grantor pursuant hereto shall be in suitable form for transfer by
delivery, or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or
assignment in blank, with signatures appropriately guaranteed, and accompanied
by any required transfer tax stamps, all in form and substance satisfactory to
Purchaser.

SECTION 9.3. Further Assurances. (a) Grantor agrees that it will,
at Purchaser's expense and in such manner and form as Purchaser may reasonably
require, execute, deliver, file and record any financing statement, specific
assignment or other paper and take any other action that may be necessary or
desirable, or that Purchaser may request, in order to create, preserve, perfect
or validate the Security Interest or to enable Purchaser to exercise and
enforce its rights hereunder with respect to any of the Collateral. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, Grantor hereby authorizes Purchaser to
execute and file, in the name of Grantor or otherwise, Uniform Commercial Code
financing statements (which may be carbon, photographic, photostatic or other
reproductions of this Agreement or of a financing statement relating to this
Agreement) which Purchaser in its reasonable discretion may deem necessary or
appropriate to further perfect the Security Interest.

(b) Grantor agrees that it will not change (i) its name, identity
or corporate structure in any manner or (ii) the location of its chief
executive office unless it shall have given Purchaser not less than 30 days'
prior notice thereof.

21
<PAGE> 45

SECTION 9.4. Right to Vote and Receive Dividends on Collateral.
(a) Until such time (if ever) that Purchaser shall have exercised any of its
remedies in respect of the Collateral, Grantor shall retain all voting rights
with respect to the Optioned Shares and shall have the right to receive all
dividends paid by the Company in respect of the Collateral and Purchaser shall
take all such action as Grantor may deem necessary or appropriate to give
effect to such right. All such dividends which are received by Purchaser shall
be received in trust for the benefit of Grantor and shall promptly be paid over
to Grantor.

(b) In the event Purchaser exercises any of its remedies in respect
of the Collateral, Purchaser shall thereafter be entitled to receive all
dividends paid by the Company in respect of the Collateral, but there will be
no Option Price adjustment pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(ii) in respect of any
such dividends retained by Purchaser.

SECTION 9.5. Limitation on Duty of Purchaser in Respect of
Collateral. Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof,
Purchaser shall have no duty as to any Collateral in its possession or control
or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income thereon or
as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights
pertaining thereto. Purchaser shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable
care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the
Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords
its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage
to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason
of the act or omission of any agent or bailee selected by Purchaser in good
faith.

SECTION 9.6. Termination of Security Interest; Release of
Collateral. The Security Interest granted hereunder shall terminate, and all
rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantor, at the Termination Time
(unless Purchaser has purchased the Optioned Shares). Upon any such
termination of the Security Interests or release of Collateral, Purchaser will
execute and deliver to Grantor such documents as Grantor shall reasonably
request to evidence the termination of the Security Interest or the release of
such Collateral, as the case may be.

SECTION 9.7. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this
Article IX are for the benefit of Purchaser and Grantor and their respective
successors and assigns, and in the event of an assignment permitted by Section
10.2 of all or any of the Secured Obligations, the rights hereunder, to the
extent applicable to the

22

indebtedness so assigned, may be transferred with such indebtedness.

required to permit the consummation of the Closing shall have been

effect.

7
<PAGE> 68
(iii) There shall not then be in effect any applicable law,
rule or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree that
has one or more of the effects described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of
the following paragraph (iv), provided that if after the date hereof
Bell Canada International Inc. ("BCI") or any of its Affiliates enters

regulation that has, or is reasonably expected to have, one or more of
such effects, then this clause (iii) will not apply to any such law,
rule or regulation.

(iv) There shall not then be instituted or pending any action
or proceeding before any federal or state court or other Governmental
Authority brought by a Governmental Authority challenging the
consummation of the Closing or seeking to (a) prevent Purchaser from
exercising the Control Option, (b) require Purchaser to divest, or
otherwise limit Purchaser's ability to exercise full rights of
ownership over, the shares of Capital Stock owned by Purchaser and its

limitation on the conduct of Intercable Group's business, provided
that if after the date hereof BCI or any of its Affiliates enters into
a new line of business and at such time there is a law, rule or
regulation that has, or is reasonably expected to have, one or more of
the foregoing effects, then this clause (iv) will not apply to actions
or proceedings that seek to enforce such law, rule or regulation.

(v) The Intercable Group Entities shall have received all
material third party consents required to be obtained in connection
with the Closing, in each case in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser.

(vi) The representations and warranties of Grantor contained
in Article V shall be true at and as of the date of the Closing, as if
made at and as of such date.

SECTION 3.3. Purchase Price For the Optioned Shares.

(a) The purchase price per Optioned Share will be calculated as
follows:

8
<PAGE> 69
(i) (A) if the Trigger Date occurs prior to or on the
(18th)(1) day after the date hereof, ___% of the Market Value of a
share of Class A Common Stock on the applicable Trigger Date, or (B)
if the Trigger Date occurs after such (18th) day, the sum of (x)
two-thirds of the Option Price on the applicable Trigger Date and (y)
one-third of 120% of the Market Value of a share of Class A Common
Stock on the applicable Trigger Date(2), in each case reduced by

(ii) the amount (or in the case of property other than cash,
fair market value) of any dividends and distributions other than stock
dividends paid, declared or otherwise distributed by the Company in
respect of the Optioned Shares between the date hereof and the date of
Closing. In the event any such dividends or distributions are made in
property other than cash, the fair market value of such dividends or
distributions will be determined pursuant to the valuation procedures
described in Section 3.4(b).

(b) The applicable "Trigger Date" will depend on the Exercise
Period under which Purchaser is delivering an Exercise Notice and will be
earliest of the following days:

(i) in the case of an Exercise Period described in clauses
(i) or (ii) of Section 3.1(a), the day of an Event or Resignation
Event, as the case may be;

(ii) in the case of an Exercise Period described in clause
(iii) of Section 3.1(a), the day immediately preceding the day on
which Grantor delivers a Grantor's Notice;

(iii) in the case of an Exercise Period described in clause
(iv) of Section 3.1(a), the day immediately preceding the day on which
Purchaser delivers an Exercise Notice; or

(iv) in the case of an Exercise Period described in clause
(v) of Section 3.1(a), the day immediately preceding the day of a
Spacelink Bankruptcy Event.

(1)Insert day which is six months after closing.

(2)As an example of the calculation described in clause (i)(B), if on the
applicable Trigger Date the Option Price were $50 per Share and the Market
Value of a share of Class A Common Stock were $60 per share, the purchase price
would be 2/3 of $50 ($33.3333) plus 1/3 of 120% of $60 ($24), or $57.3333
(computed to four decimal places).

9
<PAGE> 70
SECTION 3.4. Determination of Market Value. (a) For purposes of
this Agreement, "Market Value" of a share of Class A Common Stock means, on any
Trigger Date, the average of the daily closing prices on the NASDAQ National
Market System (or other principal exchange on which shares of Class A Common
Stock are listed or approved for trading) for the shares of Class A Common
Stock for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Trigger
Date. The daily closing price for each such trading day shall be the closing
price, if reported, or, if the closing price is not reported, the average of
the closing "bid" and "asked" prices as reported by NASDAQ (or other principal
exchange). If the daily closing price per share of Class A Common Stock is
determined during a period following the declaration of a dividend,
distribution, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction, then
the Market Value shall be properly adjusted to take into account exdividend
trading.

(b) In the event that the shares of Class A Common Stock are not
traded on a national securities exchange, promptly after delivery of an
Exercise Notice Grantor and Purchaser shall in good faith negotiate the Market
Value on the applicable Trigger Date. If they are unable to reach agreement
within 10 Business Days, each of Grantor and Purchaser shall promptly select a
nationally recognized independent investment banking firm to determine the
Market Value of a share of Class A Common Stock, which will be based on a
public market valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if the Class A
Shares were traded on the NASDAQ National Market System and a non-controlling
block of approximately 1,000,000 Class A Shares had been purchased on the
Trigger Date by a willing institutional purchaser. If 20 Business Days after
their selection such firms cannot agree as to such Market Value, each firm will
submit to Grantor and Purchaser a proposed Market Value and within 10 Business
Days they shall mutually select a third nationally recognized independent
investment banking firm which shall be engaged to make such determination,
which Market Value shall be within the range of values proposed by the two
investment banking firms. Such third investment banking firm shall make such
determination (the "Final Determination") by written notice to Grantor and
Purchaser within 20 Business Days of its engagement and its judgment as to all
matters relating to its determination shall be binding upon the parties hereto.
Each party will pay the fees and expenses of the initial investment banking
firm hired by such party. The fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the third
investment banking firm shall be paid equally by Grantor and Purchaser,
provided that if Purchaser withdraws an Exercise Notice pursuant to the
following paragraph (c), Purchaser shall pay the fees and expenses of such
third investment banker.

10
<PAGE> 71
(c) At any time prior to 10 Business Days after the receipt by
Purchaser of a written determination of the Market Value pursuant to the
immediately preceding paragraph (b) (the "Withdrawal Period"), Purchaser shall
have the right to withdraw its Exercise Notice by written notice to Grantor.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event the investment
banking firm selected by Purchaser submits a proposed Market Value pursuant to
such paragraph (b), Purchaser may withdraw its Exercise Notice only for 10
Business Days after the receipt by Purchaser of such proposed Market Value,
provided that if (but only if) the Final Determination is greater than 110% of
such proposed Market Value, Purchaser will have 10 Business Days after the
receipt by Purchaser of such Final Determination to withdraw its Exercise
Notice. If Purchaser does not withdraw such Exercise Notice pursuant to this
paragraph (c), Purchaser will notify Grantor within five Business Days after
the expiration of such Withdrawal Period as to the time and place of the
Closing, which shall be not more than 20 Business Days after the expiration of
such Withdrawal Period, provided that, subject to Section 3.6, Purchaser may
postpone such closing until such time as the conditions described in Section
3.2(b) have been satisfied or waived by Purchaser.

SECTION 3.5. Closing. (a) At the Closing, Grantor shall deliver
to Purchaser a certificate or certificates or other documentation representing
the Optioned Shares, accompanied by stock powers duly executed in blank or
other appropriate assignment documentation reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Grantor an amount in
cash equal to the purchase price for such Optioned Shares, calculated pursuant
to Section 3.3(a). Such purchase price will be paid by wire transfer to a bank
account designated by Grantor not later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the mutual agreement of Purchaser
and Grantor, all or a portion of the Purchase Price may be paid in shares of
common stock of BCE Inc.

SECTION 3.6. Termination of Control Option. (a) The Control Option
shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. Denver time when the first Exercise Period
described in clauses (i), (iii) or (iv) of Section 3.1 expires (the
"Termination Time"), provided that, subject to the following paragraph (b), the
Control Option will not terminate if Purchaser has previously delivered to
Grantor an Exercise Notice. The Control Option shall also terminate (A) at
such time as Purchaser withdraws an Exercise Notice pursuant to Section 3.4(c),
or (B) if the Closing has been postponed pursuant to Section 3.2(b), ten
Business Days after Grantor

11
<PAGE> 72
has delivered written notice to Purchaser stating that it believes Purchaser is
not using its reasonable efforts to consummate the Closing promptly (which
notice will set forth the basis for such claim) and Purchaser has failed to use
its reasonable efforts prior to the expiration of such period to cure the
problem identified by Grantor. The Control Option will not terminate upon the
expiration of the Exercise Periods described in clauses (ii) and (v) of Section
3.1.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
if an Exercise Period is extended pursuant to the proviso in Section 3.1(a),
the Termination Time will occur twenty Business Days after such stay or
prohibition has been lifted and Purchaser has received notice of such action
and (ii) each Exercise Notice shall terminate, and be of no further force or
effect, 18 months after its delivery, unless a Closing shall have occurred by
such time.

SECTION 3.7. Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger.
If any change in the Company's capital stock shall occur by reason of stock
dividends, stock splits, mergers, consolidations, recapitalizations,
combinations, conversions, exchanges of shares, dividends or other changes in
the corporate or capital structure of the Company, the number and kind of
shares or securities subject to the Control Option and the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted so that Purchaser shall receive upon exercise of the Control Option
the number and class of shares or other securities or property that Purchaser
would have received in respect of the Optioned Shares purchasable upon exercise
of the Control Option if the Control Option had been exercised immediately
prior to such event.

except as otherwise agreed to between Grantor, its Affiliates and Purchaser in
the Shareholders Agreement or otherwise or (ii) any Affiliate of Grantor from
taking or refraining from taking any other action not provided herein or

SECTION 5.1. Valid Title. Grantor is the sole record and
beneficial owner of the Optioned Shares, free and clear of any Lien (other than
the Security Interest) and any other limitation or restriction (including any
limitation or restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of or

incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Colorado
and has all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business as now conducted. Grantor is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified would not, individually or in the

13
<PAGE> 74

aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the condition or business of
Grantor. Grantor has heretofore delivered to Purchaser true and complete
copies of its articles of incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect.

SECTION 5.3. Binding Effect. The execution, delivery and
performance by Grantor of this Agreement are within Grantor's corporate power
and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Grantor. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Grantor, and
assuming the accuracy of Purchaser's representations and warranties herein, is
a valid and binding agreement of Grantor.

SECTION 5.4. Governmental Authorization. Assuming the accuracy of
Purchaser's representations and warranties herein, the execution, delivery and
performance by Grantor of this Agreement requires no action by Grantor in
respect of, or filing by Grantor with, any Governmental Authority other than
(i) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and (ii) any
such action or filing as to which the failure to make or obtain would not
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the business, assets, results of operations, properties or
condition (financial or otherwise) of Grantor.

SECTION 5.5. Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and
performance by Grantor of this Agreement do not: (i) violate the articles of
incorporation or by-laws of Grantor, (ii) assuming the accuracy of Purchaser's
representations and warranties herein and compliance with the matters referred
to in Section 5.4, violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding on Grantor, (iii) assuming the accuracy of
Purchaser's representations and warranties herein, require any consent or other
action by any Person under, or constitute a default under, any material
agreement or other instrument binding upon Grantor, or (iv) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any material asset of Grantor, except in
the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), to the extent that any such

loss or Lien would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of
operations, properties or financial condition of Grantor.

SECTION 5.6. Finder's Fees. Except as disclosed to Purchaser,
there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary which has
been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Grantor or its Affiliates

SECTION 5.7. Validity, Perfection and Priority of Security
Interest. (a) Upon the delivery of the certificates representing the Optioned

registration, recordation or filing with any governmental body, agency or
official is required in connection with (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or necessary for the validity or enforceability hereof (except as
covered in Sections 5.4 and 5.5) or (ii) for the perfection or enforcement of
the Security Interest. Neither Grantor nor any of its Affiliates has performed
or will perform any acts which would prevent Purchaser from enforcing any of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement or which would materially limit
Purchaser in any such enforcement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that in matters relating to Franchise
Agreements (as defined in the Shareholders Agreement) and material contracts,
an Affiliate of Grantor will not be in breach of the immediately preceding
sentence if it is in compliance with its obligations under Section 5.2 of the
Shareholders Agreement concerning such matters.

(b) The chief executive office of Grantor is located at its address
set forth in Section 10.4. Under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in
the State in which such office is located, no local filing is required to
perfect a security interest in collateral consisting of general intangibles
other than any such collateral arising from or relating to farm products.

Act.

ARTICLE VII

CHANGE IN LAW

SECTION 7.1. Change in Law. (a) If a Change in Law after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the delivery of an
Exercise Notice would be reasonably likely to (i) prevent Purchaser from
exercising the Control Option, (ii) require Purchaser to divest, or otherwise
limit Purchaser's ability to exercise full rights of ownership over, the shares
of Capital Stock owned by Purchaser and its Affiliates, the Control Option or
the Optioned Shares or (iii) after the exercise of the Control Option, require
the Intercable Group to divest any material business or assets or impose a
material limitation on the conduct of Intercable Group's business, Purchaser
may elect to dispose of the Control Option and any other securities of the
Intercable Group Entities owned by Purchaser and its Affiliates pursuant to the
terms and procedures of this Article VII.

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that it will have no rights under this
Article VII if after the date hereof Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into a new line of business and at such time there is a law, rule or
regulation that has one or more of the effects described in clauses (i), (ii)
or (iii) of the preceding paragraph (a).

SECTION 7.2. Right of First Offer. (a) In the event Purchaser
wishes to dispose of the Control Option after the occurrence of an event
described in Section 7.1, Purchaser shall, by written notice to Grantor, first
offer the Control Option to Grantor at a price equal to the aggregate
consideration paid by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.1, plus interest from the
date of this Agreement to and including the date the Control Option is
purchased by Grantor (or an Affiliate of Grantor), at a rate per annum equal to
12%, compounded annually (the "Offer Price"). Any such written notice shall be
in the form of Exhibit C hereto (the "Offer Notice"), but will be effective
only if a similar notice is simultaneously delivered by Purchaser under the
Related Option Agreements.

(b) For a period of 270 days after receipt of the Offer Notice,
Grantor (or, if Grantor elects not to purchase the Control Option, any of its
Affiliates, including the Company) may, by a written notice to Purchaser in the
form attached as Exhibit D hereto (an "Acceptance Notice"), elect to purchase
the Control Option at the Offer

17
<PAGE> 78

Price and, if it so elects, may also purchase all (but not less than all) of
(i) the shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock then held by Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries at a price per share equal to the Market Value of such
shares (calculated pursuant to Section 3.4 and assuming that the Trigger Date
is the day immediately preceding the day the Offer Notice is delivered) and
(ii) any other debt or equity securities of the Intercable Group Entities then
held by the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries at a price equal to the fair market
value of such securities on the day immediately preceding the day on which the
Offer Notice is delivered (such value to be determined pursuant to the
valuation procedures described in Section 3.4(b)).

(c) If Grantor and its Affiliates (including the Company) fail to
elect to purchase the Control Option within 270 days after receipt of the Offer
Notice, then Purchaser may, for a period of 360 days following the expiration
of such time period, sell (or enter into an agreement to sell) the Control
Option to a third party, provided that in the event of any such sale the third
party purchaser must simultaneously exercise the Control Option and deliver the
Option Price to Grantor in exchange for the Optioned Shares (in such event, the
"Trigger Date" will be the day which is 270 days after receipt by Grantor of an
Offer Notice).

(d) If Grantor fails to elect to purchase the Control Option at the
Offer Price and Purchaser shall not have sold or entered into an agreement to
sell the Control Option prior to the expiration of the 360 day period specified
in paragraph (c) above, Purchaser must, prior to selling the Control Option,
again offer the Control Option to Grantor pursuant to the terms and procedures
of this Section 7.2.

(e) In the event Purchaser elects to exercise its rights under
Sections 7.1 and 7.2, Purchaser and Grantor will use reasonable efforts to
identify a suitable partner to purchase the Control Option and the shares of
Class A Common Stock held by Purchaser. Purchaser will consult with Jones
before selling the Control Option to a third party and will consider Jones'
views as to the suitability of potential purchasers.

SECTION 7.3. Closing Procedures. (a) The delivery of an
Acceptance Notice will constitute a contract between Purchaser and Grantor (and
any Affiliate of Grantor that delivers the Acceptance Notice) for the purchase
and sale of (i) the Control Option at the Offer Price, and (ii) if applicable,
the securities described in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 7.2(b) (the

Securities will be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to a
bank account designated by Purchaser not less than five Business Days prior to
Closing.

(d) At any closing hereunder, Purchaser will deliver to the
purchaser good and valid title to the Control Option and the Additional
Securities, free and clear of any Lien.

Closing, provided that the representation and warranty contained in Section 5.1
shall survive indefinitely. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentence, if notice of the
inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have

SECTION 8.3. Procedures. The party seeking indemnification under
Section 8.2 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice to the party
against whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of
any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under such Section. The Indemnifying Party may,
and at the request of the Indemnified Party shall participate in and control
the defense of any such suit, action or proceeding at its own expense. The
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 8.2 for any settlement
effected without its consent of any claim, litigation or proceeding in respect
of which indemnity may be sought hereunder.

ARTICLE IX

PLEDGE OF OPTIONED SHARES

SECTION 9.1. The Security Interest. In order to secure the
performance of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof,
and to secure the performance of all the obligations of Grantor hereunder:

(a) Grantor hereby assigns and pledges to Purchaser and grants to
Purchaser a security interest in the Optioned Shares, and all of its rights and
privileges with respect to the Optioned Shares, and all income and profits
thereon (other than dividends paid by the Company in respect of the Optioned
Shares prior to any exercise by the Purchaser of its remedies hereunder, which
will paid over to Grantor as provided in Section 9.4) and all proceeds of the
foregoing, and any and all property referred to in Section 9.1(b) (the
"Collateral").

(b) In the event any change in the Company's capital stock
described in Section 3.7 shall occur, Grantor will immediately pledge and
deposit with Purchaser any securities (and any share certificates or other
instruments evidencing such securities) issued by the Company in respect of the
Optioned Shares, and all income and profits thereon (other than dividends paid
by the Company in respect of the Optioned Shares prior to any exercise by the
Purchaser of its remedies hereunder), as additional security for the Secured
Obligations. All such securities, share certificates, instruments and other
property constitute

20
<PAGE> 81

Collateral and are subject to all provisions of this Agreement.

(c) The Security Interest is granted as security only and shall not
subject Purchaser to, or transfer or in any way affect or modify, any
obligation or liability of Grantor with respect to any of the Collateral or any
transaction in connection therewith.

(d) In the event Grantor fails to perform any Secured Obligation,
Purchaser shall be entitled to exercise all rights of a secured party under the
Uniform Commercial Code (whether or not in effect in the jurisdiction where the
rights are exercised) and such other rights as may otherwise be provided to a
secured party under applicable law.

SECTION 9.2. Delivery of Collateral. All certificates representing
Optioned Shares (or securities described in Section 9.1(b)) delivered to
Purchaser by Grantor pursuant hereto shall be in suitable form for transfer by
delivery, or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or
assignment in blank, with signatures appropriately guaranteed, and accompanied
by any required transfer tax stamps, all in form and substance satisfactory to
Purchaser.

SECTION 9.3. Further Assurances. (a) Grantor agrees that it will,
at Purchaser's expense and in such manner and form as Purchaser may reasonably
require, execute, deliver, file and record any financing statement, specific
assignment or other paper and take any other action that may be necessary or
desirable, or that Purchaser may request, in order to create, preserve, perfect
or validate the Security Interest or to enable Purchaser to exercise and
enforce its rights hereunder with respect to any of the Collateral. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, Grantor hereby authorizes Purchaser to
execute and file, in the name of Grantor or otherwise, Uniform Commercial Code
financing statements (which may be carbon, photographic, photostatic or other
reproductions of this Agreement or of a financing statement relating to this
Agreement) which Purchaser in its reasonable discretion may deem necessary or
appropriate to further perfect the Security Interest.

(b) Grantor agrees that it will not change (i) its name, identity
or corporate structure in any manner or (ii) the location of its chief
executive office unless it shall have given Purchaser not less than 30 days'
prior notice thereof.

SECTION 9.4. Right to Vote and Receive Dividends on Collateral.
(a) Until such time (if ever) that Purchaser shall have exercised any of its
remedies in

21
<PAGE> 82

respect of the Collateral, Grantor shall retain all voting rights with respect
to the Optioned Shares and shall have the right to receive all dividends paid
by the Company in respect of the Collateral and Purchaser shall take all such
action as Grantor may deem necessary or appropriate to give effect to such
right. All such dividends which are received by Purchaser shall be received in
trust for the benefit of Grantor and shall promptly be paid over to Grantor.

(b) In the event Purchaser exercises any of its remedies in respect
of the Collateral, Purchaser shall thereafter be entitled to receive all
dividends paid by the Company in respect of the Collateral, but there will be
no Option Price adjustment pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(ii) in respect of any
such dividends retained by Purchaser.

SECTION 9.5. Limitation on Duty of Purchaser in Respect of
Collateral. Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof,
Purchaser shall have no duty as to any Collateral in its possession or control
or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income thereon or
as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights
pertaining thereto. Purchaser shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable
care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the
Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords
its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage
to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason
of the act or omission of any agent or bailee selected by Purchaser in good
faith.

SECTION 9.6. Termination of Security Interest; Release of
Collateral. The Security Interest granted hereunder shall terminate, and all
rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantor, at the Termination Time
(unless Purchaser has purchased the Optioned Shares). Upon any such
termination of the Security Interests or release of Collateral, Purchaser will
execute and deliver to Grantor such documents as Grantor shall reasonably
request to evidence the termination of the Security Interest or the release of
such Collateral, as the case may be.

SECTION 9.7. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this
Article IX are for the benefit of Purchaser and Grantor and their respective
successors and assigns, and in the event of an assignment permitted by Section
10.2 of all or any of the Secured Obligations, the rights hereunder, to the
extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, may be transferred with such
indebtedness.

MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 10.1. Termination. (a) This Agreement will terminate
automatically and will be of no further force or effect at the Termination
Time.

(b) The termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1
shall be without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to any other party
to this Agreement, provided that no such termination shall relieve any party
for any liability such party may have for a material willful breach hereof.

SECTION 10.2. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors. No party may assign, delegate or otherwise

written consent of the other parties hereto, provided that (i) Purchaser may
assign its rights, but not its obligations, hereunder to any Eligible Assignee,
(ii) Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations hereunder as provided in
Article VII and (iii) Purchaser may assign its rights (but not its obligations)
hereunder at any time after the delivery by it of an Exercise Notice to Grantor
if at the time of any such assignment pursuant to this clause (iii) the
assignee will purchase the Optioned Shares pursuant to Section 3.5.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Eligible Assignee" means any
entity which at the time of such assignment is, and thereafter during the term

acknowledge that the foregoing provisions are not intended to restrict the
Purchaser from assigning its rights hereunder to a Subsidiary of the Purchaser
that is a holding company of an entity or entities primarily engaged in a
Restricted Business.

SECTION 10.3. Specific Performance. The parties agree that (i)
Purchaser would be irreparably damaged if for

23
<PAGE> 84

any reason Grantor failed to sell the Optioned Shares upon exercise of the
Control Option or to perform any of Grantor's other obligations under this
Agreement, and that Purchaser would not have an adequate remedy at law for
money damages in such event and (ii) Grantor would be irreparably damaged if
for any reason Purchaser failed to maintain the Collateral in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or to perform any of Purchaser's other obligations
under this Agreement, and that Grantor would not have an adequate remedy at law
for money damages in such event. Accordingly, each party shall be entitled to
specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief to enforce the
performance of this Agreement by the other party. This provision is without
prejudice to any other rights that each party may have against the other party
for any failure to perform their obligations under this Agreement.

reasonably be expected to have, one or more of the effects described

will not apply to actions of the Intercable Group that would 
reasonably be expected to have such effects under such law, rule or
regulation, (2) after the Option Termination Date this subparagraph
(viii) will only apply to actions that would reasonably be expected to
require Investor to divest, or otherwise limit its ability to exercise

Such notice will be accompanied by such additional information as is reasonably
required to enable Investor to evaluate such proposed action. Upon receipt of
such notice, Investor will have ten Business Days to exercise its right not to

Percentage is less than 15%, then:

(i) Investor's right to designate the Joint Nominees pursuant

designate only one Class A Director pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i); and

(ii) the consent rights of Investor described in Section

(i) Investor's right to designate the Joint Nominees pursuant

17
<PAGE> 121

Common Directors that are not designated by Investor pursuant to this
Article II (and after such time such directors will be nominated

without regard to this Agreement).

2.8 Tag-Along Right and Third Party Offers. (a) Subject to the
transfer rights of JI Shareholders under Section 4.1(c), after the Option
Termination Date but prior to the eighth anniversary of the date hereof,
neither the Spacelink Group Entities nor the JI Group Entities will sell (or
enter into an agreement or option to sell), directly or indirectly, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Control Block") to a Person that is
not a

18
<PAGE> 122

Spacelink Group Entity or a JI Group Entity (the "Control Purchaser"), unless
(i) the Control Purchaser agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as
a JI Shareholder or (ii) prior to any such sale such Control Purchaser offers
to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) of the shares of Capital
Stock, and other debt or equity securities, issued by the Intercable Group
Entities to, and then held by, the Bell International Group Entities (the
"Owned Securities") at the Buy-Out Price pursuant to the procedures of this
Section 2.8.

(b) After the eighth anniversary of the date hereof, if the JI
Group Entities or the Spacelink Group Entities sell, directly or indirectly, in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, the Control Block to a
Control Purchaser, prior to any such sale such Control Purchaser may, but is
not required to, offer to purchase for cash all (but not less than all) of the
Owned Securities at the Buy-Out Price.

(c) A Control Purchaser that offers to purchase the Owned
Securities for the Buy-Out Price pursuant to this Section 2.8 will deliver a
written offer notice to Investor. After the delivery of such notice, the
Control Purchaser and Investor will attempt to negotiate a Buy-Out Price that
is mutually satisfactory. If in connection with the purchase of the Control
Block the Control Purchaser (or an Intercable Group Entity) is also offering to
purchase from the public any class of Owned Securities, the Buy-Out Price for
such Owned Securities will be such offer price.

(d) If the Control Purchaser and Investor are unable to agree on a
mutually satisfactory Buy-Out Price, the Control Purchaser and the relevant
Spacelink Group Entity or JI Group Entity will make a public announcement that
the Control Purchaser is negotiating to purchase the Control Block. In such
event, the Buy-Out Price for each class of Owned Securities will be equal to
the Market Value of such class of Owned Securities, calculated pursuant to
Section 3.8(h) and (i) and assuming that the Trigger Date is the tenth trading
day immediately after the day of such public announcement

(e) After the Market Value of each class of Owned Securities has
been determined, if the Control Purchaser wishes to proceed with the proposed
transaction to purchase the Control Block and the Owned Securities, it will (or
after the eight anniversary of the Closing Date, it may) by written notice to
Investor, irrevocably offer to purchase all of the Owned Securities at the
Buy-Out Price. If Investor fails to deliver a written acceptance notice within
10 Business Days after receipt of such written offer from the Control
Purchaser, Investor will be deemed to have

19
<PAGE> 123

declined an offer from a Control Purchaser, including for purposes of
determining whether an Event Date has occurred.

(f) The purchase and sale of the Owned Securities will take place
simultaneously with the purchase of the Control Block. The purchase price for
the Owned Securities purchased pursuant to this Section 2.8 will be paid by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to a bank account designated by
the relevant Bell International Group Entity not less than three Business Days
prior to closing.

(g) At any closing hereunder, the relevant Bell International Group
Entity will deliver to the Control Purchaser good and valid title to the Owned
Securities, free and clear of any Lien.

ARTICLE III

COVENANTS

3.1. Investment Commitment. (a) Investor will purchase for cash
30% of any Class A Shares sold by the Company to unaffiliated third parties
after the date hereof, at a price per share equal to the price per share
received by the Company from such third parties in connection with any such
sales (net of selling commissions and underwriter's discounts), provided that
the obligation of Investor under this Section 3.1 will terminate at such time
(the "Commitment Termination Time") as the aggregate purchase price of all
equity securities, and securities that are convertible or exchangeable into
equity securities (including any Convertible Debentures), purchased by the Bell
International Group Entities from the Company or any Intercable Group Entity
prior to, on or after the date hereof (including any New Securities purchased
pursuant to this Section 3.1) equals $400,000,000. The parties hereto
acknowledge that after taking into account the purchase of 2,500,000 Class A
Shares on March 25, 1994 pursuant to the Investment Agreement dated as of such
date between the Company and Investor, and 7,500,000 Class A Shares on the date
hereof pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Bell International Group
Entities have purchased from the Company Class A shares having an aggregate
purchase price of (___________), and that Investors's remaining investment
commitment is (___________).

(b) In the event the Company proposes to offer and sell any Class A
Shares prior to the termination of the purchase commitment described in
paragraph (a), it will give Investor not less than ten Business Days' written
notice of its intention, describing the material terms of the proposed sale,
including the manner of sale and a range of proposed

20
<PAGE> 124

prices and numbers of Class A Shares to be sold to unaffiliated third parties
and to Investor. The Company will deliver to Investor copies of all
prospectuses and other related offering and closing documents prepared by the
Company and its advisors in connection with the proposed sale and will keep
Investor informed as to material developments during the offering process. The
closing for the purchase and sale of any Class A Shares purchased by Investor
pursuant to this Section 3.1 will take place on the later to occur of (i) the
date on which such third parties purchase Class A Shares, (ii) the date on
which the Purchase Conditions have been satisfied, or waived by Investor in its
sole discretion (provided that if Investor has not purchased the Class A Shares
40 days after the third party closing, the Company may sell such shares to a
third party) or (iii) such other time as Investor and the Company agree.
Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, any Class A Shares
purchased by Investor under this Section 3.1 will be purchased pursuant to the
same terms and conditions as the unaffiliated third parties.

(c) At Investor's request, Investor may purchase for $50,000,000 in
cash a Convertible Debenture, provided that the Company may postpone such
purchase until such time as it wishes to sell any New Securities. For purposes
of this Section 3.1, "Convertible Debenture" means a convertible unsecured
subordinated debenture of the Company having terms and conditions that would be
obtained from the Company by an unaffiliated institutional investor at the time
of such purchase pursuant to a public offering (such terms and conditions to be
mutually agreed by the parties), provided that (i) such debenture will convert
automatically into Class A Shares two years after the date of issuance, unless
earlier converted at the option of the holder and (ii) the indenture relating
to such debenture will contain the consent rights set forth in Section 2.6 and
the termination provisions set forth in Sections 2.7 and 7.1.

3.2. Consultation on Business Strategies. (a) The Company will
regularly advise and consult with Investor as to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, which consultation will include the review of (i)
strategic, operating and financial plans, including plans for acquisitions and
sales of cable television systems (both as they relate to owned and managed
systems), (ii) equity, debt, joint venture and other financing strategies,
(iii) business plans for operations, marketing and technology deployment and
(iv) personnel, compensation and related decisions.

(b) Each year, management of the Company will present to the Board
for approval a business plan that

21
<PAGE> 125

includes the elements described in paragraph (a) of this Section 3.2.

3.3. Obligation to Refer Business Opportunities. (a) Subject to
the provisions of this Section 3.3, each of Investor, Spacelink, Jones and
International will refer, and will cause each of their Subsidiaries to refer,
to the Company business opportunities in the following lines of business:

(i) any business that is primarily engaged in a Core 
Business in the United States of America at such time,

(ii) any business that is primarily engaged in wireline local
communications services (including exchange, access and value-added
services, such as call waiting, call forwarding and similar services)
in geographic markets in the United States where neither the Company
nor Spacelink owns or operates a cable television or wireline local
communications business at such time, and has a fair market value less
than the then market capitalization (equity and long-term debt) of
the Company at such time, and

(iii) such other businesses as may be agreed in writing by
Investor, Spacelink and Jones from time to time.

The parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing businesses do not
include (x) inter-active or multi-media services, or programming networks or
(y) competitive access provider services similar to those provided by Jones
Lightwave, Ltd. and its Subsidiaries. The parties hereto also acknowledge that
Spacelink will have no obligation under this Section 3.3 to refer business
opportunities that relate primarily to the Core Business in Hawaii or to the
maintenance or completion of the cable television systems currently owned or
managed by any Spacelink Group Entity.

(b) Investor, Spacelink, Jones and International will not, and will
cause each of their Subsidiaries not to, purchase, finance or otherwise
participate in the acquisition of a business described in paragraph (a) of this
Section 3.3 (an "Opportunity") without first complying with the following
procedures:

(i) The Person referring the Opportunity (an "Offering
Party") will notify the Company of the Opportunity, and deliver to the
Company a report setting forth in reasonable detail the material terms
and conditions of such Opportunity.

22
<PAGE> 126

(ii) The Company will then promptly convene a special meeting
of the Board to consider whether the proposed Opportunity is in the
best interests of the Company.

(iii) If the Board determines that the Company should pursue
the Opportunity, the Company will so notify the Offering Party (and
each of Jones, Spacelink and Investor), and thereafter none of the
Offering Party, any Bell International Group Entity (or a Subsidiary
thereof), any Spacelink Group Entity nor any JI Group Entity will
pursue, or participate in, such Opportunity, provided that the
Offering Party will be free to pursue, or participate in, such
Opportunity if (A) the Company is unable to raise financing in respect
of such Opportunity (unless the Offering Party is a Bell
International Group Entity (or a Subsidiary thereof) and Investor
exercised its consent rights under Section 2.6 in respect of any such
proposed financing, in which case the Offering Party may not pursue or
participate in such Opportunity), (B) the Company is unable to pursue
or participate in such Opportunity because a law, rule or regulation
of a Governmental Authority prevents (or materially restricts) the
participation by the Intercable Group in such Opportunity or (C) the
Company otherwise subsequently elects not to pursue, or participate
in, such Opportunity. Nothing in this subparagraph (iii) will affect
the consent rights of Investor in Section 2.6.

(iv) If the Board fails to approve the pursuit by the Company
of an Opportunity or the Company otherwise elects not to pursue such
Opportunity, the Offering Party will be free to pursue such
Opportunity without any further obligation to the Company, provided
that the Offering Party may not pursue, or participate in, any such
Opportunity if (A) the Offering Party is a Bell International Group
Entity (or a Subsidiary thereof) and Investor exercised its consent
rights under Section 2.6 in respect of such Opportunity or (B) the
Offering Party is a Spacelink Group Entity or a JI Group Entity and a
majority of the Spacelink Nominees that are not Independent Directors
voted against the pursuit by the Company of such Opportunity.

(c) Each Shareholder agrees to keep confidential (as provided in
Section 3.10) any Opportunities that it receives notice of pursuant to this
Section 3.3. If an Offering Party is permitted to pursue an Opportunity
pursuant to this Section 3.3, Shareholders that are not Affiliates of such
Offering Party, and Subsidiaries of such Shareholders, will not be permitted to
pursue, or

23
<PAGE> 127

participate in, such Opportunity unless they lawfully acquire knowledge of such
Opportunity from sources other than the Offering Party or an Affiliate of such
Offering Party. In the event an Opportunity is offered by a Bell International
Group Entity (or a Subsidiary thereof), and Investor elects to exercise its
consent rights under Section 2.6 in respect of such Opportunity, the Spacelink
Group Entities and the JI Group Entities will be free to pursue such
Opportunity.

(d) The Company will use reasonable efforts to keep Investor,
Spacelink and Jones informed as to the geographic markets served by the cable
television and wireline local communications businesses owned or operated by
the Intercable Group Entities.

(e) The provisions of this Section 3.3 will terminate on the Option
Termination Date.

3.4. Supplier Arrangements. The Company will give Investor,
International and their respective Affiliates the first opportunity to supply
services, compatible network equipment and systems to the Company on
competitive terms and conditions which will, at the Company's discretion, be
made pursuant to competitive bidding or other processes. Nothing herein will
adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain services, equipment and
systems on open and competitive terms.

3.5. Programming Services. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary: (a) The JI Group Entities shall have the
right to distribute, on a full-time (or, if requested from time to time by
Jones or International, part-time, to be extended or restored, as applicable,
to full-time upon his or its request), daily basis, programming packaged (as
opposed to brokered) by, created by or created primarily for a JI Group Entity
("Jones Programming") on such number of channels (not to exceed six at any one
time) on the Systems as Jones or International may designate from time to time
(with the Mind Extension University programming to be carried on a VHF channel
(i.e., channel 2 through 12)). The Bell International Group Entities shall
have the right to distribute, on a full-time (or, if requested from time to
time by Investor, part-time to be extended or restored, as applicable to full
time upon Investor's request), daily basis, programming packaged (as opposed to
brokered) by, created by or created primarily for a Bell International Group
Entity ("Investor Programming") on such number of channels (not to exceed two
at any one time) on the Systems as Investor may designate from time to time.

24
<PAGE> 128

(b) Prior to exercising its distribution right with respect to any
programming under this Section 3.5, the relevant JI Group Entity or Bell
International Group Entity (each a "Programmer") will present to the Board a
reasonably detailed business plan that, among other things, describes (i) the
general content of such programming, (ii) the marketing strategy for such
programming, including service level (such as basic, tier or a la carte) and
(iii) pricing for such service levels. The Jones Programming and the Investor
Programming shall be carried and priced by the Intercable Group Entities on
such level or levels of services as such programming is intended to be carried
under the business plan for such programming.

(c) Notwithstanding the rights granted pursuant to paragraph (a)
above:

(i) the Intercable Group Entities shall not be required to
delete from any System any programming acquired from any third-party
programmer prior to the expiration of the term of the program carriage
agreement with such third-party programmer in order to carry any
Investor Programming or Jones Programming,

(ii) in the event there is insufficient channel capacity to
carry Jones Programming or Investor Programming, carriage of such
Jones Programming or Investor Programming on a System shall be given
priority over any third party programming not then carried by such
System and over any third party programming then carried by the System
at such time as the initial or then current renewal term, as
applicable, is scheduled to expire, provided that (x) such priority
shall not apply to off-air programming carried by the four major
broadcast networks or as mandated by law, or the 20 most widely viewed
third party programs as then carried by the System at the time as
reported by (NAME OF APPLICABLE TRADE PUBLICATION), and (y) in
addition to the foregoing requirements, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to add Jones Programming and Investor
Programming to the Systems whenever opportunities to do so arise,

(iii) in the event there is insufficient channel capacity to
carry both the Jones Programming and Investor Programming, Jones
Programming will be given priority over carriage of Investor
Programming,

(iv) Jones, International and Investor, as the case may be,
shall give the Company at least four months' prior notice of any
proposed commencement or termination of use of any channel and

25
<PAGE> 129

(v) the Bell International Group Entities shall have no rights
under this Section 3.5 to distribute programming that has 
substantially similar content as any Jones Programming.

(d) During the Validation Period (as defined herein), the license fee
payable by the Intercable Group Entities for any unit of Jones Programming
(excluding Mind Extension University, Health Care Network, Jones Computer
Network and Product Information Network) or Investor Programming ("New
Programming") shall be such license fee as the Programmer establishes in good
faith based on its reasonable estimate of the market value of such New
Programming. A Programmer shall notify the Company and the Independent
Directors in writing promptly following the end of the Validation Period
whether the Programmer has entered into an agreement providing for (a) the
distribution of such New Programming by a cable television operator or other
distributor of video programming (a "Distributor") having at least 400,000
subscribers ("Validating Distributor") and (b) the payment of a license fee by
such Validating Distributor at a rate equal to or greater than the license fee
payable by the Intercable Group Entities ("Validating Programming Agreement").
If no Validating Programming Agreement has been entered into during the
Validation Period, the Company or any Independent Director may, by written
notice given within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company and the
Independent Directors of the above-referenced notification, require that such
Programmer reduce the license fee payable by the Intercable Group Entities for
such New Programming to the greater of (i) a license agreement approved by the
Independent Directors, (ii) the average license fee charged by the applicable
Programmer to all Distributors for such New Programming and (iii) the Agreed
Rate in effect at such time. For purposes of this Section 3.5, "Agreed Rate"
means, at any time, the rate set forth in the Affiliate Agreement between Mind
Extension University, Inc. and the Company dated December 28, 1993, as amended
as of June 1, 1994. Thereafter, the license fee payable by the Intercable
Group Entities for such New Programming shall be subject to such adjustments as
are similar to adjustments in the license fee permitted by the Validating
Programming Agreement or, if there is no such agreement in effect, by the
programming agreement pursuant to which such New Programming is carried by the
largest Distributor serving fewer than 400,000 subscribers. A Programmer may
elect at any time to terminate carriage of such unit of New Programming upon
not less than ninety days prior written notice to the Company if it does enter
into a Validating Programming Agreement during the Validation Period.
"Validation Period" shall mean, as to any New Programming, the fifteen (15)
month period commencing with the first

26
<PAGE> 130

month with respect to which a license fee is payable by an Intercable Group
Entity for the right to distribute such New Programming.

(e) The Intercable Group Entities shall carry Jones Programming and
Investor Programming on the Systems for a period of 15 years after the date
hereof (or the expiration date of the applicable programming agreement with the
Company) in accordance with this Section 3.5, provided that if Investor does
not purchase the Optioned Shares pursuant to the Option Agreements, the rights
of the Bell International Group Entities will terminate on the Option
Termination Date.

(f) No JI Group Entity nor any Bell International Group Entity may
sell or assign (other than to an Affiliate) its unused right of distribution to
the Systems pursuant to this Section 3.5, provided that in the event any
Programming is being distributed pursuant to this Section 3.5, such Programming
will continue to have the distribution rights provided herein if the relevant
JI Group Entity sells or assigns (i) any network or networks carried on a
System or any such Programming or (ii) any entity directly or indirectly owning
or controlling such network(s) or Programming. In the event of any such sale
or assignment by a JI Group Entity or a Bell International Group Entity, the
continuing distribution rights of such Programming will count towards the
number of channels permitted to be designated by such JI Group Entity or Bell
International Group Entity pursuant to paragraph (a) above.

(g) Each of Investor and International shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its designees to the Board, subject to their fiduciary duties
under applicable law as advised by counsel, to approve the carriage by the
Intercable Group Entities of the other party's Programming in accordance with
this Section 3.5.

3.6. Transactions with Affiliates. (a) Investor acknowledges that
prior to the date hereof certain services have been provided by the Intercable
Group Entities to the JI Group Entities and by the JI Group Entities to the
Intercable Group Entities. Investor agrees that the services described in the
Affiliate Agreements or the Current SEC Filings (as defined in the Stock
Purchase Agreement) may continue to be provided for a period of eight years
following the date hereof, on terms and conditions consistent with those
described in such Current SEC Filings or as set forth in the Related
Agreements.

(b) Except for transactions described in Section 3.5 or paragraph
(a) of this Section 3.6, or undertaken pursuant to the terms of the Related
Agreements or the

27
<PAGE> 131

Affiliate Agreements, each Shareholder agrees that neither it nor any of its
Affiliates will engage in any transaction, or enter into, amend in any material
respect or renew any agreement, with an Intercable Group Entity unless the
material terms of such transaction are fully and fairly disclosed to the Board,
and approved by a majority of the Unrelated Directors.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement "Unrelated Directors" means:

(i) in the case of a transaction or agreement between an
Intercable Group Entity and a JI Group Entity or a Spacelink Group
Entity, the three Investor Nominees and the three Joint Nominees,

(ii) in the case of a transaction or agreement between a BCE
Group Entity and an Intercable Group Entity, the directors that are
not Investor Nominees, and

(iii) in the case of a transaction or agreement among (x) an
Intercable Group Entity, (y) a Spacelink Group Entity or a JI Group
Entity and (z) a BCE Group Entity, the directors that are Independent
Directors.

3.7. Information. (a) The Company will permit Investor (or a
representative of Investor) to visit and inspect any of the properties of any
Intercable Group Entity, including the books of account and other records of
such Intercable Group Entity (and make copies thereof and take extracts
therefrom), and to discuss its affairs, finances and accounts with the relevant
officers and, after notice to the Company, its independent public accountants
and counsel, all at such reasonable times and as often as Investor may
reasonably request.

(b) As soon as available and in any event within 45 days after the
close of each quarterly accounting period ending after the date hereof, the
Company will deliver to Investor the consolidated balance sheet of the Company
as of the end of such quarterly period, and the related consolidated statements
of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for such quarterly period and
for the elapsed portion of the fiscal year ended with the last day of such
quarterly period, and in each case setting forth comparative figures for the
related periods in the prior fiscal year, all of which shall be certified by
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles (subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments).

28
<PAGE> 132

(c) As soon as available and in any event within 90 days after the
close of each fiscal year of the Company, the Company will deliver to Investor
the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such fiscal year
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
cash flows for such fiscal year, in each case setting forth comparative figures
for the preceding fiscal year, and certified by Arthur Andersen & Co., or other
independent certified public accountants of recognized national standing to
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States.

(d) The Company will provide Investor with such assistance as
Investor reasonably requests from officers, employees and auditors of the
Company to enable Investor to account for its investment in the Company in its
financial statements, including assistance in the calculation and presentation
of any adjustments required to reflect generally accepted accounting principles
in Canada.

(e) The Company will furnish to Investor copies of (i) all reports,
registration statements, proxy statements or other filings made by an
Intercable Group Entity with the SEC, promptly after any such filing and (ii)
all reports, notices or other written communications (other than routine
correspondence and responses to routine inquiries) sent to holders of equity or
debt securities of, or lenders to, the Company, promptly after any such
communications are sent.

3.8. Preemptive Rights. (a) The Company hereby grants to Investor
the preemptive right to purchase Investor's Ownership Percentage of any New
Securities which the Company may propose to sell or otherwise issue from time
to time (other than Class A Shares issued pursuant to any Convertible Debt or
Convertible Debentures). The procedures described in this Section 3.8 do not
apply to purchases of Class A Shares by Investor pursuant to Section 3.1.
Investor may exercise its preemptive right with respect to any or all of the
New Securities offered to Investor pursuant to this Section 3.8.

(b) In the event the Company proposes to sell or otherwise issue
any New Securities it shall give Investor not less than 30 days' prior written
notice (a "Rights Notice") of its intention, describing the material terms of
the proposed sale, including the type of New Securities proposed to be issued,
the manner of sale and a range of proposed prices and number of shares
(including overallotments) or other securities to be sold or issued. If the
New Securities are traded, or proposed to be traded, on a national securities
exchange, the high and low end of such

range will be no greater than 110%, or lower than 90%, of the midpoint.
Investor shall have 20 days (10 days in the case of New Securities to be
offered by the Company pursuant to a shelf registration statement) from the
date of receipt of a Rights Notice to agree to purchase up to Investor's
Ownership Percentage of such New Securities, by delivery of written notice to
the Company. If the Company determines that the price or number of New
Securities to be sold or issued is not within the range specified in the Rights
Notice, or that there have been other material changes to the transaction
described in the Rights Notice, the Company will promptly deliver an amended
Rights Notice to Investor, setting forth the revised ranges for the price and
number of securities to be offered, or any other revised material terms.
Investor will have 10 Business Days after receipt of any such amended Rights
Notice to agree to purchase up to its Investor's Ownership Percentage of such
New Securities, upon the revised terms and conditions set forth in the amended
Rights Notice, by delivery of a written notice to the Company.

(c) In the case of any New Securities sold for cash, the price for
any New Securities purchased by Investor pursuant to this Section 3.8 will be
the proceeds received by the Company in connection with such sale, net of
selling commissions and underwriters discounts. In the case of any issuance of
New Securities for consideration other than cash, including issuances in
connection with an acquisition of a business (a "Special Issue"), the price at
which Investor shall purchase such New Securities shall be the Market Value of
such New Securities, calculated as described in paragraph (h) below where the
applicable "Trigger Date" is the tenth trading day immediately after the public
announcement of the agreement giving rise to the Special Issue (or if there is
no public announcement the date the transaction agreement is executed and
delivered). In the case of a Special Issue, Investor shall have five Business
Days after the determination of the Market Value to determine whether or not to
purchase Investor's Ownership Percentage of such New Securities.

(d) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, any New
Securities purchased by Investor under this Section 3.8 will be purchased
pursuant to the same terms and conditions as such New Securities are issued to
third parties, provided that so long as Investor is using its reasonable
efforts to consummate the closing promptly, Investor may postpone such closing
until such time as the Purchase Conditions have been satisfied or waived by
Investor, provided further that if such Purchase Conditions have not been
satisfied or waived within 90 days after the third party closing, Investor's
rights to purchase such New Securities hereunder will terminate and the Company
will be

30
<PAGE> 134

free to sell such New Securities without regard to Investor's rights under this
Section 3.8.

(e) In the event Investor fails to exercise its preemptive right in
accordance with the terms of this Section 3.8, the Company shall have 120 days
after the latest of (i) 20 days after delivery of a Rights Notice, (ii) 10
Business Days after delivery of an amended Rights Notice, (iii) if applicable,
the expiration of the five Business Day period described in paragraph (c)
above, or (iv), if applicable, 20 days after the expiration of the 90 day
period referred to in Section 3.8(d), to sell, or enter into an agreement to
sell (containing customary conditions), the New Securities proposed to be sold
in the Rights Notice (or the amended Rights Notice), at a price and upon
general terms no more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in
such notice. In the event the Company has not sold, or entered into such an
agreement to sell, such New Securities prior to or within said 120-day period,
the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any such New Securities without
first offering such securities to Investor in the manner provided above.

(f) In the case of Employee Options granted by the Company,
Investor's preemptive rights will be exercisable following each calendar year.
Promptly after December 31 of each calendar year, the Company will deliver to
Investor a list of the Employee Options granted during such calendar year. For
a period of 30 days after receipt of such list, Investor will have the right to
purchase from the Company a number of Class A Shares equal to the product of
(i) the highest level of Investor's Ownership Percentage during the calendar
year in question and (ii) the aggregate number of Class A Shares into which
such Employee Options are exercisable. The purchase price for such purchases
of Class A Shares will be the Market Value of the Class A Shares, calculated as
described in paragraph (h) below where the applicable "Trigger Date" is
December 31 of the calendar year in question.

(g) All sales pursuant to this Section 3.8 shall be made pursuant
to arrangements reasonably determined by the Company in order to ensure
compliance with the Securities Act.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, "Market Value" of a share of
any security means the average of the daily closing prices on the NASDAQ
National Market System (or other principal exchange on which shares of such
security is listed or approved for trading) for the shares of such security for
the 20 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the applicable Trigger
Date. The daily closing price for each such trading day shall be the closing

31
<PAGE> 135

price, if reported, or, if the closing price is not reported, the average of
the closing "bid" and "asked" prices as reported by NASDAQ (or other principal
exchange). If the daily closing price per share of such New Security is
determined during a period following the declaration of a dividend,
distribution, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction, then
the Market Value shall be properly adjusted to take into account ex-dividend
trading.

(i) In the event that a New Security is not traded on a national
securities exchange, promptly after delivery of a Rights Notice Investor and
the Company shall in good faith negotiate the Market Value of such New
Security. If they are unable to reach agreement within 10 Business Days, each
of Investor and the Company shall promptly select a nationally recognized
independent investment banking firm to determine the Market Value of such New
Security. If 20 Business Days after their selection such firms cannot agree as
to such Market Value, within 10 Business Days they shall mutually select a
third nationally recognized independent investment banking firm which shall be
engaged to make such determination, which Market Value shall be within the
range of values suggested by the two investment banking firms. Such third
investment banking firm shall make such determination by written notice to
Grantor and Purchaser within 20 Business Days of its engagement and its
judgment as to all matters relating to its determination shall be binding upon
the parties hereto. Each party will pay the fees and expenses of the initial
investment banking firm hired by such party. The fees and out-of-pocket
expenses of the third investment banking firm shall be paid equally by the
Company and Investor.

(j) For purposes of this Agreement, "Purchase Conditions" means:

(i) The waiting period (including any extension thereof
resulting from additional inquiries, if any) under the HSR Act
applicable to the purchase by Investor of the subject securities shall
have expired or been earlier terminated.

(ii) All other actions by, in respect of or filings with any
Governmental Authority required to permit the consummation of the
closing shall have been taken or obtained, as the case may be, and
shall be in full force and effect.

(iii) There shall not then be in effect any applicable law,
rule or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree that
has one or more of the effects described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of
the following paragraph (iv).

32
<PAGE> 136

(iv) There shall not then be instituted or pending any action
or proceeding before any federal or state court or other Governmental
Authority brought by a Governmental Authority challenging the
consummation of the closing or seeking to (a) prevent Investor from
exercising the Control Option, (b) require Investor to divest, or
otherwise limit Investor's ability to exercise full rights of
ownership over, the shares of Capital Stock owned by Investor and its
Affiliates, the Control Option or the Optioned Shares or (c) require,
after the exercise of the Control Option, the Intercable Group to
divest any material business or assets or would impose a material
limitation on the conduct of Intercable Group's business.

(v) The Intercable Group Entities shall have received all
material third party consents, if any, required to be obtained in
connection with the closing, in each case in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Investor.

3.9. Registration Rights. The Company grants to Investor and each
other BCE Group Entity that has agreed to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement the registration rights set forth in Exhibit A. If Investor
exercises the Control Option, the Company will grant to the JI Group
Shareholders registration rights on the same terms and conditions as the rights
set forth in Exhibit A.

3.10. Confidentiality. Each party to this Agreement will hold in
confidence and not use, and will use its reasonable efforts to cause its
respective Affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold in confidence
and not use, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process
or by other requirements of law, all documents and information received from
the other parties to this Agreement (and Affiliates of such other parties) in
connection with any information exchange contemplated by this Agreement, except
to the extent that such information can be shown to have been (i) previously
known by such party on a nonconfidential basis, (ii) in the public domain
through no fault of such party or (iii) later lawfully acquired by such party
on a non-confidential basis from sources other than another party to this
Agreement (or an Affiliate of such other party). The obligation of each party
to hold any such information in confidence shall be satisfied if they exercise
the same care with respect to such information as they would take to preserve
the confidentiality of their own similar information.

33

3.11. Certain Brokerage Fees. The parties hereto acknowledge that
any brokerage or similar fees payable pursuant to the partnership agreements of
the Cable Partnerships will be paid to The Jones Group, Ltd. pursuant to the
terms of the relevant agreements. The provisions of this Section 3.11 will
terminate on the Option Termination Date if Investor does not exercise the
Control Option.

3.12. Purchases of Additional Shares of Capital
Stock. (a) After the Closing, the Bell International Group Entities, the
Spacelink Group Entities and the JI Group Entities shall be entitled to
purchase additional shares of Capital Stock in the open market or otherwise,
and the Company will not interfere with or otherwise take action to restrict
such purchases, provided that in the event any BCE Group Entity proposes to
take an action that would increase Investor's Ownership Percentage above 79%,
Investor will conduct (or cause another BCE Group Entity to conduct) (i) a
Qualifying Tender Offer or (ii) a Qualifying Merger to implement such increase.

(b) Prior to or on the tenth anniversary of the Option Termination

elements: (i) the offer is for all of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock
not owned by a BCE Group Entity, (ii) the offer is for cash, (iii) the offeror
has received a written opinion from a nationally recognized investment bank
that such price is fair to the holders of Capital Stock from a financial point
of view, (iv) the offer has a minimum condition that 51% of the outstanding
shares of Capital Stock not owned by a BCE Group Entity shall have been validly
tendered and (v) the offer will provide that it will be extended for ten
Business Days after the offeror has publicly announced that such minimum
condition has been satisfied. After the tenth anniversary of the Option
Termination Date, "Qualifying Tender Offer" means a tender offer for all of the
outstanding shares of Capital Stock not owned by a BCE Group Entity.

(c) Prior to the time that Investor or its Affiliates have
purchased shares of Capital Stock pursuant to a Qualifying Tender Offer,
"Qualifying Merger" means a merger or similar transaction that has been
approved by (i) a majority of the members of a special committee consisting of
all the Independent Directors (which special committee may hire outside
advisors if it so chooses) and (ii) the holders of a majority of the shares of
Capital Stock not beneficially owned by a BCE Group Entity. After Investor or
any of its Affiliates have purchased shares of Capital Stock pursuant to a
Qualifying Tender Offer, "Qualifying Merger" means a merger or similar
transaction.

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND OFFER PROCEDURES

4.1. Transfer Restrictions. (a) No Bell International
Shareholder, no Spacelink Shareholder and no JI Group Shareholder will Transfer
any shares of Capital Stock or New Securities to an Affiliate of such
transferor unless such Affiliate has agreed to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement as a Shareholder and has delivered an executed counterpart of this
Agreement to the Company, Spacelink, Jones and Investor, provided that after
the Option Termination Date this Section 4.1 will apply only to Transfers of
shares of Common Stock.

(b) During the Option Period, without the consent of Investor each
of Jones and International will not, and will cause each other JI Group Entity
not to, sell any Class A Shares or Common Shares that are not Optioned Shares
except (i) to other JI Group Entities pursuant to paragraph (a) above, (ii) to
Jones Family Members that have agreed to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement as a JI Shareholder, (iii) pursuant to pledges to financial
institutions to secure bona fide borrowings by such JI Group Entity (provided
that any foreclosure transferee's interest in such shares will be subject to
the provisions of this Agreement), (iv) to BCE Group Entities or (v) pursuant
to the procedures set forth in Section 4.2. Nothing in this paragraph (b) will
be construed as restricting a JI Group Entity from making gifts to charitable
institutions, family members or other Persons.

(c) If Investor does not purchase the Control Option pursuant to
the Option Agreements, between the Option

35
<PAGE> 139

Termination Date and an Event Date no JI Group Shareholder and no Spacelink
Shareholder will Transfer any shares of Common Stock to a Person that is not a
JI Group Entity, a Spacelink Group Entity or a BCE Group Entity unless (i) such
Transfer is pursuant to an underwritten public offering or Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act, (ii) such transferee has agreed to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement as if such transferee was a JI Shareholder or Spacelink
Shareholder, as the case may be, and has delivered an executed counterpart of
this Agreement to the Company and Investor or (iii) such Transfer is pursuant
to a pledge to a financial institution to secure bona fide borrowings by such
Person (provided that any foreclosure transferee's interest in such shares of
Common Stock will be subject to the provisions of this Agreement). In addition
to the foregoing, during such period of time the JI Group Entities may Transfer
up to an aggregate of 200,000 Common Shares to charitable institutions and
pursuant to gifts; to the extent any such Transfers exceed 50,000 individually
or 200,000 in the aggregate, such Transfer may only be made if the charitable
institution or donee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as a JI
Shareholder.

(d) Any attempt by a JI Group Entity, Spacelink Group Entity or a
Bell International Group Entity to effect a Transfer of shares of Capital Stock
(including the Optioned Shares) not in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Option Agreements shall be null and void and neither the
Company nor any transfer agent shall give any effect in the Company's stock
records to such attempted Transfer.

4.2. Sales of Class A Shares by Jones. (a) During the Option
Period, the JI Group Entities may sell up to an aggregate of 15,000 Class A
Shares in any single calendar month without any obligation to offer such shares
to Investor.

(b) During the Option Period, if any JI Group Entity wishes to sell
(x) a number of Class A Shares that, when added to the sales of all JI Group
Entities during such calendar month, exceeds 15,000 or (y) any Common Shares
that are not Optioned Shares, such sale shall be made pursuant to the following
procedures:

(i) The relevant JI Group Entity (the "Offeror") shall
deliver to Investor an irrevocable written notice in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the "Sale Offer Notice") specifying the number of
Class A Shares or Common Shares offered for sale by such Offeror (the
"Offered Shares") and the average of the closing "bid" and "asked"
prices for Class A Shares or Common Shares, as the case may be, as
reported by

36
<PAGE> 140

the NASDAQ for the Business Day immediately preceding the Business Day
on which the Sale Offer Notice is delivered (the "Offer Price").
During the Offer Period (as defined below), Investor will have the
right to purchase (at its election) 100% or 50% of the Offered Shares
at a price per share equal to the Offer Price by delivery to the
Offeror of a written notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C
(the "Purchase Notice"). For purposes of this Section 4.2, the "Offer
Period" means the period beginning at the time Investor receives the
Sale Offer Notice and ending 24 hours after such time, provided that
the Offer Period will end five Business Days after such time if the
sum of (x) the aggregate proposed purchase price of the Offered Shares
and (y) any other amounts paid by Investor to any JI Group Entity
pursuant to this Section 4.2 during the 30 days immediately preceding
delivery of the Sale Offer Notice, exceeds $10,000,000.

(ii) If Investor fails to deliver a Purchase Notice to the
Offeror on or prior to the expiration of the Offer Period, the Offeror
will have the right, for a period of 30 calendar days after receipt of
the Sale Offer Notice, to sell the Offered Shares in the open market
or to any Person that is not primarily engaged in the cable television
or telecommunications business in the United States, Canada or Mexico.

(iii) If Investor timely delivers a Purchase Notice to the
Offeror, (x) the closing for the purchase and sale of the Offered
Shares covered by such Purchase Notice will take place five Business
Days after the delivery of such Purchase Notice pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 4.4, provided that Investor will have
30 days to close such purchase in cases where the Offer Period is five
Business Days, (y) the Offeror will have the right to sell any
remaining Offered Shares (A) to any person that is not primarily
engaged in the cable television or telecommunications business in the
United States, Canada or Mexico or (B) in the open market and (z)
Investor will purchase in the open market a number of Class A Shares
equal to the number of Offered Shares purchased pursuant to such
Purchase Notice, at a price per share not to exceed the Offer Price to
the extent such Class A Shares are available for purchase at such
price during the 60 calendar days after the delivery by Investor of a
Purchase Notice.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, without Investor's prior written
consent during the Option Period the JI Group Entities may not sell more than
900,000 Class A Shares in the aggregate during any period of twelve

37
<PAGE> 141

consecutive calendar months, calculated on a cumulative basis and adjusted for
prior sales of Class A Shares by the JI Group Entities. If the JI Group
Entities wish to sell more than an aggregate of 900,000 Class A Shares in any
such twelve month period for tax, estate planning or other unanticipated bona
fide liquidity needs, the JI Group Entities will have the right to sell such
Class A Shares; Jones and such JI Group Entity will consult with Investor and
the Company as to the proposed plan of distribution and such JI Group Entity
shall use its reasonable best efforts to develop a plan of orderly disposition
of such Class A Shares. Such plan shall take into account any projected
offerings by the Company of Capital Stock during the next 12 month period.

4.3. Purchases of Class A Shares by Bell International Group
Entities. During the Option Period, the Bell International Group Entities may
purchase up to an aggregate of 15,000 Class A Shares in any single calendar
month without any obligation to offer to purchase such Class A Shares from any
other Shareholder. During the Option Period, if any Bell International Group
Entity wishes to purchase a number of Class A Shares that, when added to the
purchases of all Bell International Group Entities during such calendar month,
exceeds 15,000, Investor or the relevant Bell International Group Entity (the
"Purchaser") will first offer to purchase of such Class A Shares from Jones (or
any JI Group Entity designated by Jones) pursuant to the following procedures:

(i) Purchaser shall deliver to Jones an irrevocable
written notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Purchase
Offer Notice") specifying the number (the "Purchase Number") of Class
A Shares that Purchaser is offering to purchase, and the average of
the closing "bid" and "asked" prices for Class A Shares as reported by
NASDAQ for the Business Day immediately preceding the Business Day on
which the Purchase Offer Notice is delivered (the "Proposed Price").
For a period of 48 hours after receipt of a Purchase Offer Notice,
Jones (and any JI Group Entity designated by Jones) will have the
right to sell to Purchaser an aggregate number of Class A Shares equal
to (but not less than) the Purchase Number, at a price per share equal
to the Proposed Price, by delivery to Investor of a written notice in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Sale Notice").

(ii) If Jones (or his designee) fails to deliver a Sale
Notice to Purchaser prior to the expiration of the 48 hour period
specified in paragraph (i), Purchaser will have the right, for a
period of 30 calendar days after delivery of the

38
<PAGE> 142

Purchase Offer Notice, to purchase a number of Class A Shares equal to
or less than the Purchase Number.

(iii) If Jones (or his designee) timely delivers a Sale
Notice to Purchaser, (x) the closing for the purchase and sale of the
Class A Shares will take place five Business Days after delivery of
such Sale Notice pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 4.4
and (y) Purchaser will purchase in the open market a number of Class
A Shares equal to the Purchase Number at a price per share not to
exceed the Proposed Price to the extent such Class A Shares are
available for purchase at such price during the 60 calendar days
after the receipt by Investor of a Sale Notice.

4.4. General Offer Procedures. (a) The delivery of a Purchase
Notice or a Sale Notice will constitute a contract between the relevant Bell
International Group Entity and the relevant JI Group Entity for the purchase
and sale of (i) in the case of a Purchase Notice, the Offered Shares at a price
per share equal to the Offer Price, and (ii) in the case of a Sale Notice, a
number of Class A Shares equal to the Purchase Number at a price per share
equal to the Proposed Price.

(b) So long as Investor is using its reasonable efforts to
consummate a closing under this Article IV promptly, Investor may postpone a
closing pursuant to Section 4.2 (but not Section 4.3) until such time as the
following conditions have been satisfied or waived by Investor:

(i) The waiting period (including any extension thereof
resulting from additional inquiries, if any) under the HSR Act
applicable to the purchase by Investor of the subject securities
shall have expired or been earlier terminated.

(ii) All other actions by, in respect of or filings with the
Federal Communications Commission (or similar federal agency), if
any, required to permit the consummation of the closing shall have
been taken or obtained, as the case may be, and shall be in full
force and effect.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Purchase Conditions have
not been satisfied or waived within 40 days after the delivery of a Purchase
Notice, the relevant Offeror will be free to sell the Offered Shares without
restriction.

(d) The purchase price for any Class A Shares purchased pursuant to
Sections 4.2 or 4.3 will be paid by

39
<PAGE> 143

wire transfer in immediately available funds to a bank account designated by
the relevant JI Group Entity not less than three Business Days prior to
closing, provided that upon the mutual agreement of Investor and such JI Group
Entity all or a portion of the purchase price may be paid in shares of common
stock of BCE Inc. or another BCE Group Entity.

(e) At any closing hereunder, the relevant JI Group Entity will
deliver to Investor good and valid title to the Class A Shares or other shares
of Capital Stock being sold, free and clear of any Lien.

(f) The parties hereto recognize that the offer periods in Sections
4.2 and 4.3 are short and that written communications will be delivered by
facsimile transmission. Any party delivering a notice pursuant to Sections 4.2
and 4.3 will use reasonable efforts to contact by telephone a representative of
the other party to notify him or her of the content of such notice.

4.5 Termination of Article IV. The provisions of Sections 4.2, 4.3
and 4.4 will terminate on the Option Termination Date and the provisions of
Section 4.1 will terminate as provided therein.

Intercable Group conducts business or third party that are necessary in
connection with the exercise by Investor of the Control Option.

(b) During the Option Period, if any Intercable Group Entity renews

to an event of default, right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
thereunder or (iii) cause a loss of any material benefit to which an Intercable
Group Entity is entitled.

5.3. Further Assurances. In the event Investor exercises its right
to purchase the Optioned Shares, the Company, Spacelink, Jones, International

shall be deemed to prevent or restrict Jones, International, Spacelink or any
other JI Group Entity or Spacelink Group Entity from voting the Optioned Shares
in its sole discretion on all matters, except as otherwise agreed in this
Agreement.

5.5. Deemed Exercise. For all purposes of this Agreement, Investor

Control Option and purchases the Optioned Shares pursuant to the terms of the
Option Agreements.

Jones, International nor the Company, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries,

Re: Fee Sharing Agreement

Dear Mr. Somers:

Reference is made to that certain Financial Services Agreement (the
"Agreement") between Jones Intercable, Inc. ("Intercable") and Jones Financial
Group, Inc. (the "Company"), dated as of the date hereof, a copy of which is
attached as Exhibit A.

In consideration of the assistance provided or otherwise made
available to the Company by Bell Canada International, Inc. ("BCI") in
connection with the Company's performance of the Agreement, and for other good
and valuable consideration, the Company hereby agrees to pay to BCI fifty
percent (50%) of the Net Fees paid to the Company by Intercable under the
Agreement. "Net Fees" shall mean the gross amount of funds received by the
Company from Intercable pursuant to paragraph 3(a) of the Agreement, less
reasonable and customary expenses incurred by the Company in its performance of
the Agreement (including salaries, bonuses and other operating expenses). Net
Fees shall not include any of the fees paid to the Company by Intercable
pursuant to Section 5.12 of the Stock Purchase Agreement referenced in the
Agreement. BCI's share of Net Fees shall be payable by the Company to BCI
within 30 business days after receipt of collected funds from Intercable
pursuant to the Agreement. If all reasonable and customary expenses that may
be deducted from the amount paid by Intercable to the Company pursuant to the
Agreement to arrive at Net Fees have not been finally determined at the time a
payment is due to BCI hereunder, the Company may estimate such expenses in
calculating Net Fees. All payments hereunder shall be subject to final
adjustment at
<PAGE> 165
Mr. Daniel E. Somers
(Closing Date), 1994
Page 2

such time as such costs and expenses have been fully determined. BCI may
inspect the books and records of the Company upon reasonable notice to the
Company to verify the amount of the Net Fees.

This letter agreement shall terminate simultaneously with the
termination of the Agreement.

If the foregoing correctly sets forth the understanding and agreement
between BCI and the Company, please so indicate in the space provided for that
purpose below, whereupon this letter shall constitute a binding agreement as of
the date first above written.

Very truly yours,

JONES FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

(FORM OF IDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT
TO COME)

<PAGE> 167

EXHIBIT G

It is a condition to the Reorganization that Intercable shall have
received an opinion from Davis, Graham & Stubbs or Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher & Flom, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Special
Committee of Intercable, as advised by counsel, substantially to the effect set
forth below. If the firm rendering the opinion believes it has complied with
this condition, but the Special Committee of Intercable (as advised by counsel)
nevertheless believes that the opinion is not reasonably satisfactory, and the
disagreement cannot be resolved, then the firm rendering the opinion and the
counsel to the Special Committee will jointly select a third law firm to
determine whether such dissatisfaction with the opinion is reasonable, and the
Special Committee will reconsider its initial conclusion in light of the
determination of such third firm.

This opinion may be qualified in the following manner: (i) counsel
may rely upon customary certificates of officers and directors of Intercable,
Spacelink, International and of other persons (including a representation with
respect to the arms-length nature of the transactions between International,
Intercable, BCI and all related parties), (ii) the transfer of the Common Stock
of Intercable from International to a not wholly-owned (Newco) and the issuance
of the Control Option following the Reorganization should not violate the
continuity of interest requirements recognizing the absence of authority on
point, (iii) regulations may be promulgated under Section 337(d) of the Code
which could affect the tax-free status of the Reorganization, (iv) such opinion
is based on the applicable provisions of the Code, Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, pertinent judicial authorities, interpretive rulings of
the Service and other relevant authorities and that such statutes, regulations,
judicial decisions and administrative interpretations are subject to change at
any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect and that a change
in the authority upon which such opinion is based could affect such conclusion,
and (v) any additional qualifications which are reasonable and customary for an
opinion of a similar nature.

The opinion would state that, based upon and subject to the
foregoing and on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth
in such opinion which are consistent with the state of facts existing at the
Effective Time and recognizing the absence of authority regarding (i) the
applicability of Revenue Ruling 78-47 if an actual transfer of stock could not
be accomplished under corporate law and (ii) the applicability of the
liquidation-reincorporation doctrine to the transfer of Common Stock to
(Newco), the Reorganization will be treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code.

to Dissenting Shareholders and the distribution of all of its assets to
shareholders in complete liquidation pursuant to Section 5.11(c), Spacelink
shall transfer to Intercable any cash remaining in the Reserve established
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), together with any of the Shares which would
otherwise have been distributed to Dissenting Shareholders. Upon completion of
such steps, Spacelink shall forthwith execute and file Articles of Dissolution
