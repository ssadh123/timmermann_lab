as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
at the Effective Time (as defined below). Following the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to and
assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective
when the Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that, upon
mutual consent of the Constituent Corporations the Certificate of Merger may
provide for a later date of effectiveness of the Merger not more than 30 days
after the date the Certificate of Merger is filed. When used in this
Agreement, the term "Effective Time" shall mean the later of the date and time
and "Effective Date" shall mean the later of the date at which the Certificate
of Merger is accepted for record or such later time so established by the
Certificate of Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made
as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
the Merger set forth herein.

Section 1.3 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 251 of the DGCL.

Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws; Directors
and Officers of Surviving Corporation. (a) The Certificate of Incorporation
and By-laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.

-2-
<PAGE> 10
(b) The directors of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office from the Effective
Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified. The officers of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5 Conversion of Securities. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any stockholder
of the Company:

(a) All shares of Company Stock that are held in the treasury of
the Company or by any wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of the Company
and any shares of Company Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other wholly- owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and no capital stock of Parent or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; provided, however, that
the 220,000 shares of Company Class B Stock held by DEKALB Energy Canada Ltd.
shall remain outstanding and not be converted into shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(c) below.

(b) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub
shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
Class A Stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) Subject to the provisions of Sections 1.8 and 1.10 hereof,
each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled or to remain outstanding as
provided by and in accordance with Section 1.5(a)) shall be converted into 0.85
shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common
Stock; provided, however, that if the "Market Price" (as defined below) of
Parent Common Stock is less than $30.00, such 0.85 exchange ratio shall be
automatically increased by an amount (computed to the nearest ten-thousandth)
equal to (i) 0.0125 multiplied by (ii) the difference between $30.00 and the
Market Price; and provided further, that the resulting number shall in no event
be greater than 0.90 (in any case, the "Exchange Ratio"). All such shares of
Company Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of a Certificate (as
defined below) representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive certain dividends and other
distributions as contemplated by Section 1.7 and shares of Parent Common Stock
and any cash, without interest, in lieu of fractional shares to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 1.6.

(d) "Market Price" shall mean the average of the per share closing
prices of Parent Common Stock as reported on The New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
("NYSE") Composite Transactions Reporting System during the 10 consecutive
trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day prior to the
Effective Time.

Section 1.6 Parent to Make Certificates Available.

(a) Exchange of Certificates. Parent shall authorize a commercial
bank (or such other person or persons as shall be acceptable to Parent and the
Company) to act as Exchange Agent

-3-
<PAGE> 11
hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"). As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent in trust for the holders of
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Stock (the "Certificates") certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 1.5(c) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Stock.

(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 1.5 into shares of
Parent Common Stock a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall
contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock). Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to this Article I, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
1.6, each Certificate shall, at and after the Effective Time, be deemed to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate, the
certificate representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares as contemplated by Section 1.8 and
certain dividends and other distributions as contemplated by Section 1.7.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto (or the Exchange Agent) shall be
liable to any former holder of Company Stock for any cash, Parent Common Stock
or dividends or distributions thereon delivered to a public official pursuant
to requirements of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Parent (or the Exchange Agent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of Company Stock such amounts as Parent (or any affiliate thereof or the
Exchange Agent) is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local, Canadian,
territorial, provincial or other foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld or deducted by Parent (or the Exchange Agent), such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the former holder of the Company Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

Section 1.7 Dividends; Taxes. No dividends or other
distributions that are declared on or after the Effective Time on Parent Common
Stock or are payable to the holders of record thereof on or after the Effective
Time will be paid to persons entitled by reason of the Merger to receive
certificates representing Parent Common Stock until such persons surrender
their Certificates, as provided in Section 1.6, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.8
until such holder of such Certificate shall so surrender such Certificates.
Subject to the effect of applicable law, there shall be paid to the record
holder of the certificates representing such Parent Common Stock (i) at the
time of such surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of
any dividends or other

-4-
<PAGE> 12
distributions theretofore paid with respect to whole shares of such Parent
Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time and a
payment date prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date
or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of ]dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
having a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and
a payment date subsequent to surrender. In no event shall the person entitled
to receive such dividends or other distributions be entitled to receive
interest on such dividends or other distributions. If any cash or certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be paid to or issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates for such shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that
of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Parent (or the Exchange Agent) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any former stockholder of the Company such amount as Parent (or any affiliate
thereof or the Exchange Agent) is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local,
Canadian, territorial, provincial or other foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or deducted by Parent (or the Exchange Agent), such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the former stockholder of the Company in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

Section 1.8 No Fractional Securities. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates pursuant to this Article I, and no
Parent dividend or other distribution or stock split shall relate to any
fractional security, and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder of Parent. In lieu of
any such fractional securities, each holder of Company Stock who would
otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
upon surrender of Certificates for exchange pursuant to this Article I will at
the option of Parent either:

(i) be paid an amount in cash determined by multiplying
(a) the Market Price by (b) the fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, in which case
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, without regard to
any other cash being provided to the Exchange Agent, the amount of
cash, if any, necessary to make such payments (the "Fractional Cash
Fund"); or

(ii) be paid an amount in cash in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 1.8 representing such holder's
proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the
Exchange Agent in one or more transactions (which sale transactions
shall be made at such times, in such manner and on such terms as the
Exchange Agent shall determine in its reasonable discretion) on behalf
of all such

-5-
<PAGE> 13
holders of the aggregate of the fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock which would otherwise have been issued (the "Excess Shares").
The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed
as soon as practicable (but in all events in time to permit the
proceeds to be delivered together with the certificates representing
Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger) on the NYSE through one or
more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to
the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales
have been distributed to the holders of Company Stock, the Exchange
Agent will hold such proceeds in trust (the "Fractional Securities
Fund") for the holders of Company Stock entitled thereto. Parent
shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the
Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with this sale of the Excess
Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion, if any, of
the Fractional Securities Fund to which each holder of Company Stock
shall be entitled by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net
proceeds comprising the Fractional Securities Fund by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional Parent Common Stock
to which such holder of Company Stock is entitled and the denominator
of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Company Stock are entitled.

As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any,
to be paid to holders of Company Stock in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to
such holders of Company Stock without interest. All payments pursuant to this
Section 1.8 and any other provisions of this Agreement shall be made in U.S.
dollars.

Section 1.9 Return of Exchange Fund and Fractional Cash Fund or
Fractional Securities Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund and, if
applicable, the Fractional Cash Fund or Fractional Securities Fund, as
appropriate, which remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the
Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand of Parent, and any former stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not be liable to any former stockholders of the Company for any amount
paid to a public official pursuant to requirements of applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

Section 1.10 Adjustment of Exchange Ratio. In the event of any
reclassification, stock split or stock dividend with respect to Parent Common
Stock (or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing should occur)
during the period prior to the Effective Time, appropriate and proportionate
adjustments, if any, shall be made to the Exchange Ratio, and all references to
the Exchange Ratio in this Agreement shall be deemed to be to the Exchange
Ratio as so adjusted.

Section 1.11 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Class A Stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held
by stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal
for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the consideration provided in Section 1.5(c). Such stockholders shall
be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company
Class A Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section
262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights
to appraisal of such shares of Company Class A Stock under such Section 262
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Class A Stock in
the manner provided in Section 1.5(c).

Section 1.12 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to Sections 1.7 or 1.8) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Stock.

Section 1.13 Closing of Company Transfer Books. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of shares of Company Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

Section 1.14 Closing. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices
of Sidley & Austin, One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois at 10:00 A.M.,

aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. For purposes of this
Agreement (a) "Material Adverse Change" or "Material Adverse Effect" means,
when used with respect to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, any change
or effect that is or, so far as can reasonably be determined, may be materially
adverse to the assets, liabilities, business, condition (financial or
otherwise) or cash flows from operating activities of Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, as the case may be, (b) "Subsidiary" means any corporation, partnership,
joint venture (exclusive of any joint operating agreement) or other legal
entity of which Parent or the Company, as the case may be (either alone or
through or together with any other Subsidiary), (i) owns, directly or
indirectly, 50% or more of the stock or other equity interests the holders of
which are generally entitled to vote for the election of the board of directors
or other governing body of such corporation or other legal entity or (ii) is a

Common Stock (collectively, the "Parent Derivative Securities"), (iii)

contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, no vote or approval by
the stockholders of Parent of this Agreement, of the issuance of stock in the

registering the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Registration
Statement") and the reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of
the Parent Derivative Securities have been duly authorized by Parent's Board of
Directors. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the

security interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the Restated

or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, liens,
security interests, charges or encumbrances that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, materially
impair the ability of Parent to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby. No filing or
registration with, or authorization, consent or approval of, any U.S. federal,
state, foreign or supranational court, commission, governmental body,

Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which

the corporation, takeover, "Blue Sky" or securities laws of various states of
the United States and territories or provinces of Canada and (v) such other
consents, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the

-9-

Parent, materially impair the ability of Parent to perform its obligations
hereunder or prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 2.4 SEC Documents. Parent has timely filed with the SEC
all required documents since January 1, 1991, and will timely file all
required Parent SEC Documents between the date hereof and the Effective Time
(all such documents, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective
dates, the Parent SEC Documents complied or will comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained or will contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The consolidated financial statements of Parent included or to be
included in the Parent SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles (except, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10- Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the
notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of Parent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and statements of cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein).

Section 2.5 Absence of Material Adverse Change. Except as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date

Company), there has not been any Material Adverse Change with respect to Parent
(other than changes in laws or regulations, changes in generally accepted
accounting principles or interpretations thereof or changes in general economic

gas).

Section 2.6 Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, there are no

material adverse effect on the transactions contemplated hereby or the
performance of Parent's or the Company's obligations hereunder.

Section 2.8 Benefit Plans; ERISA Compliance. (a) Except as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date
hereof, since December 31, 1993, there has not been any adoption or material
amendment by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any collective bargaining
agreement or any bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, phantom
stock, retirement, vacation, severance, disability, death benefit,
hospitalization, medical, dependent care, cafeteria, employee assistance,
scholarship or other plan, program, arrangement or understanding (whether or
not legally binding) maintained in whole or in part, contributed to, or
required to be contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for the
benefit of any present or former officer, employee or director of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (collectively, and including all amendments thereto, for
purposes of this Section 2.8, "Benefit Plans").

(b) Each "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA")) currently maintained in whole or in part, contributed to or required
to be contributed to, by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit
of any present or former officer, employee or director of the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries ("Pension Plan") and each former pension plan that is or was
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject
of a determination letter from the IRS to the effect that such plan is
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or can still be submitted in a
timely manner to the IRS for such a letter, and no such determination letter
has been revoked nor has revocation of any such letter been threatened, nor has
any such plan been amended since the date of its most recent determination
letter or application therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its
qualification or materially increase its costs, and nothing has occurred or
failed to occur which would cause the loss of such qualification, and all
amendments required to be adopted before the Effective Time for any such
Pension Plan to continue to be so qualified have been or will be duly and
timely adopted, except that this sentence does not apply to any multiemployer
plans; provided however, that to the extent that this representation applies to
terminated pension plans, this representation refers to the qualified status of
any such plan through the time of its termination.

(c) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors or
maintains any defined benefit plan described in Section 3(35) of ERISA, or
Section 414(j) of the Code, other than any such plan which is a "multiemployer
plan" as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, and no such plan
has been terminated in a manner that resulted in any liability of Parent and/or
any Subsidiary to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC"). No
entity, whether or not incorporated, which is deemed to be under common control
(as defined in Section 414 of the Code) with the Parent and/or any of its
Subsidiaries sponsors or maintains any such defined benefit plan.

(d) Each of the Benefit Plans sponsored by, and each of the
benefit plans formerly sponsored by, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries: (A) has
been in substantial compliance with all reporting and disclosure requirements
of (i) Part 1 or Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, if applicable, or (ii) other
applicable law, (B) has had the appropriate required Form 5500 (or equivalent
annual report) filed, timely, with the appropriate Governmental Entity for each
year of its existence, (C) has at all times complied with the bonding
requirements of (i) Section 412

-11-
<PAGE> 19
of ERISA, if applicable, or (ii) other applicable law, (D) has no issue pending
(other than the payment of benefits in the normal course) nor any issue
resolved adversely to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which may subject
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the payment of a material penalty,
interest, tax or other obligation, nor is there any basis for any imposition of
any such liability, and (E) has been maintained in all respects in compliance
with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable law
(including all rules and regulations issued thereunder) not otherwise covered
hereunder so as not to give rise to any material liabilities to Parent or its
Subsidiaries.

(e) All voluntary employee benefit associations maintained by the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and intended to be exempt from federal income
tax under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code have been submitted to and approved as
exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code by the
United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), and nothing has occurred or
failed to occur which would cause the loss of such exemption.

(f) The execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not give rise to any, or
trigger any, change of control, severance or other similar provisions in any
Benefit Plan.

(g) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries provides material
post-retirement medical, health, disability or death protection coverage or
contributes to or maintains any employee welfare benefit plan which provides
for medical, health, disability or death benefit coverage following termination
of employment by any officer, director or employee except as is required by
Section 4980B(f) of the Code or other applicable statute, nor has it made any
representations, agreements, covenants or commitments to provide that coverage.

(h) None of the Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any officer of
the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Benefit Plans or prior
benefit plans (including the Pension Plans and prior pension plans) which are
subject to ERISA, or any trusts created thereunder, or any trustee or
administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term
is defined in Section 406, 407 or 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or
any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could subject the Parent, any
of its Subsidiaries or any officer of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 or
to any liability under Section 502(i) or (1) of ERISA which would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Parent. Neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has suffered a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as
such terms are defined in Section 4203 and Section 4205, respectively, of
ERISA) since the effective date of such Sections 4203 and 4205 for which the
Parent has any material liability outstanding.

(i) With respect to any Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan, (A) each such Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as such
term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, complies in all material
respects with any applicable requirements of Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and
Section 4980B(f) of the Code and (B) each such Benefit Plan (including any such
plan covering retirees or other former employees) may be amended or terminated
with

-12-
<PAGE> 20
respect to health benefits without material liability to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries on or at any time after the consummation of the Merger.

(j) All contributions required by law or by a collective
bargaining or other agreement to be made under the Benefit Plans with respect
to all periods through the Effective Date including a pro rata share of
contributions due for the current plan year, will have been made by such date
or provided for by adequate reserves by Parent and/or each Subsidiary. No
changes in contribution rates or benefit levels have been implemented or
negotiated (but not yet implemented), with respect to any Benefit Plan since
the date on which the information provided in the attached schedule has been
provided, and no such changes are scheduled to occur.

(k) Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has or will have any
material liability or obligation for taxes, penalties, contributions, losses,
claims, damages, judgments, settlement costs, expenses, costs, or any other
liability or liabilities of any nature whatsoever arising out of or in any
manner relating to any Benefit Plan or former benefit plan (including but not
limited to employe benefit plans such as foreign plans which are not subject to
ERISA), that has been, or is, contributed to by any entity, whether or not
incorporated, which is deemed to be under common control (as defined in Section
414 of the Code), with Parent or any Subsidiary.

(l) Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has incurred a liability for
payment of premiums to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund
pursuant to Section 9704 of the Code, which liability has not been satisfied in
full.

(m) Following the relevant periods set forth in Section 6.12 of
this Agreement, it is the intention of Parent to extend to the employees of the
Company coverage under benefit plans similar in nature to the benefit plans
afforded to employees of Parent, subject to applicable Canadian law.

Section 2.9 Director, Officer and Employee Agreements. Except as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date

unlawful or unrecorded funds, (iii) the violation of any of the provisions of
the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, (iv) the receipt of any illegal discounts
or rebates or any other violation of the antitrust laws, or (v) any

-13-
<PAGE> 21
Section 2.11 Insider Interests. Except as disclosed in the Parent
SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, no affiliate,
officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any agreement with
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any interest in any property, real or
personal, tangible or intangible, of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries except
for the normal rights as a stockholder or an employee and except for such other
matters which, under the rules of the SEC, are not required to be disclosed.

Section 2.12 Compliance with Laws. Parent and its Subsidiaries
hold all required, necessary or applicable permits, licenses, grants,
authorizations, easements, variances, exemptions, certificates, orders,
franchises and approvals necessary to own, lease and operate its material
properties and to carry on its material business as now being conducted (the
"Parent Permits") and there is no action, proceeding or investigation pending
or threatened regarding the suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent
Permits. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of the Parent Permits except where the failure to so
comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law,

arbitration award or any judgment, decree or order of any court or other
Governmental Entity, applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their

proprietary intellectual property rights and computer programs ("Intellectual
Property") currently used in the conduct of the business and operations of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to so own or otherwise
have the right to use such Intellectual Property would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The use of such
Intellectual Property by Parent and its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the
rights of any person, subject to such claims and infringements as do not,
individually or in the aggregate, give rise to any liability on the part of
Parent and its Subsidiaries which could have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, and no person is infringing on any right of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any such Intellectual Property. No claims are
pending or threatened that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing or
otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any person with regard to any
Intellectual Property.

Section 2.14 Labor Matters. There are no collective bargaining
agreements or other labor union agreements or understandings to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound, nor is
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any proceeding asserting that
Parent or any Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to
compel it to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions.
Since September 30, 1994 neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
encountered any labor union organizing activity, or had any actual or
threatened employee strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts.

repair so as to be adequate for normal operations; and (b) easements,

Section 2.17 Environmental Matters. Except to the extent, if any,
that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent: (a) Parent and its
Subsidiaries have not received notice of any violation of or investigation

environmental or pollution law, regulation, or ordinance with respect to assets
now or previously owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that

Subsidiaries to liability under any Environmental Laws, claims by third parties
under Environmental Laws or under common law or the incurrence of costs to
avoid any such liability or claim; and (d) all operators of Parent's or any of
its Subsidiaries' assets are in compliance with all terms and conditions of
such Environmental Laws, permits, licenses and authorizations, and are also in
compliance with all other limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards,

Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or held under lease or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has delivered to
Parent complete and correct copies of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation
and By-laws and of the articles or certificates of incorporation, by-laws or
other similar organizational or governing documents of its Subsidiaries.
Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each direct or indirect
Subsidiary of the Company and the number and percentage of outstanding shares
of capital stock or other ownership interests owned by the Company in such

ownership interests in the Company's Subsidiaries that are not corporations are
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and were not issued in violation
of any preemptive rights. All such stock and ownership interests are owned of
record and beneficially by the Company or the Company's Subsidiary identified
on such schedule as owning such interest, free and clear of all liens, pledges,
security interests, charges, claims and other encumbrances of any kind or
nature. Except for the capital stock and ownership interests of its
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock, equity interest or other ownership interest in any corporation,
partnership, association, joint

-18-

outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, there are no options, warrants,

which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them
is bound obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries.
There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Company, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject to approval of
the Merger by the stockholders of the Company as set forth in Section 6.1.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
(assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Sub) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the creation of any lien, security
interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the Certificate
of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any provision of the comparable
charter or organization documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any
contract, agreement, loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease or other agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise or license
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) any judgment,
injunction, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), any such
conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, liens, security interests, charges or
encumbrances that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, materially impair the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. No filing or registration with, or
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity is required by
or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) the

State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
other states in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do
business, (iv) such filings and consents as may be required under any
environmental, health or safety law or regulation pertaining to any
notification, disclosure or required approval triggered by the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) such other consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as
may be required under (a) the laws of Canada (or any territory or province
thereof) or any other foreign country in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries conducts any business or owns any property or assets or (b) the
corporation, takeover or "Blue Sky" or securities laws of various states of the
United States and territories or provinces of Canada, and (vi) such other
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings the failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, materially
impair the ability of the Company to

-20-
<PAGE> 28
perform its obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 3.4 SEC Documents. The Company has timely filed all
required documents with the SEC since January 1, 1991, and will file all
required Company SEC Documents between the date hereof and the Effective Time
(all such documents, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective
dates, the Company SEC Documents complied or will comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained or will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the
Company included or to be included in the Company SEC Documents comply or will
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect

for the benefit of any present or former officer, employee or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, and including all amendments

currently maintained in whole or in part, contributed to, or required to be
contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any
present or former officer, employee or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except for those documents relating to benefit plans that were

operations in the U.S., the Company has delivered to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of (A) each Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten
Benefit Plans, descriptions thereof), (B) the three annual reports on Form 5500
most recently filed with

-22-
<PAGE> 30
the IRS with respect to each Benefit Plan (if any such report was required),

the date of that letter, (D) the most recent actuarial report for each Benefit
Plan for which an actuarial report is required by ERISA, (E) the most recent
summary plan description for each Benefit Plan for which such summary plan
description is required by ERISA and each summary of material modifications

each trust agreement and/or group annuity contract relating to any Benefit Plan
and (G) all material correspondence for the last three years prior to the
Effective Date with the IRS or the United States Department of Labor relating
to plan qualification, filing of required forms, or pending, contemplated and
announced plan audits with respect to any Benefit Plan, except that this
sentence does not apply to any multiemployer plans.

(c) Each Pension Plan maintained and each pension plan formerly
maintained that is or was intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has been the subject of a determination letter from the IRS to the effect
that such plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or can still be
submitted in a timely manner to the IRS for such a letter, and no such
determination letter has been revoked nor has revocation of any such letter
been threatened, nor has any such plan been amended since the date of its most
recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would
adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its costs, and
nothing has occurred or failed to occur which would cause the loss of such
qualification, and all amendments required to be adopted before the Effective
Time for any such Pension Plan to continue to be so qualified have been or will
be duly and timely adopted, except that this sentence does not apply to any
multiemployer plans; provided however, that to the extent that this
representation applies to terminated pension plans, this representation refers
to the qualified status of any such plan through the time of its termination.
The Company has paid all premiums (including any applicable interest, charges
and penalties for late payment) due the PBGC with respect to each such Pension
Plan for which premiums to the PBGC are required. No such Pension Plan in
whole or in part maintained by the Company has been terminated or partially
terminated under circumstances which would result in liability to the PBGC.

(d) Each of the Benefit Plans sponsored by, and each of the
benefit plans formerly sponsored by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries:
(A) has been in substantial compliance with all reporting and disclosure
requirements of (i) Part 1 or Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, if applicable, or
(ii) other applicable law, (B) has had the appropriate required Form 5500 (or
equivalent annual report) filed, timely, with the appropriate Governmental
Entity for each year of its existence, (C) has at all times complied with the
bonding requirements of (i) Section 412 of ERISA, if applicable, or (ii) other
applicable law (D) has no issue pending (other than the payment of benefits in
the normal course) nor any issue resolved adversely to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries which may subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
the payment of a material penalty, interest, tax or other obligation, nor is
there any basis for any imposition of any such liability, and (E) has been
maintained in all respects in compliance with the applicable requirements of
ERISA, the Code and other applicable law (including all rules and

-23-
<PAGE> 31
regulations issued thereunder) not otherwise covered hereunder so as not to
give rise to any material liabilities to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(e) All voluntary employee benefit associations maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and intended to be exempt from federal
income tax under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code have been submitted to and
approved as exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code
by the IRS, and nothing has occurred or failed to occur which would cause the
loss of such exemption.

(f) The execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not give rise to any, or
trigger any, change of control, severance or other similar provisions in any
Benefit Plan other than with respect to Company Stock Options.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries provides
material post-retirement medical, health, disability or death protection
coverage or contributes to or maintains any employee welfare benefit plan which
provides for medical, health, disability or death benefit coverage following
termination of employment by any officer, director or employee except as is
required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code or other applicable statute, nor has
it made any representations, agreements, covenants or commitments to provide
that coverage.

(h) No Pension Plan or pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA
(i) that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries maintains or maintained, or
(ii) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was obligated to
contribute, other than any such plan that is or was a "multiemployer plan" (as
such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) had, as of its most recent
annual valuation date, an "unfunded benefit liability" (as such term is defined
in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA), based on actuarial assumptions which have
been furnished to Parent. None of such plans subject to Section 302 of ERISA
has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 302
of ERISA), whether or not waived. None of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
the Benefit Plans or prior benefit plans (including the Pension Plans and prior
pension plans) which are subject to ERISA, or any trusts created thereunder, or
any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction"
(as such term is defined in Section 406, 407 or 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could subject
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section 502(i) or (1) of ERISA
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No "reportable
event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to which
the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred and is
continuing with respect to any such Pension Plan, other than as may arise as a
result of the consummation of the Merger. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has suffered a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as
such terms are defined in Section 4203 and Section 4205, respectively, of
ERISA) since the effective date of such Sections 4203 and 4205 for which the
Company has any material liability outstanding.

-24-
<PAGE> 32
(i) With respect to any Benefit Plan that is a Welfare Plan, (A)
each such Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as such term is defined in
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, complies in all material respects with any

<PAGE> 34

where the failure to so own or otherwise have the right to use such
Intellectual Property would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The use of such Intellectual Property
by the Company and its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any
person, subject to such claims and infringements as do not, individually or in
the aggregate, give rise to any liability on the part of the Company and its
Subsidiaries which could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and no
person is infringing on any right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any such Intellectual Property. No claims are pending or
threatened that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing or
otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any person with regard to any
Intellectual Property.

Section 3.15 Labor Matters. There are no collective bargaining
agreements or other labor union agreements or understandings to which the

asserting that the Company or any Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor
practice or seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor organization as to
wages or conditions. Since September 30, 1994 neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has encountered any labor union organizing activity, or had
any actual or threatened employee strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or
lockouts.

Section 3.16 Insurance. Section 3.16 of the Company Disclosure

or any of its Subsidiaries has insurance contracts. All of the Company's
insurance policies or contracts of insurance are sufficient for compliance with
all requirements of law and of all agreements to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party. All insurance policies pursuant to which any such

carrier, and all premiums required to be paid have been paid in full.

meaning of Section 203 of the DGCL). Except for the approval of the Merger as
provided for in Section 6.1 of this Agreement, no other stockholder action on
the part of the Company is required for approval of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. No provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws or other governing instruments of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the terms of any rights plan or other takeover defense
mechanism of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would, directly or
indirectly, restrict or impair the ability of Parent to vote, or otherwise to
exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to, securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that may be acquired or controlled by Parent or
permit any stockholder to acquire securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on a basis not available to Parent in the event that Parent were
to acquire securities of the Company.

Section 3.28 Fairness Opinion. The Board of Directors of the
Company has received the opinion of Merrill Lynch & Co. to the effect that, as
of the date of delivery of such opinion, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the Company's stockholders.

Section 3.29 No Misrepresentation. None of the factual
information furnished in written or electronic form to Parent or its
representatives by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the
investigation by Parent with respect to this Agreement (i) was inaccurate or
false in any material respect or (ii) knowingly omitted any portion of such
information necessary to make the information that was furnished, in light of
the circumstances, not misleading in any material respect.

(b)(i) All data and information furnished by the Company to Parent or
by Parent to the Company (with the party furnishing such being
the "Disclosing Party" and the party receiving such being the
"Receiving Party", as applicable) or by such Disclosing
Party's directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants,
attorneys, accountants, affiliates, or controlling persons
(such persons collectively referred to herein as
"Representatives", as applicable), whether furnished before or
after the date hereof, and regardless of the manner in which
it is furnished, is referred to in this Agreement as
"Proprietary Information". Proprietary Information does not
include, however, information which (x) is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives, (y)

basis prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party, or (z)

Party who is not known by the Receiving Party to be (i)
otherwise bound by a confidentiality agreement with the
Disclosing Party, or (ii) not otherwise prohibited from
transmitting the information to the Receiving Party. As used
in this Agreement, the term "person" shall be broadly
interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation,
company, partnership and individual.

(ii) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Disclosing Party,
the Receiving Party agrees (x) except as otherwise required by

of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement or who otherwise
need to know the Proprietary Information for the purpose of
evaluating the Merger and to cause those persons to observe
the terms of this Section and (y) not to use Proprietary
Information for any purpose other than in connection with the
consummation of the Merger in a manner which both parties have
approved. The Receiving Party will be responsible for any
breach of the terms hereof by it or the persons or entities
referred to in clause (x) of the preceding sentence. In the
event that the Receiving Party is requested pursuant to, or
required by, applicable law or regulation or by legal process
to disclose any Proprietary Information, the Receiving Party
agrees to provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of
such request(s) to enable the Disclosing Party to seek an
appropriate protective order.

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason,
the Receiving Party will, upon request, promptly (x) either
deliver to the Disclosing Party or, at the election of the
Disclosing Party, destroy all of the copies of the Disclosing
Party's Proprietary Information as the same was furnished to
the Receiving Party and (y) furnish to the Disclosing Party a
copy of each summary, projection, analysis or extract prepared
by the Receiving Party from or based on the Disclosing Party's
Proprietary Information; provided, however, that the Receiving
Party shall not be required to furnish any information
pursuant to clause (y) in violation of any contractual or
other applicable requirement not to disclose such summary,

-43-
<PAGE> 51
projection, analysis or extract. Without prejudice to the
rights and remedies otherwise available to it, the Disclosing
Party shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of
injunction if the Receiving Party or any of its
Representatives breach or threaten to breach any of the
provisions of this Section 6.3(b); except that in no event
shall a party be liable for punitive, special, consequential,
or indirect damages. It is further understood and agreed that
no failure or delay by a party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
right, power or privilege hereunder.

(c) The Receiving Party also agrees that (except pursuant to the
Merger) for a period of one (1) year from the date of this Agreement, neither
the Receiving Party nor any of its Representatives will knowingly without the
prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Disclosing Party:

(i) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or
indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, any outstanding common
stock or direct or indirect rights to acquire any such common
stock of the Disclosing Party or any such common stock of the
Disclosing Party or any subsidiary thereof, or of any
successor to or person in control of the Disclosing Party, or
(except in the ordinary course of business) any assets of the
Disclosing Party or any subsidiary or division thereof or of
any such successor or controlling person;

(ii) make, or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, in
any "solicitation" or "proxies" to vote (as such terms are

securities of the Disclosing Party;

(iii) make any public announcement unless otherwise required by law
or stock exchange regulation with respect to, or submit a
proposal for, or offer of (with or without conditions) any

under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, in connection with
any of the foregoing.

The Receiving Party will promptly advise the Disclosing Party of any inquiry or
proposal made to the Receiving Party with respect to any of the foregoing.

purpose of resale by former stockholders of the Company who may be affiliates
of the Company or Parent pursuant to Rule 145.

Section 6.6(b), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses.

(b) The Company and Parent agree that if this Agreement is
terminated for any reason, then (A) Parent shall pay (or reimburse the Company
for) the fees and expenses of Ryder Scott Company Petroleum Engineers incurred
by the Company pursuant to Section 6.15 hereof and (B) the Company and Parent
shall share equally all out-of-pocket expenses incurred relating to (i)
printing and mailing the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement, (ii)
the SEC and any "Blue Sky" filing fees in the United States or Canada incurred
with filing the Registration Statement and (iii) the solicitation of
stockholder approvals; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated
by reason of a party's breach of this Agreement, such party shall not be
entitled to reimbursement from the other party hereto pursuant to this Section
6.6(b). Within 10 days of termination of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall deliver in writing to the other a schedule of expenses. As soon
thereafter as practicable, but not later than 20 days after termination of this
Agreement, either the Company or Parent as the case may be shall reimburse the
other so as to comply with this Section 6.6(b).

Section 6.7 Company Stock Options. (a) Parent and the Company
shall take such actions as shall be required to permit Parent to, and Parent
shall, effective at the Effective Time, (A) assume each option to purchase
shares of Company Stock which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the Company's Stock Option Plans, the long-term incentive plan
or otherwise (each a "Company Stock Option") and which remains unexercised in
whole or in part as of the Effective Time and (B) substitute shares of Parent
Common Stock for the shares of Company Stock purchasable under each such
assumed option ("Assumed Option"), which assumption and substitution shall be
effected as follows:

(i) the Assumed Option shall not give the optionee
additional benefits which such optionee did not have under the Company
Stock Option before such assumption, nor diminish the benefits which
such options did have, and shall be assumed on the same terms and
conditions as the Company Stock Option being assumed, subject to
clauses (ii) and (iii) below;

-45-
<PAGE> 53
(ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
purchasable under the Assumed Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder of the Company Stock
Option being assumed would have received upon consummation of the
Merger had such Company Stock Option been exercised (without regard to
any vesting schedule restrictions) in full for Company Stock
immediately prior to consummation of the Merger; and

(iii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
of such Assumed Option shall be an amount equal to (A) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock of the Company Stock Option
being assumed divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio.

(b) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Assumed Options, and, immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
the Assumed Options and use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any of the Assumed
Options remain outstanding.

(c) Parent agrees to offer (the "Offer"), at the Effective Time,
Parent Common Stock to the holders of Company Stock Options outstanding on the
date hereof (each right to acquire a single share of Company Stock pursuant to
a Company Stock Option being referred to herein as a "Company Option") in
accordance with this Section 6.7(c) and Section 6.8. The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange for cancellation of each Company
Option pursuant to the Offer shall be computed as follows: (i) the Market
Price computed pursuant to Section 1.5(d) shall be multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio determined pursuant to Section 1.5(c); (ii) the applicable exercise price
of each Company Option shall be subtracted from the product obtained in clause
(i) above; and (iii) the difference obtained in clause (ii) above shall be
divided by the Market Price. In the event that the Offer is not accepted as to
any Company Option, Parent shall assume such Company Option pursuant to Section
6.7(a) above.

insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available comparable coverage;
provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of five times
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof, but in
such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount. From
and after the Effective Time, Parent (i) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
all past and present officers and directors of the Company and of its
Subsidiaries to the same extent that such persons are currently entitled to be

contain terms no more favorable than those described on Section 6.13(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Parent shall maintain the Company's severance policy for
terminated employees as in effect on the date hereof, or shall replace such
policy with a policy providing equal or more favorable compensation, for a
period of at least 24 months following the Effective Time. The Company's
severance policy is set forth in Section 6.13(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

Section 6.14 Signatory Stockholder Notice. If any Signatory
Stockholder gives any notice under any of the Stockholder Agreements to any of
the officers or directors of the Company, whether orally or in writing, such
officer or director will immediately repeat or cause such notice to be conveyed

Section 6.15 Reserve Reports. Both Parent and the Company shall
have Ryder Scott Company Petroleum Engineers ("Ryder Scott") undertake an audit
of the respective parties' internal reports as of December 31, 1994 which shall
set forth (a) the estimated volume and rate of production of hydrocarbons which
may reasonably be expected to be produced from the proved reserves of their
respective properties and (b) projections as to the amount of proved reserves

proved developed non-producing reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. Each
of the parties' respective audit reports shall be prepared in accordance with
the accounting and reporting standards prescribed for use by independent
petroleum engineers in making determinations and appraisals of hydrocarbon
reserves, including, without limitation, assumptions, estimates and projections
as to production expenses, availability of reserves and rates of production set
forth in the SEC's Regulation S-X Part 210.4- 10(a), as clarified by subsequent
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins; provided, however, that in preparing such
report, Ryder Scott need only provide an audit opinion covering (i) Parent's
properties comprising not less than 70% in value of the properties included in
its most recent reserve report, (ii) 80% in value of Parent's properties not
included in such reserve report, (iii) 80% in value of the Company's
properties, and (iv) may review the evaluation by the respective parties'
petroleum engineers in accordance with the foregoing criteria of the remainder
of the respective parties' properties. Both parties shall prepare their
December 31, 1994 financial statements consistently with the Ryder Scott audit
reports provided for in this Section. Any impact of the adjustment of reserves
of Parent or the

-48-
<PAGE> 56
Company attributable to such audit reports shall be disregarded for all
purposes in determining whether any representation or warranty has been
breached by, or whether there has occurred any Material Adverse Change or
Material Adverse Effect with respect to, Parent or the Company, as the case may
be.

Section 6.16 Accrual of Expenses. Both Parent and the Company
shall accrue as liabilities on all financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") after the date hereof
all expenses required by GAAP to be accrued in the event that the Merger is
consummated and is accounted for as a pooling of interests for accounting
purposes.

-51-
<PAGE> 59
(ii) Each of Parent and Sub has corporate power
and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement
and this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Parent or Sub, as the case may be, and (assuming
due and valid authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company) constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of
Parent or Sub enforceable against Parent or Sub in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer or other similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights and by the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law).

(iii) The execution and performance by Parent and
Sub of this Agreement will not violate the Certificates of
Incorporation or By-Laws of Parent and Sub, respectively, and,
to the knowledge of such counsel, will not violate, result in
a breach of or constitute a default under any lease, mortgage,
contract, agreement, instrument, law, rule, regulation,
judgment, order or decree to which Parent and Sub is a party
or by which they or any of their properties or assets may be
bound.

approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental

behalf of Parent and Sub for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

no actions, suits or proceedings, pending or threatened
against or affecting Parent and Sub, at law or in equity or

arbitrator of any kind which seek to restrain, prohibit or
invalidate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(vi) At the time the Registration Statement became
effective, the Registration Statement (other than the

relating to or supplied by the Company as to which such
counsel expresses no opinion) complied as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder.

(vii) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to this Agreement will be, when so issued,
duly authorized, validly issued and outstanding, fully paid
and nonassessable.

-52-
<PAGE> 60
In addition, there shall be a statement to the effect that in the
course of the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement such counsel has considered the information set forth
therein in light of the matters required to be set forth therein, and
has participated in conferences with officers and representatives of
the Company and Parent, including their respective counsel and
independent public accountants, during the course of which the
contents of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement and
related matters were discussed. Such counsel has not independently
checked the accuracy or completeness of, or otherwise verified, and
accordingly is not passing upon, and does not assume responsibility
for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements
contained in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement; and
such counsel has relied as to materiality, to a large extent, upon the
judgment of officers and representatives of the Company and Parent.
However, as a result of such consideration and participation, nothing
has come to such counsel's attention which causes such counsel to
believe that the Registration Statement (other than the financial
statements, financial data, statistical data and supporting schedules
included therein, and information relating to or supplied by the
Company as to which such counsel expresses no belief), at the time it
became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the
Proxy Statement (other than the financial statements, financial data,
statistical data and supporting schedules included therein, and
information relating to or supplied by the Company, as to which such
counsel expresses no belief), at the time the Registration Statement
became effective, included any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

In rendering such opinion, counsel for Parent may rely as to matters
of fact upon the representations of officers of Parent or Sub
contained in any certificate delivered to such counsel and
certificates of public officials, which certificates shall be attached
to or delivered with such opinion. Such opinion shall be limited to
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the laws of
the United States of America.

(g) Comfort Letters. The Company shall have received, in
form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, comfort letters from
Coopers & Lybrand and Arthur Andersen LLP covering such matters with
respect to the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement as
reasonably requested by the Company.

to the Company at the Closing such other customary documents,
certificates or instruments as the Company may reasonably request.

case as contemplated or permitted by this Agreement.

consents or approvals of any third party (other than a Governmental
Entity), the failure to obtain which would (assuming the Merger had
taken place) have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, shall have
been obtained.

(c) Accounting. Based on the advice of Arthur Andersen
LLP and such other advice as Parent may deem relevant, Parent shall
have no reasonable basis for believing that following the Merger, the
combination of the Company and Sub may not be accounted for as a
"pooling of interests" in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

(d) Tax Opinion. Parent shall have received an opinion
of Mayor, Day, Caldwell & Keeton, L.L.P., in form and substance

exercise of dissenters' rights of appraisal;

(iv) The aggregate federal income tax basis of the
shares of Parent Common Stock received in exchange for shares
of Company Stock pursuant to

Merger, decreased by the amount of any tax basis allocable to
a fractional share interest for which cash is received or to
shares with respect to which dissenters' rights of appraisal
were exercised for which cash is received; and

(v) The federal income tax holding period for
shares of Parent Common Stock received in exchange for shares
of Company Stock pursuant to the Merger will include the
federal income tax holding period of such shares of Company
Stock, provided such shares of Company Stock were held as
capital assets by the holder on the Effective Date.

In rendering such opinion, Mayor, Day, Caldwell & Keeton, L.L.P., may
receive and rely upon representations contained in certificates of the
Company, Parent, Sub and on the Affiliate Agreements.

(e) Canadian Tax Opinion. Parent shall have received an
opinion of Bennett Jones Verchere, in form and substance satisfactory

Caldwell & Keeton, L.L.P. on the effect of the Merger under Delaware
corporate law, no gain or loss will be recognized by Parent, Sub or
the Company under the Income Tax Act (Canada) as a result of the
Merger.

(f) Officers' Certificate. The Company shall have
furnished to Parent a certificate, dated the Effective Time, signed by
the appropriate officers of the Company, certifying to the effect that

the authorized shares of Company Stock are as stated in this
Agreement; all outstanding shares of Company Stock are duly

such counsel, there is no existing option, warrant, right,
call, subscription or other agreement or commitment obligating
the Company to issue or sell, or to purchase or redeem, any
shares of its capital stock other than as stated in this
Agreement.

-55-
<PAGE> 63
(ii) The Company has corporate power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and this
Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Company, and (assuming the due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Sub) constitutes the
legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to
the extent enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or
other similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and by the
effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

(iii) To the knowledge of such counsel, there are
no actions, suits or proceedings, pending or threatened
against or affecting the Company or its Subsidiaries, at law
or in equity or before or by any court, governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or

Subsidiaries is a party or to which they or any of their
properties or assets may be bound.

(v) To the knowledge of such counsel, no consent,
approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental
agency or body which has not been obtained is required on

material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act

In addition, there shall be a statement to the effect that in the
course of the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement such counsel has considered the information set forth

for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements
contained in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement; and
such counsel has relied as to materiality, to a large extent, upon the

necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the
Proxy Statement (other than the financial statements, financial data,

In rendering such opinion, counsel for the Company may rely as to

shall to the extent provided therein survive the termination); provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall relieve any party

APACHE AND DEKALB TO MERGE

Houston, TX -- Apache Corporation today announced that it has entered into a
merger agreement with Calgary-based DEKALB Energy Company, under which each of
DEKALB's outstanding shares of stock will be converted into .85 to .9 shares of
Apache common stock. At Apache's closing price yesterday, the merger, including
debt, is valued at approximately $285 million. The transaction has been
approved by both boards of directors. In addition, the holders of a majority of
the DEKALB voting stock have agreed to vote for this transaction at the
shareholders' meeting which will be called to approve the merger.

The merger brings to Apache long-lived Canadian oil and gas reserves estimated
to be approximately 350 billion cubic feet (Bcf) equivalent, including 290 Bcf
of natural gas and 10 million barrels of hydrocarbon liquids. In addition,
DEKALB has probable reserves estimated at approximately 60 Bcf equivalent,
150,000 net undeveloped acres and ownership in 14 gas processing plants (six
operated).

According to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Raymond Plank, "For the past
two years, Apache has considered returning to Alberta where we conducted
successful exploration during the 1960s and 1970s before political factors led
us to sell out. Our objective has been to return through merger or acquisition
of a company that has the production, reserves and acreage position to
complement our Lower 48 operations, as well as a compatible, aggressive culture
and solid infrastructure of skilled professionals.

"Canadian exploration companies' share prices have, until recently, been
inflated by overly optimistic gas price expectations," Plank added. "These
erroneous pricing assumptions have spiked drilling and related costs above U.S.
levels. Presently, however, timing and DEKALB's strategic fit create an
opportunity to establish a presence in the largest gas reserve basin in North
America. Relatively under-explored and under-exploited, the Western
Sedimentary Basin holds the potential to build long-term shareholder value
while DEKALB's rising production profile is expected to make an immediate
contribution to Apache's 1995 results.

"We have a strong fit and good chemistry with DEKALB and look forward to moving
ahead together," Plank concluded.

Located in Alberta and British Columbia, approximately 80 percent of DEKALB's
proved reserves are in 11 fields, seven of which are operated. Current net
daily production from the properties is 63 million cubic feet of gas, 2,000
barrels of oil and
<PAGE> 2
600 barrels of natural gas liquids. Approximately 70 percent of the production
is operated.

Apache and DEKALB will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a
combined proxy statement/prospectus which, among other things, will provide for
the registration of the Apache common stock to be issued in connection with the
merger. The offering will be made only by means of a prospectus, which will be
issued to the shareholders of DEKALB after the registration statement is
declared effective. Closing is expected in the second quarter of 1995 subject
to satisfaction of certain conditions and receipt of necessary consents and
approvals.

Apache Corporation is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration
for and development and production of natural gas and crude oil. The company's
securities are traded on the New York and Chicago Stock Exchanges under the
symbol APA.
