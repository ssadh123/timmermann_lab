VALCOR REPORTS HIGHER EARNINGS

DALLAS, TEXAS . . October 25, 1994 . . Valcor, Inc.'s operating income for
the third quarter of 1994 increased 32% to $17.6 million on a 3% increase in
sales to $95.2 million. For the nine-month year-to-date period, operating
income was up 30% to $48.3 million, while sales increased 7% to $278.4 million. 
The Company's year-to-date operating margin increased to 17%, up from 14% in
1993, as higher selling prices for medium density fiberboard, the Company's
principal forest product, were a major contributor to the improvement in
earnings.

The Company's higher operating earnings more than offset the higher 1994
interest expense resulting from the Company's recapitalization completed during
the third and fourth quarters of 1993. The Company's net income increased 39%
to $9.0 million for the third quarter and increased 10% to $22.3 million for the
first nine months of the year.

Valcor, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valhi, Inc. (NYSE:VHI), is
engaged in the forest products, hardware products and fast food industries. In
connection with the registration of its 95/8% Senior Notes Due 2003, Valcor
files periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
