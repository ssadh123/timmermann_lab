UNIVERSAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES RESTRUCTURING

RICHMOND, VA., JULY 11, 1994/PRNESWIRE

Universal Corporation announced today that a plan of restructuring was
approved on June 30, 1994. The plan, which provides for the consolidation and
rationalization of operations and services in company facilities around the
world, is expected to result in a more efficient operation and better service to
the Company's customers. In addition, the Company believes that it will realize
significant annual cost savings.

A restructuring charge will be recorded in the Company's fourth fiscal
quarter which will be reported on August 4, 1994. It is expected to be in the
range of $13 million to $18 million before taxes, but the numerous calculations
necessary to quantify the precise charges have not been finalized. Savings on
an annual basis are expected to be roughly comparable to the charge, although
the full effect of the savings will not be realized until fiscal year 1996.

Universal's management reaffirmed its earlier estimate that its net income
for the fiscal year just ended would be 35-40% below that of last year before
considering the anticipated restructuring charge or the cumulative effect of the
accounting change related to postretirement medical benefits that was recorded
in the first quarter.

Universal Corporation is a diversified company with operations in tobacco,
lumber, and agri-products. Its gross revenues for the fiscal year that ended on
June 30, 1993, were approximately $3 billion.
