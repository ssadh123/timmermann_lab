UJB FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
- ------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS:
UJB Financial Corp. (UJB Financial) commenced operations on October 1, 1970 as
a New Jersey Corporation and as a bank holding company registered under the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Through its subsidiaries UJB Financial
provides a full range of banking services and certain non-bank services in a
competitive environment to individual and corporate customers. UJB Financial is
regulated by various state and Federal agencies and is subject to periodic
examinations by those regulatory authorities.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UJB
Financial and all of its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement
presentation for 1993. The reclassifications have no effect on shareholders'
equity or net income or loss as previously reported.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing the financial
statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could
significantly differ from these estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:
For the purposes of cash flow, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand,
amounts due from banks, Federal funds sold, and securities purchased under
agreements to resell. Generally, Federal funds are sold for one day periods and
securities purchased under agreements to resell are short-term, highly liquid
assets.

SECURITIES:
Securities are classified into one of three investment categories: trading
account securities, investment securities available for sale and investment
securities. Securities that are purchased and held principally with the intent
of selling in the near future are classified as trading account securities.
Securities which are intended to be held to maturity are classified as
investment securities. All other securities, including equity securities, are
classified as investment securities available for sale.
Trading account securities are reported at market value on a specific
identification basis, with gains and losses included in non-interest income.
This category includes securities purchased specifically for short-term
appreciation.
Investment securities available for sale are reported at the lower of the
aggregate cost or market. 
Investments classified as available for sale may be sold in response to 
changing market and interest rate conditions or as part of an overall 
asset/liability management strategy. Included in investment securities 
available for sale are marketable equity securities.
Investment securities are held for long-term investment and are recorded
at amortized cost. UJB Financial has both the intent and ability to hold all
securities in this category until maturity.

LOANS:
Loans are stated at principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned discount and
net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest income on loans is
accrued and credited to interest income as earned. Loan origination fees and
certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized over the
estimated life of the loan as an adjustment to the loan's yield. Other loan
fees are recorded as earned and included in non-interest income.

NON-PERFORMING LOANS:
Non-performing loans consist of commercial non-accrual and renegotiated loans.
Non-accrual loans include loans that are past due 90 days or more as to
principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely
collectibility. At the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously
accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. Interest
collections on non-accrual loans are generally credited to interest income
when received. However, if ultimate collectibility of principal is in doubt,
interest collections are applied as principal reductions. After principal and
interest payments are brought current and future collectibility is reasonably
assured, loans are returned to accrual status.
Renegotiated loans are loans whose contractual interest rates have been
reduced to below market rates or other significant concessions made due to a
borrower's financial difficulties. Interest income on renegotiated loans is
generally credited to interest income as received.
Consumer loans are charged off when they are 120 days past due. For home
equity loans, accruals cease at 180 days and uncollected interest is reversed
against interest income. Past due residential mortgage loans and home equity
loans are monitored and charged off when deemed uncollectible.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES:
The loan portfolio and other extensions of credit are regularly reviewed to
determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The impact of
economic conditions on the credit worthiness of the borrowers is given
consideration, as well as loan loss experience, changes in the composition and
volume of the loan

42

<PAGE> 6
portfolio, and management's assessment of the risk inherent in the loan
portfolio. These and other factors are used in assessing the overall adequacy
of the allowance for loan losses and the resulting provision for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings
in the form of a provision for loan losses. Losses on loans and loans which are
determined to be uncollectible are deducted from the allowance and subsequent
recoveries, if any, are added back to the allowance.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT:
Premises, furniture and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization charges are
computed using the straight-line method. Premises, furniture and equipment are
depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets, except for leasehold
improvements, which are amortized over the term of the lease or the estimated
useful life of the asset, if shorter. Estimated useful lives are ten to forty
years for premises, and three to ten years for furniture and equipment.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The
costs of major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Premises and major
items of furniture and equipment are removed from the property accounts upon
disposition at their carrying amount, and gains or losses on such transactions
are included in other non-interest income or expense.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED:
Other real estate owned includes both formally foreclosed and in-substance
foreclosed property. In-substance foreclosed property includes properties for
which borrowers have little or no equity or prospects for building equity in
the collateral and for which the loan repayment can only be expected from the
operation or sale of the collateral. In-substance foreclosed properties are
generally in the process of formal foreclosure. When a property is acquired
through foreclosure or in-substance foreclosure, the excess of the carrying
amount over fair value, if any, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
An allowance for other real estate owned has been established to maintain
these properties at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to
sell. Other real estate owned is shown net of the allowance.
The allowance is established through charges to other real estate owned
expenses. Operating results of other real estate owned, including rental
income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of
properties owned, are recorded in other real estate owned expense.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:
Interest rate swap and cap agreements are periodically used to manage interest
rate risk. The income or expense associated with these transactions is
recognized over the lives of the agreements as an adjustment to interest income
or interest expense.

INCOME TAXES:
The amount provided for income taxes is based on income reported for
consolidated financial statement purposes after elimination of income which is
exempt for Federal tax purposes. Such tax-exempt income is derived primarily
from investment securities of states and political subdivisions and certain
commercial and mortgage loans.
Prior to January 1, 1993, deferred income taxes were provided for timing
differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax reporting and
financial statement purposes, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 11. Effective January 1, 1993, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109), was adopted. SFAS 109
requires a change from the deferred method to the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred
income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of "temporary differences"
by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of
existing assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date, whereas under the deferred method, deferred taxes were not adjusted for
subsequent changes in tax rates. The cumulative effect at January 1, 1993 of
this change in the method of accounting for income taxes has been included in
the Consolidated Statement of Income, for the year ended December 31, 1993.
UJB Financial and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax
return and the amount of income tax expense or benefit is computed and
allocated to its subsidiaries within the consolidated group on a separate
return basis.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS:
Excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) relating to
subsidiaries purchased is included in other assets and is amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from ten to forty years. Goodwill
amounted to $13,561,000 and $14,775,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.
Other intangible assets are amortized on an accelerated basis over periods
ranging from five to ten years. Other intangibles amounted to $15,003,000 and
$16,781,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

RETIREMENT PLANS:
UJB Financial and its subsidiaries have several formal non-contributory
retirement plans which cover substantially all employees. Annual contributions
are made to the plans in amounts not less than the minimum regulatory
requirements. In 1993 UJB Financial adopted, on a prospective basis, Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106). The costs associated
with these benefits are accrued based on actuarial assumptions and included in
non-interest expenses.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
- -------------------------------------------------------
INCOME PER SHARE:
Income per common share is calculated by dividing net income, less the dividend
requirement on the adjustable-rate cumulative preferred stock, by the average
daily number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common stock
equivalents are not included in the calculation as they are not material.

NOTE 2 ACQUISITIONS
On December 16, 1993, UJB Financial announced a definitive agreement to acquire
VSB Bancorp, Inc., headquartered in Closter, N.J. with total assets of
approximately $379,000,000. The merger is expected to occur in the second or
third quarter of 1994.

NOTE 3 RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS
The subsidiary banks are required to maintain reserve balances with a Federal
Reserve Bank based principally upon deposits. These reserve balances averaged
$332,881,000 in 1993 and $262,577,000 in 1992.

Most of UJB Financial's business is with customers located within New
Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. A portion of the total loan portfolio is
secured by real estate. The principal areas of exposure are construction and
development, which are primarily commercial and residential projects and
commercial mortgage loans. Commercial mortgage loans are completed projects
and are generally owner-occupied, creating cash flow.
The ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and realization of the
carrying value of real estate are subject to changes in the region's real
estate market and future economic conditions.
Residential mortgage loans held for sale amounted to $33,788,000 at
December 31, 1993 and $44,731,000 at December 31, 1992. These loans are
accounted for at the lower of aggregate cost or market.
Subsidiaries of UJB Financial have granted loans to officers and
directors of the company and its significant subsidiaries and to their
associates. Related party loans are made on substantially the same terms,
including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with unrelated persons and do not involve more than
normal risk of collectibility. The aggregate dollar amount of these loans was
$80,046,000 and $98,043,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
During 1993, there were $64,801,000 of new loans made and repayments totaled
$82,798,000.

NOTE 7 NON-PERFORMING LOANS
Non-performing loans consist of commercial non-accrual and renegotiated loans.
Non-accrual loans are those on which income under the accrual method has been
discontinued with subsequent interest payments credited to interest income when
received, or if ultimate collectibility of principal is in doubt, applied as
principal reductions. Renegotiated loans are loans whose contractual interest
rates have been reduced to below market rates, or other significant concessions
made, due to a borrower's financial difficulties. Interest on these loans is
either accrued or credited directly to interest income as received.
At December 31, non-performing loans were as follows:

==================================================================================
</TABLE>

The 8.625% subordinated notes were issued in 1992 and are unsecured.
Interest is payable semi-annually on June 10 and December 10 of each year. The
notes are not subject to redemption prior to maturity. No sinking fund is
provided for the notes.
On August 19,1993 the Company issued $20,000,000 of 7.95% ten year
maturity, private placement notes with interest payable quarterly on the
twenty-fifth day of each February, May, August and November. The notes are to
mature on August 25, 2003. The Company shall have the option, on any interest
payment date, to prepay the notes in whole or in part, but in no event shall
the prepayment be less than $1,000,000 subject to certain contractual
prepayment options.
The 7.75% sinking fund debentures are currently redeemable at the option
of UJB Financial at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest. An
annual sinking fund of $700,000 is calculated to retire 52.5% of this issue
prior to maturity on November 1, 1997. UJB Financial may, at its option,
increase its sinking fund payment in any year by making an additional payment
not in excess of the mandatory sinking fund payment. The debentures are
redeemable, through the sinking fund, at the principal amount thereof plus
accrued interest. 
The 12.95% mortgage note was prepaid in whole on June 28, 1993, as
permitted by the original agreement, at a premium of $913,500. The private
placement notes were paid in full in 1993.

<PAGE> 10
The 11.50% senior notes and the 13% subordinated debentures are included
in other borrowed funds as they are expected to be paid in full in 1994.
Certain of the above long-term debt agreements include restrictions upon
the creation of liens by UJB Financial, the disposition of stock of
subsidiaries, the payment of cash dividends and the creation of funded debt, as
defined. At December 31, 1993, under the most restrictive limitations,
consolidated retained earnings of $208,483,000 were unrestricted and available
for dividends and the amount of additional funded debt, as defined, that could
be created was $249,808,000.
The principal amount of long-term debt due in the following year is
included in other borrowed funds. Principal amounts due, including sinking fund
payments, for the years 1994 through 1998 are $6,867,000, $1,225,000, $831,000,
$832,000 and $833,000, respectively.

NOTE 13 COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK
At December 31, 1993, approximately 8,241,000 common shares were reserved for
issuance under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, Incentive Stock and Option Plan,
Stock Option Plans, Savings Incentive Plan, Long-Term Performance Stock Plan
and the 1983 Equity Contracts.
At December 31, 1993, UJB Financial had 4,000,000 shares of preferred
stock authorized of which 600,166 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were
outstanding. Each outstanding share of Series B $50 stated value preferred
stock is non-convertible and has no voting rights. Dividends are cumulative and
are payable quarterly on February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each
year. For each quarterly period, the dividend rate will be determined in
advance of such period, and the dividend rate will be 1.5% less than the
highest of the Three Month Treasury Bill Rate, the Ten Year Constant Maturity
Rate and the Thirty Year Constant Maturity Rate. The dividend rate for any
dividend period will not be less than 6% per annum or greater than 11% per
annum.
The preferred stock is redeemable at the option of UJB Financial, in
whole or in part, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The preferred stock may be
redeemed prior to May 1, 1995 at a redemption price of $51.50 per share and,
thereafter, at $50 per share. Dividends in the amounts of $3.00 per share were
declared on the Series B Preferred Stock during 1993.
A Shareholder Rights Plan exists which is designed to ensure fair and
equal treatment for all UJB Financial shareholders in the event of any proposal
to acquire UJB Financial. The terms of the plan provide that, effective August
28, 1989, each share of common stock also represents one "right." Each right
will entitle the holder to buy one one-hundredth of a share of a new series of
preferred stock upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, upon the
occurrence of certain other events, holders of the rights will be entitled to
purchase either shares of this new preferred stock or shares in an "acquiring
person" at half their fair market value, as determined under the plan.

NOTE 14 RESTRICTIONS ON SUBSIDIARY BANK DIVIDENDS
Certain bank regulatory limitations exist on the availability of subsidiary
bank undistributed net assets for the payment of dividends to UJB Financial
Parent Corporation without the prior approval of the bank regulatory
authorities.
The National Bank Act which affects the three nationally-chartered banks
and the Federal Reserve Act which affects one state-member bank, restrict the
payment of dividends in any calendar year to the net profit of the current year
combined with retained net profits of the preceding two years. Each of the
three state-chartered banks may declare a dividend only if, after payment
thereof, its capital would be unimpaired and its remaining surplus would equal
50 percent of its capital (New Jersey) or 100 percent of its capital
(Pennsylvania). At December 31, 1993, the total undistributed net assets of the
subsidiary banks were $858,299,000 of which $96,920,000 was available under the
most restrictive limitations for the payment of dividends to UJB Financial
Parent Corporation.

NOTE 15 BENEFIT PLANS
UJB Financial has several trusteed non-contributory defined benefit retirement
plans covering substantially all of its employees. The benefits are based on
years of service and the employees' final average compensation. The funding
policy of UJB Financial is to contribute annually an amount that can be
deducted for Federal income tax purposes. Contributions are intended to provide
not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those
expected to be earned in the future.
The following table sets forth the plans' funding status and amounts
recognized in the consolidated financial statements of UJB Financial at
December 31:

The plans' assets were principally invested in units of mutual funds.
The weighted average discount rate was 7.5% in 1993, 8.0% in 1992, and 8.5% in
1991. The rate of increase in future compensation levels used in determining
the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was 5.5% in
1993, 6.0% in 1992, and 6.5% in 1991. The expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets was 9.0% in 1993, 1992 and 1991.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
- -------------------------------------------------------
Management incentive plans have been established with the intention of
providing added incentive to key executives to increase the profits of the
company. The executives and the amount of the awards are subject to limits as
set forth in the plans. Accruals for the plans amounted to $1,640,000,
$1,420,000 and $958,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
There is a Savings Incentive Plan which covers substantially all employees
with one or more years of service. The Plan permits eligible employees to make
basic contributions to the Plan up to 3% of base compensation in 1993, 1992 and
1991, and additional contributions up to 12% of base compensation. Under the
Plan, the employer provides a matching contribution equal to 65% in 1993 and
1992 and 55% in 1991 of the basic contributions. Matching contributions to the
Plan amounted to $2,084,000, $1,863,000, and $1,651,000, in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.
Certain subsidiaries have other incentive plans and profit sharing 
agreements. Accruals under these plans amounted to $1,622,000, $1,402,000, and
$949,000, in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
The Incentive Stock and Option Plan and previous Long-Term Performance 
Stock Plans provide for the grant of shares of common stock in the form of 
Restricted Stock Awards. Shares issued as stock awards were 68,702 in 1993, 
83,210 in 1992 and 134,160 in 1991. The shares awarded are subject to certain 
forfeiture restrictions as set forth in the Plan.
In addition to pension benefits, certain health care and life insurance
benefits are made available to retired employees. In 1993 UJB Financial
adopted, on a prospective basis, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions" (SFAS 106). Under SFAS 106 the costs of such benefits are accrued
based on actuarial assumptions from the date of hire to the date the employee
is fully eligible to receive the benefits. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 106,
the costs of these benefits were expensed as paid and amounted to $1,039,000 in
1992 and $847,000 in 1991.
The following table sets forth the net periodic postretirement benefit
cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) at December 31,
1993:

For measurement purposes, the cost of medical benefits was projected to
increase at a rate of 15.0% in 1993, thereafter decreasing linearly to 6.0%
over 9 years. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percent in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of January 1, 1993 by $1,464,000 and the aggregate of the service and interest
components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended
December 31, 1993 by $100,000. The present value of the accumulated benefit
obligation assumed a 7.5% discount rate. The rate of increase used in future
compensation levels was 5.5% in 1993.

NOTE 16 STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Stock Option Plans permit UJB Financial common stock to be issued to key
employees of the company and its subsidiaries. The options granted under the
Plans are intended to be either Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified
Options.
Options have been granted to purchase common stock principally at the fair
market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options are exercisable
starting one year after the date of grant and generally expire ten years from
the date of grant. Upon the exercise of options, proceeds received in excess of
par value of the shares are credited to surplus.
Changes in options outstanding during the past three years
were as follows:

NOTE 18 INCOME TAXES
In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS
109). This Statement

48

<PAGE> 12
changes the method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method,
required under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11, to the asset and
liability method. The Statement addresses temporary differences and the basis
of certain assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting
purposes. A deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary
differences and a deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary
differences.
Effective January 1, 1993, SFAS 109 was adopted on a prospective basis.
The cumulative effect of the adoption resulted in a positive effect to earnings
of $3.8 million or $.07 per share.
The provision (benefit) for income taxes in the consolidated statement of
income consists of the following:

Included in deferred tax assets "Other" is a valuation allowance which has
been established against certain Federal and state temporary differences. The
valuation allowance was $7,346,000 at December 31, 1993 compared with
$7,150,000 at January 1, 1993. At December 31, 1993, there was a deferred state
tax asset of $3,975,000 resulting from operating loss carryforwards. This
asset was reserved by the valuation allowance.
UJB Financial is not aware of any factors which would generate significant
differences between taxable income and pretax book income in future years
except for the effects of the reversal of current or future net deductible
temporary differences. However, there can be no assurances that there will not
be any significant differences in the future, if circumstances change.
Management believes, based upon current facts, that more likely than not
there will be sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the net
deferred tax asset. However, there can be no assurance about the level of
future earnings.

NOTE 19 LEASE COMMITMENTS
Non-interest expenses include rentals for premises and equipment of $34,435,000
in 1993, $31,969,000 in 1992 and $28,955,000 in 1991, after reduction for
sublease rentals of $2,894,000, $3,164,000, and $2,873,000 in each of the
respective years. At December 31, 1993, UJB Financial and its subsidiaries were
obligated under a number of non-cancellable leases for premises and equipment,
many of which provide for increased rentals based upon increases in real estate
taxes and the cost of living index. These leases, most of which have renewal
provisions, are principally non-financing leases. Minimum rentals under the
terms of these leases for years 1994 through 1998 are $33,014,000, $28,382,000,
$23,287,000, $16,167,000, and $10,275,000, respectively. Minimum rentals due
after 1998 are $26,143,000.

NOTE 20 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
UJB Financial and its subsidiaries may, from time to time, be defendants in
legal proceedings relating to the conduct of their business. UJB Financial is a
defendant in a purported class action lawsuit brought by plaintiffs alleged to
have owned or purchased securities of UJB Financial. Violations of Federal
securities laws and New Jersey common law are alleged. Discovery by both
parties is in process.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
- -------------------------------------------------------
The Board and management of UJB Financial believe the allegations
contained in the lawsuit to be lacking in merit and intend to defend this
lawsuit vigorously. Management believes the consolidated financial position of
UJB Financial and subsidiaries will not be affected materially by the final
outcome of any pending legal proceedings.

NOTE 21 OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
UJB Financial and its subsidiaries enter into a variety of financial
instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business.
These financial instruments include interest rate swaps, commitments to extend
credit and standby letters of credit, each of which involve, to varying
degrees, elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial
statements.
Included in financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk are
derivatives which are primarily attributable to asset and liability management
efforts. The notional amount of interest rate swaps at December 31, 1993 and
1992 was $1,019,000,000 and $161,300,000 respectively.
Credit risk, the risk that a counterparty of a particular financial
instrument will fail to perform, is the contract amount of commitments to
extend credit and standby letters of credit. The credit risk associated with
these financial instruments is essentially the same as that involved in
extending loans to customers. Credit risk is managed by limiting the total
amount of arrangements outstanding and by applying normal credit policies to
all activities with credit risk. Collateral may be obtained based on
management's credit assessment of the customer.
The contract amounts of off-balance-sheet financial instruments at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 for commitments to extend credit were 
$3,656,141,000 and $3,431,459,000, respectively, and for standby letters of 
credit were $224,291,000 and $258,302,000, respectively.
Many of the commitments to extend credit are expected to expire without
being drawn upon and, therefore, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash flow requirements.

NOTE 22 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the asset or
obligation could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair value estimates are made at a
specific point in time based on relevant market information and information
about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or
discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire
holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market value exists
for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates
are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current
economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments,
and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve
uncertainties and matters of judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with
precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
Fair value estimates are determined for on and off-balance-sheet financial
instruments, without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future
business, and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered
financial instruments. Additionally, tax consequences related to the
realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a potential effect on
fair value estimates and have not been considered in many of the estimates.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of significant financial instruments.

FINANCIAL ASSETS:
The carrying amounts of cash, short-term investments, due from customers on
acceptances, and bank acceptances outstanding are considered to approximate
fair value. Short-term investments include Federal funds sold, securities
purchased under agreements to resell, and interest bearing deposits with banks.
The fair values of investment securities, including available for sale, are
generally based on quoted market prices. The fair value of loans are estimated
using a combination of techniques, including discounting estimated future cash
flows and quoted market prices of similar instruments, where available.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES:
The carrying amounts of deposit liabilities payable on demand, commercial paper
and other borrowed funds are considered to approximate fair value. For fixed
maturity deposits, fair value is estimated by discounting estimated future cash
flows using currently offered rates for deposits of similar remaining
maturities. The fair value of long-term debt is based on rates currently
available to UJB Financial for debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:
The fair value of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is
estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and caps, entered into in order to manage
interest rate risk, are based on dealer quotes. At December 31, 1993 the fair
value of these instruments was ($1,233,000).
The estimated fair value of financial instruments at December 31, is
summarized as follows:

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

The management of UJB Financial Corp. and its subsidiaries has the
responsibility for preparing the accompanying financial statements and for
their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances
and include amounts that are based on management's best estimates and
judgments. Other financial information presented throughout this annual report
is prepared on a basis consistent with these financial statements.
The financial statements of UJB Financial Corp. have been audited by KPMG
Peat Marwick, independent auditors, whose selection has been ratified by the
shareholders. Their audit was made in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards and considered the internal control structure to the extent
deemed necessary to support their independent auditors' report appearing
herein.
Management has the responsibility for establishing and maintaining an
internal control structure designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets
are safeguarded and protected and financial reporting is reliable. Judgments
are required to assess and balance the relative cost and the expected benefits
of these controls. To monitor compliance, UJB Financial Corp. maintains an
internal auditing program. This program includes a review for compliance with
written policies and procedures and a review of the adequacy and effectiveness
of internal controls.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of UJB Financial Corp.,
composed exclusively of outside directors, meets periodically with the
independent auditors, management, and internal auditors to review the work of
each and ensure that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The
internal auditors and independent auditors have full and free access to the
Committee to discuss the results of their audit work and their evaluation of
internal controls and the quality of financial reporting.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Shareholders and Board of Directors
UJB Financial Corp,:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UJB Financial
Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UJB
Financial Corp. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" in 1993.
