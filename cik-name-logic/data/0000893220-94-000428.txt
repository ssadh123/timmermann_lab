CIGNA'S THIRD QUARTER 1994 RESULTS

PHILADELPHIA, OCTOBER 31, 1994 -- CIGNA Corporation (NYSE:CI) today reported
third quarter 1994 consolidated net income of $123 million ($1.70 per share),
compared with a loss of $94 million ($1.31 per share) a year ago. For the nine
months of 1994, consolidated net income was $372 million ($5.14 per share),
compared with $40 million ($0.55 per share) a year ago.

OPERATING INCOME*
- -----------------

Operating results for the third quarter and nine months of 1994 improved over
comparable periods of 1993. The third quarter operating results were $122
million of income versus a loss of $167 million in 1993. For the nine months
of 1993 operating income was $342 million versus a loss of $82 million in 1993.

"Our health, pension and life insurance businesses continue to produce strong
earnings and returns. The Property and Casualty fundamentals are beginning to
show improvement. The decision to exit the property and casualty reinsurance
business underscores our commitment to focus on those businesses that can
improve shareholder returns," said Wilson H. Taylor, CIGNA's Chief Executive
Officer.

* Operating income is defined as net income excluding realized investment gains
and losses.
<PAGE> 2
- 2 -

The third quarter and nine months of 1994 reflect a $9 million after-tax charge
for CIGNA's substantial withdrawal from the property and casualty reinsurance
business and a $26 million after-tax charge for property and casualty
reinsurance reserve strengthening. The third quarter and nine months of 1993
reflect a $244 million after-tax charge for asbestos and environmental
litigation expenses, a $107 million after-tax restructuring charge and a
benefit of $48 million from the federal income tax rate change.

The 1994 third quarter operating income, adjusted to eliminate the items
discussed above and shown on the supplemental financial information page, was
$149 million versus $143 million in 1993. For the nine months of 1994,
operating income excluding those items was $369 million versus $228 million in
1993.

REALIZED GAINS/LOSSES
- ---------------------

The 1994 third quarter consolidated net income includes after-tax realized
investment gains of $1 million ($0.01 per share), compared with gains of $73
million ($1.01 per share) for the same period of 1993. For the nine months of
1994, consolidated net income included after-tax realized investment gains of
$30 million ($0.41 per share), compared with gains of $122 million ($1.69 per
share) for the same period of 1993.

REVENUES
- --------

Consolidated revenues for the third quarter of 1994 were $4.6 billion, compared
with $4.5 billion for 1993. For the first nine months of 1994, consolidated
revenues were $13.7 billion, versus $13.5 billion in 1993.

ASSETS/SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
- ---------------------------

Assets at September 30, 1994 were $86.0 billion, compared with $85.0 billion at
year-end 1993. Shareholders' equity was $5.9 billion ($81.68 per share) at
September 30, 1994, compared with $6.6 billion ($91.30 per share) at December
31, 1993. During the nine months of 1994, shareholders' equity decreased
approximately $700 million due to upward movement in interest rates, which
reduced the unrealized appreciation of securities carried at fair value. The
new mark to market SFAS 115 requirement will result in fluctuations in
shareholders' equity.

SEGMENT RESULTS:

Segment results are discussed excluding the previously referenced adjustments:

EMPLOYEE LIFE AND HEALTH BENEFITS
- ---------------------------------

This segment, which includes CIGNA's HMO and Indemnity operations, had
operating income of $132 million in the third quarter of 1994. This compares
with operating income of $134 million in the third quarter of 1993. For the
nine months of 1994, operating income was $381 million, compared with $309
million in 1993.

Indemnity results declined in the third quarter from $88 million to $81
million. Year-to-date 1994 results remain strong at $221 million compared with
$195 million for 1993. HMO operations had operating income of $51 million for
the third quarter of 1994, compared with $46 million for the same period of
last year. For the nine months of 1994, HMO operating income was $160 million,
compared with $114 million in 1993. These HMO improvements are attributable to
good membership growth and favorable medical cost experience.
<PAGE> 4
- 4 -

HMO medical membership grew by 122,000 to approximately 3.2 million enrollees
in the third quarter of 1994, a 24% increase over third quarter 1993 levels.
Year to date membership has grown by 549,000 enrollees.

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS BENEFITS
- ----------------------------------------

This segment, which operates in the defined benefit and defined contribution
markets, had operating income of $46 million in the third quarter of 1994.
This compares with operating income of $43 million in the third quarter of
1993. For the nine months of 1994, operating income was $138 million, compared
with $131 million in 1993.

The third quarter 1994 increase reflects improved interest margins on defined
contribution business and higher earnings from an increased asset base.

Assets under management at September 30, 1994 were $34.3 billion, an increase
of 2 percent from $33.6 billion as of September 30, 1993.

INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL SERVICES
- -----------------------------

This segment, which includes individual and corporate-owned life insurance,
life and health reinsurance, and annuity businesses, had operating income of
$33 million in the third quarter of 1994. This compares with operating income
of $29 million in the third quarter of 1993. For the nine months of 1994,
operating income was $96 million, compared with $82 million in 1993. The third
quarter 1994 results reflect improved earnings on interest-sensitive business.

$226 million in 1993.

126 for the third quarter and nine months of 1994, compared with 162 and 139
for the comparable periods of 1993. Excluding the referenced adjustments,
