MULTIMEDIA ESTIMATES RESULTS FOR 1994

GREENVILLE, S.C. - OCT. 5, 1994 -- In a meeting today with
analysts and investors Multimedia, Inc. announced that it expects
its 1994 earnings from ongoing operations to be in the range of
$1.95 to $1.97 per share, up about four percent from the $1.88
earned in 1993. It expects operating cash flow* from ongoing
operations to be about $250 million, a five percent increase. 
Both the projections for earnings and cash flow from ongoing
operations are in line with what the Company announced that it
expected for the year on February 15.

The projections for earnings and cash flow* from ongoing
operations exclude prelaunch and first-year expenses for the
Company's Talk Channel, a cable service that premiered on Oct. 1. 
Those expenses are expected to be $9 million for 1994, based on
100% ownership. However, those expenses will be more than offset
by gains on the sale of radio stations and wireless operations.

Multimedia, Inc. is a diversified media company headquartered in
Greenville, S.C., which publishes 11 daily and 49 non-daily
newspapers, owns and operates five television and five radio
stations, operates 125 cable franchises in five states, monitors
approximately 60,000 security alarm subscribers, and produces and
syndicates quality television programming, including DONAHUE;
SALLY JESSY RAPHAEL; JERRY SPRINGER; RUSH LIMBAUGH, THE
TELEVISION SHOW; SUSAN POWTER and DENNIS PRAGER.

* Operating cash flow, as defined by The Company, is operating
profit plus depreciation and amortization, and amortization of
stock awards and stock options.
