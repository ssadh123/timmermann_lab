Item 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

Pursuant to the Partnership Acquisition Agreement (the "Merger Agreement"),
dated as of October 27, 1993, among La Quinta Inns, Inc., a Texas corporation
(the "Registrant"), La Quinta Motor Inns Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited
partnership (the "Partnership"), La Quinta Realty Corp., a Texas corporation,
LQI Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser"), and LQI
Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation, on December 1, 1993, the Registrant,
through the Purchaser, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant,
acquired through a tender offer (the "Offer") 2,805,190 units of limited
partnership interest in the Partnership ("Units") (representing approximately
70.6% of the presently outstanding Units) for $13.00 net in cash per Unit. As a
result of the contribution by the Registrant of 452,700 additional Units
subsequent to the termination of the Offer, the Purchaser beneficially owns
3,257,890 Units (representing approximately 82.0% of the presently outstanding
Units). The Registrant may also be deemed to beneficially own the Units both
acquired by and contributed to the Purchaser.

The Purchaser obtained the funds to acquire the Units through the Offer
as a result of a capital contribution by the Registrant. In order to make such
a capital contribution to the Purchaser, the Registrant borrowed approximately
$36.6 million under its existing bank credit facility with NationsBank of Texas,
N.A., as administrative agent for the several lenders thereunder (the "Credit
Facility"). Under the Credit Facility (i) borrowings under a $40,000,000 line
of credit (the "Bank Line of Credit"), which will expire on May 31, 1996, are
made at varying interest rates up to LIBOR plus 1 3/4%, the prime rate, or the
certificate of deposit rate plus 1 7/8% and (ii) borrowings under a $30,000,000
secured term credit facility (the "Secured Term Facility"), which will expire
on May 31, 1999, can be made through September 30, 1994 and bear interest at
varying interest rates up to LIBOR plus 2%, the prime rate plus 1/4%, or the
certificate of deposit rate plus 2 1/8%. Amounts borrowed under the Secured
Term Facility require equal semi-annual principal payments commencing
November 30, 1994 through May 31, 1999. The Secured Term Facility is secured by
first priority liens on 19 of the properties on which the Registrant owns or
operates "La Quinta" inns. Of the approximately $36.6 million borrowed under
the Credit Facility to fund the capital contribution, $30 million was borrowed
under the Secured Term Facility and approximately $6.6 million was borrowed
under the Bank Line of Credit.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the remaining Units not beneficially
owned by the Registrant will be acquired in a subsequent merger pursuant to
which each Unit (other than Units beneficially owned by the Purchaser, the
Registrant or their affiliates) will be converted into the right to receive
the same consideration as is paid in connection with the Offer.

On November 30, 1993, the Registrant also acquired the limited partners'
interest in one of the Registrant's combined unincorporated joint ventures for
a purchase price of $9,171,000 which included cash of $5,619,000 and the
assumption of $3,552,000 of existing debt attributable to the limited
partners' interest.

The information set forth in Exhibits 2.1, 21.1, 28.1 and 28.2 is
incorporated herein by reference.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Partners
La Quinta Motor Inns Limited Partnership:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of La Quinta Motor Inns
Limited Partnership and subsidiary limited partnership as of December 31, 1992
and 1991, and the related consolidated statements of operations, partners'
capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1992. These consolidated financial statements are the responsi-
bility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of La Quinta
Motor Inns Limited Partnership and subsidiary limited partnership as of December
31, 1992 and 1991, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1992, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

LA QUINTA MOTOR INNS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
AND SUBSIDIARY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991

(1) ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION

La Quinta Motor Inns Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership
("the Partnership" or "LQP") was formed pursuant to an Agreement of Limited
Partnership, dated July 30, 1986, to operate 31 La Quinta Inns, which are
generally located in the "Sunbelt" (the "Inns") through its 99% limited
partnership interest in LQM Operating Partners, L.P. (the "Operating
Partnership"). La Quinta Realty Corp. ("LQ Realty" or the "General Partner"), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of La Quinta Motor Inns, Inc. ("La Quinta"), is the
general partner of both the Partnership and the Operating Partnership, holding a
1% interest in each. The Partnership and the Operating Partnership are
collectively referred to as the "Partnerships".

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Partnership and the Operating Partnership. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain
reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform with the
current year presentation.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization
of property and equipment are computed using the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Buildings....................................................... 30 years
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment.............................. 4-10 years
</TABLE>

Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Expenditures
for improvements are capitalized.

DEFERRED CHARGES

Costs incurred by the Operating Partnership in connection with the mortgage
notes are amortized using the interest method over the life of the mortgage
notes.

NET LOSS PER UNIT

Net loss per limited partnership unit is computed based on the 3,975,000
limited partnership units outstanding for the periods included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, after giving effect to the
General Partner's 1% interest.

(2) PARTNERSHIP ALLOCATIONS

CASH DISTRIBUTIONS

Pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing the Partnerships, net cash
flow, as defined, shall be distributed in the ratio of 1.99% to the General
Partner and 98.01% to the Unitholders no less frequently than quarterly until
the Unitholders have received an amount equal to 12 1/2% simple annual
noncumulative return on the weighted average value of their unrecovered capital
contributions (as defined) from all distributions of net cash flow during such
year. Thereafter, net cash flow shall be distributed 29.29% to the general
partner and 70.71% to the Unitholders.

9
<PAGE>
LA QUINTA MOTOR INNS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
AND SUBSIDIARY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Cash distributions from the sale of an Inn will be allocated 98.01% to the
limited partners and 1.99% to the General Partner until such time as the limited
partners have received a cumulative amount of distributions from sales or
refinancings to return their initial capital contributions in full. The General
Partner will then receive 100% of the proceeds until on a cumulative basis the
General Partner has received distributions sufficient to return all
contributions required under the guarantee (note 5). Remaining proceeds will be
distributed 98.01% to the Unitholders and 1.99% to the General Partner until the
Unitholders have received a cumulative 12 1/2% simple annual cumulative return
on the weighted average balance of their unrecovered capital contributions, and
thereafter 70.71% to the Unitholders and 29.29% to the General Partner.

Generally, distributions resulting from a liquidation of the Partnership's
interest in the Operating Partnership will be made in the same manner as
distributions from sales of inns, subject to the overall requirement that such
distributions be made to the Unitholders and the General Partner in accordance
with their positive capital account balances.

Excess proceeds resulting from the refinancing of a property, if any, will
be distributed 100% to the General Partner until all capital contributions
required under the guarantee (note 5) are recovered, then 98.01% to the
Unitholders and 1.99% to the General Partner until the Unitholders have received
a cumulative 12 1/2% simple annual cumulative return on the weighted average
balance of their unrecovered capital contributions, and thereafter 70.71% to the
Unitholders and 29.29% to the General Partner.

ALLOCATIONS OF TAXABLE INCOME (LOSS)

Taxable income for each year generally will be allocated among the
Unitholders and the General Partner in the same proportions that net cash flow
is distributed for that year. Taxable loss will generally be allocated in
accordance with positive capital account balances. Gain and loss from any
capital transaction generally will be allocated among the Unitholders and the
General Partner in the same proportions that proceeds of such capital
transaction are distributed except to the extent necessary to reflect capital
account adjustments. Upon the transfer of a unit, the Partnership allocates tax
items allocable thereto between the transferor and the transferee based on the
number of months during the year that each owned the unit, with the holder of
such unit on the last day of the month being treated as the holder of such unit
for the entire month.

(3) LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt, which is secured by substantially all property and
equipment, consisted of the following at December 31:

LA QUINTA MOTOR INNS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
AND SUBSIDIARY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Operating Partnership's original mortgage notes payable, totaling
$67,500,000, matured November 1, 1991. The Operating Partnership modified and
extended the mortgage notes payable with the original lender. (The mortgage loan
as extended and modified is referred to as the "AEtna Loan" and the individual
notes comprising the AEtna Loan are referred to as the "Mortgage Notes".)

The AEtna Loan covers a three-year period, from November 1, 1991 to November
1, 1994. The stated interest rates in the AEtna Loan as extended and modified
began at 10 1/4% at November 1, 1991, and increases by a 1/2 percentage point
each November 1 thereafter until it reaches a rate of 11 1/4% at November 1,
1993. Interest expense included in the accompanying statement of operations for
the escalating interest rate Mortgage Notes was computed using an effective rate
of interest over the term of the AEtna Loan of 10.75%. The principal payments on
the Mortgage Notes are payable in thirty-six (36) monthly installments. The
principal payments are structured to reduce the outstanding principal balance on
a per annum basis in an amount equal to 0.75%, 1.50% and 2.00% at November 1,
1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively. On November 1, 1994, the then outstanding
balance on the Aetna Loan, plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, will
become due and payable.

The Mortgage Notes may be prepaid at the Operating Partnership's option at
any time prior to maturity, subject to a prepayment premium equal to a yield
differential between the yield on United States Treasury obligations of a
comparable maturity and interest rates specified for the year of prepayment.

The agreements associated with the Mortgage Notes contain certain
restrictions including a limitation of $10,000,000 on future borrowings for
working capital purposes, the written consent of the note holder prior to the
sale of the properties and that the management agreement with La Quinta not be
terminated. The AEtna loan requires the Operating Partnership to spend
$3,500,000 for additions to property and certain repair items within each
calendar year. As of December 31, 1992, the Partnership had spent $3,026,000 of
the required expenditures and will place $474,000 in an escrow account in 1993.
The Partnership is in compliance with all restrictions related to the Mortgage
Notes.

The industrial revenue bond obligation was assumed by the Operating
Partnership from La Quinta. These bonds are redeemable in November 1993 at
101 1/2% of face value decreasing to face value in 1994. La Quinta purchased
these bonds in September 1990. Interest paid on these bonds was $233,000 and
$185,000, in 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Annual maturities of long-term debt for the four years subsequent to
December 31, 1993 follow:

RESTAURANT RENTAL INCOME

The Operating Partnership owns 20 restaurants, 19 of which are leased to
third parties and one which is vacant. The leases, which are accounted for as
operating leases, expire from 1993 to 2016 and provide for minimum rentals and
contingent rentals based on a percentage of annual sales in excess of stipulated
amounts. The following is a summary of restaurant property leased at December
31:

the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively.

As a result of having incurred substantial operating losses, Kettle
Restaurants, Inc. ("Kettle"), the tenant of six (6) restaurant leases with the
Operating Partnership, entered into a letter agreement with La Quinta and the
Operating Partnership on December 28, 1990, which provided for, among other
things: (i) the termination of five (5) of the six restaurant leases with the
Operating Partnership on the earlier of June 30, 1991 or the date La Quinta
leased such restaurants to another tenant or otherwise disposed of the
properties; (ii) the conveyance of leasehold improvements and restaurant
equipment, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, at the five facilities
to the Operating Partnership upon the lease termination date; (iii) the ability
of La Quinta on behalf of the Operating Partnership to operate the five
restaurants for four (4) years after June 30, 1991 under the Kettle trade dress
pursuant to a license agreement with no fees; and (iv) the reimbursement of
certain administrative and legal costs of La Quinta and the Operating
Partnership incurred in implementing the lease termination agreement. Under the
terms of this lease termination agreement with Kettle, which included a total of
the five Kettle restaurants adjacent to the Inns and 15 Kettle restaurants
adjacent to other inns in the La Quinta chain, the remaining 24 Kettle
restaurant leases with La Quinta and the remaining one Kettle restaurant lease
with the Operating Partnership, not being terminated pursuant to such agreement,
were amended to include cross default provisions, which permit La Quinta to
terminate all of the remaining Kettle restaurant leases upon an event of default
involving any one such lease.

As of December 31, 1992, four of the five restaurants owned by the Operating
Partnership which were subject to the lease termination agreement discussed
above have been leased to other third parties. The table above includes minimum
future rental payments to be received under the terms of the new leases on the
four restaurants.

LAND LEASE EXPENSE

The Operating Partnership has one Inn subject to an operating land lease
with annual rental payments of $77,000 plus contingent rentals based on gross
room and adjacent restaurant revenues through December 31, 2004. The Partnership
has an option to extend the lease for an additional thirty-five years. The
accompanying consolidated statements of operations include land rental expense
of $98,000, $94,000, and $95,000 for the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991 and
1990, respectively.

(5) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

REFINANCING OF MORTGAGE NOTES

The original mortgage notes totaling $67,500,000 were initially payable by
the Operating Partnership to La Quinta. La Quinta sold the mortgage notes to
AEtna Life Insurance Company, an unaffiliated institutional lender in December
1986. During the years ended December 31, 1991 and 1990, La Quinta received
$387,000 and $422,000 respectively, representing the difference between the
9.875% interest rate payable on the original mortgage notes and 9.25% interest
rate payable to the institutional lender. The original mortgage notes were
refinanced in November 1991.

GENERAL PARTNER OBLIGATIONS AND WORKING CAPITAL PROVISIONS

The General Partner had an obligation, guaranteed by La Quinta and limited
to $6,000,000 annually on a non-cumulative basis, to make additional capital
contributions to the Partnership during the first three years of operation if
cash flow available for distribution to unitholders was less than $2.00 per unit
during any of such years. The General Partner contributed $12,410,000 to the
Partnership under the terms of this guarantee.

Under the terms of the Partnership Agreements, the General Partner or its
affiliates may loan money to the Partnerships. Such loans will be repaid with
cash flow from operations and will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the
prime rate quoted by a designated major bank located in Texas from time to time
plus one percentage point. No such loans, with the exception of the credit line
discussed below, were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 1992 or
1991.

The General Partner, on behalf of the Operating Partnership, executed a
promissory note establishing a $4,000,000 line of credit with La Quinta to fund
operational needs (including renovation and refurbishing expenditures) of the
Partnerships as deemed necessary by management. There were no advances
outstanding at December 31, 1992, and $100,000 at December 31, 1991.

MANAGEMENT SERVICES FEE

The Operating Partnership entered into a long-term management agreement with
La Quinta whereby La Quinta provides services as manager of the Inns. For the
year ended December 31, 1990 the Operating Partnership paid La Quinta 6% of
gross room revenue per month for management services and 3.75% of gross room
revenue plus $4.50 per room per month for bookkeeping, marketing and reservation
services provided pursuant to the management agreement. Effective January 1,
1991 these fees were 6% of gross room revenue per month for management services
and 5% of gross room revenue plus $2.00 per room per month for bookkeeping,
marketing and reservation services. In addition, La Quinta also receives a
license royalty fee equal to 3.5% of annual gross room revenue. Fees paid to La
Quinta under the management agreement totaled $5,964,000, $5,733,000, and
$5,073,000
13
<PAGE>
LA QUINTA MOTOR INNS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
AND SUBSIDIARY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991 and 1990. The
Operating Partnership will also pay La Quinta an annual incentive management fee
should the Operating Partnership's cash flow before debt service, as defined,
exceed $15,644,000.

OTHER RECURRING TRANSACTIONS

Under the terms of the Partnership Agreements, the General Partner is
responsible for managing the business and affairs of the Partnerships and is
entitled to be reimbursed by the Partnerships for the actual out-of-pocket
expenditures incurred by the General Partner or its affiliates on behalf of each
of the Partnerships in connection with the administration and supervision of the
Partnerships and their assets. During the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991
and 1990, the Partnerships reimbursed La Quinta $148,000, $124,000, and $65,000,
respectively, for expenses incurred in connection with administration of the
Partnerships. These reimbursements are included in administrative expense in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

As manager of the Inns, La Quinta pays on behalf of the Operating
Partnership all direct operating expenses. The Operating Partnership reimburses
La Quinta for all such payments. Neither the Partnership, the Operating
Partnership, nor the General Partner have any employees and the fee and
reimbursement structured under the management agreement presently covers the
costs of all employees at the Inns and chain services allocable to the Inns. The
Operating Partnership participates in a paid loss retrospective self-insurance
program (the "Paid Loss Program") established by La Quinta, which includes
excess umbrella policies for commercial general liability insurance, fire and
extended property insurance, workers' compensation and employer's liability
insurance. All inns in the La Quinta chain participate in the Paid Loss Program,
under which claims and expenses are shared pro rata by all inns participating
therein.

(6) INCOME TAXES

No provision, credit or payment for income taxes has been made as the
liability for such taxes is that of the Unitholders rather than the
Partnerships. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 the
Partnerships will retain their non-corporate tax status through December 31,
1997. The Partnerships file their tax returns on the accrual basis.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, requires a change from the deferred method under APB Opinion 11 to the
asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method of Statement 109, deferred income taxes are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under
Statement 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Statement 109 must be adopted in 1993. Upon adoption, the provisions of the
Statement may be applied without restating prior years' financial statements or
may be applied retroactively by restating any number of consecutive prior years'
financial statements.

Upon adoption in 1993, the Partnership plans to apply the provisions of the
Statement without restating prior years' financial statements. It is estimated
that adoption of Statement 109 will result in the recording of a deferred tax
liability in the amount of $2.8 million and that this amount will be reported
separately as the cumulative effect of the change in the method of accounting
for income taxes in the consolidated statement of the operations for the year
ending December 31, 1993.

of prior year losses. Such adjustment increases the 1992 loss allocation to the
General Partner with a corresponding decrease to the Limited Partners.

(7) SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On February 13, 1993, the Board of Directors of La Quinta Realty Corp., the
General Partner, approved a cash distribution of $.20 per unit, payable on March
12, 1993 to Unitholders of record as of March 5, 1993, totaling $795,000. In
addition, it approved distributions to the General Partner of $15,000 from the
Partnerships. The cash distribution applies to the quarter ended December 31,
1992.

(8) CONTINGENCIES

On February 15, 1993, LQP, La Quinta and Ronin Partners, L.P. ("Ronin")
announced that they had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to settle all
of the litigation between them. As part of the settlement, Ronin agreed not to
contest the tabulation of its latest consent solicitation, to cease all
activities relating to LQP and to refrain from further consent solicitations or
similar activities relating to LQP or La Quinta.

If approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery and the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware, the settlement contemplates that LQP will
increase the annual distribution to Unitholders from $.80 per Unit to $1.00 per
Unit, effective for the first quarterly distribution after the settlement has
been approved by the Courts and has become final (which is expected to occur in
the summer of 1993). Also, as part of the settlement, the Board of Directors of
La Quinta Motor Inns, Inc. has authorized the purchase of up to 15% of the
outstanding LQP Units in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
from time to time, subject to market conditions, over the period beginning on
February 17, 1993, and ending on June 30, 1994. La Quinta Motor Inns, Inc. is
not obligated to purchase any LQP Units at any particular price or at any
particular time during such period. The settlement is subject to certain
contingencies, including approval of definitive settlement agreements and
approval by both Courts. Upon final approval by the Courts, the General Partner
of

LQP and La Quinta have agreed to reimburse Ronin for certain of its expenses
incurred in connection with the litigation. Such payment will not be reimbursed
to the General Partner or La Quinta by LQP. The settlement was a culmination of
a series of actions which began in September 1991.

In September 1991, Ronin filed two lawsuits against the Partnership and the
General Partner. One lawsuit was filed in Delaware state court on behalf of the
Partnership's unitholders and derivatively on behalf of the Partnership (the
"First Delaware State Suit"). These two lawsuits allege, among other matters,
that the defendants wasted Partnership assets by paying excessive management
fees to La Quinta and breached their fiduciary duties and violated federal
securities laws by disseminating misleading statements, acting recklessly with
respect to the Partnership's mortgage loan refinancings and participating in a
purported scheme to depress the market price for units of the Partnership. Ronin
seeks, among other things, injunctive relief barring certain conduct about which
it complains, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount and attorney's fees.
On June 22, 1992, Ronin filed its Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint in
the First Delaware Federal Suit against the Partnership, the General Partner, La
Quinta, and the Operating Partnership and certain individual officers of La
Quinta repeating certain of the alleged violations of those laws. Recently, the
parties stipulated to the stay of the First Delaware State Suit pending
resolution of the Second Delaware Federal Suit described below.

The Partnership and the General Partner filed answers containing denials to
the allegations and motions to dismiss the complaint. Simultaneous therewith,
the Partnership, the Operating Partnership and the General Partner filed suit in
the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (the "Texas
Federal Suit") against Ronin for injunctive relief and/or compensatory and
punitive damages as a result of the various alleged wrongful actions including
various alleged securities law violations and common law claims, such as
wrongful interference with contractual and business relations, fraud, negligent
misrepresentation, commercial defamation and breach of a confidential agreement.
On April 20, 1992, the Texas Federal Suit was transferred to the United States
Court for the District of Delaware.

In February 1992, Ronin commenced a consent solicitation seeking a special
meeting of the Partnership's unitholders to vote on amendments to the management
agreement dealing with management compensation. The General Partner, having
determined that the consents were untimely delivered, did not call a special
meeting. On June 22, 1992, Ronin filed an additional lawsuit in Delaware state
court, naming the General Partner and La Quinta as defendants (the "Second
Delaware State Suit"). This lawsuit seeks to compel the General Partner to call
a special meeting of the Partnership's unitholders, and seeks compensatory
damages from La Quinta alleging that the fees received under the terms of the
management agreement between La Quinta and the Operating Partnership are
excessive. In addition, declaratory relief with respect to the parties' rights
under the management agreement is sought, along with damages. On September 3,
1992, the defendants filed a motion to stay the Second Delaware State Suit
pending resolution of other litigation. Although the parties have not briefed
that motion to stay, the case has been inactive since last September.

In June 1992, Ronin commenced a second consent solicitation, seeking a
dissolution of the Partnership, replacement of the General Partner with a
special liquidator to seek bids for the sale of its assets, and to reimburse
Ronin for certain alleged expenses. Ronin filed another suit in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Second Delaware Federal
Suit"), seeking a declaration from the court that this second consent
solicitation did not violate the disclosure provisions of the securities laws.
On October 21, 1992, the court ordered the consolidation of the First Delaware
Federal Suit, as well as an action brought by Exel Inns of America, Inc. seeking
declaration that its proposal to manage the Partnership's properties and press
release did not violate the securities laws. Ronin voluntarily withdrew its
second consent solicitation on August 24, 1992.

AND SUBSIDIARY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

On or about November 3, 1992, Ronin commenced a third consent solicitation,
seeking to dissolve LQP so as to effect a restructuring or disposition of its
assets, business and operations, and reimbursement of certain expenses.
Thereafter, Ronin claimed to have delivered on January 8, 1993, sufficient
consents to LQP for Ronin's third consent solicitation to have succeeded. La
Quinta and the General Partner disputed that claim, and the independent
inspector of election determined that Ronin's third consent solicitation did not
succeed. A hearing on that issue was conducted in the Second Delaware Federal
Suit on February 8 and 9, 1993.

LA QUINTA MOTOR INNS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
AND SUBSIDIARY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

(1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting
of normal recurring adjustments, have been made which are necessary for a fair
presentation of financial position and results of operations. It is suggested
that the consolidated condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the December
31, 1992 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(2) INCOME TAXES
Effective January 1, 1993, La Quinta Motor Inns Limited Partnership (the
"Partnership") adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). SFAS 109 requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or
tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are
determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently
enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse.

Although the Partnership is not a tax paying entity in 1993, under current
U.S. Federal tax law, certain publicly-traded partnerships (such as the
Partnership) will become taxable as corporations beginning January 1, 1998.
Accordingly, with the adoption of SFAS 109 by the Partnership, a deferred tax
liability has been recorded for the portion of the temporary differences which
are not expected to reverse until after December 31, 1997. As of January 1,
1993, the Partnership recorded a deferred tax liability and a cumulative effect
adjustment which increased the net loss by $2,800,000 or $.69 per unit resulting
from the adoption of SFAS 109. Such amount has been reflected in the statement
of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 1993, as the
cumulative effect of an accounting change. Prior years' financial statements
have not been restated to apply the provisions of SFAS 109.

(3) SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On October 18, 1993 La Quinta Inns, Inc. ("La Quinta") announced that its
Board of Directors authorized its officers to enter into negotiations with the
Partnership regarding the acquisition of all of the 3,522,300 partnership units
of the Partnership that it does not own at a price of up to $12 per unit in
cash. La Quinta currently owns 452,700 partnership units of the Partnership,
representing 11.4% of the outstanding units. The terms and form of a
transaction, if any is agreed to, have yet to be determined, but may include a
merger, acquisition or other business combination. Any transaction would be
financed by La Quinta's available credit lines and would not be subject to a
financing contingency. The Board of Directors of La Quinta Realty Corp., the
General Partner of the Partnership (the "General Partner"), has formed a special
committee (the "Special Committee") comprised solely of board members who are
not affiliated with La Quinta to evaluate the proposal. The Special Committee
has engaged its own legal counsel and financial advisor to advise and assist it.

On October 18, 1993, two separate lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court
of Chancery on behalf of Unitholders (other than La Quinta and its affiliates)
against La Quinta, the Partnership, the General Partner and certain directors
and officers of the General Partner (collectively, the "Defendants"). The
lawsuits are captioned GREENBERG V. SCHULTZ, ET. AL., C.A. No. 13199 and GORIN
BROTHERS, INC. V. SCHULTZ, ET. AL., C.A. No. 13200 (collectively, the
"Actions"). The complaints in the Actions allege, among other things, that
Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to Unitholders by, among other
things, offering grossly inadequate consideration to entrench themselves in
control of
21

AND SUBSIDIARY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
(UNAUDITED)

(3) SUBSEQUENT EVENT (CONTINUED)
the Partnership, failing to solicit competing bids and by making inadequate
public disclosure regarding the transaction. The complaints additionally allege
that La Quinta has used unequal knowledge and economic power, given its
affiliation with the General Partner, to the detriment of the Unitholders. The
independence of the outside directors is also questioned, allegedly resulting in
the lack of arm's-length negotiations and the lack of any independent appraisal
or evaluation. The complaints in the Actions seek, among other things, (i) a
declaration that Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to members of
the alleged class, (ii) an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining
consummation of the proposed transaction, (iii) the award of compensatory
damages, and (iv) the award of costs and disbursements.

On October 27, 1993, the Board of Directors of the General Partner, declared
a cash distribution to Unitholders of record as of November 26, 1993 of $993,750
or $.25 per unit to be paid December 6, 1993.

On October 28, 1993, La Quinta and the Partnership jointly announced that
they have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which La Quinta,
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, will acquire all of the 3,522,300 limited
partnership units of the Partnership that it does not own for $13 per unit in
cash. It is anticipated that the acquisition will be effected in two steps. A
subsidiary of La Quinta will commence, not later than Wednesday, November 3,
1993, a tender offer for all of the Partnership's outstanding units at a price
of $13 net per unit in cash. If all of the Partnership's outstanding units are
not acquired as a result of the tender offer, the remaining units will be
acquired in a subsequent merger pursuant to which each unit will be converted
into the right to receive the same consideration as is paid in connection with
the tender offer, in cash.

The General Partner's Board of Directors, based on the unanimous
recommendation of the Special Committee of independent directors, has
unanimously approved the tender offer and the merger, determined that the tender
offer and merger are fair to the Partnership's public unitholders and
recommended acceptance of the tender offer by the Partnership's public
unitholders. The tender offer will be conditioned on, among other things, there
being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the tender
offer more than 50% of the Partnership's units not owned by La Quinta. La Quinta
currently owns 11.4% of the outstanding Partnership units. The tender offer and
the merger will be financed by La Quinta through borrowings under its existing
lines of credit and are not subject to any financing contingency.

In addition, La Quinta and the Partnership announced that, in connection
with the foregoing definitive agreement, a settlement in principle has been
reached in the Actions. The settlement in principle is subject to certain
conditions, including court approval.
