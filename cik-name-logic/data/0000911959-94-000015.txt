for the shares of LIBERTY Common Stock;

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement provides that prior to the time

BANC ONE will transfer ownership of its subsidiary, Bank One,
Lexington, National Association to ACQUISITION CORP.; and

WHEREAS, the parties have determined that instead of

of BANK ONE LEXINGTON, BANC ONE, as the sole shareholder of BANK
ONE LEXINGTON, will ratify and confirm the Bank P&A at a meeting of
the shareholders of BANK ONE LEXINGTON held for such purpose or by
means of a unanimous written consent of BANK ONE LEXINGTON
shareholders adopted in lieu of a meeting to approve the Bank P&A
and the Bank P&A Agreement.

Except as amended by this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the
exhibits thereto remain in full force and effect without alteration
or change. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
