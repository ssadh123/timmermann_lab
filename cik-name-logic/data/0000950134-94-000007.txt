ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On December 17, 1993, First United Bancshares, Inc., El Dorado, Arkansas
("First United") and InvestArk Bankshares, Inc., Stuttgart, Arkansas
("InvestArk") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization whereby
First United has agreed to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of InvestArk in exchange for total
consideration of $26,125,000 consisting of fully paid and nonassessable shares
of voting common stock, $1.00 par value of First United. The number of shares
of common stock of First United to be exchanged will be determined by dividing
$26,125,000 by the average sales price per share of First United's common stock
for all trades occurring during the period of ten (10) trading days on which
one or more trades actually takes place and which ends immediately prior to the
second trading day preceding the closing date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the number of shares of First United common stock to be exchanged shall not be
less than 885,593 and shall not be greater than 985,849. Fractional shares of
First United common stock shall not be issued. The closing date is expected to
be prior to May 30, 1994, but may be extended by the mutual consent of the
parties.

InvestArk is a multi-bank holding company incorporated and organized under
the laws of the State of Arkansas with two bank subsidiaries, First Stuttgart
Bank & Trust Company, Stuttgart, Arkansas and The Bank of North Arkansas,
Melbourne, Arkansas. InvestArk has roughly $194 million in assets and with the
InvestArk acquisition First United will have assets of approximately $1.1
billion. Consummation of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization is subject to
approval by the appropriate bank regulatory authorities.
