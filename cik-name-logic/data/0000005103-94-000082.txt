FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

AMERICAN GENERAL TO ACQUIRE THE FRANKLIN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FROM AMERICAN
BRANDS, INC.

Houston, November 30, 1994 -- American General Corporation (NYSE:AGC)
and American Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AMB) today jointly announced the signing of a
definitive agreement, under which American General will acquire The Franklin
Life Insurance Company, a wholly-owned life insurance subsidiary of American
Brands for $1.17 billion in cash. The transaction, which is subject to
requisite regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the first quarter of
1995.
Franklin Life, with assets of $7.4 billion and life insurance in force
of $35 billion, is a leading provider of individual life insurance to families
throughout the United States. Together with its subsidiaries, the company also
markets group life insurance, annuities, disability income, universal life,
and variable universal life. Franklin Life's career agency sales force
includes more than 3,000 agents operating through 34 regional offices.
American General plans to continue to operate Franklin Life from its
headquarters in Springfield, Illinois, where it was founded in 1884.
The combination of Franklin Life and the life insurance subsidiaries of
American General will have assets of $22 billion and life insurance in force
of $128 billion, and will rank among the nation's top 10 largest stock life
insurance companies. Both companies share a common commitment to providing
personalized financial services to middle-income households through a career
distribution system.
In commenting on the transaction, Harold S. Hook, chairman and chief
executive officer of American General, said, "We have long admired The
Franklin, and in particular, their outstanding agency force. Franklin Life is
a solid strategic fit and the combination reinforces American General's
commitment to ordinary life insurance. We expect the transaction to be non-
dilutive to earnings in the first year, to add value for shareholders, and to
benefit the employees, agents, and customers of both companies."
