MATTEL REPORTS RECORD 1993 RESULTS;
INTEGRATION PLANS FOR MERGER WITH FISHER-PRICE ON TARGET
--------------------------------------------------------

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 8 -- Mattel, Inc. today reported that 1993 net income for
Mattel, consolidated with Fisher-Price, was $117 million on net sales of
$2.7 billion. Consolidated after-tax earnings for the year were at the
record level of $226 million before a pre-tax charge of $115 million
($90.4 million after-tax) related to the merger of Mattel and Fisher-Price,
and extraordinary after-tax charges totaling $18.7 million related primarily
to the prepayment of high-cost Fisher-Price debt.

"Considered separately, Mattel produced a fifth consecutive year of record
sales and earnings," John W. Amerman, chairman and chief executive officer,
said. "Mattel sales totaled $2.0 billion, and earnings were $1.40 per share,
in excess of the $1.36 per share target established at the beginning of the year
(after adjusting for the five-for-four split that was effective on
January 7, 1994).

"The excellence of our 1993 performance, in a year of worldwide recession,
is seen in several ways," Amerman said. "Our worldwide toy volume increase in
local currency was 15 percent. In addition, Mattel's gross profit, operating
profit and net income -- both in the absolute and relative to sales -- were at
record levels."

For the consolidated company, 1993 fourth quarter income -- before one-time
merger-related charges and costs associated with prepayment of $100 million in
Fisher-Price debt -- reached a record $62.4 million, an increase of 26 percent
over the year-ago quarter. Net sales for the quarter were a record
$754 million, an increase of 4 percent from the 1992 quarter.

Amerman said that fourth quarter increases were achieved in both sales
and earnings for each of Mattel's domestic, international and Fisher-Price
business units. "The dedication of Mattel and retailers during the fourth
quarter to achieve a clean worldwide sell-through will be beneficial for
1994 results", he said.

"In addition, the decisive action we have taken to integrate Fisher-Price
and Mattel over the past two months will result in substantial operating
efficiencies, savings and expansion opportunities," Amerman said. "Even
though we continue to deal with a strengthening of the U.S. dollar and a
cautious attitude by retailers worldwide, we believe the merger of Mattel
and Fisher-Price results in an even brighter outlook for the company in 1994
and beyond."

Mattel, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and
marketing of children's toys. The company's principal brands of Barbie,
Fisher-Price, Disney and Hot Wheels together account for 80 percent of
total sales. With headquarters in El Segundo, California, Mattel has offices
and facilities in 31 foreign countries and sells its products in more than
140 nations throughout the world.
