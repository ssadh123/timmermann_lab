FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - DECEMBER 9, 1994

The Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Pacific
Telecom, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTCM) announced today that the Special
Committee has retained Smith Barney Inc. and CS First Boston as
financial advisors and Latham & Watkins as legal counsel to
assist the Special Committee in evaluating and responding to
the offer made by PacifiCorp Holdings, Inc. (PHI), a wholly-
owned subsidiary of PacifiCorp (NYSE:PPW), to acquire the 13%
interest in Pacific Telecom not already held by PacifiCorp
Holdings at a price of $28.00 per share.

The Special Committee also announced that Pacific Telecom
and certain other defendants, including the members of Pacific
Telecom's Board of Directors, have been sued regarding PHI's
offer in the Superior Court of Washington for Clark County. 
The plaintiff in the action alleges, among other things, that
he is a shareholder of Pacific Telecom, that the offer of
$28.00 per share made by PHI is inadequate and that the members
of the Board of Directors of Pacific Telecom have breached
their fiduciary duty to the public stockholders of Pacific
Telecom. The plaintiff seeks certification of the case as a
class action on behalf of all public shareholders of Pacific
Telecom and seeks to enjoin the proposed transaction or, in the
alternative, to be awarded rescissory damages in an unspecified
amount if the transaction closes. A response to the complaint
is due from Pacific Telecom on or before January 9, 1995. 
Pacific Telecom intends to contest vigorously the allegations
that the directors of Pacific Telecom have breached their
fiduciary duty or otherwise acted improperly with respect to
the offer.
