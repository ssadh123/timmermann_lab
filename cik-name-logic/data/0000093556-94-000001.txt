FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 31, 1994 

STANLEY REPORTS 1993 SALES UP 3.5%; EARNINGS UP 4% BEFORE ACCOUNTING 
CHANGE AND LITIGATION CHARGE 

New Britain, CT . . . "The Stanley Works achieved record sales of $2.3 
billion in 1993, representing an increase of 3.5% over last year," 
reported Richard H. Ayers, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Net 
earnings, excluding the effects of a change in an accounting principle and 
fourth quarter legal settlements, were up 4% from the previous year." 

Mr. Ayers noted, "We are encouraged that our 1993 sales growth was driven 
primarily by unit volume increases. Minor price increases and the effects 
of acquisitions were almost entirely offset by a 3% negative effect of 
currency. Improving economic conditions, particularly in the U.S., and 
our continued focus on developing new products and markets, helped foster 
this solid growth in our core businesses." 

Excluding the effects of an accounting change, earnings were $93 million, 
$2.06 per share, compared with $98 million, $2.15 per share, reported in 
1992. We experienced a significant negative currency impact from the 
translation of foreign results into U.S. dollars and transaction costs in 
purchasing product, principally from Japan. Earnings also included a $.21 
per share charge in the fourth quarter related to the settlement of 132 
lawsuits involving a subsidiary, Mac Tools, Inc. 

During recent discussions with lawyers representing former distributors 
concerning cases filed against Mac Tools, Inc., 66 threatened claims were 
revealed. A decision was made to settle 132 filed and threatened 
lawsuits, leaving four outstanding filed cases against Mac Tools. A 
fourth quarter charge of $15 million was recognized to reflect these 
settlements and the accrual of reserves to cover outstanding claims. 

Mac Tools has retained law firms who had previously represented settling 
claimants to advise Mac in its relationships with its distributors. 

Mr. Ayers commented, "Mac Tools has been a successful business for over 50 
years based on a company commitment to help its independent tool 
distributors succeed. This settlement removes a degree of uncertainty in 
our balance sheet and eliminates a significant distraction, enabling Mac 
and its employees to concentrate fully on the continued success of both 
its distributors and the company." 

Net earnings for 1993 also reflected a one-time after-tax charge of $8.5 
million, $.19 per share, for the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard 
No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits". The new 
standard, which must be adopted by all publicly traded companies no later 
than the first quarter 1994, requires us to accrue postemployment benefits 
as they are earned by the employee for services rendered rather than as 
they are paid. The charge, which reduced net earnings to $84 million, 
$1.87 per share, will be applied retroactively by restating the first 
quarter 1993.

Gross margins realized in 1993 of 31.7% were down from 33.2% in 1992. 
Much of the decline is associated with the transition of previously 
foreign-sourced fastening tools to U. S. in-house manufacture together 
with high raw material costs and the related expenses of manufacturing 
process changes in our Door Systems business. 

Operating expenses were 22.5% of sales in 1993 compared with 24.0% in 
1992. The improvement reflects continued efforts to reduce costs, 
increased operating efficiencies, and the absence of certain non-recurring 
expenses. Interest-Net was similar to the prior year. Other- Net 
expense for 1993 included a $.21 per share charge for Mac Tools' 
distributor litigation issues. It also included a gain on the sale of a 
non-operating asset of $.39 per share which was substantially offset by 
additional charges for contingency reserves related to product liability, 
restructuring activities and environmental clean-up. The effective tax 
rate was 37.4%, down slightly from 37.9% in 1992. 

Net sales in the United States were up 8%, reflecting unit volume gains of 
6% and a 2% gain from acquisitions. This was the strongest internal 
growth realized since 1988. There were no effective price increases in 
the U.S. in 1993. 

During 1993, weak economic conditions continued in Europe where our 
operations experienced an overall decline in sales of 10%. Foreign 
currency had a negative impact of 11% and unit volume was 3% negative. 
The combination of small price increases and acquisitions added 4%. 

Net sales in Other Areas decreased 2% principally due to the negative 
effects of currency and sales weakness in Canada. Sales in the Far East 
and Latin America continue to exceed growth rates experienced by the 
company overall. 

Tools sales were 4% higher than 1992. Unit volume gains of 4% were 
primarily the result of stronger internal growth in our industrial and 
engineered tools categories. Acquisitions and divestitures resulted in a 
2% increase in sales. The net result of price increases in some tool 
categories and decreases in others resulted in an overall 1% increase in 
sales for the year. The negative effect of currency of approximately 3% 
offset price and acquisition gains. Operating profits of $158 million 
were down 8% from 1992 and reflected dealer litigation and plant closing 
expenses of a subsidiary, Mac Tools, Inc. As a result, operating margins 
were 9.3% for 1993, compared with 10.5% in 1992. 

Hardware sales increased 1% over 1992, as the negative effects of currency 
partially offset unit volume growth of 3%. Operating profits increased 
29% to $33 million and operating margins improved to 11.0% from 8.6% in 
the prior year. The improvement in margins is principally due to 
operating efficiencies and the integration of recent acquisitions. 

Specialty Hardware sales for 1993 were 4% higher than 1992. Virtually all 
of the increase was generated by internal growth, as the effects of modest 
price increases were offset by the negative effect of currency. Operating 
profits were negatively impacted by abnormally high raw material costs and 
the expenses of related manufacturing process adjustments at our Door 
Systems division.<PAGE>

Net sales for the fourth quarter 1993 were $578 million which were 2% 
below 1992 sales of $593 million. Inherent in the sales decline is the 
difference between fiscal 1993 with 52 weeks and fiscal 1992, which 
contained 53 weeks, with the extra week occuring in the fourth quarter. 

Net earnings for the fourth quarter 1993 were $18 million, $.39 per share, 
compared with $26 million, $.58 per share, in the fourth quarter 1992. 
Net earnings for the quarter included a $15 million, $.21 per share, 
charge for Mac Tools' distributor litigation issues. Gross margins of 
31.2% reflected a slight improvement over the third quarter 1993; however, 
it was lower than 1992 margins of 32.4%. Operating expenses were 22.1% of 
sales compared with 23.3% in the fourth quarter 1992. 

Mr. Ayers stated, "We believe there are several reasons to be optimistic 
about 1994: rising consumer confidence, low interest rates, the general 
affordability of homes in the U.S., growth in housing starts and existing 
home sales, and sustained growth in U.S. factory activity. Our company--
wide emphasis on customer service and product innovation, together with 
our continuing commitment to increasing manufacturing efficiencies through 
technology and process improvements, have already positioned us in the 
market with high quality, innovative products at reasonable prices. 

"While the economies of Europe will probably continue to be weak, they 
have stabilized. The high growth markets of Asia and Latin America 
provide brighter prospects and we have been growing continuously from a 
modest base in both regions, paced by our understanding of the markets, 
the business environments and the cultures. We have had significant 
manufacturing in Latin America for several years and continue to increase 
our manufacturing presence in Asia, with new facilities in Malaysia, 
Indonesia and Thailand. 

"Many of our large U.S. and European customers are beginning to expand 
into Latin America and Asia. Our local manufacturing, worldwide brand 
strength, broad product mix and our existing strong relationships with 
these customers, give us a significant competitive advantage in servicing 
their needs." 

Mr. Ayers concluded, "We have achieved significant reductions in the costs 
of our operations over the past few years. At the same time, we have been 
making the investments in new product development, technology and global 
expansion that will accelerate growth for our business units and provide 
profitable growth for our company."

THE STANLEY WORKS AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the fourth quarter of 1993, Other-net includes a charge of
$15.0 million ($.21 per share) related to the settlement of 132
lawsuits involving a subsidiary, Mac Tools, Inc. The fourth
quarter of 1992 includes a gain of $25.8 million ($.35 per share)
from the sale of a portion of the company's investment in Max Co.,
Ltd., expenses of $14.1 million ($.21 per share) related to
planned closings of certain company-owned stores and reduction of
the goodwill of the company's Taylor Rental operation, and expense
of $7.8 ($.11 per share) for reserves for litigation pending at
the company's Mac Tools business.

In the consolidated statement of earnings for 1993, Other-net for
the twelve months includes a gain of $29.0 million ($.39 per
share) from the sale of the company's investment in Max Co., Ltd.
Also included in Other-net were additional charges for a fine
levied by U.S. District Court in Missouri for $5.0 million ($.07
per share) and contingency reserves of $23.3 million ($.32 per
share) related to product liability litigation, restructuring
activities and environmental clean-up.

The company adopted "Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 112" in 1993. The new standard requires the company to accrue
postemployment benefits as they are earned by the employee for
services rendered rather than as they are paid. The cumulative
effect of this accounting change, as of January 3, 1993, reduced
1993 net earnings by $8.5 million ($13.6 million less related
income taxes of $5.1 million) or $.19 per share.

Certain amounts in the consolidated statements of earnings were
reclassified to conform to the 1993 presentation.
