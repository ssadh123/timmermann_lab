its $290 million of Senior Secured Uncertificated Notes due 1995 that was due on

with the principal holders of the Secured Notes and their advisors in an effort
to reach an agreement on the terms of a restructuring of the Senior Notes. The
prospects, terms and timing of any such restructuring are uncertain at this
time.

1994 will be supplied, when available, upon written request to Mortgage and
Realty Trust, 8380 Old York Road, Suite 300, Elkins Park, PA 19027.
