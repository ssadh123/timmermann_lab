CLARK REPORTS $1.86 EPS FOR THIRD QUARTER

SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, October 25, 1994 -- Clark Equipment Company (NYSE: 
CKL) today announced net income for the three months ended September 30,
1994, of $32.3 million, or $1.86 per share, compared to net income of $3.2
million, or $0.18 per share, in the prior year period. Sales for third
quarter 1994 were $249.2 million compared to $167.1 million in third
quarter 1993. The announcement was made by Leo J. McKernan, Clark
chairman, president and chief executive officer.

"Continued gains by Clark Equipment Company's core businesses and a marked
improvement in its construction machinery joint venture significantly
increased sales and earnings during the third quarter," said Mr. McKernan.

For the first nine months of 1994, Clark reported net income of $121.7
million, or $6.99 per share, compared to net income of $29.6 million, or
$1.70 per share, in 1993. Net income from continuing operations was $87.6
million, or $5.03 per share, compared to $14.2 million, or $0.82 per
share, for the first nine months of 1993. Clark consolidated revenues for
the nine-month period of 1994 were $696.9 million compared to $517.5
million for the prior year period.

Earnings from Clark consolidated operations, which include Melroe Company,
Clark-Hurth Components, and Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment Corporation,
continued their upward trend in the third quarter, rising to $16.5
million, or $0.95 per share, on sales of $249.2 million. This result
compares to Clark consolidated net income of $1.4 million, or $0.08 per
share, on sales of $167.1 million in third quarter 1993. Blaw-Knox
results are not included in 1993. Clark's share of earnings from its
construction machinery joint venture, VME, rose in third quarter 1994 to
$16.0 million, or $0.92 per share, a sharp improvement over net income of
$1.8 million, or $0.10 per share, a year earlier.

Outlining the factors that contributed to Clark's third quarter increases,
Mr. McKernan said, "Gross margins and operating margins increased compared
to third quarter 1993. Melroe sales and operating income overcame the
third quarter traditional seasonal downturn. Clark-Hurth Components
continued its three-quarter upward profit trend. Blaw-Knox, Clark's
asphalt paving business acquired earlier this year, contributed its first
full quarter of results to corporate sales and earnings. Renewed strength
in VME markets and its leaner cost structure combined to deliver strong
third quarter earnings from operations."

New orders during the quarter rose to $260.4 million, an increase of
approximately 55 percent, compared to $168.2 million for the same period
in 1993 and up seven percent from second quarter 1994. At September 30,
1994, the order backlog was $202.4 million compared to $122.1 million in
third quarter 1993 and $191.2 million in second quarter 1994. Order rates
increased at all Clark businesses compared to a year earlier. Order and
backlog data for the second and third quarters of 1994 include Blaw-Knox.

Discussing Clark's Melroe operations, Mr. McKernan said, "Melroe's North
American operations resisted its normal seasonal downturn in the third
quarter, producing sales and earnings close to its record second quarter
results. Momentum in the North American business continued to be strong,
with the skid-steer loader industry recording a 20 percent increase in
retail activity compared to 1993." He added that Melroe shipments were up
more than 30 percent compared to third quarter 1993.

"European sales of Bobcat skid-steer loaders increased somewhat from
depressed 1993 levels, although demand remained sluggish," said Mr.
McKernan. He went on to say that European mini-excavator sales continued
to expand and are running more than 10 percent ahead of 1993 third quarter
sales. In July, Melroe announced a $15.0 million expansion of its
Gwinner, North Dakota, plant. The additional 160,000 square feet will
assure adequate manufacturing capacity to meet projected growth in demand
for Bobcat products worldwide.

"Improving construction machinery markets in North America and Europe
helped to increase earnings at Clark-Hurth during the third quarter," said
Mr. McKernan, noting that order rates remained at high levels, with orders
at the end of nine months more than 60 percent ahead of the prior year. 
He added, "For the third consecutive quarter, Clark-Hurth profitability
increased. Factors contributing to Clark-Hurth gains included improved
economic conditions, share gains in major markets and continuing cost
controls."

Discussing Clark's asphalt paving equipment business, Mr. McKernan said,
"Performance at Blaw-Knox has exceeded our expectations. Increases in
domestic road-paving activity and expanded exports drove sales and
earnings above 1993 levels. Order rates for the third quarter were 15
percent ahead of the same period in 1993. Improved earnings resulted from
increased unit sales, a better product mix and increasing parts sales." 
European markets remained stagnant with no clear signs of improvement. 
However, cost reductions in the United Kingdom helped improve margins,
despite flat production.

Clark's share of VME net income in third quarter 1994 was $16.0 million,
or $0.92 per share, up significantly from net income of $1.8 million, or
$0.10 per share, in the prior year period. Sales were $357.9 million, up
26 percent from $283.1 million in third quarter 1993. Discussing VME's
performance, Mr. McKernan said, "The market demand for construction
equipment remained strong in North America and is showing some improvement
in most European markets. Increased sales volumes, improved price
realization and higher capacity utilization drove the earnings
improvement."

Looking ahead at the remainder of 1994, Mr. McKernan said, "We expect
sales and earnings in fourth quarter 1994 to show continued strength
compared to the prior year, with production and shipping rates similar to
the third quarter. All indications are that Clark's strong operating
performance will continue into the foreseeable future."

Clark Equipment Company designs, manufactures and markets skid-steer
loaders, construction machinery, asphalt paving equipment, and axles and
transmissions for off-highway equipment.
