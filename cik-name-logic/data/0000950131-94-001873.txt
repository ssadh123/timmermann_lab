NOTE A -- BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Regulations S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring accruals and periodic changes in estimates) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included.

Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1994, are
not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ended December 31, 1994. Amounts in 1993 have been reclassified to conform to
the current period presentation. For further information, refer to the
consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993.

</TABLE> 
The adjustments to the net deferred tax asset in 1994 identified as the "Effect
of acquisitions and other transactions" result primarily from the acquisition of
Rocky Mountain Financial Corporation, the exercise of compensatory stock
options, and changes in deferred taxes associated with changes in unrealized
gains/losses associated on securities available-for-sale.

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not, that some
portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company previously
established a valuation allowance for a portion of the operating loss
carryforwards as a result of unresolved matters with taxing authorities. During
1993, certain tax issues were resolved which were previously considered in
management's assessment of the valuation allowance. As a result, the Company
reduced the valuation allowance by $10 million during the first quarter of 1993.
The remaining $6.5 million valuation allowance was eliminated in the last half
of 1993. Approximately $10.6 million of the change in the deferred tax asset
valuation allowance ($10 million in first quarter 1993) was allocated as a
reduction of income tax expense.

At September 30, 1994, the Company had the following net operating loss
carryforwards available for income tax purposes:

NOTE D -- Definitive Agreement

On July 21, 1994, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive purchase
agreement to be acquired by First Bank System, Inc. ("FBS"). FBS will exchange
.6803 shares of FBS common stock for each common share of the Company. In
addition, each outstanding share of Series B preferred stock of the Company will
be converted into the right to receive $27.00 (plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends) in cash and the outstanding warrants to purchase 153,108 shares of
common stock of the Company will be converted to warrants to purchase 104,159
shares of FBS common stock at $6.96 per share. The exchange ratio for common
stock of the Company is subject to change based upon changes in FBS stock price
under certain circumstances. The aggregate purchase price is approximately $800
million and either company can terminate the agreement if the average price of
FBS common stock is less than $29.50 during a specified period. In addition, the
Company has issued FBS an option to purchase up to 19.9% of the outstanding
shares of the Company's common stock under certain circumstances. The
transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 1995, pending
regulatory and shareholder approval, and will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests.

FBS is a regional bank holding company headquartered in Minneapolis with assets
of $26.3 billion. FBS provides complete financial services to individuals and
institutions through nine banks and other financial service companies with 220
offices primarily in Minnesota, Colorado, Illinois, Montana, North Dakota, South

RECENT ACQUISITIONS

On March 25, 1994, the Bank completed the acquisition of Rocky Mountain
Financial Corporation ("RMFC") and its bank subsidiary, Rocky Mountain Bank, fsb
("Rocky Mountain"). Rocky Mountain had assets and deposits of approximately
$537 million and $428 million at March 25, 1994, respectively. The Bank paid

million in deposits of two branches of Pioneer Federal Savings and Loan
Association, a failed thrift in Kansas.

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

On July 21, 1994, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive purchase
agreement to be acquired by First Bank System, Inc. ("FBS"). FBS is a regional
bank holding company headquartered in Minneapolis with assets of $26.3 billion. 
The companies had previously announced on July 1, 1994 that they had signed a
letter of intent. FBS will exchange .6803 shares of FBS common stock for each
common share of the Company. In addition, each outstanding share of Series B
preferred stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive
$27.00 (plus accumulated and unpaid dividends) in cash and the outstanding
warrants to purchase 153,108 shares of common stock of the Company will be
converted into warrants to purchase 104,159 shares of FBS common stock at $6.96
per share. The exchange ratio for common stock of the Company is subject to
change based upon changes in FBS stock price under certain circumstances. The
aggregate purchase price is approximately $800 million. The exchange ratio will
be adjusted if the average of the closing price of FBS common stock is less than
$33.00 for the 20 trading days ending three business days prior to the last date
of both companies' meetings of shareholders. In that event, the exchange ratio
would be multiplied by the quotient of $33.00 divided by the average price. In
addition, if the average price is greater than $40.50, the exchange ratio would
be adjusted by multiplying the ratio by the quotient of $40.50 divided by the
average price. Either company can terminate the agreement if the average price
of FBS common stock is less than $29.50. In addition, the Company has issued
FBS an option to purchase up to 19.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company's
common stock under certain circumstances.

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 1995, pending
regulatory and shareholder approval, and would be accounted for as pooling of

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW. The Company earned net income of $4.4 million or $0.12 per share for
the quarter ended September 30, 1994, compared to $16.9 million or $0.51 per
share for the third quarter of 1993. Included in the third quarter of 1994 are
net charges totaling $9.5 million (after tax), or approximately $0.30 per share
related to the planned merger with First Bank System, Inc. and the tentative
settlement of two class action lawsuits. The results of the third quarter of
1993 reflect gains related to mortgage banking activities of $4.0 million
compared to a $220 thousand loss in the third quarter of 1994. The Company
recorded net income of $31.0 million or $0.92 per share for the nine months
ended September 30, 1994, compared with $47.3 million or $1.46 per share during
the same period in 1993. The current year's results are fully taxed while the
prior year results include a tax benefit of $10 million, or $.32 per share,
recognized in the first quarter of 1993 associated with a reduction of the
deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The reduction of the valuation allowance
resulted from the favorable resolution of a number of outstanding tax issues
raised by the Internal Revenue Service for which the Company had previously
established reserves.

NET INTEREST INCOME. The Company earned net interest income of $55.5 million for
the third quarter of 1994, an increase of 6.6 percent from the third quarter of
1993. The improvement in net interest income from the third quarter of 1993
reflects increases in the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios from
originations, financial institutions acquisitions and wholesale loan purchases.
Average earning assets in the third quarter of 1994 increased to $7.6 billion,
up from $6.5 billion a year ago. The increase in average earning assets reflects
the completed acquisitions of Eureka Savings Bank in August 1993 and Rocky
Mountain Financial Corporation in March 1994. Single family mortgage loan
production during the third quarter of 1994 totaled $250.5 million compared with
$438.7 million in the third quarter of 1993 reflecting decreased demand for
single family mortgage loans as interest rates have continued to increase.

The net interest margin was 2.92 percent in the third quarter of 1994 which
represents a decrease of 27 basis points from the same period in 1993. The net
interest margin began to narrow a year ago reflecting reduced average yields on
earning assets resulting from the high rate of prepayments in the mortgage-
backed securities and mortgage loan portfolios. During 1994, mortgage loan
prepayments decreased as interest rates rose; however, the cost of retail
deposits and FHLB advances increased faster than the yields on new loan
production resulting in the lower net interest margin.

The weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 9 basis
points to 4.57 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 1994 as compared to
the same period in 1993. The weighted average yields earned on interest bearing
assets for the third quarter of 1994 decreased by 18 basis points to 7.40
percent compared to the same period in 1993.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to
the extent that its interest earning assets reprice or mature differently than
its interest bearing liabilities. The Company manages interest rate risk through
production of interest earning assets with repricing or maturity characteristics
similar to its retail deposit funding source, as well as concentrating on the
gathering of retail deposits which match the repricing and maturity
characteristics of the assets produced. This strategy emphasizes the production
of fifteen year fixed rate, five and seven year balloon and adjustable rate
mortgage loans and consumer loans. The Company augments its interest rate risk
management strategy by purchasing assets or borrowing funds with comparable
maturity and repricing characteristics to its loans or deposits. Finally, when
considered necessary and cost effective, the Company uses hedging instruments,
such as interest rate caps and swaps, to reduce its exposure to interest rate
risk. 

Interest rate caps are used to minimize the impact of fluctuating interest rates
on earnings by effectively extending the life and placing a ceiling on the
interest rate paid on the Company's short term deposits. The total notional
amount of cap agreements purchased as of September 30, 1994 was $500 million
with an average strike level of 3-month LIBOR at 6.05% and an average remaining
maturity of 1.1 years. The unamortized premuim on caps is amortized over the
life of the cap. The caps decreased net income by $731 thousand during the
quarter ended September 30, 1994.

Likewise, interest rate swaps are used similarly to caps, thereby extending the
maturity of short term deposits. At September 30, 1994 the Company had no swaps
outstanding.

An industry gauge of exposure to interest rate risk is the one year interest
rate sensitivity "gap" (the difference between interest earning assets and
interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year). See table
below.

The Company mitigates its exposure to interest rate risk by striving to maintain
a neutral "gap" between the maturities of its interest earning assets and
interest bearing liabilities. This strategy results in a stable net interest
margin in periods of either rising or falling interest rates

Assets available-for-sale without a firm commitment are based on their
contractual maturity considering amortization and prepayments. Passbook savings
and checking account balances assume a 10% annual decay rate and money market
demand and tiered rate savings accounts are included in the one year or less
category. Loan balances, which are prior to discounts and the allowance for loan
losses, include non-accrual loans.

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. The provision for loan losses reflects management's
estimate of the allowance for loan losses necessary to provide for anticipated
credit losses. The provision for loan losses was $4.0 million in the third
quarter of 1994 compared with $2.1 million in the third quarter of 1993. The
increase in the provision reflects the related growth in the consumer loan
portfolio. The consumer loan portfolio was $1.9 billion at September 30, 1994,
an increase of $552 million, or 41 percent from the same period in 1993. Charge-
offs in the consumer loan portfolio totaled $3.5 million for the three months
ended September 30, 1994 compared to $2.1 million in the period one year ago.
The Company anticipates further growth in the loan portfolio and commensurate
increases in the provision throughout the remainder of 1994. Also, see
Nonperforming Assets and Allowance for Loan Losses.

NONINTEREST INCOME. Noninterest income in the third quarter of 1994 was $22.5
million, compared to $25.0 million a year ago. Included in the third quarter of
1993 are net gains related to the sale of mortgage assets of $4.0 million
compared with net losses of $220 thousand recorded in the current quarter.
Excluding net gains and losses associated with mortgage banking activities,
noninterest income in the third quarter increased $1.7 million or 8.0 percent
for the third quarter of 1993. Mortgage loan servicing fees were $3.0 million,
an increase of $1.5 million from the third quarter of 1993.

Realty commissions from the Company's real estate brokerage subsidiary, Edina
Realty, were $10.3 million, down 3.5 percent from the third quarter of 1993.
Title closing fees from the title service subsidiary, Equity Title, declined to
$2.7 million from $3.9 million a year ago reflecting reduced demand in the real
estate market. Financial services income from the sale of mutual funds and
annuities totaled $2.5 million for the current quarter, up from $1.2 million in
the third quarter of 1993. Service charges on deposit accounts and other income
were $4.2 million for the current quarter, an increase of 12.6 percent from the
same quarter a year ago. The increase of service charges on deposit accounts is
a result of acquisitions and the strategic evaluation of fees and implementation
of a new fee structure for deposit accounts.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE. Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 1994 was $66.9
million compared with $48.1 million in the third quarter of 1993. Included in
the third quarter of 1994 are expenses of $1.4 million related to the planned
merger with First Bank System, Inc. and an accrual of $14 million related to the
tentative settlement of two class action lawsuits against the Company and its
subsidiaries, Edina Realty and Equity Title. The bank-only efficiency ratio,
defined as noninterest expense less amortization of goodwill and real estate
expense as a percent of net interest income before the provision for loan losses
and noninterest income, was 57 percent in the third quarter of 1994, compared
with 53 percent in the third quarter of 1993.

Compensation, occupancy, data processing, advertising and amortization of
goodwill expense increased $4.9 million from the third quarter of 1993 to the
third quarter of 1994, or 15.2 percent, primarily reflecting the acquisitions
during the past year. Deposit insurance premiums decreased $357 thousand from
the third quarter of 1993 to the third quarter of 1994 reflecting one-time
insurance premium credits related to previous acquisitions. Real estate owned
expense declined $1.3 million as a result of improved results from certain
income-producing properties as well as a reduction in these nonperforming
assets. Other general and administrative expenses increased $15.4 million to
$26.5 million reflecting the effect of acquisitions and an increase in
professional fees related to the pre-merger activities and the accrual for the
tentative lawsuit settlement.

Included in the nine months ended September 30, 1993 was a one-time charge of
$4.0 million related to the closing of 17 retail bank offices and other
reorganization activities.

Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes was 
$2.7 million in the third quarter of 1994 compared 
with $10.0 million in the third quarter of 1993. The 
provision for income taxes for the first nine months 
of 1994 was $19.0 million compared with $13.1 
million (which included a $10 million tax benefit for 
the same period in 1993). The $10 million benefit in 
the first quarter of 1993 resulted from the favorable 
resolution of a number of outstanding tax issues 
raised by The Internal Revenue Service for which the 
Company had earlier established reserves.

Loan Portfolio. The Company's loan portfolio 
totaled $5.2 billion at September 30, 1994, an 
increase of $609 million from December 31, 1993. 
The increase is due to new production of residential 
mortgage and consumer loans, as well as the 
addition of loans through acquisition offset by the 
securitization of approximately $500 million of 15 
year fixed rate loans into mortgage-backed securities 
during the second quarter of 1994.

Consumer loan origination and origination of first 
mortgage loans for the purchase or construction of 
one to four family residential property continue to be 
the main emphasis of the Company. Of the $609 
million increase in loans, $115 million related to 
residential real estate mortgage loans and $531 
million related to consumer loans. The Company's 
current policy is to sell all agency conforming 30-
year fixed rate mortgage loans, thus reducing interest 
rate risk.

Single family mortgage loan originations totaled 
$250.5 million in the third quarter 1994 compared 
with $438.7 million in the third quarter of 1993. 
The decrease in single family mortgage originations 
is a result of higher interest rates. Consumer 
originations totaled $313.1 million in the third 
quarter of 1994, an increase of $74.6 million, 
compared with $238.5 million during the third 
quarter of 1993. Indirect automobile lending has 
been a focus product for the Company for the past 
few years.

The Company generally maintains the servicing rights 
on mortgage loans sold to preserve the customer 
relationship, create opportunities to cross sell other 
banking services and generate fee income.

Nonperforming Assets and Allowance for Loan 
Losses. Nonperforming assets are nonaccruing 
loans and real estate owned. The Company places 
loans on a nonaccrual status when the loans are 
contractually delinquent more than 90 days. The 
table below presents a summary of nonperforming 
assets at the dates indicated.

Nonperforming assets at September 30, 1994, totaled 
$74.6 million, a decrease of $40.8 million, or 35.3 
percent from the $115.4 million total reported at 
December 31, 1993. The decrease is principally 
related to the sale or disposition of commercial real estate.

The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 1994, 
remained relatively consistent with year end 1993 at 
$40.4 million. The allowance for loan losses as a 
percentage of nonperforming loans increased from 
70.0 percent at December 31, 1993 to 100.8 percent 
at September 30, 1994. Nonperforming loans to 
total loans and nonperforming assets to total assets 
decreased to .77 percent and .92 percent, 
respectively, at September 30, 1994 from 1.32 
percent and 1.65 percent at December 31, 1993, 
respectively.

Mortgage-Backed Securities and Available-For-
Sale Securities. Mortgage-backed securities held for 
investment totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 
1994, compared to $.9 billion at December 31, 1993. 
The increase in mortgage-backed securities relates to 
wholesale purchases of mortgage-backed securities 
during the first quarter of 1994 and the securitization 
of approximately $500 million of fixed rate 
residential mortgage loans as FNMA securities. 
Securities available-for-sale decreased slightly from 
year end 1993 to $0.6 billion at September 30, 1994, 
principally as a result of the settlement of certain 
sales transactions executed in the fourth quarter of 
1993.

Sources of Funds. Deposits at September 30, 1994, 
totaled $5.5 billion, an increase of $152 million or 
2.8 percent from the December 31, 1993 total of $5.4 
billion. The increase in deposits resulted from 
acquisitions offset by deposit outflows as depositors 
seeking higher yields are reinvesting their funds in 
mutual funds and other non FDIC insured 
instruments. As interest rates have risen in recent 
months, the pace of deposit outflow has diminished.

Capital Adequacy. Shareholders' equity of $497.7 
million at September 30, 1994, is a decrease of $6.7 
million from December 31, 1993. The decrease 
related to the recording of an unrealized loss 
associated with securities available-for-sale as a 
result of increasing interest rates and, 
correspondingly, decreasing market values of these 
securities. Shareholders' equity as a percentage of 
assets was 6.2 percent at September 30, 1994. 
Common shareholders' equity at September 30, 1994 
was $485.5 million or $15.46 per share compared 
with $492.2 or $15.79 per share at December 31, 
1993. Under minimum regulatory capital regulations 
issued by the OTS, thrift institutions are required to 
meet the following three capital requirements.

Tangible Capital Requirement. Generally, this 
requirement measures capital adequacy after 
consideration of the effect of intangibles, purchased 
servicing assets and other factors on the financial 
statements. Tangible capital must meet or exceed 
1.50 percent of tangible assets, as defined in the 
regulations.

Core Capital Requirement. This measure permits 
thrifts to include in tangible capital supervisory 
goodwill (goodwill related to certain acquisitions 
prior to 1989) on a declining basis through 1994 and 
core deposit intangibles. The core capital of a thrift 
must meet or exceed 3.00 percent of tangible assets, 
as defined in the regulations.

Risk-Based Capital Requirement. The risk-based 
capital ratio measures capital adequacy taking into 
account the level of risk of an institution's assets. 
The OTS has also issued a rule which adds, under 
certain circumstances, an interest rate risk 
component which increases the risk-based capital 
requirement. The Bank is currently not subject to 
any additional risk-based capital requirements 
related to the recently effective interest rate risk 
component. As of December 31, 1993, a thrift's 
risk-based capital must meet or exceed 8.00 percent 
of risk adjusted assets.

The Bank, including its subsidiaries, exceeded the fully 
phased-in capital requirements at September 30, 1994 
as detailed below.

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 1. Pending Litigation.

Edina Realty, Inc. ("Edina"), Equity Title Services, Inc. ("Equity
Title") and the Company along with executives from each entity have been
named in three class action suits (two Federal and one in Minnesota
State Court) alleging that Edina failed to adequately disclose dual
agency in instances where Edina represented both buyer and seller in
real estate transactions and forced its customers to close their real
estate transactions at its affiliate, Equity Title. A definitive
settlement of a non-material amount has been reached with respect to the
class action suit in Minnesota State Court (Dismuke vs. Edina Realty).

On September 13,1994 the Company announced a tentative settlement in the
total amount of $14 million with respect to the two class action suits
in Federal Court (Bokusky et al. vs. Edina Realty and Nitti et al. vs.
Edina Realty). Class members will receive a distribution in that amount,
less amounts paid for expert fees, and costs and expenses of the
litigation, including attorneys fees to be determined by the court. On
September 15, 1994, a judge entered an order granting preliminary
approval to the settlement and scheduled a hearing for January 20, 1995
to determine whether the court should grant final approval to the
settlement.
