IPALCO To Delay Construction of Power Plant

Indianapolis, IN., September 28, 1994 -- IPALCO Enterprises, Inc., the
parent company of Indianapolis Power & Light Company (IPL), announced today
that IPL will further delay the construction of a new, base-load power plant
in Switzerland County in Southern Indiana, to a date beyond the Company's
current five-year Construction Program.

"As part of our ongoing efforts to keep costs as low as possible, we have
intentionally orchestrated a flexible start date for this project. This will
allow us to take advantage -- as long as possible -- of supplies of bulk power,
which we believe will be available several years into the next decade," said
John R. Hodowal, IPALCO Chairman and President.

"Our focus will continue to be -- as it has been in the past
-- to assure a reliable supply of low-cost electricity for our customers.
And even though we are delaying the construction of about 800 megawatts of new
co-owned, base-load, coal-fired electric generating capacity, we will not allow
our quality of service to deteriorate," Hodowal added.

He stressed that IPALCO remains committed to the communities in
Switzerland County and to the location near Patriot, Indiana, as a priority
site when a new base-load power plant resurfaces as part of IPALCO's generation
program.

"It is our responsibility to continually analyze and refine our options
- -- from power purchases to combustion turbine construction -- in our search for
the most reliable, low-cost power. And as a result of this continuing analysis,
construction can be delayed for several years without affecting the quality of
service to our customers," Hodowal said.

IPALCO Enterprises, Inc., is a multi-state energy company providing a
variety of energy products and services. Its principal subsidiary, Indianapolis
Power & Light Company, provides electric service to approximately 400,000
commercial, residential and industrial customers in Indianapolis and in portions
of other Central Indiana communities.
