FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

KEYCORP REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY EARNINGS
-----------------------------------------

CLEVELAND, October 17, 1994 -- KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today reported
record earnings of $229 million for the 1994 third quarter, up 14 percent from
the year-ago quarter. Earnings per common share for the third quarter were
$0.92, up 12 percent from the same period last year.

"It was another great quarter," said Victor J. Riley, Jr., chairman of
the board and chief executive officer. "We had solid loan growth, excellent
credit quality experience, an improved efficiency ratio, a return on average
total assets of over 1.40%, and a return on average common equity of nearly 20
percent. And while all this was being accomplished, we announced the agreement
to acquire Omnibancorp, of Denver, Colorado which will bolster our presence to
over $1 billion in assets in this strategic and fast-growing market. What
better way to demonstrate the success of the KeyCorp/Society Corporation merger
of only seven months ago."

For the first nine months of 1994, net income was $660 million, an
increase of 12 percent from the year-ago period, with earnings per common share
totaling $2.66, up 11 percent. Prior year results have been restated for the
March 1, 1994 merger with Society Corporation, accounted for as a pooling of
interests.

Said Robert W. Gillespie, KeyCorp's president and chief operating
officer, "Successful innovation is critical to future growth. We're especially
pleased with the boost to loan growth and market penetration we see coming from
our pilot Resource Center in the Pacific Northwest. This type of specialized
product delivery will continue to assure that we provide the products and
services our customers want, where and when they want them."

Commenting on financial performance, James W. Wert, senior
executive vice president and chief financial officer, said, "Our 1994 third
quarter 1.43 percent return on average total assets and 19.95 percent return on
average common equity will surely prove to be among the highest ratios in the
industry. Importantly, third quarter noninterest expense decreased $8.6
million from the 1994 second quarter. Our efficiency ratio was 57.9 percent,
down from 58.4 percent in the 1994 second quarter and 60.1 percent in the
year-ago period. We anticipate further positive impacts upon this ratio in
coming quarters as planned merger-related expense savings are realized."

Net interest income in the 1994 third quarter totaled $680
million, up $7 million or one percent, from the year-ago quarter. The
favorable impact of a $6.1 billion, or 12 percent, increase in the level of
average earning assets was partially offset by a decline in the net interest
margin to 4.79 percent from 5.30 percent. Compared to the 1994 second quarter,
net interest income was relatively unchanged, reflecting the favorable impact
of a $1.2 billion, or an annualized 8 percent, increase in average earning
assets which was offset by a decline in the net interest margin to 4.79 percent
from 4.92 percent. The decline in the net interest margin reflects a number of
factors including strong earning asset growth, narrower lending spreads, and a
moderate liability-sensitive balance sheet position which resulted in the
average cost of funds rising somewhat more rapidly than asset yields during the
first three quarters of 1994.

At September 30, 1994, loans totaled $44.6 billion, up $1.5
billion, or 13 percent on an annualized basis, from June 30, 1994. Average
loans in the 1994 third quarter compared to the second quarter were up $1.5
billion, or 14 percent on an annualized basis. Regionally, annualized average
loan growth in the Rocky Mountain (20 percent) and Northwest regions (19
percent) continued to outpace growth in the Great Lakes (12 percent) and
Northeast regions (12 percent).

Noninterest income in the 1994 third quarter totaled $223 million.
When noncore items such as special asset management fees, net securities
transactions, and the third quarter 1993 gain on the sale of Ameritrust Texas
are excluded from all reporting periods for comparative purposes, core
noninterest income in the current quarter was $218 million, down $2 million
from the prior quarter, and down $11 million, or 5 percent, from the year-ago
quarter. This $11 million decrease reflected declines of $10 million and $16
million in trust and mortgage banking income, respectively, which were only
partially offset by increases in other noninterest income categories.

The $10 million decrease in trust income resulted from the
September 1993 sale of Ameritrust Texas which contributed approximately $11
million to the year-ago quarter. Trust income, including investment management
activity, was up 3 percent from the year-ago quarter, after excluding the
impact of the 1993 Ameritrust Texas divestiture.

The $16 million decline in mortgage banking revenue from the
year-ago quarter reflected not only the industry-wide decline in origination
activity from the record levels experienced last year, but also a lower level
of gains from sales of mortgage servicing rights and loans. As was recently
disclosed, KeyCorp is exploring several strategic options regarding its
mortgage banking business, including its possible sale.

Special asset management fees decreased slightly from the year-ago
quarter, and were down nearly $4 million from the 1994 second quarter. As
previously disclosed, these fees are associated with loan collection work done
for the FDIC and are expected to decrease over time as the FDIC assets under
contract are collected and, therefore, decline. These fees will continue to
exhibit quarter-to-quarter volatility depending on the timing associated with
the loan work-outs. For this reason, they are considered noncore fee income.

Noninterest expense totaled $530 million in the 1994 third
quarter. Excluding net OREO expense and certain nonrecurring charges, core
noninterest expense was down $17 million, or 3 percent, from the year-ago
quarter. Compared to the 1994 second quarter, core noninterest expense
declined $7 million, primarily due to a $2 million decrease in personnel
expense and a $5 million decline in the all other expense category. These
decreases related to a number of factors including the continued recognition of
anticipated merger-related cost savings, and downsizing of the mortgage banking
business.

Credit quality measures have continued to improve in recent
quarters and remain at historically strong levels with further improvement
noted in the 1994 third quarter. Nonperforming assets declined $33 million, or
8 percent, from the 1994 second quarter and represented 0.89 percent of loans 
plus other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets. Net loan 
charge-offs totaled a very low $26 million, or 0.24 percent of average loans, 
down from 0.30 percent in the 1994 second quarter. Despite the historically 
low level of net loan charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses continued to 
increase as the provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge-offs. As a 
result of the growth in loans, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of 
loans decreased slightly to 1.84 percent from 1.89 percent at June 30, 1994. 
Both the nonperforming loan and nonperforming asset coverage ratios increased 
and remained strong at 287 percent and 206 percent, respectively.

Also of significance during the quarter was the announcement of a
definitive agreement to acquire Omnibancorp, a Denver, Colorado-based $500
million asset bank. This transaction is expected to close in the first half of
1995 and will grow KeyBank of Colorado's presence to more than $1 billion.

At September 30, 1994, assets totaled $64.5 billion and equity
capital totaled $4.7 billion. The September 30, 1994, Tier 1 capital ratio was
estimated at 8.72 percent and the Total Capital ratio was estimated at 11.89
percent.

NONINTEREST INCOME RECLASSIFICATION

During the third quarter of 1994, certain fees were reclassified from the all
other category of noninterest income to mortgage banking income. This
reclassification was also made to prior period amounts to conform to the
current period presentation. Total noninterest income, as previously reported,
did not change. The reclassification referred to above is reflected in the
numbers presented in the following table:
