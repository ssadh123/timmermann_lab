REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Cinema World Companies

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheet of the Cinema World
Companies as of December 30, 1993, and the related statements of operations and
retained earnings (deficit) and cash flows for the year then ended. These
combined financial statements are the responsibility of management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company entered into an
agreement for the sale of substantially all of its assets subsequent to
December 30, 1993.

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Cinema World
Companies at December 30, 1993, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Notes to Combined Financial Statements

December 30, 1993

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

COMBINATION

The combined financial statements include the accounts of Cinema World, Inc.,
CW Advertising, Inc., and CW Industries, Inc. (collectively referred to herein
as the "Company"). These organizations are affiliated through operations and
certain common ownership interests. A parent/subsidiary relationship does not
exist. Cinema World, Inc. operates motion picture theaters which are owned or
leased under long-term leases. CW Advertising, Inc. is an advertising agency
which places advertising on behalf of both Cinema World, Inc. and others on a
commission basis. CW Industries, Inc. is inactive. Intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in combination.

OPERATIONS

Although the Company operated near the break-even point in 1993 and had a
$14,144,978 deficiency in net assets as of December 30, 1993, they continue to
meet their current and long-term obligations through December 30, 1993 on a
timely basis from operating cash flows and support from an affiliate of certain
stockholders (Note 3). The Company's anticipated cash flows for 1994 are
expected to be sufficient to fund operations and capital commitments.
Additionally, an affiliate of certain stockholders has provided specific
guarantees relating to the Company's obligations under the credit facility
agreement.

Reference is made to Note 7, Subsequent Events, regarding the sale of
substantially all of the assets of the Company and repayment of long-term
obligations.

FISCAL YEAR

The Company maintains the accounting records on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending
on the last Thursday in December.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash equivalents consist of certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements
with banks with a maturity of ninety days or less.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

INVENTORIES

Inventories consist primarily of concession related items which are stated at
the lower of cost (first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis) or market.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Provisions for depreciation have
been computed by the straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives of
the assets. Buildings are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of
twenty years or the lease term, whichever is less, and equipment is depreciated
over periods from five to ten year. Leaseholds and leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of the lease term plus those renewal period options
that were reasonably expected to be exercised at the acquisition date or the
estimated useful life of the improvement.

Equipment not used in operations consists of both new and used theater seats,
projection and concession equipment, carpeting, and other theater related
items, which will be placed in service as replacement equipment in existing
theaters or new equipment in theaters under construction. The carrying value
of the equipment is either cost, for new equipment, or remaining book value,
for equipment removed from an existing theater.

Loss reserves are provided when it becomes known that an existing theater
property will be abandoned in connection with the construction of a new
facility, or it is anticipated that a theater will be closed in the next year.

DEFERRED REVENUES

The Company sells gift book coupons and discount admission tickets which expire
twelve months from date of sale. The gift book coupons are sold to customers
and can be redeemed at either the box office or the concession stand. The
discount admission tickets are sold in quantities to various groups and
organizations and cannot be resold except at the original price. Revenue and
the related expense is recognized when and if the coupons and discount tickets
are

presented for use at the box office or concession stand. During the year,
discount tickets and gift book coupons expired in an aggregate amount of
approximately $119,700 which was recorded as revenue. The deferred revenue
account is comprised of the following:

Balance at December 30, 1993 $ 248,306 $ 133,552 $ 381,858
=====================================================
</TABLE> 

DEFERRED RENT

The Company enters into lease agreements for theaters which occasionally
include fixed escalation provisions in later years. The accompanying financial
statements include recognition of rent expense (including fixed escalation
provisions) on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Included in
rent expense is approximately $55,000, which represents the excess of rent
expense recognized over cash payments made to landlords.

CLOSED THEATER LIABILITY

The Company provides for costs associated with closing theaters at the time the
decision is made to close the theater. These costs include disposal of
equipment, remaining noncancelable lease obligations, real estate taxes and
other miscellaneous costs. The closed theater liability is reduced as payments
are made.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts
receivable.

Notes to Combined Financial Statements (continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

The Company places its temporary cash investments with a high credit quality
financial institution for periods generally less than 30 days. Repurchase
agreements and deposits in excess of $100,000 which are not specifically
collateralized are not insured.

The Company performs advertising services for the major distributors of its
film products. It is the industry practice to offset the accounts receivable
for such advertising services against film rental costs at the time of payment
of the film rental. At December 30, 1993, the Company had accounts receivable
of approximately $308,400 which were not subject to this settlement practice.
The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of these companies and does not
require collateral. Credit losses have consistently been within management's
expectations.

ADVERTISING COSTS

It is the Company's policy to expense advertising costs in the period that they
are incurred. Advertising costs for the period ending December 30, 1993 were
approximately $1,099,000.

2. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company incurred certain expenses in connection with the guarantee by an
affiliate of certain stockholders of the Company's indebtedness to the bank and
former owners. Amounts incurred for providing the guarantee in 1993 were
$134,682.

3. LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)

NOTE PAYABLE--CREDIT FACILITY

In connection with the original acquisition of certain assets of the Company, a
credit facility agreement ("Facility") with a bank ("Bank") was entered into in
the amount of $21,000,000. In November 1990, the amount of the Facility was
increased to $22,500,000. Interest was payable at the prime rate plus 1% or
LIBOR plus 2% rate, at the option of the borrower. The Facility was
collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company. In addition,
to the extent the Company did not attain a certain ratio of total debt to
operating cash flow, an affiliate of certain stockholders of the Company
provided a guarantee for the excess amount.

On May 4, 1993, the Facility was replaced with a credit facility from another
bank in the amount of $27,000,000. The new facility was scheduled to mature on
August 4, 1993, and was subsequently amended to mature on September 4, 1993.
The facility was fully guaranteed by an affiliate of certain stockholders of
the Company. On August 30, 1993, the Company entered into a permanent credit
facility with this bank. The permanent credit facility consists of a
$26,000,000 term loan and a $1,000,000 revolving credit agreement. The
outstanding balance on the revolving credit agreement as of December 30, 1993
was $250,000. Interest is payable at the prime rate or LIBOR plus .625% rate,
at the option of the borrower (4% at December 30, 1993 for the term loan and 6%
for the revolving credit agreement). The permanent credit facility is
collateralized by the guarantee of an affiliate of certain stockholders. The
guarantor must maintain a certain level of tangible net worth and a certain
liquidity ratio, both of which are defined in the guarantee document. The
permanent credit facility matures on December 31, 1988, and has an annual
commitment fee of $33,750. In connection with the financing, the Company
incurred certain costs associated with terminating the outstanding interest
rate swap transactions. These costs totaling $443,700 are included in interest
expense.

SUBORDINATED DEBT

At December 31, 1992, the Company had outstanding debt of $3,573,240 payable to
affiliates of certain stockholders. Payment of the indebtedness was
subordinated to the obligations of the Company under the Facility as agreed
upon by all parties. Interest was payable on a quarterly basis at the prime
rate plus 2%. The amounts outstanding were repaid with the proceeds of the new
facility on May 4, 1993.

Reference is made to Note 7, Subsequent Events, regarding the sale of
substantially all of the assets of the Company and repayment of long-term
obligations.

4. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Total rental expense for the office, theaters, and equipment amounted to
$3,963,130, including contingent rentals of $234,504 based on gross revenues in
excess of specified minimums, for the year ended December 30, 1993. The
minimum rental commitments payable under noncancelable leases for theaters,
excluding options to renew for periods ranging from five to thirty years,
aggregate as follows:

Notes to Combined Financial Statements (continued)

5. INCOME TAXES

The shareholders of the Company included in the combination elected under
Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code to include the Company's loss in
their own income for federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, the
Company is not subject to federal and state income taxes.

6. STOCK OPTIONS

In 1989, employment agreements were signed with two executives of the Company.
The agreements provide for the payment of certain levels of base pay, bonuses,
and certain fringe benefits. Nonqualified stock options were also granted to
each of the executives, permitting each the purchase of 74 shares of common
stock at a price per share of $6,585. The options may be exercised in whole or
in part at any time until the earliest of December 31, 1997, 90 days after
termination of employment or a change of control in the Company (as defined by
the employment agreements). The agreements also provide that the executives
may "put" the stock back to the Company or the Company may "call" the stock in
the event of death or disability, involuntary termination, or expiration of the
employment agreement of the executive, or a change in control of the Company.

On or about January 6, 1994, a former executive of the Company exercised 74
options representing all his outstanding options and expressed his intention to
put the common shares to the Company for a price per share equal to the fair
market value of a share of common stock. This former executive filed a claim
against the Company for $650,000 representing the former executive's opinion of
the value of the stock (net of the option price) plus additional compensation
alleged to be due him. This former executive further advised the Company that
as a result of an oral agreement, he was not obligated to pay the option price
per share. This matter has been tentatively settled.

It is anticipated, in conjunction with the asset sale described in Note 7, the
executive holding the remaining 74 options will exercise the options and put
his 74 shares of common stock to the Company for their fair market value under
the change of control provisions of the employment agreements.

The payments associated with the stock put arrangements if executed as
described above will be treated as compensation expense when it becomes
probable that the payments will be made.

7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On May 20, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale of
substantially all its assets to Carmike Cinemas, Inc. (Carmike) for
$38,100,000. The assets sold include, but are not limited to, the theater
buildings, equipment, leasehold and leasehold improvements, concession
inventories, and related contracts. Carmike subsequently advised the Company
on May 27, 1994 that, under the terms of the agreement, Carmike was asserting a
claim of approximately $905,000 against the Company for breach of certain
representations and warranties contained in the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
The Company has filed a timely response to the claim disputing substantially
all of the claim and intends to vigorously defend against the claim.

On May 20, 1994, the Company utilized a portion of the proceeds from the sale
to repay the outstanding notes payable--revolving credit facility.

Four closed theaters and one operating theater were not included in the sale of
assets. Equipment and leaseholds for these theaters had a net book value at
December 30, 1993 of $369,874. In a transaction not directly related to the
sale, the Company entered into a separate agreement on May 16, 1994 which
transferred the Company's interest in the equipment and lease of the remaining
operating theater, in settlement of their future lease obligation on one of the
closed theaters. The future lease obligation of the closed theater included in
this transaction was $1,056,212 and is included in the closed theater
liability. The net book value of the equipment as of December 30, 1993
included in the exchange was $282,048.

Notes to Unaudited Combined Financial Statements

March 31, 1994

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited combined financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have
been included. Operating results for the three-month period ended March 31,
1994 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
year ended December 29, 1994. For further information, refer to Cinema World
Companies' combined financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year
ended December 30, 1993.

2. CONTINGENCIES

On or about January 6, 1994, a former executive of the Company exercised 74
options representing all his outstanding options and expressed his intention to
put the common shares to the Company for a price per share equal to the fair
market value of a share of common stock. This former executive filed a claim
against the Company for $650,000 representing the former executive's opinion of
the value of the stock (net of the option price) plus additional compensation
alleged to be due him. This former executive further advised the Company that
as a result of an oral agreement, he was not obligated to pay the option price
per share. This matter has been tentatively settled.

3. ASSET SALE

On May 20, 1994, the Company entered in an agreement for the sale of
substantially all its assets to Carmike Cinemas, Inc. (Carmike) for
$38,100,000. The assets sold include, but are not limited to, the theater
buildings, equipment, leasehold and leasehold improvements, concession
inventories, and related contracts. Carmike subsequently advised the Company
on May 27, 1994 that, under the terms of the agreement, Carmike was asserting a
claim of approximately $905,000 against the Company for breach of certain
representations and warranties contained in the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
The Company has filed a timely response to the claim disputing substantially
all of the claim and intends to vigorously defend against the claim.

On May 20, 1994, the Company utilized a portion of the proceeds from the sale
to repay the outstanding notes payable -- revolving credit facility.

3. ASSET SALE (CONTINUED)

Four closed theaters and one operating theater were not included in the sale of
assets. Equipment and leaseholds for these theaters had a net book value at
December 30, 1993 of $369,874. In a transaction not directly related to the
sale, the Company entered into a separate agreement on May 16, 1994 which
transferred the Company's interest in the equipment and lease of the remaining
operating theater, in settlement of their future lease obligation on one of the
closed theaters. The future lease obligation of the closed theater included in
this transaction was $1,056,212 and is included in the closed theater
liability. The net book value of the equipment as of December 30, 1993
included in the exchange was $282,048.

purchase hereinafter referred to as the "Transaction") pursuant to an Agreement
dated as of the same date by and between the Company and Cinema World, C.W.
Industries, Inc. and C.W. Advertising, Inc. (collectively the "Cinema World
Companies"). Cinema World was engaged in the motion picture exhibition
business and its assets consist of theatre properties located primarily in

The Company paid $38.1 million to Cinema World for assets consisting primarily

These pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not
purport to represent what the Company's actual results of operations would have
been had such Transaction occurred on January 1, 1993 and should not serve as a

upon certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the
circumstances. These pro forma unaudited financial statements should be read

Notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 1993 (as filed on Form 10-K) and
for the three months ended March 31, 1994 (as filed on Form 10-Q).
