The Merger

Section 2.1 The Merger. At the Effective Date, in accordance with
this Agreement and the GCL, F4L Supermarkets shall be merged with and into
Ralphs Supermarkets, the separate existence of F4L Supermarkets (except as may
be continued by operation of law) shall cease, and Ralphs Supermarkets shall
continue as the surviving corporation. As constituted from and after the
Effective Date, Ralphs Supermarkets hereinafter sometimes is referred to as
the "Surviving Corporation."

Section 2.2 Effect of the Merger. When the Merger has been
effected, the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon and thereafter possess all
the rights, privileges, immunities and franchises, of a public as well as of a
private nature, of F4L Supermarkets and Ralphs Supermarkets (the "Constituent
Corporations"); all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due on
whatever account and all choses in action, and all and every other interest,
or belonging to or due

<PAGE>13

each of the Constituent Corporations shall be vested in the Surviving
Corporation without further act or deed; and the title to any real estate, or
any interest therein, vested in F4L Supermarkets, Ralphs Supermarkets or the
Surviving Corporation shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of
the Merger. The Surviving Corporation shall thenceforth be responsible and
liable for all the liabilities and obligations of each of the Constituent
Corporations so merged; any claim existing or action or proceeding pending by
or against any of the Constituent Corporations may be prosecuted as if the
Merger had not taken place, or the Surviving Corporation may be substituted in
its place. The Surviving Corporation shall have all the rights, privileges,
immunities and powers and shall be subject to all the duties and liabilities
of a corporation organized under the GCL, and neither the rights of creditors
nor any liens upon the respective properties of the Constituent Corporations
and the Surviving Corporation shall be impaired by the Merger; all with the
effect set forth in the GCL.

Section 2.3 Consummation of the Merger. As soon as is practicable
after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions hereinafter set forth, the
parties hereto will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the
Secretary of State of Delaware a certificate of merger in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
GCL (the time of such filing being the "Effective Date").

Section 2.4 Restated Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws;
Directors and Officers. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Ralphs Supermarkets, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Date, until thereafter amended as provided therein and under the GCL, except
that the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall provide for the authorized capitalization and for the number of
directors set forth in the certificate of merger filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State.

Section 2.5 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Date, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of F4L Supermarkets,
Ralphs Supermarkets, the Surviving Corporation or the holder of any of the
following securities:

(a) Each Share (or fractional Share) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date shall be cancelled and extinguished
and be converted into and become a right to receive $16.60971 in cash and
$3.9083 principal amount of the Debentures (or the pro rata portion of such
cash and Debentures, in the case of fractional Shares) (collectively, and
together with the cash amounts referred to in Section 2.5(b) below, the
"Merger Consideration"). Each Selling Stockholder hereby waives all
dissenters', appraisal and other rights arising under Section 262 of the GCL
(or comparable provisions of any applicable laws of other jurisdictions) with
respect to its Shares in the Merger. The Merger Consideration payable to each
Selling Stockholder is set forth in Schedule 2.5(a).

(b) Debentures will be issued only in denominations of $1000 and
integral multiples of $1000. A Selling Stockholder will not be entitled to
receive Debentures in principal amounts less than $1000, or in principal
amounts in excess of $1000 (or an integral multiple thereof) but less than the
next highest integral multiple ("Fractional Amounts"), but instead will be
entitled to receive cash in lieu of any such Fractional Amount.

(c) Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of F4L
Supermarkets issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each share
of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of F4L Supermarkets issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of preferred
stock of the Surviving Corporation,

<PAGE>14

having the same rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as that share
of Preferred Stock of F4L Supermarkets so converted.

(d) All notes and other debt instruments of the Constituent
Corporations which are outstanding at the Effective Date shall continue to be
outstanding subsequent to the Effective Date as debt instruments of the
Surviving Corporation, if permitted by their respective terms and provisions.

(e) There shall be withheld from the cash consideration set forth
in Section 2.5(a) any amounts lawfully required to be withheld and paid over
to any taxing authority with respect to any Selling Stockholder (whether by
reason of receipt of the Merger Consideration or any other consideration
received in, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); it being agreed, however, that except as otherwise required as a
result of a change after the date hereof in law (including court decisions),
regulations or administrative interpretation thereof: (i) if the Company
provides a FIRPTA certificate as set forth in Section 7.1(h) hereof (and F4L
has no reason to believe that such certificate is not true and complete), no
portion of the cash consideration shall be withheld pursuant to sections 897
and 1445 of the Code, and (ii) if such Selling Stockholder provides an opinion
of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to F4L and to F4L's
counsel to the effect that no portion of the Merger Consideration to be
received by such Selling Stockholder is subject to withholding under sections
1441 or 1442 of the Code, no amount of the cash consideration shall be
withheld pursuant to sections 1441 or 1442 of the Code.

Section 2.6 Ralphs Supermarkets Stock Options and Related Matters.
At or immediately prior to the Effective Date, each then outstanding stock
option (an "Option") to purchase Shares, heretofore granted under the Ralphs
Holding Company Nonqualified Stock Option Plan dated February 3, 1992 (whether
or not such Option is then exercisable) shall be cancelled, exercised or
surrendered by the holder thereof, without payment of consideration for such
cancellation or surrender (or payment of Merger Consideration with respect to
any Shares acquired upon exercise thereof) in excess of $880,000 (including
the principal amount of any Debentures issued as Merger Consideration with
respect to Shares acquired upon exercise thereof). At or immediately prior to
the Effective Date, each then outstanding equity appreciation right (an "EAR")
heretofore granted pursuant to the Company's Equity Appreciation Plan, as
amended through the date hereof (the "EAR Plan"), will be paid in accordance
with its terms. In the event that F4L and the holders of such options or EARs
enter into any agreement to modify or cancel a portion of the options or EARs
held by such person in connection with the consummation of the Merger, the
Company will execute such documentation as may be reasonably requested by F4L
to reflect such modification or cancellation.

Section 2.7 Closing. The Closing shall take place on the Closing
Date at 10:00 A.M., Los Angeles time, at the offices of Latham & Watkins, 633

place as shall be agreed upon by the parties. At the Closing (a) the Selling

<PAGE>15

Delaware and certificates of good standing of Ralphs Supermarkets in Delaware

Section 2.8 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) From and after the Effective Date, each holder of a certificate
or certificates representing Shares shall surrender such certificate or
certificates to the Surviving Corporation, duly endorsed without recourse
except as provided herein, as the Surviving Corporation may require, and shall
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Date,
the holder of a certificate or certificates representing Shares shall have no
rights with respect to such Shares other than to surrender such certificate or
certificates pursuant to this Section 2.8. No interest shall accrue on the
Merger Consideration. If the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) is
to be delivered to any person other than the person in whose name the
certificate or certificates representing Shares surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such exchange that the
person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Surviving Corporation any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate
or certificates so surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any other
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat and similar laws.

(b) After the Effective Date, there shall be no transfers of any
Shares on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after
the Effective Date, certificates formerly representing Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.8.

Section 2.9 Alternative Transaction Structure. At the election of
F4L, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be restructured in
the form of a purchase by F4L or a subsidiary of F4L of all of the outstanding
capital stock of Ralphs Supermarkets, or a merger of a subsidiary of F4L with
and into Ralphs Supermarkets, or such other form as F4L may determine to be
appropriate, provided that such stock purchase or other form does not result
in any consequences

<PAGE>16

to any Selling Stockholder which are less favorable to such Selling
Stockholder than the consequences which would have resulted from the Merger,
and appropriate conforming changes to this Agreement satisfactory to the
Selling Stockholders are made.

and not jointly, to F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets as follows (in each

Stockholder is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Except as set forth in

by such Selling Stockholder, and, assuming the due execution hereof by each
other party hereto, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Selling Stockholder, enforceable against such Selling
Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject in each case to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now
or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally
and to general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in equity or at law).

Section 3.2 Ownership of Shares. At the time of Closing, such
Selling Stockholder will own, beneficially and of record, all of the Shares
issued in its name and set forth opposite its name on Schedule 3.2, free of

with, or to obtain any permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
government or regulatory authority or any non-governmental person or entity in
connection with the execution and delivery by such Selling Stockholder of this
Agreement, the consummation of the Merger, and the performance of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, except where the failure to make such
filings or registrations or to obtain such permits, authorizations, consents
or approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.3, neither
the execution or delivery of this Agreement by such Selling Stockholder nor
the consummation by such Selling Stockholder of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will (i) violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or By-laws of such Selling Stockholder, (ii) violate any
provision of, or constitute (with or without notice, the passage of time or
both) a default under, or result in the acceleration of or entitle any party

instrument or obligation to which such Selling Stockholder is a party or by
which it or the Shares owned by it are bound, except where such event would

order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation to which such
Selling Stockholder is subject.

of the officers and management employees of F4L and Ralphs Supermarkets and to
acquire additional information about the business, assets and financial
condition of F4L and Ralphs Supermarkets. Such Selling Stockholder confirms
that it is not acquiring the Debentures with a view toward any distribution
thereof or with any present intention of selling any Debentures in either case
in a transaction that would violate the Securities Act or the securities laws
of any state or other applicable jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of
Section 6.10 hereof, such Selling Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the
Debentures may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act except pursuant to an exemption from such registration
available under the Securities Act.

Except as set forth in Schedule 3.5 or the Ralphs Registration Rights
Agreement, no Selling Stockholder has any legal obligation, absolute or
contingent, to any other person or firm to sell or dispose of its interest in
the capital stock of Ralphs Supermarkets, by way of a sale of capital stock,
merger, consolidation or other reorganization, or otherwise, or to enter into
any agreement with respect thereto. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.5, EJDC
has not directly or through any Affiliate or agent created, or caused to be

or firm to sell any material portion of the Assets of the Company, to sell the

consolidation or other reorganization of Ralphs Supermarkets or Ralphs
Grocery, or to enter into any agreement with respect thereto, or (ii) any
liability (contingent or otherwise) for payment of a brokerage, finder's,
investment banking or other fee or commission in connection with any sale or
restructuring of the Company, or (iii) any obligation with respect to the
issuance or sale of capital stock by Ralphs Supermarkets or any subsidiary.

equity interests in, Ralphs Supermarkets or any subsidiary of Ralphs

Supermarkets owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Ralphs
Grocery, and Ralphs Grocery owns all of the issued and outstanding capital

entity (other than investments in marketable securities).

Section 4.4 Authority. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors and
stockholders of Ralphs Supermarkets and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Ralphs Supermarkets or its stockholders are necessary therefor. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Ralphs Supermarkets and,
assuming the due execution hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Ralphs Supermarkets, enforceable
against Ralphs Supermarkets in accordance with its terms, subject in each case
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors'
rights generally and to general equitable principles (regardless of whether
such enforceability is sought in equity or at law).

Section 4.5 Consents and Approvals; No Violation. Except for
liquor licensing laws, the filing with the Delaware Secretary of State of the
certificate of merger referred to in Section 2.3, and the matters set forth in
Schedule 4.5, and assuming compliance with any applicable Antitrust Laws,

approval of, any government or regulatory authority or any non-governmental
person or entity in connection with the execution and delivery by Ralphs
Supermarkets of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the
performance of the other transactions contemplated hereby, except where the
failure to make such filings or registrations or to obtain such permits,
authorizations, consents and approvals would not, individually or in the
aggregate impair the continued operation by the Company of any store,
warehouse or distribution facility, or otherwise have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.5, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Ralphs Supermarkets nor the consummation by
Ralphs

<PAGE>19

Supermarkets of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will (i) violate any provision of Ralphs Supermarkets' certificate
of incorporation or by-laws, (ii) violate any provision of, or constitute

of the Assets that are leased by it, which leasehold interests are free and
clear of all Encumbrances, except as set forth in Schedule 4.8 and for
Permitted Encumbrances and except for Encumbrances that would not,

them or their respective

<PAGE>22

properties or assets are bound, or which otherwise relate to the operation of
their respective business (the "Leases"). The Company has in all material
respects performed all the obligations required to be performed by it with
respect to (y) all Assets leased by it (whether as lessor or lessee) except
where the failure to perform would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect, and (z) all Leases of the Facilities, and there
exists no default or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time
or both, would become a default on the part of the Company under any Lease,
which defaults, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Leases are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms and are in full force and effect, and assuming all
consents required by the terms thereof or applicable law have been obtained,
the Leases will continue to be valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms and in full force and effect immediately following
the consummation of the transactions expressly contemplated hereby (excluding
any modification to the transaction structure pursuant to Section 2.9), except
where the failure of such Leases to be or continue in effect will not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Ralphs Supermarkets has delivered to F4L, or
otherwise made available, originals or true copies of all the Leases as
amended, and made available for review all related files.

in default under, or in breach or violation of, any Contract except where such

lapse of time or both, entitle the holder of any indebtedness affecting the
Company to accelerate, or which does accelerate, the maturity of any
indebtedness affecting the Company, except as set forth in Schedule 4.10. To
the best of the Company's knowledge, the Company has not committed any act,
and there has been no omission which will result in a default by it under, or
the breach by it of, any Contract, and there has been no occurrence which will

adversely decided, would prevent or delay the Merger or otherwise prevent
Ralphs Supermarkets from performing its obligations under this Agreement, nor
is there any outstanding judgment, decree, or injunction or any statute, rule
or order of any domestic or foreign court, governmental department,
commission, agency or arbitrator which has or will have, individually or in
the aggregate, any such Material Adverse Effect.

with all foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable to

Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.12, to the best knowledge
of the Company, the Company has not received any notice asserting a failure,
or possible failure, to comply with any such law, regulation or requirement
the subject of which notice has not been resolved as required thereby or
otherwise to the satisfaction of the party sending the notice, except to the
extent that failure to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The

Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

orders, licenses, permits, purchase agreements and other agreements, business
arrangements and commitments described in Schedule 4.9 or which are of the

other qualifications which would have required them to be listed in Schedule
4.9, and (iv) other liabilities or obligations which would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 4.15 No Brokers. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.15, no

(c) Representations. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.18, Ralphs

(i) Pension Plans

(A) The funding method used in connection with each
Pension Plan which is subject to the minimum funding requirements of
ERISA and the actuarial assumptions used in connection with funding each
such plan are reasonable. During the last five years, the fair market
value of the assets in the Ralphs Grocery Company Retirement

<PAGE>27

Plan have exceeded the Plan's accumulated benefit obligations under FAS 87.
No "accumulated funding deficiency" (for which an excise tax is due or
would be due in the absence of a waiver) as defined in Section 412 of the
Code or as defined in Section 302(a)(2) of ERISA, whichever may apply, has
been incurred with respect to any Pension Plan with respect to any plan
year, whether or not waived. Neither the Company nor any Current ERISA
Affiliate has failed to pay when due any "required installment," within
the meaning of Section 412(m) of the Code and Section 302(e) of ERISA,
whichever may apply, with respect to any Pension Plan. Neither the Company
nor any Current ERISA Affiliate is subject to any lien imposed under
Section 412(n) of the Code or Section 302(f) of ERISA, whichever may
apply, with respect to any Pension Plan. Neither the Company nor any
Current ERISA Affiliate has failed to make full payment when due of all
amounts which under the provisions of any Pension Plan or the Code
of ERISA are required to be made as contributions to such Pension Plan.

(B) Neither the Company nor any Current ERISA Affiliate
is required to provide security to a Pension Plan under Section
401(a)(29) of the Code.

(C) Each Pension Plan intended to be qualified and each
related trust agreement, annuity contract or other funding instrument of
any such plan is qualified and tax-exempt under the provisions of Code
Sections 401(a) (or 403(a), as appropriate) and 501(a) and has been so
qualified during the period from its adoption to date.

(D) To the knowledge of Ralphs Supermarkets, each Pension
Plan, each related trust agreement, annuity contract or other funding
instrument presently complies and has been maintained in substantial com-
pliance with its terms and, both as to form and in operation, with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
regulations which are applicable to such plans, including but not limited
to ERISA and the Code.

(E) The Company has paid all premiums (and interest
charges and penalties for late payment, if applicable) due the PBGC with
respect to each Pension Plan for each plan year thereof for which such
premiums are required. Neither the Company nor any Current ERISA
Affiliate has engaged in, or is a successor or parent corporation to an
entity that has engaged in, a transaction described in Section 4069 of
ERISA. There has been no "reportable event" (as defined in Section
4043(b) of ERISA and the PBGC regulations under such Section) with
respect to any Pension Plan. No filing has been made by the Company or
any Current ERISA Affiliate with the PBGC, and no proceeding has been
commenced by the PBGC, to terminate any Pension Plan. No condition
exists and no event has occurred that could constitute grounds for the
termination of any Pension Plan by the PBGC. Neither the Company nor any
Current ERISA Affiliate has, at any time, (I) ceased operations at a
facility so as to become subject to the provisions of Section 4068(e) of
ERISA, (II) withdrawn as a substantial employer so as to become subject
to the provisions of Section 4063 of ERISA or (III) ceased making
contributions on or before the Closing Date to any Pension Plan subject
to Section 4064(a) of ERISA to which the Company or any Current ERISA
Affiliate made contributions during the five years prior to the Closing
Date.

(F) No Other Pension Plan has been terminated in a manner
which would subject the Company or any of its Current ERISA Affiliates to
any liability.

<PAGE>28

(ii) Multiemployer Plans

(A) Neither the Company nor any Current ERISA Affiliate
has, at any time, withdrawn from a Multiemployer Plan in a "complete
withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" as defined in Sections 4203 and
4205 of ERISA, respectively, so as to result in a liability, contingent

bankruptcy, conservatorship or rehabilitation proceedings.

(xv) Equity Appreciation Rights. Schedule 4.18 sets forth a
list of all holders of currently outstanding EARs or other rights which are
based upon or derive their value from the value of the Shares, the number of

retentions and deductibles, expiration dates, annual premiums and a general
description of the type of coverage provided) maintained by the Company on its
business, property or employees within the last five years. To the Company's
knowledge, all of such policies are sufficient for compliance with all
requirements of law and of all contracts to which the Company is a party,

Effect. To the best of the Company's knowledge, the Company has not failed to
give any notice or to present any claim under any such policy or binder in a
due and timely fashion, except where any such failure to give any notice or to
present any claim would not have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no
outstanding unpaid claims under any such policies or binders for which
adequate reserves have not been established. Such policies and binders
provide sufficient coverage (in light of prevailing commercial practices with
respect to similarly situated properties) for the risks insured against, are
in full force and effect on the date hereof and shall be kept in full force
and effect by the Company through the Effective Date. True copies of the
documents described will be delivered to F4L on request.

ARTICLE V
Representations and Warranties of F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets

Each of F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets hereby represents and
warrants to Ralphs Supermarkets and the Selling Stockholders as follows:

Section 5.1 Organization; Authorization; etc. Each of F4L, F4L
Holdings and F4L Supermarkets is duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Indenture,
the consummation of the Merger, the issuance of the Debentures and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by the
Board of Directors of each of F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets, as
applicable, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of any of them are
necessary therefor. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
each of F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets, and, assuming the due
execution hereof by the other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L
Supermarkets, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms,
subject in each case to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law). On or
prior to the Closing Date, the Indenture and the Debentures will have been
duly executed and delivered by F4L Holdings, and assuming the due execution
hereof by the trustee thereunder, the Indenture and the Debentures will
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of F4L Holdings,
enforceable against F4L Holdings in accordance with their respective terms,
subject in each case to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law). Without
limitation of the foregoing, the Debentures will not, at the time of their
issuance, violate any applicable usury laws of the State of California.

Section 5.2 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except for
liquor licensing and pharmacy laws, the filing with the Delaware Secretary of
State of the certificate of merger referred to in Section 2.3, and the matters
set forth in Schedule 5.2, and assuming compliance with applicable Antitrust
Laws, there is no requirement applicable to F4L, F4L Holdings or F4L
Supermarkets to make any filing or registration with, or to obtain any permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any government or regulatory authority
or any non-governmental person or entity in connection with the execution and
delivery by F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets of this Agreement, the

<PAGE>33

consummation of the Merger and the performance of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except where the failure to make such filings or
registrations or to obtain such permits, authorizations, consents or approvals
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.2, neither the execution or
delivery of this Agreement by F4L, F4L Holdings or F4L Supermarkets nor the
consummation by any of them of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (i) violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or By-laws of any of them, (ii) violate any
provision of, or constitute (with or without notice, the passage of time or
both) a default under, or result in the acceleration of or entitle any party
to accelerate (whether after the giving of notice or lapse of time or both) or
terminate any obligation under, any mortgage, lien, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which F4L, F4L Holdings or F4L Supermarkets is a
party or by which any of them is bound, except where such event would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
business, assets, results of operations or financial condition of the
Surviving Corporation, or (iii) assuming compliance with any applicable
Antitrust Laws, violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or
regulation to which any of them is subject.

Section 5.3 Acquisition of Shares for Investment. F4L has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of its acquisition of shares of the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger. F4L confirms that Ralphs Supermarkets
has made available to F4L the opportunity to ask questions of the officers and
management employees of the Company and to acquire additional information
about the business, assets and financial condition of the Company. F4L
confirms that it is not acquiring shares of the Surviving Corporation with a
view toward any distribution thereof or with any present intention of selling
any shares in a transaction that would violate the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any state or other applicable jurisdiction. F4L
acknowledges and agrees that such shares may not be sold, transferred, offered
for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration
under the Securities Act except pursuant to an exemption from such
registration available under the Securities Act.

Section 5.4 Shelf Registration Statement. None of the information
contained in the Shelf Registration Statement, at (i) the time the Shelf
Registration Statement becomes effective, and (ii) the Effective Date, will
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, F4L and its subsidiaries make
no representations or warranties with respect to any information that has been
supplied by the Company or its auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, other
consultants or advisors specifically for use in any of the foregoing
documents. The Shelf Registration Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

Section 5.5 No Brokers. Neither F4L nor any subsidiary or
Affiliate of F4L has created any liability or obligation on the part of any
Selling Stockholder to pay any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission
in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.6 Financing Commitments. F4L has delivered to Ralphs
Supermarkets and EJDC copies of fully-executed letters from the Financing
Sources setting forth the commitments of such Financing Sources to provide
(or, in the case of public debt securities comprising part of the Financing,
stating that such Financing Sources are "highly confident" of their ability to
provide) the amounts and types of Financing upon the terms therein
contemplated (collectively, and together with any modifications or
replacements thereof approved by EJDC, the "Commitment Letters"). The
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters, together with the existing
debt securities of F4L,

<PAGE>34

Ralphs Supermarkets, or their respective subsidiaries, as amended or as
exchanged for newly-issued debt securities of F4L or its subsidiaries pursuant
to the Public Debt Refinancing, provide for all of the Financing needed by F4L
and its subsidiaries to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
fund the anticipated working capital requirements of the Surviving Corporation
after the Closing. As of the date hereof, F4L knows of no reason that the
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters will not be satisfied.

Section 5.7 Financial Statements. The unaudited consolidated
balance sheets of F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets as of April 2, 1994 and
the related unaudited consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for
the twelve weeks then ended, with the notes thereto, contained in the
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for such period filed with the SEC by F4L
Holdings and F4L Supermarkets, respectively (collectively, the "F4L Unaudited
Financial Statements"), and the audited consolidated balance sheets of F4L
Holdings and F4L Supermarkets as of June 26, 1993 and June 27, 1992 and the
related audited consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
stockholder's equity for the fiscal years then ended, with the notes thereto,
contained in the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such periods filed with the
SEC by F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets, respectively (collectively, the "F4L
Audited Financial Statements" and, together with the F4L Unaudited Financial
Statements, the "F4L Financial Statements"), present fairly the consolidated
financial position and results of operations of F4L Holdings and F4L
Supermarkets, respectively, for the periods or as of the dates set forth
therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise indicated
therein or in Schedule 5.7 and except that the F4L Unaudited Financial
Statements do not include all of the notes required by GAAP). Except as
otherwise set forth therein, the F4L Financial Statements are complete in all
material respects, are in accordance with the books and records of F4L
Holdings and F4L Supermarkets, respectively, fairly present the financial
condition and results of operations indicated thereby in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied, and contain and reflect all necessary adjustments (under
GAAP consistently applied) for a fair representation of the F4L Financial
Statements as of the dates and for the periods covered thereby.

Section 5.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set
forth in Schedule 5.8, since April 2, 1994, F4L Holdings and its subsidiaries
have conducted its business only in the ordinary and usual course and there
has not been any change in F4L Holdings' condition (financial or otherwise),
results of operations, assets, liabilities, working capital or reserves,
except for changes contemplated hereby or changes which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
Surviving Corporation, or other event or condition of any character which in
any one case or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on
the business, assets, results of operations or financial condition of the
Surviving Corporation, or any event or condition (other than matters of
general public knowledge relating to general economic conditions or F4L's
industry as a whole) which it is reasonable to expect will, individually or in
the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results
of operations or financial condition of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.9 Absence of Breaches or Defaults. None of F4L Holdings
or any subsidiary is in default under, or in breach or violation of, any
Contract except where such event would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of operations
or financial condition of the Surviving Corporation. No event has occurred
which either entitles, or would, on notice or lapse of time or both, entitle
the holder of any material indebtedness of F4L Holdings or any subsidiary to
accelerate, or which does accelerate, the maturity of any material
indebtedness of F4L Holdings or any subsidiary, except as set forth in
Schedule 5.9. To F4L's knowledge, neither F4L Holdings nor any subsidiary has
committed any act, and there has been no omission which will result in a
default by it under, or the breach by it of, any Contract, and there has been
no occurrence which will give rise to product liability or breach of warranty
(whether covered by insurance or not) on the part of F4L Holdings or any
subsidiary.

<PAGE>35

Section 5.10 Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.10,
there are no Actions instituted, pending or, to the knowledge of F4L,
threatened, which are reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate,
directly or indirectly to have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, results of operations or financial condition of the Surviving
Corporation, or, if adversely decided, would prevent or delay the Merger or
otherwise prevent F4L, F4L Holdings, or F4L Supermarkets from performing their
respective obligations under this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
Debentures, nor is there any outstanding judgment, decree, or injunction or
any statute, rule or order of any domestic or foreign court, governmental
department, commission, agency or arbitrator which would have, individually or
in the aggregate, any such material adverse effect on the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 5.11 Compliance with Law. Each of F4L Holdings and its
subsidiaries is in compliance with all foreign, federal, state and local laws
and regulations applicable to its operations or with respect to which
compliance is a condition of engaging in the business thereof (including,
without limitation, all Environmental Laws), except to the extent that failure
to comply would not have a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
results of operations or financial condition of the Surviving Corporation.
Except as set forth in Schedule 5.11, to the knowledge of F4L, none of F4L
Holdings or any subsidiary has received any notice asserting a failure, or
possible failure, to comply with any such law, regulation or requirement the
subject of which notice has not been resolved as required thereby or otherwise
to the satisfaction of the party sending the notice, except to the extent that
failure to comply would not have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, results of operation or financial condition of the Surviving
Corporation. F4L Holdings and its subsidiaries have all material permits,
licenses and franchises from governmental agencies required to conduct their
business as now being conducted and none of such permits, licenses and
franchises will be terminated as a result of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.12 No Undisclosed Liabilities. None of F4L Holdings or
any subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations (absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) except (i) liabilities which are reflected and
reserved against in the F4L Unaudited Financial Statements as of April 2,
1994, (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice since April 2, 1994, (iii) liabilities arising
under Contracts, letters of credit, purchase orders, licenses, permits,
purchase agreements and other agreements, business arrangements and
commitments which would be described in Schedule 4.9 if they were Company
obligations, or of the type described in Schedule 4.9 but which do not meet
the dollar threshold or other qualifications which would have required them to
be listed in Schedule 4.9, (iv) liabilities arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation the
Financing, (v) liabilities set forth in Schedule 5.12 and (vi) other
liabilities or obligations which would not have a material adverse effect on
the business, assets, results of operations or financial condition of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.13 Material Misstatements Or Omissions. No repre-
sentations or warranties by F4L or its subsidiaries in this Agreement, nor any
exhibit, statement, certificate or schedule furnished to Ralphs Supermarkets
or the Selling Stockholders or their respective agents or Affiliates pursuant
hereto, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, contains
or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omits or will omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements or facts contained
therein not misleading. There is no fact known to F4L which is not disclosed
in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule and which is reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of operations
or financial condition of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.14 No Additional Agreements. Neither F4L nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any arrangement, agreement or understanding with
any person who is a Selling Stockholder on the date hereof providing for the
payment of any consideration to, or the conferring of

<PAGE>36

any benefit on, such Selling Stockholder in connection with the Merger or any
matter related thereto, other than as set forth in this Agreement and the
other agreements referred to herein, provided that F4L or its subsidiaries may
offer the opportunity to Selling Stockholders to participate in the Financing.

Ralphs Supermarkets and the Selling Stockholders

Records. (a) After the date hereof, Ralphs Supermarkets shall afford to F4L
and its representatives reasonable access to the Company's offices, plants,
properties, books and records, in each case during normal business hours, in
order that F4L may have full opportunity to make such investigations as it
desires of the records and documents relating to the affairs and assets of the
Company; provided, however, that such investigation shall not unreasonably
disrupt the personnel and operations of the Company; and provided, further,
that Ralphs Supermarkets shall not be required to provide such access to the
extent that it has been advised by outside counsel that the provision of such
access could violate the Antitrust Laws including, without limitation, any
information concerning prices charged by the Company, how such prices are
determined, or otherwise to communicate with F4L concerning price or
price-related issues, or to supply any other market-related data. All
requests by F4L or any of its representatives for access to the Company's
offices, plants, properties, books and records shall be made to such
representatives of Ralphs Supermarkets as Ralphs Supermarkets shall designate
in writing, who shall be responsible for coordinating all such requests and
all access permitted hereunder.

(b) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, F4L shall make
such inspection of the Properties as it shall deem appropriate (and which may
consist, in part, of a review by its consultants of existing Company
information and reports) in order to determine the presence of hazardous,
toxic or other substances (including asbestos) or to determine compliance with
Environmental Laws. Ralphs Supermarkets shall cooperate with F4L in effecting
such inspection, provided that such inspection shall be performed at F4L's
sole cost, and by an individual or firm reasonably acceptable to Ralphs
Supermarkets. Any invasive testing or sampling, including, without
limitation, testing of soil, ground or surface water, at any of the Properties
shall be conducted by F4L only with the prior consent of Ralphs Supermarkets
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and without any
unreasonable interference of the Company Business. The inspector, after
conducting its inspection, shall first inform F4L and Ralphs Supermarkets of
its findings orally. Any written report shall be marked "Draft" and shall be

withheld. Ralphs Supermarkets shall cooperate reasonably with F4L in
connection with the filing of permits and licenses necessary for the conduct
of the Company Business following the Closing Date. F4L and its subsidiaries,
Ralphs Supermarkets and its subsidiaries, and EJDC shall use all reasonable

with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

or permitting any of its agents or Affiliates to issue, any other press
releases or otherwise making or permitting any of its agents or Affiliates to
make, any public statements with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.7 Notice of Developments. Each party shall promptly
notify the other party in writing of any events, facts and occurrences arising
or discovered subsequent to the date hereof which become known to the officers
of such party and which would result in any breach of representation or
warranty made by such party or breach of covenant applicable to such party
contained in this Agreement in any material respect.

Section 6.8 No Mergers, Consolidations, Sale of Stock, etc.
Neither EJDC nor the Company will, directly or indirectly, through officers,
employees, representatives or agents, solicit any inquiries or proposals or
enter into or continue any discussions, negotiations or agreements relating to

combination of Ralphs Supermarkets or Ralphs Grocery with, or the disposition
of a significant amount of Ralphs Supermarkets' or Ralphs Grocery's assets or
business to, any person other than F4L or its Affiliates. Neither EJDC nor
Ralphs Supermarkets will provide any information to any other party in
connection with any such possible transaction, and each will promptly

in respect of any such transaction.

<PAGE>40

Section 6.9 Delivery of Financial Statements. Ralphs Supermarkets
shall cause Ralphs Grocery to deliver to F4L, to the extent such reports are
regularly prepared by Ralphs Grocery, promptly on a monthly and year to date
basis, unaudited balance sheets and statements of earnings for Ralphs Grocery.
In addition, subject to compliance with the Antitrust Laws, Ralphs
Supermarkets shall cause the Company to deliver to F4L, on a weekly and
monthly basis such internal sales reports on a store by store basis promptly
as they are prepared by the Company for each such week or month.

Section 6.10 Registration of Debentures. F4L Holdings shall (i)
cause to be filed with the SEC as soon as practicable after the date hereof a
registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (the
"Shelf Registration Statement") (which Shelf Registration Statement shall
include the Indenture ) and (ii) use its best efforts to cause such Shelf
Registration Statement to become effective and for such Indenture to be
qualified under the TIA, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
the Closing Date, all as more fully provided in the Registration Rights
Agreement. F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets shall use their best
efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective,
supplemented and amended as required by the Registration Rights Agreement to
ensure that it is available for resales of all Debentures and to ensure that
it conforms with the requirements of this Agreement, the Registration Rights
Agreement, the Securities Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the
SEC as announced from time to time, during the time periods specified in, and
subject to the terms of, the Registration Rights Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Shelf Registration Statement shall not be available for,
and each Selling Stockholder agrees that it will not make, public resales of
the Debentures for a period of 90 days following the Closing Date, or
otherwise conduct marketing activities with respect to the Debentures during
such 90-day period which would impair or interfere with F4L's marketing
activities with respect to debt securities comprising any portion of the
Financing. F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets jointly and severally agree to
pay the liquidated damages provided in the Registration Rights Agreement under
the circumstances set forth therein. In addition, and notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that (i) F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets determine
that it is advisable to complete the Financing and the Public Debt Refinancing
in transactions which would be exempt from the registration requirements under
the Securities Act (a "Private Financing") and so advise the Selling
Stockholders in writing and (ii) EJDC, after reviewing the proposed terms and
schedule for such Financing and Public Debt Refinancing (as supplied by F4L)
and, after consulting with F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets, and with
its and their respective counsel and such other persons (including the SEC) as
they may collectively deem appropriate, reasonably determines that (a) the
filing of the Shelf Registration Statement would adversely affect the ability
of F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets to consummate the Private Financing and
(b) the failure to pursue the Private Financing would substantially delay the
Closing Date, then, EJDC, acting on behalf of (and without obligation to
provide prior notice to or obtain approval from) all Selling Stockholders, may
agree, in its sole and absolute discretion (but shall be under no obligation)
to extend the date by which the Shelf Registration Statement is required to be
filed to a date that is no later than 30 days after the Closing Date and to
extend the date by which the Shelf Registration Statement is required to be
declared effective to a date which is no later than 90 days after the Closing
Date. In the event that EJDC agrees to any such extension of the filing date
or effective date, EJDC may also agree with F4L, in its sole and absolute
discretion (but shall be under no obligation), on behalf of (and without
obligation to provide prior notice to or obtain approval from) all Selling
Stockholders, to make such modifications to the form of Registration Rights
Agreement attached hereto as they may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate
to reflect such extension(s) and to provide for such additional liquidated
damages or other rights or remedies (pro rata to all Selling Stockholders) as
EJDC and F4L mutually deem appropriate in the event that the Shelf
Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the
90th day following the Closing Date. EJDC will provide prompt notice to the
other Selling Stockholders of any agreement concerning such extension of the
filing date or effective date or of any such modifications to the Registration
Rights Agreement. EJDC agrees that,

<PAGE>41

so long as it directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures, it will
not vote pursuant to Section 9.2 of the Indenture in favor of any amendment to
the Indenture or the Debentures unless at least one other holder of Debentures
(excluding any Affiliate of EJDC) shall also vote in favor of such amendment;
provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall restrict the ability of
any bona fide pledgee to vote or cause EJDC or such Affiliate to vote in favor
of any such amendment.

Section 6.11 Maintenance of Insurance and Indemnification
Provisions. F4L shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for a
period of at least six years following the Closing Date indemnification
provisions in its charter documents no less favorable to its directors and
officers (except to the extent required otherwise by the GCL) than the
indemnification provisions in the charter documents of Ralphs Supermarkets as
in effect on the date hereof, and F4L shall maintain or cause the Surviving
Corporation or another Affiliate to maintain, for a period of at least three
years following the Closing Date, directors and officers liability insurance
governing all persons who were officers or directors of Ralphs Supermarkets or
Ralphs Grocery, and all occurrences, at any time since February 3, 1992, the
material terms of which insurance shall be no less favorable to such officers
and directors than that in effect on the date hereof, except that the amount
of coverage may be less than, but not less than one-half of, the amount of
coverage in effect on the date hereof.

Section 6.12 Definitive Financing Agreements. F4L and its
subsidiaries shall use their best efforts to negotiate, prepare and enter into
definitive financing agreements (the "Definitive Financing Agreements") with
the Financing Sources to provide the Financing on the terms set forth in the
Commitment Letters. F4L and its subsidiaries shall use their best efforts to,
and the Company shall use its best efforts to cooperate with F4L in order to,
satisfy on or before the Closing Date all requirements of the Definitive
Financing Agreements which are conditions to closing the transactions
constituting the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall
cause its auditors to deliver to such Financing Sources, if requested,
customary comfort letters and certificates, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to F4L, which may be required in connection with the Financing.
F4L shall promptly notify Ralphs Supermarkets and EJDC of any material change
to, or revocation of, any Commitment Letter.

Section 6.13 Continuation of Certain Agreements. Each of EJDC,
Camdev Properties Inc. and Federated Department Stores, Inc. agrees that, from
and after the Effective Date, Ralphs Supermarkets and Ralphs Grocery will
continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and be bound by their obligations
under, the agreements described in Schedule 8.7, and that, upon consummation
of the Merger, the rights of Ralphs Supermarkets thereunder will inure to the
benefit of the Surviving Corporation, provided that the obligations of Ralphs
Supermarkets thereunder will thereafter bind the Surviving Corporation, until
such agreements are amended to provide otherwise or terminated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, EJDC agrees that from and after the Closing
Date, neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
obligation under Sections 3 or 5 of that certain Reimbursement Agreement dated
as of January 31, 1992 between Ralphs Grocery and EJDC. Effective upon
Closing, Ralphs Supermarkets agrees, on behalf of itself and Ralphs Grocery,
that notwithstanding Section 5.3 of the Indemnification Agreement referred to
in Item 2 of Schedule 8.7, all payments by Ralphs Supermarkets or Ralphs
Grocery under such Indemnification Agreement shall be made in cash.

Section 6.14 Workers' Compensation. F4L agrees for the benefit of
EJDC that F4L shall maintain or cause the Surviving Corporation or another
Affiliate to maintain, for a period of not less than five years following the
Closing Date, (i) one or more bank letters of credit in favor of, and
acceptable to, the DIR in a face amount equal to at least 1.1 times the
Projected Losses attributable to all workers' compensation claims, whether or
not such claims are EJDC Guaranteed Claims, provided that if the proceeds of
drawings under such letters of credit are exclusively available to pay the
EJDC

<PAGE>42

Guaranteed Claims, then the face amount of such letters of credit need only be
equal to at least 1.1 times the Projected Losses attributable to the EJDC
Guaranteed Claims or (ii) other security in favor of, and acceptable to, the
DIR and having a value equal to at least 1.1 times the Projected Losses
attributable to all workers' compensation claims, whether or not such claims
are EJDC Guaranteed Claims, provided that if the proceeds of such security are
exclusively available to pay the EJDC Guaranteed Claims, then the value of
such security need only be equal to at least 1.1 times the Projected Losses
attributable to the EJDC Guaranteed Claims or (iii) insurance in favor of the
Surviving Corporation and/or Ralphs Grocery reasonably acceptable to EJDC,
and providing for coverage (net of any deductible amounts) in an amount equal
to at least 1.1 times the Projected Losses attributable to all workers'
compensation claims, whether or not such claims are EJDC Guaranteed Claims,
provided that if the proceeds of such insurance are exclusively available to
pay the EJDC Guaranteed Claims, then the net coverage provided by such
insurance need only be equal to at least 1.1 times the Projected Losses
attributable to the EJDC Guaranteed Claims. F4L agrees to indemnify EJDC
against, and to hold it harmless from, any damage, claim, liability or
expense, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and other
costs, incurred by EJDC at any time from and after the Closing under or in
respect of the EJDC Guarantee. Such indemnification obligation of F4L shall
be governed by the procedures and other terms set forth in Section 10.3. EJDC
agrees that it will, as of the Closing Date, terminate the EJDC Guarantee in
accordance with DIR procedures.

As used in the foregoing paragraph:

"DIR" shall mean the State of California Department of Industrial
Relations.

"Projected Losses" shall mean the projected losses of Ralphs
Supermarkets and its subsidiaries with respect to workers' compensation
claims, as such losses are customarily projected for purposes of DIR self-

Closing Date F4L Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its
subsidiaries or The Yucaipa Companies or any of its Affiliates to, directly or
indirectly acquire any Debenture, by purchase or otherwise (except as required
under the Indenture) from any Selling Stockholder except pursuant to an offer
to purchase made by F4L Holdings or such other person to purchase Debentures
on the same terms and conditions, pro rata among all Debentures tendered, and

ARTICLE VII
Certain Tax Matters

Section 7.1 Taxes and Tax Returns. Ralphs Supermarkets hereby
represents, warrants, covenants, agrees and promises as follows:

(a) Filing of Tax Returns. To the best knowledge of Ralphs
Supermarkets, each of Ralphs Supermarkets, its subsidiaries and all members
for income Tax purposes of any affiliated or combined group of corporations
(as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code or any analogous state, local or
foreign provision) (an "Affiliated Group") of which Ralphs Supermarkets is the
common

<PAGE>43

parent (collectively, the "Taxpayers") have filed with the appropriate taxing
or other governmental authorities all returns, reports, estimates, information
returns and statements (collectively, "Tax Returns") required to be filed on
or prior to the Closing Date. The Tax Returns filed are complete, correct and
accurate in all material respects. Except as set forth in Schedule 7.1(a),
none of the Taxpayers has requested any extension of time within which to file
such Tax Returns.

(b) Payment of Taxes. All Taxes for which any of the Taxpayers are
or may be liable or that are or may become due or payable with respect to all
taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, have
been timely paid, to the extent payable before the Closing Date, or will be
timely paid, or an adequate reserve has been or will be established therefor.
The Taxpayers have made adequate provision, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 for the payment of all
Taxes which may subsequently become due. All Taxes which any Taxpayer has
been required to collect or withhold have been duly collected or withheld and,
to the extent required when due, have been or will be duly paid to the proper
taxing or other governmental authorities. True and correct copies of all Tax
Returns for all open taxable years have been provided to F4L prior to the date
hereof.

(c) Audit History. Except as set forth in Schedule 7.1(c), no
material deficiencies for Taxes of any of the Taxpayers have been claimed,
proposed or assessed by any taxing or other governmental authority. Except as
set forth in Schedule 7.1(c), there are no pending or, to the best of Ralphs
Supermarkets' knowledge, threatened audits, investigations, claims or
assessments for or relating to any material liability in respect of Taxes, and
there are no matters under discussion with any taxing or other governmental
authorities with respect to Taxes that in the reasonable judgment of Ralphs
Supermarkets or any of the Taxpayers are likely to result in an additional
amount of Taxes. Audits of federal, state and local income Tax Returns by the
relevant taxing or other governmental authorities have been completed or the
statute of limitations has expired or such income Tax Returns have been
accepted as filed, except for income Tax Returns described in Schedule 7.1(c),
and, except as set forth in Schedule 7.1(c), none of the Taxpayers has been
notified that any taxing or other governmental authority intends to audit a
Tax Return for any other period. Except as set forth in Schedule 7.1(c), no
extension of a statute of limitations relating to Taxes is in effect with
respect to any of the Taxpayers.

(d) Tax Elections. All elections with respect to Taxes affecting
any of the Taxpayers as of the date hereof are set forth in Schedule 7.1(d).
No new elections with respect to Taxes, or any changes in current elections
with respect to Taxes, affecting any of the Taxpayers shall be made after the
date of this Agreement without F4L's prior written consent. None of the
Taxpayers (i) has made or will make a deemed dividend election under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-32(f)(2) or a consent dividend election under
Section 565 of the Code; (ii) has consented at any time under Section
341(f)(1) of the Code to have the provisions of Section 341(f)(2) of the Code
apply to any disposition of any of the Taxpayer's assets; (iii) has agreed, or
is required, to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason
of a change in accounting method or otherwise; (iv) has made an election, or
is required, to treat any asset of any Taxpayer as owned by another person
pursuant to the provisions of Section 168(f) of the Code or as tax-exempt bond
financed property or tax-exempt use property within the meaning of Section 168
of the Code; or (v) has made any of the foregoing elections or is required to
apply any of the foregoing rules under any comparable state or local Tax
provision.

(e) Affiliated Groups. Except as set forth in Schedule 7.1(e),
none of the Taxpayers has ever been a member of an Affiliated Group.

<PAGE>44

(f) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax-sharing agreements or similar
arrangements with respect to or involving the Taxpayers are set forth in
Schedule 7.1(f). Except as set forth in Schedule 8.7, all Tax-sharing
agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or involving any of the
Taxpayers shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date, and, after the
Closing Date, none of the Taxpayers shall be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the
Closing Date.

(g) Partnerships. Except as set forth in Schedule 7.1(g), none of
the Taxpayers is subject to any joint venture, partnership, or other
arrangement or contract which is treated by the Taxpayers as a partnership for
federal income Tax purposes.

(h) FIRPTA Withholding. Ralphs Supermarkets is not, and was not at
any time during the five-year period ending on the date hereof, a "United
States real property holding corporation" as such term is defined by Section
897(b)(2) of the Code. As a result, the Shares do not constitute a "United
States real property interest" as such term is defined by Section 897(c)(1) of
the Code, and F4L will not be required to withhold any portion of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code. Ralphs Supermarkets
agrees to provide F4L prior to the Closing any certificate necessary to
substantiate exemption from such withholding.

Section 7.2 Books and Records. As soon as practicable after a
request by F4L, F4L Holdings, F4L Supermarkets, Ralphs Supermarkets, the
Surviving Corporation or the Selling Stockholders (the "Requesting Party"),
for a period of seven years from and after the Closing Date, the party of whom
such request is made (the "Delivering Party") shall deliver to the Requesting
Party such information and data in its possession concerning the business,
activities and assets of Ralphs Supermarkets and its subsidiaries and make
available such knowledgeable employees of the Delivering Party, or any
affiliate thereof, or any predecessor or successor of the foregoing, as the
Requesting Party may reasonably request, including providing the information
and data required by the Requesting Party's customary Tax and accounting
questionnaires, in order to enable the Requesting Party to complete and file
all Tax Returns and all other federal, state or foreign forms and reports that
it may be required to file with respect to the business, activities or assets
of any of the Taxpayers or to respond to audits by any taxing or other
governmental authorities with respect to such business, activities or assets.
The obligations of any Delivering Party under this Section 7.2 to permit
access to and review of the foregoing materials are conditioned upon the
execution by the Requesting Party of a confidentiality agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Delivering Party.

be true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as
though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of such
date, except for representations and warranties that speak as of a specific
date or time other than the Closing Date (which need only be true and correct
as of such date or time). The representations and warranties of Ralphs
Supermarkets and the Selling Stockholders contained in this Agreement which by
their terms do not require an event or condition having a Material Adverse
Effect in order to be inaccurate shall

<PAGE>45

be true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as

Adverse Effect. The covenants and agreements of Ralphs Supermarkets and the
Selling Stockholders to be performed on or before the Closing Date in
accordance with this Agreement shall have been duly performed except for such

ARTICLE X
Survival; Indemnification

Section 10.1 Survival of Representations, Etc. All representations
and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement or in any Schedule
hereto, or in any certificate, document or other instrument delivered in
connection herewith, shall be deemed to be representations and warranties by
the parties hereunder. The representations, warranties and covenants of the
Selling Stockholders, F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets hereunder shall
survive the Closing Date, without regard to any investigation made by any of
the parties hereto, provided, however, that no representation or warranty in
this Agreement (other than those of the Selling Stockholders set forth in
Sections 3.2 and 3.5) shall survive beyond the second anniversary of the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and
warranties of Ralphs Supermarkets set forth in Article IV, and the
representations and warranties of F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L Supermarkets set
forth in Sections 5.7 through 5.13, inclusive, shall not survive the Closing
Date. Each party hereto agrees that, to the extent any Shares are transferred
hereby, such transfer is made by the Selling Stockholder without recourse or
warranty of any kind, except as expressly set forth in Article III. F4L, F4L
Holdings and F4L Supermarkets each acknowledges that it has conducted its own
investigation into the business, prospects and condition (financial and other)
of the Company and that neither any Selling Stockholder nor any of its agents
or representatives has, directly or indirectly, made or shall be deemed to
have made any representation or warranty to F4L in respect thereto. No party
hereto has relied on any representations or warranty of any Selling
Stockholder other than those expressly stated herein. F4L, F4L Holdings and
F4L Supermarkets acknowledge that, except for those express obligations
undertaken in this Agreement, the Selling Stockholders have no legal
obligations whatsoever to F4L, F4L Holdings or F4L Supermarkets. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, each party hereto waives any claims, whether
known or unknown, that it may have against any Selling Stockholder in respect
of this Agreement except for the representations and warranties expressly set
forth in Article III.

<PAGE>49

Section 10.2 Indemnification. Each Selling Stockholder shall
indemnify F4L, F4L Holdings and (from and after the Effective Date) the
Surviving Corporation, and their respective employees, agents, representatives
and Affiliates, against, and hold each of them harmless from, any damage,
claim, liability or expense, including without limitation, interest, penalties
and reasonable attorneys' fees (collectively "Damages"), arising out of the
breach of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement of such Selling
Stockholder contained in this Agreement. F4L, F4L Holdings and F4L
Supermarkets shall indemnify each Selling Stockholder and (prior to the
Effective Date) Ralphs Supermarkets, and their respective employees, agents,
representatives and Affiliates, against, and hold each of them harmless from,
any Damages arising out of the breach of any warranty, representation,
covenant or agreement of either of them contained in this Agreement. The term
"Damages" as used in this Section 10.2 is not limited to matters asserted by
third parties against F4L, F4L Holdings, F4L Supermarkets, the Surviving
Corporation, Ralphs Supermarkets or the Selling Stockholders, but includes
Damages incurred or sustained by any of them in the absence of third party
claims. The indemnification obligations of each Selling Stockholder under
this Section 10.2 shall be several, and not joint, and no Selling Stockholder
shall have any liability hereunder with respect to the warranties,
representations, covenants or agreements of any other party contained herein.

Section 10.3 Procedures for Indemnification. (a) If a claim by a
third party is made against a person or party entitled to indemnification
hereunder (an "Indemnified Party"), and if such Indemnified Party intends to
seek indemnity with respect thereto under Section 10.2, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party") of
such claims. As part of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the
Indemnifying Party with copies of any pleadings or correspondence relating
thereto that are in the Indemnified Party's possession. The Indemnified
Party's failure to promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of any such matter
shall not release the Indemnifying Party, in whole or in part, from its
obligations to indemnify under this Article X except to the extent the
Indemnified Party's failure to so notify prejudices the Indemnifying Party's
ability to defend against such claim. At such time as the Indemnifying Party
acknowledges in writing its liability under this Article X with respect to
such claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the sole and exclusive
right to defend against, settle or compromise such claim; provided, that the
Indemnifying Party shall proceed in good faith with respect thereto; and
provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle such claim for
other than monetary consideration (unless the terms of any such settlement do
not in any way constrain or otherwise affect the Indemnified Party) without
the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld; and provided, further, that the Indemnified Party may participate in
the defense of such claim at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does
not acknowledge to the Indemnified Party its liability hereunder prior to the
earlier of (i) 15 business days after the receipt of such Indemnified Party's
notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder and (ii) five business days prior to
the deadline for filing any pleading in connection therewith, such Indemnified
Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the claim, but
shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this
Agreement and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified
Party in connection with defending against such claim; provided, that the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, in
such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the consent of
such Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the person or persons asserting such
claim to the Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all
liability with respect to such claim or consent to entry of any judgment.

(b) If any party becomes obligated to indemnify another party with
respect to any claim pursuant to this Article X, and the amount of liability
with respect thereto shall have been finally determined, the Indemnifying
Party shall pay such amount to the Indemnified Party in immediately available
funds within fifteen days following written demand by the Indemnified Party.

<PAGE>50

Section 10.4 No Reliance by Selling Stockholders. Each Selling
Stockholder acknowledges that it has conducted its own investigation into the
business, prospects and condition (financial and other) of the Subject
Companies and that no Selling Stockholder nor any of its agents or
representatives has, directly or indirectly, made or shall be deemed to have
made any representation or warranty to any other Selling Stockholder in
respect thereto. No Selling Stockholder has relied on any representations or
warranties of any other Selling Stockholder under this Agreement or otherwise.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Selling Stockholder waives any
claims, whether known or unknown, that it may have against any other Selling
Stockholder in respect of this Agreement, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in Article III and under the Ralphs
Registration Rights Agreement. As used herein, the term "Subject Companies"
shall mean, individually and collectively, F4L, F4L Holdings, F4L
Supermarkets, Ralphs Supermarkets, Ralphs Grocery and the Surviving
Corporation.

ARTICLE XI
Termination

Section 11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing by:

(a) The mutual consent of EJDC, Ralphs Supermarkets and F4L, set
forth in a written instrument executed by all such parties; or

(b) Any of Ralphs Supermarkets, EJDC or F4L, if the Closing shall
not have occurred by the close of business on January 16, 1995, or by any
Selling Stockholder if the Closing shall not have occurred by the close
of business on March 31, 1995, and, in each case, if the failure to
consummate the Merger on or before such date did not result from the
failure by the party seeking termination of this Agreement to fulfill any
covenant provided for herein that is required to be fulfilled by it prior
to Closing; or

(c) Any of Ralphs Supermarkets, EJDC or F4L in the event that a
condition to the terminating party's obligations to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall become incapable of
satisfaction; provided that no party shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (c) if the failure of such condition to
be satisfied is attributable to such party's breach of this Agreement; or

(d) Ralphs Supermarkets or EJDC if (i) any Financing Source which
is party to a Commitment Letter providing for equity or bank debt
Financing shall exercise its right under such Commitment Letter to
withdraw its commitment (or shall have materially adversely modified such
commitment) as a result of any due diligence review which, according to
the terms of the original Commitment Letter, was to be completed within
30 calendar days after the date hereof or (ii) within 31 calendar days
after the date hereof (or if such date is not a business day, on the next
business day), F4L has failed to deliver to Ralphs Supermarkets and EJDC
written confirmation that neither of such Financing Sources has exercised
its right under such Commitment Letter to withdraw its commitment (or has
materially adversely modified such commitment) as a result of such due
diligence review; or

(e) F4L, if F4L has not been notified on or before the expiration

specified on Schedule 3.3 hereof, have been obtained.

the terminating party to all other parties hereto, and this Agreement shall
thereupon terminate and become void and have no effect, the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without further action by the parties
hereto, and the parties hereto waive and release any claim or Action with
respect hereto, except that the provisions of Sections 12.4 and 12.10 and the
last sentence of Section 12.13 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement; provided, however, that such termination shall not relieve any
party hereto of any liability for fraud or any willful, material breach of
Sections 6.2 or 6.8 of this Agreement, which breach is not cured within
fifteen calendar days following written notice from the other party specifying
the nature of such breach in reasonable detail. If this Agreement is
terminated as provided herein, all filings, applications and other submissions
made pursuant to the terms hereof shall, to the extent practicable, be
withdrawn from the agency or other persons to which they were made.

ARTICLE XII

EJDC, on behalf of Ralphs Supermarkets or the Selling Stockholders, or the

of such notice with the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA");
provided, however, that in no event shall such notice be given if institution
of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claim, dispute or other matter
in question would be barred by any applicable statute of limitations or by
this Agreement. Arbitration shall be held in New York City under the auspices
of the AAA pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, and shall
be by three arbitrators independent of the parties to this Agreement selected
from a list provided by the AAA. One of the arbitrators shall be appointed by
EJDC, on behalf of Ralphs Supermarkets and the Selling Stockholders, as
applicable. One of the arbitrators shall be appointed by F4L. The third
arbitrator is to be selected by these two arbitrators before the beginning of
the arbitration. If, however, any party fails to select an arbitrator within
15 days after receiving notice under this Agreement of an initial selection
of an arbitrator by the other party, the party appointing the first arbitrator
may also appoint the second arbitrator on behalf of the party who has failed
to make the appointment. Should the two arbitrators appointed by the parties
fail to agree upon the choice of a third arbitrator within 15 days after the
appointment of the second arbitrator, the appointment shall be made by the
AAA. Each party to the arbitration shall submit its case in writing to the
arbitrators within one month of the constitution of the arbitration tribunal.
The arbitrators are empowered to determine questions both of fact and of law,
but shall to the maximum extent possible construe this Agreement strictly in
accordance with its terms and conditions and the purposes and intents evinced
thereby. Discovery shall be permitted under the same standards as set forth
in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Whether a hearing shall be held or
additional evidence accepted, and the rules governing any such hearing, shall
be in the sole discretion of the arbitrators, subject to the AAA rules as they
construe them. All decisions of the arbitrators shall be by majority vote.
The arbitrators shall make their decision in writing at the earliest
convenient date. The costs of arbitration, including the fees of the
arbitrators, shall be in the discretion of the arbitrators, who may direct to
and by whom and in what manner these costs or any part thereof shall be paid.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the decision of the
arbitration tribunal shall be final and binding on the parties to this
Agreement and not be subject to appeal. If a party against whom the
arbitration tribunal renders an award fails to abide by such award, the other
parties may bring an action to enforce the same in a court of competent
jurisdiction.

Section 12.12 Convenience of Forum; Consent to Jurisdiction. The
parties to this Agreement, acting for themselves and for their respective
successors and assigns, without regard to domicile, citizenship or residence,
hereby expressly and irrevocably elect as the sole judicial forum for the
adjudication of any matters arising under or in connection with this
Agreement, and consent and subject themselves to the jurisdiction of, the
courts of the State of New York located in New York City, and/or the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in respect of any
matter arising under this Agreement. Service of process, notices and demands
of such courts may be made upon any party to this Agreement by personal
service at any place where it may be found or giving notice to such party as
provided in Section 12.5.

Section 12.13 Termination of Registration Rights and Corporate
Governance Agreement.

<PAGE>55

Effective at the time of Closing, each of the Selling Stockholders, Ralphs
Supermarkets and Ralphs Grocery hereby waives the provisions of the
Registration Rights and Corporate Governance Agreement, dated as of February
3, 1992 (the "Ralphs Registration Rights Agreement"), among the Selling
Stockholders, Ralphs Supermarkets, Ralphs Grocery and Allied Stores
Corporation (now known as Federated Department Stores, Inc.) to the extent
inconsistent with this Agreement and further agrees that the Ralphs
Registration Rights Agreement shall terminate without any further action or

date hereof and whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated, Section 20(e) of the Ralphs Registration Rights Agreement is
amended by deleting the word "and" at the end of clause (v) of the second
sentence thereof and by adding at the end of such sentence the following
clause: "and (vii) on one occasion Camdev shall have the right to assign 100%
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to no more than four
purchasers."

Section 12.14 Waiver by Selling Stockholders. Each Selling
Stockholder by executing this Agreement waives the notice of the meeting and
the meeting referred to in Section 251(c) of the GCL and consents to the
Merger and the execution of this Agreement pursuant to Section 228 of the GCL.

with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Certain provisions of the Indenture will be added or modified prior to
execution in accordance with the general principles set forth below (defined
terms used below have the meanings set forth in the attached Indenture):

1. References to specific dates (i.e., 2006) assume an Issue Date
in 1994. In the event that the Issue Date occurs in 1995,
appropriate conforming changes will be made. Interest payment
dates will be semi-annual on the 1st, 15th or 30th of the
appropriate month.

2. Bracketed provisions with respect to FFL will be omitted if FFL
and Holdings are merged prior to the merger of the Company and
Ralphs Supermarkets.

3. The Indenture has not been reviewed by the Trustee or its
counsel and is subject to appropriate modification to reflect
the reasonable and customary comments of such persons.

4. The definitions of Credit Agent and Credit Agreement shall be
amended at closing, as appropriate.

5. The following numbered paragraphs correspond to marked sections
in the Indenture:

A. The definition of "Adjusted Fixed Charges" will conform to
the definition of "Fixed Charges" in the new senior
subordinated securities to be issued by the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (the "New Public Securities"); provided,
however, that for purposes of this Indenture, such
definition of Fixed Charges will exclude charges
attributable to the Securities, the Senior Discount Notes
and $25 million of other indebtedness.

B. An appropriate definition will be added to conform to the
corresponding definition contained in the New Public
Securities.

C. A new Section 4.12 will be added to conform to the
covenant in the New Public Securities, as appropriately
modified to be applicable to Holdings and its
subsidiaries. In addition, the covenant in this Indenture
will contain permitted exceptions to the limitation on
debt incurrence for (i) the Securities (including the
issuance of any Secondary Securities) and the Senior
Discount Notes and the accretion of original issue
discount related thereto, and (ii) an additional basket of
$25 million. All references to Section 4.12(b) contained
in the Indenture assume that such paragraph will contain
an Operating Coverage Ratio test for additional debt
incurrence.

debt incurrence covenant in the New Public Securities.

ARTICLE II

THE SECURITIES

Section 2.1. Form and Dating.

The Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall
be substantially in the form of Exhibit A. The Securities may have notations,
legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage or as
required by the Registration Rights Agreement. Holdings and the Trustee shall
approve the form of the Securities and any notation, legend or endorsement on
them. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

The terms and provisions contained in the Securities shall
constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture and, to
the extent applicable, Holdings and the Trustee, by their execution and
delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and provisions and
to be bound thereby.

Section 2.2. Execution and Authentication.

<PAGE>80
An Officer or an Assistant Secretary, shall sign (either of whom
shall, in each case, have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
actions) the Securities for Holdings by manual or facsimile signature.

If an Officer whose signature is on a Security was an Officer at the
time of such execution but no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee
authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.

A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the
Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security. The
signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been
authenticated under this Indenture.

The Trustee shall authenticate Securities, excluding Secondary
Securities, for original issue in the aggregate principal amount of up to
$100,000,000 upon a written order of Holdings in the form of an Officers'
Certificate. The Officers' Certificate shall specify the amount of Securities
to be authenticated and the date on which the Securities are to be
authenticated. The aggregate principal amount of Securities outstanding at
any time may not exceed $100,000,000, except for any Securities that may be
issued pursuant to the immediately following paragraph and except as provided
in Section 2.7 and 2.8. Upon the written order of Holdings in the form of an
Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall authenticate Securities in
substitution of Securities originally issued to reflect any name change of
Holdings.

Holdings may, on each Interest Payment Date prior to (and including)
[the Interest Payment Date five years after the Issue Date], at its option and
in its sole discretion, pay interest in additional Securities ("Secondary
Securities") in lieu of the payment in whole or in part of interest in cash on
the Securities as provided in paragraph 1 of the Securities. Holdings shall
give written notice to the Trustee of the amount of interest to be paid in
Secondary Securities not less than five Business Days prior to the relevant
Interest Payment Date, and the Trustee or an authenticating agent (upon
written order of Holdings signed by an Officer of Holdings given not less than
five nor more than 45 days prior to such Interest Payment Date) shall
authenticate for original issue (pro rata to each Holder of any Securities of
such record date) Secondary Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal
to the amount of cash interest not paid on such Interest Payment Date. Except
as set forth in the following paragraph each issuance of Secondary Securities
in lieu of the payment of interest in cash on the Securities shall be made pro
rata with respect to the outstanding Securities, and Holdings shall have the
right to aggregate amounts of interest payable in the form of Secondary
Securities to a Holder of outstanding Securities and issue to such Holder a
single Secondary Security in payment thereof. Any Secondary Securities may be
denominated a separate series if Holdings deems it necessary to do so in order
to comply with any law or other applicable regulation or requirement, with
appropriate distinguishing designations.

The Securities shall be issuable only in registered form without
coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof except
that Secondary Securities or Securities issued upon registration of transfer
of such Secondary Securities may be in denominations of other than $1,000;
provided that Holdings may at its option pay cash in lieu of issuing Secondary
Securities in any denominations of less than $1,000.

<PAGE>81

The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably
acceptable to Holdings to authenticate Securities. Unless otherwise provided
in the appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities
whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to
authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An
authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with Holdings and
Affiliates of Holdings.

Section 2.3. Registrar and Paying Agent.

Holdings shall maintain an office or agency in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, where (a) Securities may be presented or
surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange ("Registrar"), (b)
Securities may be presented or surrendered for payment ("Paying Agent") and
(c) notices and demands to or upon Holdings in respect of the Securities and
this Indenture may be served. Holdings may also from time to time designate
one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind
such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission
shall in any manner relieve Holdings of its obligation to maintain an office
or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, for such
purposes. Holdings may act as its own Registrar or Paying Agent except that
for the purposes of Articles Three and Eight and Sections 4.4 and 4.14,
neither Holdings nor any Subsidiary shall act as Paying Agent. The Registrar
shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange.
Holdings, upon notice to the Trustee, may have one or more co-Registrars and
one or more additional paying agents reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. Holdings
initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent until such time
as the Trustee has resigned or a successor has been appointed.

Holdings shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any
Agent not a party to this Indenture, which agreement shall implement the
provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent. Holdings shall notify
the Trustee, in advance, of the name and address of any such Agent. If Hold-
ings fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as
such.

Section 2.4. Paying Agent To Hold Assets in Trust.

Holdings shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to
agree in writing that each Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of
Holders or the Trustee all assets and/or Secondary Securities held by the
Paying Agent for the payment of principal of, or interest on, the Securities
(whether such assets have been distributed to it by Holdings or any other
obligor on the Securities), and shall notify the Trustee of any Default by
Holdings (or any other obligor on the Securities) in making any such payment.
If Holdings or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate such
assets and/or Secondary Securities and hold them as a separate trust fund.
Holdings at any time may require a Paying Agent to distribute all assets
and/or Secondary Securities held by it to the Trustee and account for any
assets disbursed and the Trustee may at any time during the continuance of any
payment Default, upon written request to a Paying Agent, require such Paying
Agent to distribute all assets and/or Secondary Securities held by it to the
Trustee and to account for any assets so distributed. Upon distribution to
the Trustee of all assets that shall have been delivered by Holdings to the
Paying

<PAGE>82

Agent, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for such assets and/or
Secondary Securities.

Section 2.5. Securityholder Lists.

The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably
practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of
Holders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, Holdings shall furnish to the
Trustee on or before each Interest Payment Date and at such other times as the
Trustee may request in writing a list in such form and as of such date as the
Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders, which
list may be conclusively relied upon by the Trustee.

Section 2.6. Transfer and Exchange.

When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with
a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as
requested if the requirements of the Registrar are met. The Registrar need
not transfer or exchange any Securities selected for redemption. Also, it
need not transfer or exchange any Securities for a period of 30 days before a
selection of Securities to be redeemed. When Securities are presented to the
Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal
principal amount of Securities of other authorized denominations, the
Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the requirements of the
Registrar are met. Holdings shall cooperate with the Registrar in meeting its
requirements. To permit transfers, registration and exchanges, the Trustee
shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. No service charge
shall be made for any transfer, registration or exchange, but the Company may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge payable in connection therewith, but not for any exchange pursuant to
Section 2.10, 3.6 or 9.5.

Section 2.7. Replacement Securities.

If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee or if the
Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or
wrongfully taken, Holdings shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a
replacement Security if the Trustee's requirements are met. If required by
the Trustee or Holdings, such Holder must provide an indemnity bond or other
indemnity, sufficient in the judgment of both Holdings and the Trustee, to
protect Holdings, the Trustee or any Agent from any loss which any of them may
suffer if a Security is replaced. Holdings may charge such Holder for its
reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses in replacing a Security, including rea-
sonable fees and expenses of counsel. Every replacement Security shall
constitute an additional obligation of Holdings.

Section 2.8. Outstanding Securities.

Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities that have
been authenticated by the Trustee, including the Secondary Securities, except
those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those
described in this Section as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be
outstanding because Holdings or any of its Affiliates holds the Security.

<PAGE>83

If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.7 (other than a
mutilated Security surrendered for replacement), it ceases to be outstanding
unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced
Security is held by a bona fide purchaser. A mutilated Security ceases to be
outstanding upon surrender of such Security and replacement thereof pursuant
to Section 2.7.

If on a Redemption Date or the Maturity Date the Paying Agent (other
than Holdings or any Subsidiary) holds U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government
Obligations sufficient to pay all of the principal and interest due on the
Securities payable on that date, then on and after that date such Securities
cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.

Section 2.9. Treasury Securities.

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate
principal amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, waiver or
consent, Securities owned by Holdings or any of its Affiliates shall be
disregarded, except that, for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee
shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only
Securities that the Trustee knows or has reason to know are so owned shall be
disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as otherwise provided
by the TIA, a majority of Securities not owned by Holdings or any of its
Affiliates shall be sufficient to approve any such direction, waiver or
consent.

Section 2.10. Temporary Securities.

Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, Holdings may
prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary
Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may
have variations that Holdings considers appropriate for temporary Securities.
Without unreasonable delay, Holdings shall prepare and the Trustee shall
authenticate definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities.

Section 2.11. Cancellation.

Holdings at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for
cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee
any Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange or payment. The
Trustee, or at the direction of the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent
(other than Holdings or any Subsidiary), and no one else, shall cancel and, at
the written direction of Holdings, shall dispose of all Securities surrendered
for transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation. Subject to Section 2.7,
Holdings may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that it has paid
or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. If Holdings or any Subsidiary
shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a
redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Securities
unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation
pursuant to this Section 2.11.

Section 2.12. Defaulted Interest.

If Holdings defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, it
shall, unless the Trustee fixes another record date pursuant to Section 6.10,
pay the defaulted interest, plus (to the extent lawful) any interest payable
on the defaulted interest, to the persons who are Holders

<PAGE>84

on a subsequent special record date, which date shall be the fifteenth day
next preceding the date fixed by Holdings for the payment of defaulted
interest or the next succeeding Business Day if such date is not a Business
Day. At least 15 days before the subsequent special record date, Holdings
shall mail to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, a notice that states
the subsequent special record date, the payment date and the amount of
defaulted interest, and interest payable on such defaulted interest, if any,
to be paid.

Section 2.13. CUSIP Number.

Holdings in issuing the Securities may use a "CUSIP" number, and if
so, the Trustee shall use the CUSIP number in notices of redemption or
exchange as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state
that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP
number printed in the notice or on the Securities, and that reliance may be
placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities.

ARTICLE III

REDEMPTION

Section 3.1. Notices to Trustee.

If Holdings elects to redeem Securities pursuant to Paragraph 5 of
the Securities it shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Date and
aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and whether it
wants the Trustee to give notice of redemption to the Holders (at Holdings'
expense) at least 30 days (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to
the Trustee) but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date. Any notice
given pursuant to this Section 3.1 may be cancelled at any time prior to
notice of such redemption being mailed to any Holder and shall thereby be void
and of no effect.

Section 3.2. Selection of Securities To Be Redeemed.

If fewer than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee
shall select the Securities to be redeemed pro rata, by lot or by such other
method as the Trustee considers to be fair and appropriate and in such manner
as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any.

Securities in denominations of less than $1,000 shall be redeemed
first. Thereafter the Trustee shall make the selection from the Securities
outstanding and not previously called for redemption and shall promptly notify
Holdings in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case
of any Security selected for partial redemption, the aggregate principal
amount thereof to be redeemed. Securities in denominations of $1,000 or less
may be redeemed only in whole. The Trustee may select for redemption portions
(equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal of
Securities that have denominations larger than $1,000. Provisions of this
Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to
portions of Securities called for redemption.

Section 3.3. Notice of Redemption.

<PAGE>85

At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a Redemption Date,
Holdings shall mail a notice of redemption by first class mail to each Holder
whose Securities are to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address, with
a copy to the Trustee. At Holdings' request, the Trustee shall give the
notice of redemption in Holdings' name and at Holdings' expense. Each notice
for redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date;

(2) the Redemption Price;

(3) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

(4) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to
the Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price;

(5) that, unless Holdings defaults in making the redemption
payment, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on
and after the Redemption Date, and the only remaining right of the
Holders of such Securities is to receive payment of the Redemption Price
upon surrender to the Paying Agent of the Securities redeemed;

(6) if any Security is being redeemed in part, the portion of the
aggregate principal amount of such Security to be redeemed and that,
after the Redemption Date, and upon surrender of such Security, a new
Security or Securities in aggregate principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof will be issued; and

(7) if fewer than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the
identification of the particular Securities (or portion thereof to be
redeemed), as well as the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be
redeemed and the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be
outstanding after such partial redemption.

Section 3.4. Effect of Notice of Redemption.

Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.3,
Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date
and at the Redemption Price. Upon surrender to the Trustee or Paying Agent,
such Securities called for redemption shall be paid at the Redemption Price.

Section 3.5. Deposit of Redemption Price.

On or before the Redemption Date, Holdings shall deposit with the
Paying Agent U.S. Legal Tender sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all
Securities to be redeemed on that date (other than Securities or portions
thereof called for redemption on that date which have been delivered by
Holdings to the Trustee for cancellation). The Paying Agent shall promptly
return to Holdings any U.S. Legal Tender so deposited which is not required
for that purpose upon the written request of Holdings, except with respect to
monies owed as obligations to the Trustee pursuant to Article Seven.

<PAGE>86

If Holdings complies with the preceding paragraph, then, unless
Holdings defaults in the payment of such Redemption Price, interest on the
Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on and after the applicable
Redemption Date, whether or not such Securities are presented for payment.

If a Security is redeemed on or after a Record Date but on or prior
to the related Interest Payment Date, then any accrued and unpaid interest
shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security was registered at the
close of business on such Record Date. If any Security called for redemption
shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption because of the failure of
Holdings to comply with the first paragraph of this Section 3.5, interest
shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption date until such
principal is paid, and, to the extent lawful, on any interest not paid on such
unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Securities and in
Section 4.1 hereof.

Section 3.6. Securities Redeemed in Part.

Upon surrender of a Security that is to be redeemed in part, the
Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder a new Security or Securities equal
in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.

ARTICLE IV

COVENANTS

Section 4.1. Payment of Securities.

Holdings shall pay the principal amount of, premium, if any, and
interest on, as the case may be, the Securities on the dates and in the manner
provided in the Securities. An installment shall be considered paid on the
date it is due if the Trustee or Paying Agent (other than Holdings or a
Subsidiary) holds on that date U.S. Legal Tender and/or, to the extent
permitted by Section 2.2, Secondary Securities designated for and sufficient
to pay the installment.

Holdings shall pay interest on overdue principal (including post-
petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law, to the extent
allowable as a claim in any such proceeding) at the same rate borne by the
Securities and it shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law, to the extent allowable as a claim in any
such proceeding) on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any
applicable grace period) at the same rate borne by the Securities, to the
extent lawful.

Section 4.2. Maintenance of Office or Agency.

Holdings shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York, the office or agency required under Section 2.3. Holdings shall give
prior notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location,
of such office or agency. If at any time Holdings shall fail to maintain any
such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the
address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be
made or served at the address of the Trustee set forth in Section 12.2

<PAGE>87

Section 4.3. Limitation on Restricted Payments.

Holdings shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, make any Restricted Payment if, at the time of such
Restricted Payment, or after giving effect thereto, (a) a Default or an Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or (b) Holdings or such
Subsidiary could not incur at least $1 of Indebtedness under or pursuant to
the test set forth in Section 4.12(b) (assuming a market rate of interest with
respect thereto) calculated on a pro forma basis as if such Restricted Payment
had been made at the beginning of the Pro Forma Period, (provided, however,
that with respect to any Investment in an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
Operating Coverage Ratio referred to in Section 4.12(b) shall never exceed
[See Introductory Note 5.D]) or (c) the aggregate amount expended for all
Restricted Payments, including such Restricted Payment (the amount of any
Restricted Payment, if other than cash, to be the fair market value thereof at
the date of payment, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
Holdings, which determination shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution),
subsequent to the Issue Date, shall exceed the sum of (i) 50% of the aggregate
Consolidated Net Income (or if such Consolidated Net Income is a loss, minus
100% of such loss) of Holdings earned subsequent to the Issue Date and on or
prior to the date the Restricted Payment occurs (the "Reference Date") plus
(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by Holdings from any
person (other than a Subsidiary) from the issuance and sale (including upon
exchange or conversion for other securities of Holdings) subsequent to the
Issue Date and on or prior to the Reference Date of Qualified Capital Stock
(excluding (A) Qualified Capital Stock paid as a dividend on any Capital Stock
or as interest on any Indebtedness and (B) any Net Proceeds from issuances and
sales financed directly or indirectly using funds borrowed from Holdings or
any Subsidiary, until and to the extent such borrowing is repaid) plus (iii)
an amount, to the extent not otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income,
equal to the sum of (A) the net reduction in Investments in Unrestricted
Subsidiaries resulting from payments of cash dividends, repayments of loans or
advances or other transfers of assets to Holdings or any Subsidiary from
Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and (B) the portion (proportionate to Holdings'
equity interest in such Subsidiary) of the fair market value of the net assets
of an Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time such Unrestricted Subsidiary is
designated a Subsidiary; provided, however, that the foregoing sum in this
clause (iii) shall not exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
amount of Investments previously made by the Company or any Unrestricted
Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount was treated as a
Restricted Payment plus (iv) $15 million.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing as a consequence thereof, the provisions
set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph will not prevent (1) the
payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of its declaration if
the dividend would have been permitted on the date of declaration, (2) the
acquisition of any shares of Capital Stock in exchange for or solely out of
the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary)
of shares of Qualified Capital Stock, (3) the payment of dividends by Holdings
or any Subsidiary to holders of Capital Stock of Holdings or any Subsidiary,
as the case may be, following an initial public offering of such Capital
Stock, of up to six percent per annum of the Net Cash Proceeds received in
such public offering, (4) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not
exceeding $10 million subsequent to the Issue Date or (5) Permitted Payments;
provided that (x) the declaration of each dividend paid in accordance with
clause (1) above, each acquisition or repayment made in accordance with, or of
the type set forth in, clause (2) above and each payment described in clause
(ii) of

<PAGE>88

the definition of "Permitted Payments" shall be counted for purposes of com-
puting amounts expended pursuant to subclause (c) in the immediately preceding
paragraph, and (y) no amounts paid pursuant to clauses (3) or (4) above or
clause (i) of the definition of "Permitted Payments" shall be so counted.

Prior to making any Restricted Payment under the first paragraph of
this Section 4.3, Holdings shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate setting forth the computation by which the amount available for

Except as otherwise permitted by Article Five, Holdings shall do or
cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and
effect its corporate existence and the corporate or other existence of each of
its Significant Subsidiaries in accordance with the respective organizational
documents of each such Significant Subsidiary and the rights (charter and
statutory) and franchises of Holdings and each such Significant Subsidiary;
provided, however, that Holdings shall not be required to preserve, with
respect to itself, any right or franchise, and with respect to any of its
Significant Subsidiaries, any such existence, right or franchise, if the Board

shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the
conduct of the business of Holdings or any such Significant Subsidiary.

Section 4.5. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

before the same shall become delinquent, (i) all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges (including withholding taxes and any penalties, interest
and additions to taxes) levied or imposed upon it or any of its Subsidiaries
or properties of it or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) all lawful claims for
labor, materials and supplies that, if unpaid, might by law become a Lien upon
the property of it or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
Holdings shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or
discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim if either (a) the amount,
applicability or validity thereof is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and an adequate reserve has been established therefor
to the extent required by GAAP or (b) the failure to make such payment or
effect such discharge (together with all other such failures) would not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition or results or operations of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 4.6. Maintenance of Properties and Insurance.

(a) Holdings shall cause all properties used or useful to the
conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiaries to be maintained
and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all
necessary equipment and shall cause to be made all necessary repairs,

judgment may be necessary, so that the business carried on in connection
therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times unless the
failure to so maintain such

<PAGE>89

properties (together with all other such failures) would not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Holdings
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 4.6 shall prevent Holdings or any Subsidiary from discontinuing the
operation or maintenance of any of such properties, or disposing of any of
them, if such discontinuance or disposal is either (i) in the ordinary course
of business, (ii) in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of
Holdings or the Subsidiary concerned, or of the senior officers of Holdings or
such Subsidiary, as the case may be, desirable in the conduct of the business
of Holdings or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, or (iii) is otherwise
permitted by this Indenture.

(b) Holdings shall provide or cause to be provided, for itself and
each of its Subsidiaries, insurance (including appropriate self-insurance)
against loss or damage of the kinds that, in the reasonable, good faith
opinion of Holdings, are adequate and appropriate for the conduct of the
business of Holdings and such Subsidiaries in a prudent manner, with reputable
insurers or with the government of the United States of America or an agency
or instrumentality thereof, in such amounts, with such deductibles, and by
such methods as shall be either (i) consistent with past practices of Holdings
or the applicable Subsidiary or (ii) customary, in the reasonable, good faith
opinion of Holdings, for corporations similarly situated in the industry,
unless the failure to provide such insurance (together with all other such
failures) would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition
or results of operations of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 4.7. Compliance Certificate; Notice of Default.

(a) Holdings shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the
end of Holdings' fiscal year an Officers' Certificate stating that a review of
its activities and the activities of its Subsidiaries during the preceding

view to determining whether it has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled its
obligations under this Indenture and further stating, as to each such Officer
signing such certificate, that to the best of his knowledge Holdings during
such preceding fiscal year has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled each
and every such covenant and no Default or Event of Default occurred during
such year or, if such signers do know of such a Default or Event of Default,
the certificate shall describe the Default or Event of Default and its status
with particularity. The Officers' Certificate shall also notify the Trustee
should Holdings elect to change the manner in which it fixes its fiscal year
end.

the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Holdings shall deliver

deliver to the Trustee, within five Business Days after any officer becomes
aware of any Default or Event of Default, an Officer's Certificate specifying
such Default or Event of Default and what action Holdings is taking or
proposes to take with respect thereto.

authority, bureau, agency and instrumentality of the foregoing, in respect of
the conduct of their respective businesses and the ownership of their
respective properties, except such as are being contested in good faith and by

aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results
of operations of Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

all information and financial statements, including any notes thereto and with
respect to annual reports, an auditors' report by an accounting firm of
established national reputation, and a "Management's Discussion and Analysis

the requirements of such Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

regulations to file the aforementioned reports, upon the request of a Holder
of Securities, Holdings will promptly furnish or cause to be furnished such
information as is specified pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act (or any successor provision thereto) to such Holder or to a prospective
purchaser of such Securities designated by such Holder, as the case may be, in
order to permit compliance by such Holder with Rule 144A under the Securities
Act.

Section 4.10. Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws.

Holdings covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that
it will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim
or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury
law or other law that would prohibit or forgive Holdings from paying all or
any portion of the principal of or interest on the Securities as contemplated
herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may
affect the

<PAGE>91

covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) Holdings hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of

Subsidiary, as the case may be, and on terms at least as favorable as might
reasonably have been obtainable at such time from an unaffiliated party and
(B) with respect to any transaction or series of transactions involving
aggregate payments in excess of $1 million and less than $5 million, Holdings
or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers an Officers' Certificate to
the Trustee certifying that such transaction or series of transactions
complies with clause (A) above and (C) with respect to any transaction or
series of transactions involving aggregate payments in excess of $5 million
and less than $15 million, Holdings or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,
delivers an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee certifying that such
transaction or series of transactions complies with clause (A) above and that

majority of the disinterested directors of the Board of Directors of Holdings
or the Subsidiary, as the case may be, or, in the absence of any such approval
by the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Holdings or the
Subsidiary, as the case may be, that an Independent Financial Advisor has
reasonably and in good faith determined that such Affiliate Transaction is
fair to Holdings or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, or is on terms at

the existence of, or the performance by Holdings or any Subsidiary of its
obligations under the terms of, any stockholder agreement (including any
registration rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to which

multiples thereof. Holdings will publicly announce the results of the Change
of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control
Payment Date. For purposes of this Section 4.14, the Trustee shall act as the

market value of all non-cash consideration received by Holdings or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, from any such Asset Sale shall exceed $30

such determination by the Board of Directors of Holdings shall be required if
the fair market value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of does not
exceed $10 million); and (b) the Net Cash Proceeds received by Holdings or
such Subsidiary, as the case may be, from such Asset Sale are applied in

foreclosure by the Lenders under the Loan Documents or their Representative on
collateral securing Indebtedness under the Loan Documents; provided, further,
that if at any time any noncash consideration received by Holdings or any
Subsidiary in connection with any Asset Sale is converted into or sold or
otherwise disposed of for cash, then such cash shall constitute Net Cash

with clause (c) above within 365 days of the receipt of such cash; provided,
further, that Holdings shall have the right to exclude Asset Sales subsequent
to the Issue Date, the proceeds of which in the aggregate do not exceed $20
million, from the provisions of this Section 4.15. To the extent that the Net
Cash Proceeds are not actually applied in accordance with clauses (c)(i) or
(ii) above, or after such application there remains a portion of the Net Cash
Proceeds which, when added to any other Net Cash Proceeds

<PAGE>95

remaining after such application, accumulates at least $20 million subsequent
to the previous time Holdings shall have accumulated at least such an amount
and used it in accordance with this Section 4.15, or if no such accumulation
shall previously have occurred, subsequent to the date of this Indenture,
Holdings shall make an offer as described in paragraph (b) below (the "Net
Proceeds Offer") to purchase Securities at a price equal to 100% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the date of

Asset Sale made by Holdings or one of its subsidiaries shall not be required
to be in excess of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Asset Sale less the Net Cash
Proceeds actually applied in accordance with clauses (c)(i) or (ii) above.
The Net Proceeds Offer shall remain open from the time of mailing until 5 days
(or such shorter period as may be required under applicable law) before the
Proceeds Purchase Date.

shall be mailed, by first class mail, by Holdings not less than ___ days nor
more than ___ days after the relevant Asset Sale to all Holders at their last
registered addresses, with a copy to the Trustee and the Credit Agent. The
notice shall contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such
Holders to tender Securities pursuant to the Net Proceeds Offer and shall
state the following terms:

(1) that the Net Proceeds Offer is being made pursuant to
Section 4.15 and that all Securities tendered will be accepted for
payment; provided, however, that if the aggregate principal amount of
Securities tendered in a Net Proceeds Offer plus accrued interest at the
expiration of such offer exceeds the aggregate amount of the Net Proceeds
Offer, Holdings shall select the Securities to be purchased on a pro rata
basis (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by Holdings so
that only Securities in denominations of $1,000 or multiples thereof
shall be purchased, except for Secondary Securities that were issued in
denominations other than $1,000);

(2) the purchase price (including the amount of accrued interest)

Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Security purchased; and

(7) that Holders whose Securities were purchased only in part will
be issued new Securities equal in principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Securities surrendered.

(3) immediately before and immediately after and giving effect to
such transaction and the assumption of the obligations as set forth in

(4) Holdings shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, merger, transfer or adoption and such supplemental

ARTICLE VI

DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

Section 6.1. Events of Default.

An "Event of Default" occurs if:

(1) Holdings defaults in the payment of interest on the Securities
when the same becomes due and payable and the default continues for a
period of 30 days;

(2) Holdings defaults in the payment of the principal of the
Securities when the same becomes due and payable at maturity, upon
acceleration, redemption or otherwise (including the failure to
repurchase Securities tendered pursuant to the requirements set forth in
Sections 4.14 and 4.15), whether or not such payment shall be prohibited
by the provisions of Article Eleven hereof;

(3) Holdings fails to comply with any of its other agreements or
covenants in, or provisions of, the Securities or this Indenture and the
default continues for the period and after the notice specified below;

(4) there shall be a default under any bond, debenture, or other
evidence of Indebtedness of Holdings or of any Significant Subsidiary or
under any mortgage, indenture or other instrument under which there may
be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any such
Indebtedness, whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be
created, if both (A) such default either (i) results from the failure to
pay such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (that is, the date of
the last principal installment of any installment Indebtedness under the
instrument or agreement pursuant to or under which such Indebtedness was
created or is evidenced) or (ii) relates to an obligation (including any
obligation to pay interest, to purchase such Indebtedness or to pay the
principal of such Indebtedness, other than the obligation to pay any
principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity) and results
in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness
to become due prior to its stated final maturity) and (B) the principal
amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates $25 million or more at any one time;

(5) Holdings or any Significant Subsidiary (A) admits in writing
its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, (B)
commences a voluntary case or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law with
respect to itself, (C) consents to the entry of a judgment, decree or
order for relief against it in an involuntary case or proceeding under
any Bankruptcy Law, (D) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it
or for substantially all of its property, (E) consents to or acquiesces
in the institution of a bankruptcy or an insolvency proceeding against
it, (F) makes a general assignment for

<PAGE>100

the benefit of its creditors, or (G) takes any corporate action to
authorize or effect any of the foregoing;

(6) a court of competent jurisdiction enters a judgment, decree or
order for relief in respect of Holdings or any Significant Subsidiary in
an involuntary case or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law, which shall
(A) approve as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment or composition in respect of Holdings or any
Significant Subsidiary, (B) appoint a Custodian of Holdings or any
Significant Subsidiary or for substantially all of its property or (C)
order the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs; and such judgment,
decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60
consecutive days; or

(7) any warrant of attachment is issued against any portion of the
property of Holdings having a value of at least $25 million, which
warrant is not released within 60 days after service of process with
respect thereto, or final judgments not covered by insurance for the
payment of money which in the aggregate at any one time exceeds $25
million shall be rendered against Holdings by a court of competent
jurisdiction and shall remain undischarged for a period (during which
execution shall not be effectively stayed) of 60 days after such judgment
becomes final and nonappealable.

A Default under clause (3) above (other than in the case of any
Defaults resulting from any Default under Section 4.3, 4.14 or 5.1, which
Defaults shall be Events of Default with the notice specified in this
paragraph but without the passage of time specified in this paragraph) is not
an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies Holdings, or the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities notify
Holdings and the Trustee, of the Default, and Holdings does not cure the
Default within 30 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify
the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a "Notice
of Default." Such notice shall be given by the Trustee if so requested by the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then
outstanding. When a Default is cured, it ceases.

Section 6.2. Acceleration.

(a) If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default
specified in Section 6.1(5) or (6) with respect to Holdings or any Significant
Subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, by notice to Holdings
(and, if any Indebtedness is outstanding under the Credit Agreement or any
Loan Documents is otherwise in effect, to the Credit Agent), or the Holders of
at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding
may, by written notice to Holdings and the Trustee, and the Trustee shall
(with notice to the Credit Agent if any Indebtedness is outstanding under the
Credit Agreement or any Loan Document is otherwise in effect), upon the
request of such Holders, declare the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities outstanding, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon to
the date of payment, to be due and payable and, upon any such declaration, the
same shall become and be due and payable; provided, that so long as the Credit
Agreement shall be in force and effect, if any such Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, any such acceleration shall not be effective
until the earlier of (a) five Business Days following a notice of acceleration
given to Holdings and the Credit Agent under the Credit Agreement and only if
upon such fifth Business Day such Event of Default shall be continuing or (b)
the acceleration

<PAGE>101

of any Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement. If an Event of Default
specified in Section 6.1(5) or (6) occurs with respect to Holdings or any
Significant Subsidiary, all unpaid principal and accrued interest on the
Securities then outstanding shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
Holder. Upon payment of such principal amount, interest, and premium, if any,
all of Holdings' obligations under the Securities and this Indenture, other
than obligations under Section 7.7, shall terminate. The Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by
notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if (i)
all existing Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal
and interest on the Securities which have become due solely by such
declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived, (ii) to the extent the
payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of inter-
est and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such
declaration of acceleration, has been paid, and (iii) the rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) In the event of a declaration of acceleration under this
Indenture because an Event of Default set forth in Section 6.1(4) has occurred
and is continuing, such declaration of acceleration shall be automatically
rescinded and annulled if either (i) the holders of the Indebtedness which is
the subject of such Event of Default have waived such failure to pay at
maturity or have rescinded the acceleration in respect of such Indebtedness
within 90 days of such maturity or declaration of acceleration, as the case
may be, and no other Event of Default has occurred during such 90-day period
which has not been cured or waived, or (ii) such Indebtedness shall have been
discharged or the maturity thereof shall have been extended such that it is
not then due and payable, or the underlying default has been cured (and any
acceleration based thereon of such other Indebtedness has been rescinded),
within 90 days of such maturity or declaration of acceleration, as the case
may be.

Section 6.3. Other Remedies.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may
pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the
payment of principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the
performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess
any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A
delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or
remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy
or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy
is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to
the extent permitted by law.

Section 6.4. Waiver of Past Defaults.

Subject to Sections 6.7 and 9.2, the Holders of at least a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the
Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences, except a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on
any Security as specified in clauses (1) and (2) of Section 6.1. When a
Default or Event of Default is waived, it is cured and ceases.

<PAGE>102

Section 6.5. Control by Majority.

The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting
any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust
or power conferred on it. Subject to Section 7.1, however, the Trustee may
refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with any law or this Indenture
that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of another
Holder, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided that
the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is
not inconsistent with such direction.

Section 6.6. Limitation on Suits.

A Holder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or
the Securities unless:

(1) the Holder gives to the Trustee notice of a continuing Event of
Default;

(2) the Holder or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Securities make a written request to the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense to be
incurred in compliance with such request;

(4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days
after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and

(5) during such 60-day period the Holder or Holders of at least 25%
in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities do not give
the Trustee a direction which, in the opinion of the Trustee, is
inconsistent with the request.

A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of
another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over such other Holder.

Section 6.7. Rights of Holders To Receive Payment.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of
any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on a Security, on
or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security, or to bring suit
for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates,
shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.

Section 6.8. Collection Suit by Trustee.

If an Event of Default in payment of principal or interest specified
in clause (1) or (2) of Section 6.1 occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may
recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against
Holdings or any other obligor on the Securities for the whole amount of
principal and accrued interest remaining unpaid, together with interest on
overdue principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,
interest on

<PAGE>103

overdue installments of interest, in each case at the rate per annum borne by
the Securities and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the
costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

Section 6.9. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the
Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relating to Holdings or any other
obligor upon the Securities, any of their respective creditors or any of their
respective property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect and receive
any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to
distribute the same, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceedings is
hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in
the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
Section 7.7. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the
Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder
any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting
the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the
Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

Section 6.10. Priorities.

If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article Six, it
shall pay out the money in the following order:

First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.7;

Second: if the Holders are forced to proceed against Holdings
directly without the Trustee, to the Holders for their collection costs;

Third: to the Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities
for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of
any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for
principal and interest, respectively; and

Fourth: to Holdings.

The Trustee, upon prior notice to Holdings, may fix a record date
and payment date for any payment to the Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10.

Section 6.11. Undertaking for Costs.

In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted
by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any
party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the

<PAGE>104

costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable
costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the
suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses
made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the
Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.7, or a suit by a Holder or
Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Securities.

ARTICLE VII

TRUSTEE

The Trustee hereby accepts the trust imposed upon it by this
Indenture and covenants and agrees to perform the same, as herein expressed.

Section 7.1. Duties of Trustee.

(a) If a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in
it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise
thereof as a prudent person could exercise or use under the circumstances in
the conduct of his own affairs.

(b) Except during the continuance of a Default or an Event of
Default:

(1) The Trustee need perform only those duties as are specifically
set forth in this Indenture and no covenants or obligations shall be
implied in this Indenture that are adverse to the Trustee.

(2) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness
of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions
furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this
Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and
opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of
this Indenture.

(c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own
negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful
misconduct, except that:

(1) This paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of
this Section 7.1.

(2) The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made
in good faith by a Trust Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee
was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.

(3) The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it
takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction
received by it pursuant to Section 6.5.

(d) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties

<PAGE>105

hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have
reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate
indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

(e) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to
the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this
Section 7.1.

(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any assets
received by it except as the Trustee may agree with Holdings. Assets held in
trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other assets except to the
extent required by law.

Section 7.2. Rights of Trustee.

Subject to Section 7.1:

(a) The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The
Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.

(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may consult
with counsel and may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of
Counsel, which shall conform to Sections 12.4 and 12.5. The Trustee
shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good
faith in reliance on such certificate or opinion.

(c) The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents and shall
not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent
appointed with due care.

(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action that it takes or
omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within
its rights or powers.

(e) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into
the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond,
debenture, or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its
discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such
facts or matters as it may see fit.

(f) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or
direction of any of the Holders pursuant to the provisions of this
Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee rea-
sonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred therein or thereby.

Section 7.3. Individual Rights of Trustee.

The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the
owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with Holdings, its
Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates with the same rights it would
have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights.
However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.

<PAGE>106

Section 7.4. Trustee's Disclaimer.

The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy
of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for Holdings'
use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for
any statement in the Securities other than the Trustee's certificate of
authentication.

Section 7.5. Notice of Default.

If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if
it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder notice of
the uncured Default or Event of Default within 90 days after such Default or
Event of Default occurs. Except in the case of a Default or an Event of
Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any
Security, including the failure to make payment on the Change of Control
Payment Date pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Trustee may withhold
the notice if and so long as its board of directors, the executive committee
of its board of directors or a committee of its directors and/or Trust
Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the
interest of the Holders.

Section 7.6. Reports By Trustee to Holders.

Within 60 days after each May 15 beginning with the May 15 following
the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall, to the extent that any of the
events described in TIA 313(a) occurred within the previous twelve months,
but not otherwise, mail to each Holder a brief report dated as of such May 15
that complies with TIA 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA
313(b) and 313(c).

A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be
mailed to Holdings and filed with the SEC and each stock exchange, if any, on
which the Securities are listed.

Holdings shall notify the Trustee if the Securities become listed on
any stock exchange.

Section 7.7. Compensation and Indemnity.

Holdings shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable
compensation for its services. The Trustee's compensation shall not be
limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. Holdings
shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable disbursements,
expenses and advances incurred or made by it including, without limitation,
any taxes imposed on the trust or on the income from the Securities. Such
expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses
of the Trustee's agents and counsel.

Holdings shall indemnify the Trustee for, and hold it harmless
against, any loss or liability incurred by it except for such actions to the
extent caused by any negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the administration of this trust and its rights or duties
hereunder. The Trustee shall notify Holdings promptly of any claim asserted
against

<PAGE>107

the Trustee for which it may seek indemnity. Holdings shall defend the claim
and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate
counsel and Holdings shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel; provided that Holdings will not be required to pay such fees and
expenses if it assumes the Trustee's defense and there is no conflict of
interest between Holdings and the Trustee in connection with such defense as
reasonably determined by the Trustee. Holdings need not pay for any
settlement made without its written consent. Holdings need not reimburse any
expense or indemnify against any loss or liability to the extent incurred by
the Trustee through its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

To secure Holdings' payment obligations in this Section 7.7, the
Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all assets held or
collected by the Trustee, in its capacity as Trustee, except assets held in
trust to pay principal of, premium, if any, or interest on particular
Securities.

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event
of Default specified in Section 6.1(5) or (6) occurs, the expenses and the
compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of
administration under any Bankruptcy Law.

Section 7.8. Replacement of Trustee.

The Trustee may resign by so notifying Holdings. The Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities may
remove the Trustee by so notifying Holdings and the Trustee may appoint a
successor Trustee with Holdings' consent. Holdings may remove the Trustee if:

(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;

(2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent;

(3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee
or its property; or

(4) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the
office of Trustee for any reason, Holdings shall notify each Holder of such
event and shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after
the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities may appoint a successor Trustee to replace
the successor Trustee appointed by Holdings.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its
appointment to the retiring Trustee and to Holdings. Immediately after that,
the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the
successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided in Section 7.7, the res-
ignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the
successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee
under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession
to each Holder.

<PAGE>108

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the
retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, Holdings or the
Holders of at least 10% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appoint-
ment of a successor Trustee.

If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee
and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this
Section 7.8, Holdings' obligations under Section 7.7 shall continue for the
benefit of the retiring Trustee.

Section 7.9. Successor Trustee by Merger, Etc.

If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or
transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another
corporation, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any
further act shall, if such resulting, surviving or transferee corporation is
otherwise eligible hereunder, be the successor Trustee.

Section 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification.

This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the
requirements of TIA 310(a)(1) and 310(a)(5). The Trustee shall have a
combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 as set forth in its most
recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with
TIA 310(b); provided, however, that there shall be excluded from the
operation of TIA 310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other
securities, or certificates of interest or participation in other securities,
of Holdings are outstanding, if the requirements for such exclusion set forth
in TIA 310(b)(1) are met.

Section 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Holdings.

The Trustee shall comply with TIA 311(a), excluding any creditor
relationship listed in TIA 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been
removed shall be subject to TIA Sec. 311(a) to the extent indicated.

satisfactory to the Trustee, U.S. Legal Tender or direct non-callable
obligations of, or non-callable obligations guaranteed by, the United
States

the reinvestment of such interest and after payment of all federal, state
and local taxes or other charges or assessments in respect thereof
payable by the Trustee, in the opinion of the Chief Financial Officer

in the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred;

(6) The deposit shall not result in Holdings, the Trustee or the

Section 8.2. Termination of Obligations upon Cancellation of the Securities.

In addition to Holdings' rights under Section 8.1, Holdings may
terminate all of its obligations under this Indenture (subject to Section 8.3)
when:

(1) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other
than Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have
been replaced or paid as provided in Section 2.7) have been delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation;

(2) Holdings has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable
hereunder and under the Securities by Holdings; and

(3) Holdings has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate

Indenture have been complied with.

Section 8.3. Survival of Certain Obligations.

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture and
of the Securities referred to in Section 8.1 or 8.2, the respective
obligations of Holdings and the Trustee under Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5,
2.6, 2.7, 2.13, 4.1, 4.2, 6.7, 7.7, 7.8, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 12.4 and 12.5 shall
survive until the Securities are no longer outstanding, and thereafter the
obligations of Holdings and the Trustee under Sections 7.7, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7
shall survive. Nothing contained in this Article Eight shall abrogate any of
the obligations or duties of the Trustee under this Indenture.

Section 8.4. Acknowledgment of Discharge by Trustee.

8.2 have been satisfied, (ii) Holdings has paid or caused to be paid all other
sums payable hereunder by Holdings and (iii) Holdings has delivered to the
Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that

obligations under this Indenture except for those surviving obligations
specified in Section 8.3.

Section 8.5. Application of Trust Assets.

The Trustee shall hold any U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government
Obligations deposited with it in the irrevocable trust established pursuant to
Section 8.1. The Trustee shall apply the deposited U.S. Legal Tender or the
U.S. Government Obligations, together with earnings thereon, through the
Paying Agent (other than Holdings or any Subsidiary), in accordance with this
Indenture and the terms of the irrevocable trust agreement, to the payment of
principal of and interest on the Securities. The U.S. Legal Tender or U.S.
Government Obligations so held in trust and deposited with the Trustee in com-
pliance with Section 8.1 shall not be part of the trust estate under this
Indenture, but shall constitute a separate trust fund for the benefit of all
Holders entitled thereto.

<PAGE>111

Upon termination of the trust established pursuant to Section 8.1,
the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to Holdings upon request
any excess U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations held by them.

The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to Holdings upon request,
and, if applicable, in accordance with the irrevocable trust established
pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2, any U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government
Obligations held by them for the payment of principal of or interest on the
Securities that remain unclaimed for one year after the date on which such
payment shall have become due. After payment to Holdings, Holders entitled to
such payment must look to Holdings for such payment as general creditors
unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.

Section 8.7. Reinstatement.

If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any U.S. Legal
Tender or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.1 or 8.2 by
reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any
court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting such application, Holdings' obligations under this Indenture and
the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had
occurred pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2 until such time as the Trustee or
Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such U.S. Legal Tender or U.S.
Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.1 or 8.2

ARTICLE IX

AMENDMENTS, SUPPLEMENTS AND WAIVERS

Section 9.1. Without Consent of Holders.

Holdings, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee,
together, may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities without
notice to or consent of any Holder:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; provided that
such amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights of any
Holder;

(2) to comply with Article Five;

(3) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in
place of certificated Securities; provided, however, that the
uncertificated Securities are issued in registered form for purposes of
Section 163(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as from time to time
amended, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Securities are
described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as from time to time amended;

(4) to make any other change that does not adversely affect the
rights of any Holders; or

<PAGE>112

(5) to comply with any requirements of the SEC in connection with
the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;

provided that Holdings has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
stating that such amendment or supplement complies with the provisions of this
Section 9.1.

Section 9.2. With Consent of Holders.

Subject to Section 6.7, Holdings, when authorized by a Board
Resolution, and the Trustee, together, with the written consent of the Holder
or Holders of at least fifty-one percent in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Securities, may amend or supplement this Indenture or the
Securities, without notice to any other Holders. Subject to Section 6.7, the
Holder or Holders of at least fifty-one percent in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Securities may waive compliance by Holdings with any
provision of this Indenture or the Securities without notice to any other
Holder. Without the consent of each Holder affected, however, no amendment,
supplement or waiver, including a waiver pursuant to Section 6.4, may:

(1) change the principal amount of Securities whose Holders must
consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver of any provision of this
Indenture or the Securities;

(2) reduce the rate or extend the time for payment of interest on
any Security;

(3) reduce the principal amount of any Security;

(4) change the Maturity Date of any Security, or alter the
redemption provisions contained in paragraph 5 of the Securities in a
manner adverse to any Holder;

(5) make any changes in the provisions concerning waivers of
Defaults or Events of Default by Holders of the Securities or the rights
of Holders to recover the principal of, interest on, or redemption
payment with respect to, any Security;

(6) make any changes in Section 6.4, 6.7 or this third sentence of
this Section 9.2; or

(7) make the principal of, or the interest on any Security payable
with anything or in any manner other than as provided for in the
Indenture and the Securities as in effect on the date hereof.

Without the consent of the Holder or Holders of at least 66 % of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities, no change may be
made to the provisions of Article Eleven that adversely affects the rights of
any Holder under Article Eleven.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this
Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement
or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance
thereof.

<PAGE>113

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes
effective, Holdings shall mail to the Holders affected thereby a notice
briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of
Holdings to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in
any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.

In connection with any amendment, supplement or waiver under this
Article Nine, Holdings may, but shall not be obligated to, offer to any Holder
who consents to such amendment, supplement or waiver, or to all Holders,
consideration for such Holder's consent to such amendment, supplement or
waiver.

Holdings agrees that no amendment, supplement or waiver under this
Article Nine may make any change that adversely affects the rights under
Article Eleven of any holders of Senior Indebtedness unless the holders of
such Senior Indebtedness consent to the change.

Section 9.3. Compliance with TIA.

Every amendment, waiver or supplement of this Indenture or the
Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.

Section 9.4. Revocation and Effect of Consents.

Until an amendment, waiver or supplement becomes effective, a
consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every
subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the
same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent
is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder
may revoke the consent as to his Security or portion of his Security by notice
to the Trustee or Holdings received before the date on which the Trustee
receives an Officers' Certificate certifying that the Holders of the requisite
principal amount of Securities have consented (and not theretofore revoked
such consent) to the amendment, supplement or waiver.

Holdings may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for
the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment,
supplement or waiver, which record date shall be at least 30 days prior to the
first solicitation of such consent. If a record date is fixed, then
notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph,
those persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated
proxies), and only those persons, shall be entitled to revoke any consent
previously given, whether or not such persons continue to be Holders after
such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than
90 days after such record date.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall
bind every Holder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1)
through (7) of Section 9.2, in which case, the amendment, supplement or waiver
shall bind only each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every
subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the
same debt as the consenting Holder's Security; provided that any such waiver
shall not impair or affect the right of any Holder to receive payment of
principal of and interest on a Security, on or after the respective due dates
expressed in such Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such
payment on or after such respective dates without the consent of such Holder.

<PAGE>114

Section 9.5. Notation on or Exchange of Securities.

If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a
Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to
the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security
about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if
Holdings or the Trustee so determines, Holdings in exchange for the Security
shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects
the changed terms.

Section 9.6. Trustee To Sign Amendments, Etc.

The Trustee shall execute any amendment, supplement or waiver
authorized pursuant to this Article Nine; provided that the Trustee may, but
shall not be obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver
which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Inden-
ture. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected
in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of any
amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article Nine is
authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

ARTICLE XI

SUBORDINATION

Section 11.1. Securities Subordinated to Senior Indebtedness.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Holdings, for
itself and its successors, and each Holder, by accepting a Security, agrees,
that the payment of the principal of and interest on and premiums, penalties,
fees and other liabilities (including, without limitation, liabilities in
respect of any indemnity, reimbursement, compensation or contribution
obligations, the occurrence of a Change of Control, any liquidated damage
provision, any breach of representation or warranty, or any rights of redemp-
tion or rescission under this Indenture, the Merger Agreement and the
Registration Rights Agreement or by law or otherwise) ("Other Obligations")
with respect to the Securities is subordinated, to the extent and in the
manner provided in this Article Eleven, to the prior payment in full in cash
of all Senior Indebtedness.

This Article Eleven shall constitute a continuing offer to all
persons who become holders of, or continue to hold, Senior Indebtedness, and
such provisions are made for the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness
and such holders are made obligees hereunder and any one or more of them may
enforce such provisions. Holders of Senior Indebtedness need not prove
reliance on the subordination provisions hereof.

Section 11.2. No Payment on Securities in Certain Circumstances.

(a) No direct or indirect payment or distribution shall be made by
or on behalf of Holdings (other than a payment in Secondary Securities) on
account of principal of or interest on or Other Obligations with respect to
the Securities or to acquire, repurchase, redeem, retire or defease any of the
Securities or on account of the redemption provisions of the Securities (i)
upon the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness by lapse of time, acceleration or
otherwise, unless and until all principal thereof and interest thereon shall
first be paid in full in cash or (ii) upon the happening of any default in
payment of any principal of or interest on any Senior Indebtedness when the
same becomes due and payable (a "Payment Default"), unless and until such
default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist.

(b) Without limiting the effect of Section 11.2(a), upon the
happening of a default or event of default (other than a Payment Default)
(including any event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or
both, would become an event of default and including any default or event of
default that would result upon any payment with respect to the Securities)
with respect to any Senior Indebtedness, as such default or event of default
is defined therein or in the instrument or agreement under which it is
outstanding, and upon written notice thereof given to Holdings and the Trustee
by any holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their Representative specifying
an intent to effect a Payment Blockage Period hereunder ("Payment Notice"),
then, unless and until such default or event of default shall have been cured
or waived or shall have ceased to exist, no direct or indirect payment or
distribution (other than of

<PAGE>118

Secondary Securities) shall be made by or on behalf of Holdings on account of
principal of or interest on or Other Obligations with respect to the
Securities or to acquire, repurchase, redeem, retire or defease any of the
Securities or on account of the redemption provisions of the Securities;
provided, however, that this paragraph (b) shall not prevent the making of any
payment for a period of (a "Payment Blockage Period") of more than 179 days
after a Payment Notice shall have been given (or earlier if such Payment
Blockage Period is terminated (i) by written notice to the Trustee and
Holdings from the Credit Agent or the Representative which gave such Payment
Notice, (ii) repayment in full of such Senior Indebtedness or (iii) because
the default specified in the Payment Notice is no longer continuing). Subject
to the provisions contained in Section 11.2(a) above, Holdings may resume
payments on the Securities after such Payment Blockage Period expires.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) not more than one Payment Notice shall be
given within a period of 360 consecutive days, and (ii) a Payment Notice may
only be given (A) if Senior Indebtedness is outstanding under the Credit
Agreement at the time of such notice, by the Credit Agent and (B) if no Senior
Indebtedness is outstanding under the Credit Agreement at the time of such
notice, by a holder or holders (or the Representative of holders) of at least
$35,000,000 principal amount of such Senior Indebtedness. For purposes of
this Section, no default or event of default which existed or was continuing
on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to
the Senior Indebtedness initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or
be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period
by the Representative of such Senior Indebtedness whether or not within a
period of 360 consecutive days unless such default or event of default shall
have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.

(c) In furtherance of the provisions of Section 11.1, if,
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.2, any direct or
indirect payment or distribution other than Secondary Securities on account of
principal of or interest on or Other Obligations with respect to the
Securities or to acquire, repurchase, redeem, retire or defease any of the
Securities or on account of the redemption provisions of the Securities shall
be made by or on behalf of Holdings and received by the Trustee, by any Holder
or by any Paying Agent (or, if Holdings or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of
Holdings is acting as Paying Agent, money for any such payment or distribution
shall be segregated and held in trust), at a time when such payment or
distribution was prohibited by the provisions of this Section 11.2, then,
unless and until such payment or distribution is no longer prohibited by this
Section 11.2, such payment or distribution (subject to the provisions of
Sections 11.6 and 11.7) shall be received, segregated from other funds, and
held in trust by the Trustee or such Holder or Paying Agent, as the case may
be, for the benefit of, and shall be immediately paid over to, the holders of
Senior Indebtedness or their Representative, ratably according to the
respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the
extent necessary to make payment in full in cash of all Senior Indebtedness
remaining unpaid, after giving effect to all concurrent payments and
distributions to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness. Holdings shall
give prompt notice to the Trustee of any default or event of default or any
acceleration under any Senior Indebtedness or under any agreement pursuant to
which Senior Indebtedness may have been issued. Failure to give such notice
shall not affect the subordination of the Securities to Senior Indebtedness
provided in this Article Eleven. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in the absence of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct, the Trustee shall have no duty to collect or retrieve monies
previously paid by it in good faith; provided that this sentence shall not
affect the obligation of any other party receiving such payment to hold such
payment for the benefit of, and to pay such payment over to, the holders of
Senior Indebtedness or their Representative.

<PAGE>119

Section 11.3. Securities Subordinated to Prior Payment of All Senior
Indebtedness on Dissolution, Liquidation or Reorganization of
Holdings.

Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of Holdings
of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, upon any
dissolution, winding-up, total or partial liquidation or total or partial
reorganization of Holdings (including, without limitation, in bankruptcy,
insolvency or receivership proceedings or upon any assignment for the benefit
of creditors or any other marshalling of assets and liabilities of Holdings
and whether voluntary or involuntary):

(a) the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled
to receive payments in full in cash of the principal thereof and interest
thereon before the Holders are entitled to receive any payment on account
of the principal of or interest on or Other Obligations with respect to
the Securities (whether by payment, acquisition, retirement, defeasance,
redemption or otherwise) or any other payment or distribution of assets
or securities by or on behalf of Holdings;

(b) any payment or distribution of assets or securities of Holdings
of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to
which the Holders or the Trustee on behalf of the Holders would be
entitled except for the provisions of this Article Eleven, including any
such payment or distribution that is payable or deliverable by reason of
the payment of any other Indebtedness of Holdings being subordinated to
the payment of the Securities (except for any such payment or
distribution (x) authorized by an order or decree giving effect, and
stating in such order or decree that effect is given, to the
subordination of the Securities to the Senior Indebtedness, and made by a
court of competent jurisdiction in a reorganization proceeding under any
applicable bankruptcy law, (y) of securities that (i) are unsecured, (ii)
have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity and final maturity that are no
shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Securities or
any securities issued to the holders of Senior Indebtedness under the
Loan Documents pursuant to a plan of reorganization or readjustment and
(iii) are subordinated, to at least the same extent as the Securities, to
the payment of all Senior Indebtedness then outstanding or (z) of Capital
Stock), shall be paid by the liquidating trustee or agent or other person
making such a payment or distribution, directly to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness or their Representative, ratably according to the respective
amounts of Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, until all
Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid shall have been paid in full in
cash, after giving effect to all concurrent payments and distributions to
or for the holders of such Senior Indebtedness; and

(c) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment
or distribution of assets or securities of Holdings of any kind or
character, whether in cash, property or securities, shall be received by
the Trustee or the Holders or any Paying Agent (or, if Holdings or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of Holdings is acting as Paying Agent, money,
assets or securities of any kind or character for any such payment or
distribution shall be segregated or held in trust) on account of
principal of or interest on or Other Obligations with respect to the
Securities before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash, such
payment or distribution (subject to the provisions of Sections 11.6 and
11.7) shall be received, segregated from other funds, and held in trust
by the Trustee

<PAGE>119

or such Holder or Paying Agent for the benefit of, and shall
immediately be paid over to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness or
their Representative, ratably according to the respective amounts of
Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, until all Senior
Indebtedness remaining unpaid shall have been paid in full in cash, after
giving effect to all concurrent payments and distributions to or for
the holders of Senior Indebtedness. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in the absence of its gross negligence or
wilful misconduct, the Trustee shall have no duty to collect or retrieve
monies previously paid by it in good faith; provided that this
sentence shall not affect the obligation of any other party receiving
such payment to hold such payment for the benefit of, and to pay over
such payment over to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their
Representatives.

Holdings shall give prompt notice to the Trustee prior to any
dissolution, winding-up, total or partial liquidation or total or partial
reorganization of Holdings or assignment for the benefit of creditors by
Holdings.

Section 11.4. Holders to Be Subrogated to Rights of Holders of Senior
Indebtedness.

Subject to the payment in full in cash of all Senior Indebtedness,
the Holders of Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of
Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of assets of Holdings
applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all amounts owing on the
Securities shall be paid in full in cash, and for the purpose of such
subrogation no payments or distributions to the holders of Senior Indebtedness
by or on behalf of Holdings, or by or on behalf of the Holders by virtue of
this Article Eleven, which otherwise would have been made to the Holders,
shall, as between Holdings and the Holders, be deemed to be payment by
Holdings to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that
the provisions of this Article Eleven are and are intended solely for the
purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and
the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.

If any payment or distribution to which the Holders would otherwise
have been entitled but for the provisions of this Article Eleven shall have
been applied, pursuant to the provisions of this Article Eleven, to the
payment of all amounts payable under the Senior Indebtedness, then the Holders
shall be entitled to receive from the holders of such Senior Indebtedness any
payments or distributions received by such holders of Senior Indebtedness in
excess of the amount sufficient to pay all amounts payable under or in respect
of the Senior Indebtedness in full in cash.

Section 11.5. Obligations of Holdings Unconditional.

Nothing contained in this Article Eleven or elsewhere in this
Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as between
Holdings and the Holders, the obligation of Holdings, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay to the Holders the principal of and interest on and
Other Obligations in respect of the Securities as and when the same shall
become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or
shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of Holdings
other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein
or therein prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising all remedies
otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture,
subject to the

<PAGE>120

rights, if any, under this Article Eleven, of the holders of Senior
Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of Holdings received
upon the exercise of any such remedy. Upon any payment or distribution of
assets or securities of Holdings referred to in this Article Eleven, the
Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 7.1 and 7.2, and the Holders
shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of
competent jurisdiction in which any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or
reorganization proceedings are pending, or a certificate of the receiver,
trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee or agent or other person making any
payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders for the purpose of
ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such payment or
distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of
Holdings, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or
distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article
Eleven. Nothing in this Section 11.5 shall apply to the claims of, or
payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.7.

Section 11.6. Trustee Entitled to Assume Payments Not Prohibited in Absence
of Notice.

The Trustee shall not at any time be charged with knowledge of the
existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment to or by
the Trustee unless and until the Trustee or any Paying Agent shall have
received written notice thereof from Holdings or from one or more holders of
Senior Indebtedness or from any Representative therefor and, prior to the
receipt of any such notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections
7.1 and 7.2, shall be entitled in all respects conclusively to assume that no
such fact exists.

Section 11.7. Application by Trustee of Assets Deposited with It.

U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations deposited in trust
with the Trustee pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.1 (including,
without limitation, clause (4) thereof) shall be for the sole benefit of
Holders and, to the extent allocated for the payment of Securities, shall not
be subject to the subordination provisions of this Article Eleven. Otherwise,
any deposit of assets or securities by or on behalf of Holdings with the
Trustee or any Paying Agent (whether or not in trust) for the payment of
principal of or interest on or Other Obligations with respect to any Securi-
ties shall be subject to the provisions of this Article Eleven; provided that
if prior to the second Business Day preceding the date on which by the terms
of this Indenture any such assets may become distributable for any purpose
(including, without limitation, the payment of either principal of or interest
on any Security) the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall not have received with
respect to such assets the notice provided for in Section 11.6, then the
Trustee or such Paying Agent shall have full power and authority to receive
such assets and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received,
and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary received by it on or
after such date. The foregoing shall not apply to the Paying Agent if
Holdings or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Holdings is acting as Paying Agent.
Nothing contained in this Section 11.7 (except the first sentence of this
Section 11.7) shall limit the right of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to
recover payments as contemplated by this Article Eleven.

Section 11.8. Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or Omissions of
Holdings or Holders of Senior Indebtedness.

<PAGE>121

No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness
to enforce the subordination provisions contained in this Article Eleven shall
at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act
on the part of Holdings or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any
such holder, or by any noncompliance by Holdings with the terms of this
Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder may have
or be otherwise charged with. The holders of Senior Indebtedness may extend,
renew, restate, supplement, modify or amend the terms of the Senior
Indebtedness or any security therefor and release, sell or exchange such
security and otherwise deal freely with Holdings and its Subsidiaries all
without affecting the liabilities and obligations of the parties to this
Indenture or the Holders. No provision in any supplemental indenture that
affects the subordination of the Securities or other provisions of this
Article Eleven shall be effective against the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness who have not consented thereto.

Each Holder by accepting a Security agrees that the Representative
of any Senior Indebtedness (including without limitation, the Credit Agent),
in its discretion, without notice or demand and without affecting any rights
of any holder of Senior Indebtedness under this Article Eleven, may foreclose
any mortgage or deed of trust covering interests in real property secured
thereby, by judicial or nonjudicial sale; and such Holder hereby waives any
defense to the enforcement by the Representative (including without
limitation, the Credit Agent) of any Senior Indebtedness or by any holder of
any Senior Indebtedness against such Holder of this Article Eleven after a
judicial or nonjudicial sale or other disposition of its interests in real
property secured by such mortgage or deed of trust; and such Holder expressly
waives any defense or benefits that may be derived from California Civil Code
2808, 2809, 2810, 2819, 2845, 2849 or 2850, or California Code of Civil
Procedure 580a, 580d or 726, or comparable provisions of the laws of any
other jurisdiction or any similar statute in effect in any other jurisdiction.

Section 11.9. Holders Authorize Trustee to Effectuate Subordination of
Securities.

Each Holder by accepting a Security authorizes and expressly directs
the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or
appropriate to effect the subordination provisions contained in this Article
Eleven, and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for such purpose,
including, in the event of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or
reorganization of Holdings (whether in bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership
proceedings or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other
marshalling of assets and liabilities of Holdings) tending towards liquidation
or reorganization of the business and assets of Holdings, the immediate filing
of a claim for the unpaid balance of its or his Securities and Other
Obligations in the form required in said proceedings and cause said claim to
be approved. If the Trustee does not file a proper claim or proof of debt in
the form required in such proceeding prior to 30 days before the expiration of
the time to file such claim or claims, then the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness or their Representative is hereby authorized to file an
appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders of said Securities.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee or the
holders of Senior Indebtedness or their Representative to authorize or consent
to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights
of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee or the holders of Senior
Indebtedness or their Representative to vote in respect of the claim of any
Holder in any such proceeding.

Section 11.10. Right of Trustee to Hold Senior Indebtedness.

The Trustee shall be entitled to all of the rights set forth in this
Article Eleven in respect of any Senior Indebtedness at any time held by it to
the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in
this Indenture shall be construed to deprive the Trustee of any of its rights
as such holder.

Section 11.11. Article Eleven Not to Prevent Events of Default.

The failure to make a payment on account of principal of or interest
on the Securities by reason of any provision of this Article Eleven shall not
be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default
under Section 6.1.

Section 11.12. No Fiduciary Duty of Trustee to Holders of Senior Indebtedness.

The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness, and shall not be liable to any such holders
(other than for its willful misconduct or gross negligence) if it shall in
good faith mistakenly pay over or deliver to the Holders of Securities or
Holdings or any other person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior
Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Eleven or otherwise.
Nothing in this Section 11.12 shall affect the obligation of any person other
than the Trustee to hold such payment for the benefit of, and to pay such
payment over to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their Representative.

13% Senior Subordinated Pay-in-Kind Debenture
due ________ __, 2006

1. Interest.

FOOD 4 LESS HOLDINGS, INC., a California corporation ("Holdings"),
promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate
per annum shown above. Holdings may, in its sole discretion, issue additional
Securities ("Secondary Securities") in lieu of a cash payment of any or all of
the interest due on any Interest Payment Date occurring on or prior to [the
Interest Payment Date five years after the Issue Date]. If Holdings issues
Secondary Securities in lieu of cash payment, in whole or in part, of interest
due on any Interest Payment Date occurring on or prior to [the Interest
Payment Date five years after the Issue Date], pursuant to this paragraph, it
shall give notice to the Trustee not less than 5 Business Days prior to the
relevant Interest Payment Date, and shall instruct the Trustee (upon written
order of Holdings signed by an Officer of Holdings given not less than 5 nor
more than 45 days prior to such Interest Payment Date) to authenticate a
Secondary Security, dated such Interest Payment Date, in a principal amount
equal to the amount of interest not paid in cash in respect of this Security
on such Interest Payment Date. Each issuance of Secondary Securities in lieu
of cash payments of interest on the Securities shall be made pro rata with
respect to the outstanding Securities. Any such Secondary Securities shall be
governed by the Indenture and shall be subject to the same terms (including
the maturity date and the rate of interest from time to time payable thereon)
as this Security (except, as the case may be, with respect to the title,
issuance date and aggregate principal amount). The term Securities shall
include the Secondary Securities that may be issued under the Indenture.

Holdings will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on ___________
and _________ of each year (the "Interest Payment Date"), commencing
___________, ____. Interest on this Security will accrue from the date of
issuance or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid.
Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months and actual number of days elapsed.

Holdings shall pay interest on overdue principal and interest on
overdue installments of interest, to the extent lawful, at the rate per annum
borne by the Securities.

2. Method of Payment.

Holdings shall pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted
interest) to the persons who are the registered Holders at the close of
business on the Record Date immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date
even if the Securities are cancelled on registration of transfer or
registration of exchange after such Record Date. Holders must surrender
Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. Holdings shall
pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of
payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts ("U.S. Legal
Tender") (or, pursuant to

<PAGE>129

Paragraph 1 hereof, in Secondary Securities). However, Holdings may pay
principal and interest by its check payable in such U.S. Legal Tender or by
wire transfer of federal funds
(or, pursuant to Paragraph 1 hereof, in Secondary Securities). Holdings may
deliver any such interest payment to the Paying Agent or to a Holder at the
Holder's registered address.
3. Paying Agent and Registrar.

Initially, _____________________________________ (the "Trustee"),
will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. Holdings may change any Paying Agent,
Registrar or co-Registrar without notice to the Holders. Holdings or any
Subsidiary may, subject to certain exceptions, act as Paying Agent, Registrar
or co-Registrar.

4. Indenture.

Holdings issued the Securities under an Indenture, dated as of
________ __, 1994 (the "Indenture"), between Holdings and the Trustee. This
Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of Holdings
designated as its 13% Senior Subordinated Pay-in-Kind Debentures due 2006.
Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise
defined herein. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the
Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S. Code 77aaa-77bbbb) (the "TIA"), as in effect
on the date of the Indenture until such time as the Indenture is qualified
under the TIA, and thereafter as in effect on the date on which the Indenture
is qualified under the TIA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders of Securities are
referred to the Indenture and said Act for a statement of them. The Secu-
rities are general unsecured obligations of Holdings limited in aggregate
principal amount to $100,000,000, except for Secondary Securities and except
as otherwise provided in the Indenture.

5. Optional Redemption.

The Securities may not be redeemed at the option of Holdings prior
to ________ __, 1999. Thereafter, upon at least 30 days' but not more than 60
days' notice to the Holders, Holdings may redeem all or any of the Securities
at any time at redemption prices equal to the applicable percentage of the
principal amount thereof set forth below, plus accrued interest, if any, to
the Redemption Date (as defined in the Indenture) if
redeemed during the 12-month period beginning ________ __ of the years
indicated below:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to ________ __, 1997, Holdings
may use the Net Proceeds (as defined in the Indenture) of an Initial Public
Offering (as defined in the

<PAGE>130

Indenture) of Holdings or the Company [(or of Food 4 Less, Inc., to the extent
Net Proceeds thereof are contributed as a capital contribution in exchange for
Common Stock of Holdings)] to redeem up to 35% of the Securities at a
redemption price equal to 110% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued
interest, if any, to the date of redemption.

In order to effect the foregoing redemption, Holdings shall send the
notice required by Section 3.3 of the Indenture not later than 30 days after
the Initial Public Offering Consummation Date (as defined in the Indenture).

6. Notice of Redemption.

Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more
than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be
redeemed at such Holder's registered address. Securities in denominations
larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part.

Except as set forth in the Indenture, from and after any Redemption
Date, if monies for the redemption of the Securities called for redemption
shall have been deposited with the Paying Agent for redemption on such
Redemption Date, then, unless Holdings defaults in the payment of such
Redemption Price, the Securities called for redemption will cease to bear
interest and the only right of the Holders of such Securities will be to
receive payment of the Redemption Price.

7. Change of Control Offer.

In the event of a Change of Control, upon the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Indenture, Holdings shall be required to offer to
purchase all of the then outstanding Securities pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
Holders of Securities which are the subject of such an offer to repurchase
shall receive an offer to repurchase and may elect to have such Securities
repurchased in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

8. Limitation on Disposition of Assets.

Under certain circumstances Holdings is required to apply the net
proceeds from Asset Sales to the repayment of Indebtedness of Holdings or any
Subsidiary, to make Related Business Investments or to purchase in a Net
Proceeds Offer at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase, which shall
in the aggregate equal the net proceeds required to be applied thereto.
Holdings may credit against the principal amount of Securities to be acquired
in a Net Proceeds Offer 100% of the principal amount of Securities acquired by
Holdings through purchase, optional redemption, exchange or otherwise
following consummation of the Asset Sale and surrendered for cancellation and
not previously used as a credit against any other required payment pursuant to
the Indenture.

<PAGE>131

9. Subordination. The Securities are subordinated in right of payment, in
the manner and to the extent set forth in the Indenture, to the prior payment
in full of Senior Indebtedness of Holdings whether outstanding on the date of
the Indenture or thereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed. Each
Holder, by accepting a Security, agrees to such subordination and authorizes
the Trustee to give it effect.

10. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.

The Securities are in registered form, without coupons, in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 (other than Secondary
Securities which may be in denominations of less than $1,000). A Holder shall
register the transfer of or exchange Securities in accordance with the
Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay certain transfer
taxes or similar governmental charges payable in connection therewith as
permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of
or exchange any Securities or portions thereof selected for redemption. No
service charge shall be made for any transfer, registration or exchange, but
Holdings may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection therewith, but not for any exchange
pursuant to Section 2.10, 3.6 or 9.5 of the Indenture.

11. Persons Deemed Owners.

The registered Holder of a Security shall be treated as the owner of
it for all purposes.

12. Unclaimed Money.

If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed
for one year, the Trustee and the Paying Agents will pay the money back to
Holdings at its request. After that, all liability of the Trustee and such
Paying Agents with respect to such money shall cease.

13. Discharge Prior to Redemption or Maturity.

If Holdings at any time deposits with the Trustee U.S. Legal Tender
or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay the principal of and interest
on the Securities to redemption or maturity and complies with the other
provisions of the Indenture relating thereto, Holdings will be discharged from
certain provisions of the Indenture and the Securities (including the
financial covenants, but excluding its obligation to pay the principal of and
interest on the Securities).

14. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Securities may
be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of at least
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding,
and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision
may be waived with the consent of the Holders of

<PAGE>132

a majority in aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of the
Securities then outstanding. Without notice to or consent of any Holder, the
parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to,
among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, provide for
uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated
Securities, comply with Article Five of the Indenture or comply with any
requirements of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the Indenture
under the TIA, or make any other change that does not adversely affect the
rights of any Holder of a Security. An amendment may not make any change that
adversely affects the rights under Article 11 of the Indenture of any holders
of Senior Indebtedness unless the holders of Senior Indebtedness consent to
the change.

15. Successors.

When a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor
under the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor will be released from
those obligations.

16. Defaults and Remedies.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Securities then
outstanding may declare all the Securities to be due and payable in the
manner, at the time and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Holders of
Securities may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided
in the Indenture. The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or
the Securities unless it has received indemnity satisfactory to it. The
Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding to

qualifications.

as material (the "Court Orders"), or (iv) to the knowledge of such counsel,
without any independent investigation, require any consents, approvals,
authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings by either of them under
any federal, state or local statute, rule or regulation applicable to either
of them, except where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals or

not have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of
operation or financial condition of Ralphs Supermarkets and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or on the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Agreement or the Registration Rights
Agreement. No opinion is expressed herein as to the application of any

believe that the information with respect to EJDC contained in the Shelf
Registration Statement or the related Prospectus (except for the financial
information, financial statements, financial schedules and other financial or
statistical data contained therein, as to which such counsel may express no
opinion), on the date such Shelf Registration Statement became effective under
the Securities Act, or on the date of the Prospectus, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

to the FSI plan.

9. The Shelf Registration Statement has become effective under the
Securities Act and, to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement has been
issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened.

10. Such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and
other representatives of F4L Holdings, and representatives of the independent

and, although such counsel is not passing upon, and does not assume any

<PAGE>143

responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements
contained in the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus and has not
made any independent check or verification thereof, during the course of such
participation (relying as to materiality to a large extent upon the statements
of officers and other representatives of F4L Holdings), no facts came to such
counsel's attention that caused such counsel to believe that the information
with respect to F4L Holdings contained in the Shelf Registration Statement, at
the time such Shelf Registration Statement became effective under the
Securities Act, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of its date,
contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood
that such counsel expresses no belief with respect to the financial
statements, schedules and other financial and statistical data included in the
Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus or incorporated therein or with
respect to the Form T-1.

No opinion is expressed herein as to the application of any
antifraud laws, antitrust or trade regulation laws, federal or state
securities laws, or the application for, or the transfer of, licenses or
permits regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages, pharmaceutical products,
lottery tickets, workers compensation self-insurance, food stamps, or WIC
vouchers.

The foregoing opinions will be limited to matters of federal law,
New York law, California law and the Delaware GCL. Notwithstanding the fact
that such counsel is opining as to the internal laws of the State of
California, such counsel need express no opinion as to the enforceability
under California law of provisions of any agreement selecting the law of
another state to govern; however, if California law were to apply to the
Indenture and the Debentures, the Indenture and the Debentures would not
violate the usury laws of the State of California.

conferring of any benefit on, such stockholder in connection with the Merger
or any matter related thereto, other than as set forth in the Merger Agreement
and the other agreements referred to therein, provided that F4L or its

representations or warranties, the party to whom such representations or
warranties have been made shall have all rights and remedies for such breach
available to it under the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise, whether

transactions contemplated hereby, by reason of his acting at the request of
the Buyer.

SECTION 5.12. Arbitration.

Any claim or controversy arising between the Seller and the Buyer under
this Agreement may be decided by arbitration. Either the Seller or the Buyer
may invoke arbitration under this Section 5.12 by notice to the other of the
initial selection of an arbitrator and the filing of such notice with the
American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"); provided, however, that in no
event shall such notice be given if institution of legal or equitable
proceedings based on such claim, dispute or other matter in question would be
barred by any applicable statute of limitations or by this Agreement.
Arbitration shall be held in New York City under the auspices of the AAA
pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, and shall be by three
arbitrators independent of the parties to this Agreement selected from a list
provided by the AAA. One of the arbitrators shall be appointed by the Seller.
One of the arbitrators shall be appointed by the Buyer. The third arbitrator
is to be selected by these two arbitrators before the beginning of the
arbitration. If, however, any party fails to select an arbitrator within 15
days after receiving notice under this Agreement of an initial selection of an
arbitrator by the other party, the party appointing the first arbitrator may
also appoint the second arbitrator on behalf of the party who has failed to
make the appointment. Should the two arbitrators appointed by the parties
fail to agree upon the choice of a third arbitrator within 15 days after the
appointment of a second arbitrator, the appointment shall be made by the AAA.
Each party shall submit its case in writing to the arbitrators within one
month of the constitution of the arbitration tribunal. The arbitrators are
empowered to determine questions both of fact and of law, but shall to the
maximum extent possible construe this Agreement strictly in accordance with
its terms and conditions and the purposes and intents evinced thereby.
Discovery shall be permitted under the same standards set forth in the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Whether a hearing shall be held or additional
evidence accepted, and the rules governing any such hearing, shall be in the
sole discretion of the arbitrators, subject to the AAA rules as they construe
them. All decisions of the arbitrators shall be by majority vote. The
arbitrators shall make their decision in writing at the earliest convenient
date. The costs of arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators, shall
be in the discretion of the arbitrators, who may direct to and by whom and in
what manner these costs or any part thereof shall be paid.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the decision of the arbitration
tribunal shall be final and binding on the parties to this Agreement and not
be subject to appeal. If a party against whom the arbitration tribunal
renders an award fails to abide by such award, the other parties may bring an
action to enforce the same in a court of competent jurisdiction.

SECTION 5.13. Convenience of Forum; Consent to Jurisdiction.

The parties to this Agreement, acting for themselves and for their
respective successors and assigns, without regard to domicile, citizenship or
residence, hereby expressly and irrevocably elect as the sole judicial forum

Agreement, and consent and subject themselves to the jurisdiction of, the
courts of the State of New York located in New York City, and/or the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in respect of any
matter arising under this Agreement. Service of process, notices and demands
of such courts may be made upon any party to this Agreement by personal
service at any place where it may be found or giving notice to such party as

<PAGE>153

SECTION 5.14. Enforcement of the Agreement.

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereto,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.

SECTION 5.15. Governing Law.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York (including Section 5-1401 of the General
Obligations Law) without giving effect to the choice-of-law provisions
thereof.

Agreement as of the date first above written.

CONSULTING AGREEMENT

THIS CONSULTING AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made
this ____ day of ________, 1994 between Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company") and The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation,
an Ohio corporation (the "Consultant").

R E C I T A L S:

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of _______, 1994 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and
among the Company, Food 4 Less, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Food 4 Less
Holdings, Inc., a California corporation, Ralphs Supermarkets, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Supermarkets") and the stockholders of Supermarkets,
the Company will merge with and into Supermarkets (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, Supermarkets
will assume all of the liabilities of the Company, including the liabilities
of the Company hereunder; and

WHEREAS, the Company wishes to obtain the technical
and advisory services of the Consultant as more particularly described below
and the Consultant is willing to provide such services on the terms and for
the consideration set out below.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
premises, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, it is hereby agreed as follows:

SECTION 1. Appointment. The Company hereby
appoints (the "Appointment") the Consultant and the Consultant hereby agrees
to serve the Company in the capacity of a consultant to the business of the
Company. The Appointment shall be deemed to commence on the Effective Date
(as defined in Section 9 hereof) and shall terminate on _________, 1999 [five
years from the Effective Date] (the "Term").

SECTION 2. Duties. During the Term, the
Consultant shall, as and when reasonably requested by the Company from time to
time, act as a consultant and render its assistance and participation, giving
the full benefit of the knowledge and expertise of its employees and agents in
the real estate and general commercial matters described on Schedule I hereto.
The Consultant shall have sole discretion to select which of its employees or
agents shall render services hereunder (any such employees or agents so
selected are referred to herein as the "representatives"). Nothing in this
Agreement shall obligate the Consultant (or its representatives) to provide
any services which are in conflict with the obligations of the Consultant (or
its representatives) under any non-competition agreement between the
Consultant (or its representatives) and DeBartolo Realty Corporation, an Ohio
corporation ("DRC"). In no event shall the Consultant (or any of its
representatives) be deemed, or be obligated to perform duties as, an employee,
a manager, executive or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
and the services of each of the Consultant and its representatives shall at
all times be performed as an independent contractor pursuant to this
Agreement. In the event that the attendance by representatives of the
Consultant at

<PAGE>156

any meeting is desired by the Company, the Company shall furnish such
representatives with reasonable advance notice. The Company acknowledges that
the Consultant's representatives will take vacation at various times and that
certain of such representatives are officer(s) or director(s) of the
Consultant, DRC, DeBartolo, Inc., an Ohio corporation and other corporations
and partnerships, which will require advance scheduling of such
representatives' attendance at meetings.

SECTION 3. Time Spent. At the reasonable request
of the Company, the Consultant's representatives shall devote a reasonable
amount of time to serve the Company in the capacity of consultant, as shall be
determined by mutual agreement of the parties and in a manner which will not
conflict with such representatives' other activities described in the last
sentence of Section 2(a), provided that in no event shall any representatives
of the Consultant be required to devote more than fifteen (15) hours per month
(in the aggregate for all such representatives) in service to the Company
hereunder.

SECTION 4. Compensation. (a) In consideration for
the services of Consultant hereunder, the Company shall pay the Consultant a
fee of $12,500,000 (the "Consulting Fee"). Except as otherwise provided in
paragraph (b) of this Section 4, the Consulting Fee shall be payable as
follows: (i) on the Effective Date, the Company shall pay the Consultant
$2,500,000, and (ii) on each anniversary of the Effective Date, commencing on
the first anniversary of the Effective Date and through and including the
fourth anniversary of the Effective Date, the Company shall pay, on each such
anniversary date, the Consultant $2,500,000 per annum.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4(a)
above, the Consulting Fee, at the election of the Consultant or the Company
made at or prior to the Effective Date, shall be entirely due and payable to
the Consultant on the Effective Date in an amount equal to $9,000,000.

(c) No portion of the Consulting Fee shall be
treated by the Company as subject to wage withholding or other taxes on
withholdings imposed on compensation paid to employees.

SECTION 5. Expenses. The Consultant shall be
reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or paid by the
Consultant or its representatives during the Term and in the performance of
the Consultant's services under this Agreement. Such expenses shall be
reimbursed promptly following receipt by the Company of expense reports with
accompanying supporting documentation in detail reasonably acceptable to the
Company.

SECTION 6. Termination. The Consultant shall have
the right to terminate the Consultant's retention hereunder upon thirty (30)
days' prior written notice to the Company. Upon termination hereunder, the
Consultant shall be entitled to receive (i) reimbursement under this Agreement
for expenses incurred prior to the date of termination and (ii) any Consulting
Fee earned and accrued under this Agreement.

SECTION 7. Relationship Between the Parties.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be taken to imply any relationship of
partnership, agency or employer and employee between the Company and the
Consultant.

SECTION 8. General. This Agreement is further
governed by the following provisions:

(f) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an

instrument.

be waived, only by a written instrument signed by the parties or, in the case
of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance. No delay on the part of any
party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any such
right, power or privilege nor any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

(i) Arbitration. Any claim or controversy arising
between the Company and the Consultant under this Agreement may be decided by
arbitration. Either the Company or the Consultant may invoke arbitration
under this Section 8(i) by notice to the other of the initial selection of an
arbitrator and the filing of such notice with the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA"); provided, however, that in no event shall such notice
be given if institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claim,
dispute or other matter in question would be barred by any applicable statute
of limitations or by this Agreement. Arbitration shall be held in New York
City under the auspices of the AAA pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the AAA, and shall be by three arbitrators independent of the parties
to this Agreement selected from a list provided by the AAA. One of the
arbitrators shall be appointed by the Company. One of the arbitrators shall
be appointed by the Consultant. The third arbitrator is to be selected by
these two arbitrators before the beginning of the arbitration. If, however,
any party fails to select an arbitrator within 15 days after receiving notice
under this Agreement of an initial selection of an arbitrator by the other
party, the party appointing the first arbitrator may also appoint the second
arbitrator on behalf of the party who has failed to make the appointment.
Should the two arbitrators appointed by the parties fail to agree upon the
choice of a third arbitrator within 15 days after the appointment of a second
arbitrator, the appointment shall be made by the AAA. Each party shall submit
its case in writing to the arbitrators within one month of the constitution of
the arbitration tribunal. The arbitrators are empowered to determine
questions both of fact and of law, but shall to the maximum extent possible
construe this Agreement strictly in accordance with its terms and conditions
and the purposes and intents evinced thereby. Discovery shall be permitted
under the same standards set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Whether a hearing shall be held or additional evidence accepted, and the rules
governing any such hearing, shall be in the sole discretion of the
arbitrators, subject to the AAA rules as they construe them. All decisions of
the arbitrators shall be by majority vote. The arbitrators shall make their
decision in writing at the earliest convenient date. The costs of
arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators, shall be in the discretion
of the arbitrators, who may direct to and by whom and in what manner these
costs or any part thereof shall be paid.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the
decision of the arbitration tribunal shall be final and binding on the parties
to this Agreement and not be subject

fails to abide by such award, the other parties may bring an action to enforce
the same in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Upon original issuance thereof, and until such time as the same is no

"THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR QUALIFIED UNDER STATE SECURITIES LAWS
AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT (A) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES
LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES, OR (B) IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN
FURNISHED WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL THAT SUCH TRANSFER, SALE,
ASSIGNMENT, PLEDGE, HYPOTHECATION OR OTHER DISPOSITION IS EXEMPT FROM THE
PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5 OF THE ACT AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS IN EFFECT
THEREUNDER AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS."

If any Selling Debentureholder desires to offer, sell or otherwise
transfer, pledge or hypothecate all or any part of the Debentures (other than
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act),
such Selling Debentureholder shall deliver to the Company a written opinion of
counsel (who may be in-house or special counsel), reasonably satisfactory in
form and substance to the Company, that an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws is
available.

<PAGE>166

3. Shelf Registration

(a) Initial Shelf Registration Statement. The Company has filed a
"shelf" registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 33-_____) pursuant to Rule 415
under the Securities Act (the "Initial Shelf Registration Statement") relating
to the resale by the Holders of all the Transfer Restricted Securities. The
Initial Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on
_________, 1994 and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture
Act. The Company agrees to use its best efforts to keep the Initial Shelf
Registration Statement continuously effective for a period of three years
following the Closing Date, as such period may be extended pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or such shorter period (in either case, the
"Effectiveness Period") which will terminate (i) when all the Registrable
Securities covered by the Initial Shelf Registration Statement have been sold
pursuant thereto; or (ii) at the Company's election on any date on or after
January 1, 1997 if, as of such date, less than $5,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of Debentures remain outstanding as Transfer Restricted Securities,
provided that the Company shall deliver 60 days advance written notice to each
Holder of any such election to terminate early the Effectiveness Period under
this clause (ii); or (iii) when a Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement
covering all of the Registrable Securities has been declared effective under
the Securities Act and all of the Registrable Securities have been sold
pursuant thereto.

(b) Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement. If the Initial Shelf
Registration Statement ceases to be effective for any reason at any time
during the Effectiveness Period (other than at the request of the Company or
because of the sale of all of the securities registered thereunder), the
Company shall use its best efforts to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any
order suspending the effectiveness thereof, and in any event shall within 30
days of such cessation of effectiveness amend the Initial Shelf Registration
Statement in a manner reasonably expected to obtain the withdrawal of the
order suspending the effectiveness thereof, or file an additional registration
statement pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of the Registrable Securities (a
"Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement"). If a Subsequent Shelf
Registration Statement is filed, the Company shall use its best efforts to
cause it to be declared effective as soon as practicable after such filing and
to keep it continuously effective for a period equal to the Effectiveness
Period less the aggregate number of days during which the Initial Shelf
Registration Statement or any Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement was
previously effective.

(c) Supplements and Amendments. The Company shall supplement and
amend any Initial or Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement if required by
the policies, rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the
registration form used by the Company, if required by the Securities Act, or
if reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration
Statement or by any underwriter of such Registrable Securities.

4. Liquidated Damages.

(a) Each of the Company and the Selling Debentureholders acknowledge
that the Holders of Registrable Securities will suffer damages if the
effectiveness of the

<PAGE>167

Shelf Registration Statement is not maintained during the Effectiveness
Period. Accordingly, if (i) prior to the end of the Effectiveness Period, the
SEC shall have issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf
Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement shall cease to be
effective or (ii) the Company notifies or is required to notify the selling
Holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 7(b)(6) (provided that
there shall be excluded for purposes of this clause (a)(ii): a notice under
Section 7(b)(6) if (A) the Company has delivered a supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 7(k) hereof or an Advice within ten
Business Days after receipt of such notice or after such requirement arises or
(B) such notice under Section 7(b)(6) relates solely to a transaction of the
type described in Section 5(c) hereof) (any of the events described in the
foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) being referred to herein as a "Registration
Default"), then the Company hereby agrees to pay liquidated damages to each
Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to the first 90-day period
immediately following the occurrence of such Registration Default, in an
amount equal to $.05 per week per $1,000 principal amount of Registrable
Securities held by such Holder for each week or portion thereof that the
Registration Default continues. The amount of the liquidated damages shall
increase by an additional $.05 per week per $1,000 in principal amount of
Registrable Securities with respect to each subsequent 90-day period up to a
maximum amount of liquidated damages of $.50 per week per $1,000 principal
amount of Registrable Securities; provided, however, that such liquidated
damages will cease to accrue on the date on which (A) the applicable Shelf
Registration Statement is no longer subject to an order suspending the
effectiveness thereof or a new Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement is
declared effective, with respect to liquidated damages for the failure to
remain effective or (B) a notice issued, or required to be issued, pursuant to
Section 7(b)(6) is no longer effective or required to be effective with
respect to liquidated damages payable pursuant to clause (ii) above.

(b) The Company shall notify the Indenture trustee within five
business days after any Registration Default. The Company shall pay the
liquidated damages amount due on the Registrable Securities (the "Liquidated
Damages Amount Due") by depositing with the Indenture trustee, in trust, for
the benefit of the Holders thereof, on or before the applicable Damages
Payment Date, immediately available funds in sums sufficient to pay the
Liquidated Damages Amount Due. The Liquidated Damages Amount Due shall be
payable on the Damages Payment Date, to the Persons who are registered Holders
of Debentures at the close of business on the _______ or _______ preceding
each Damages Payment Date, by federal funds check mailed to such holders'
registered address or by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Each
obligation to pay liquidated damages shall be deemed to accrue on the date of
the Registration Default. The parties hereto agree that the liquidated
damages provided for in this Section 4 constitute a reasonable estimate of the
damages that may be incurred by Holders of Registrable Securities by reason of
the failure of a Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective in
accordance with this Section 4. Liquidated damages will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

All obligations of the Company set forth in the preceding paragraph
that are outstanding with respect to any Transfer Restricted Security at the
time such security ceases to be a Transfer Restricted Security shall survive
(although such obligations shall

<PAGE>168

not continue to accrue) until such time as all such obligations with respect
to such security shall have been satisfied in full.

5. Hold-Back Agreements.

(a) Each Holder of Registrable Securities whose Registrable
Securities are covered by the Shelf Registration Statement agrees not to (i)
effect any public sale or distribution of the Debentures pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement or (ii) otherwise conduct marketing activities with
respect to the Debentures which marketing activities would impair or interfere
with F4L Supermarkets' marketing activities with respect to debt securities
comprising any portion of the Financing, in either case during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the 90th day following the
Closing Date.

(b) Each Holder whose Transfer Restricted Securities are covered by a
Shelf Registration Statement agrees, if requested by the managing underwriters
in an underwritten offering, not to effect any public sale or distribution of
the Debentures or any other securities of any issue being registered or a
similar security or any securities convertible or exchangeable or exercisable
for such securities including a sale pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A (except
as part of such underwritten registration), during the 10-day period prior to,
and ending 30 days after, the closing date of each underwritten offering made
pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement, to the extent timely notified
in writing by the Company or the managing underwriters.

(c) Each Holder agrees, upon a request of the Company made after
June 30, 1996 (which date shall be extended by each day for which liquidated
damages are payable pursuant to Section 4 hereof) in writing and delivered
with at least five days' prior notice, not to effect any public sale or
distribution of the Debentures or otherwise conduct marketing activities with
respect to the Debentures for a period not to exceed 90 days (the "90-Day
Period") if the Company, Food 4 Less, or any subsidiary proposes to make a
securities offering, material acquisition or engage in any other material
corporate transaction not in the ordinary course of business, if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith as evidenced by a resolution
of the Board of Directors that the continuation of public sales or a
distribution or other marketing activities would adversely affect the
Company's ability to complete such other transactions. Holders will be
subject to the requirements of this subparagraph only during the period
commencing on June 30, 1996 (as so extended, if applicable) and ending on the
last day of the Effectiveness Period, provided, however, that the Company
shall not be permitted to designate more than two such 90-Day Periods and the
Effectiveness Period will be extended by such number of days equal to the
number of days the Holders were subject to the requirements of this
subparagraph.

(d) Subject to the Company's prior request to Holders pursuant to
Section 5(c), the Company agrees, if requested by the managing underwriters in
an underwritten offering, not to effect any public sale or distribution of
securities of any of the issue being registered or a similar security or any
securities convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities
(other than bank borrowings, obligations of the Company with respect to trade
debt and other debt incurred by the Company in the ordinary course of
business),

<PAGE>169

during the 10-day period prior to, and ending 30 days after, the closing date
of each underwritten offering made pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement,
to the extent timely requested in writing by the managing underwriters (except
as part of such underwritten registration or pursuant to registrations on
Forms S-4 or S-8 or any successor form to such Forms).

(e) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit any pledge, transfer or
assignment permitted by Section 12(e).

6. Representations and Warranties of Selling Debentureholders, the

thereof, and pursuant thereto and in connection therewith the Company will:

(a) prepare and file with the SEC such post-effective amendments to
the Shelf Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the Shelf

supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act; and
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement
during the applicable period in accordance with the intended method or methods
of distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in such Shelf Registration
Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

(b) notify the selling holders of Registrable Securities and the
managing underwriters, if any, promptly (but in any event within five Business
Days), and (if requested by any such Person) confirm such advice in writing,
(1) when any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed,
and, with respect to or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective, (2) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information,
(3) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Shelf Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for
that purpose, (4) if at any time when a prospectus is required by the
Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Registrable
Securities the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any
agreement contemplated by paragraph (n) below cease to be true and correct in
all material respects, (5) of the receipt by the Company of any notification
with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from
qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or

the happening

<PAGE>171

of any event which makes any statement made in the Shelf Registration
Statement, the Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference
untrue in any material respect or which requires the making of any changes in
the Shelf Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any document incorporated
therein by reference so that, in the case of such Shelf Registration
Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the Prospectus,
it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

(c) use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness or the qualification or exemption from
qualification of the Shelf Registration Statement or the Registrable
Securities at the earliest possible moment;

(d) at least three Business Days prior to the filing of the same with
the SEC, furnish to each underwriter, if any, and each of the selling Holders
who beneficially own more than five percent (in principal amount) of the
outstanding Debentures, copies of any Shelf Registration Statement or any
Prospectus included therein or any amendments or supplements to any such Shelf
Registration Statement or Prospectus (including, upon request, all documents
incorporated by reference into such Shelf Registration Statement), other than
any amendment or supplement which differs from the Shelf Registration
Statement or Prospectus amended or supplemented thereby only in that it
contains additions to, or changes in, the listing of Holders of Transfer
Restricted Securities which are selling securities thereunder, or contains
updated financial statements and related information (provided that copies of
such amended or supplemented Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus shall
be furnished to such selling Holders of more than five percent (in principal
amount) of the outstanding Debentures), which documents will be subject to the
review and comment of such Holders and underwriter, if any, and make the
Company's and F4L's representatives available for discussion of such documents
and other customary due diligence matters; and the Company will not file any
such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
to any such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all such
documents incorporated by reference) to which the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Registrable Securities or the underwriter, if any,
shall reasonably object within two Business Days after the receipt thereof,
except for such amendments or supplements which counsel for the Company shall
advise are required to be filed to comply with applicable law. The objection
of the selling Holders or underwriter, if any, shall be deemed reasonable if
such Shelf Registration Statement, amendment, Prospectus or supplement, as
applicable, as proposed to be filed, contains a material misstatement or
omission or fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
Registration Default shall be deemed to have occurred under Section 4(a)(ii)
hereof if the Company has complied or been prepared to comply with all
deadlines set forth therein, but has been prevented from filing any amendment
or supplement solely because of a good faith disagreement between the Company
and a majority of the selling Holders or the underwriter, if any, under this
subsection (d) regarding the existence of a material misstatement or omission
or failure to comply with the Securities Act;

<PAGE>172

(e) if requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters or the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Registrable Securities
being sold in connection with an underwritten offering, promptly incorporate
in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the
managing underwriters or such holders request should be included therein
relating to the plan of distribution with respect to such Registrable
Securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the
principal amount of Registrable Securities being sold to such underwriters,
the purchase price being paid therefor by such underwriters and with respect
to any other terms of the underwritten (or best efforts underwritten) offering
of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering; and make all
required filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as
soon as practicable after receiving notification of the matters to be
incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to take any actions
under this Section 7(e) that are not, in the opinion of counsel for the
Company, in compliance with applicable law;

(f) furnish to each selling holder of Registrable Securities who so
requests and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, one conformed
copy of the Shelf Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment
thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and shall furnish only
to the counsel of such holders and each managing underwriter, without change,
one copy of all documents incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits;

(g) deliver to each selling holder of Registrable Securities and the
underwriter, if any, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus
(including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or supplement
thereto as such Persons may reasonably request; and, subject to the
penultimate paragraph of this Section 7, the Company consents to the use of
the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling
holders of Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if any, in connection
with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by the
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto;

(h) prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, to use
its best efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the selling holders
of Registrable Securities, the underwriters, if any, and their respective
counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption
from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for
offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as
any selling holder or managing underwriter reasonably requests in writing and
use its best efforts to do any and all other acts or things necessary or
advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable
Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement; provided that the
Company will not be required to qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or to take any action which
would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where
it is not then so subject;

(i) cooperate with the selling holders of Registrable Securities and
the managing underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and
delivery of

<PAGE>173

certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold and not bearing
any restrictive legends; and enable such Registrable Securities to be in such
denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriters may
request at least two business days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities
in a firm commitment underwritten public offering, or at least five business
days prior to any other such sale;

(j) use its best efforts to cause the Registrable Securities covered
by the applicable Shelf Registration Statement to be registered with or
approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities within the United
States as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof or the
underwriters, if any, to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities except as may be required solely as a consequence of the nature of
such selling holder's business, in which case the Company will cooperate in
all reasonable respects with the filing of such Shelf Registration Statement
and the granting of such approvals;

(k) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by paragraph (b)(6)
above, as promptly as practicable prepare a supplement or post-effective
amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any
document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document
so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable
Securities, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading;

(l) cause all Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf
Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which
similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;

requested by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such

Statement, provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities and provide
the Indenture trustee with printed certificates for the Registerable
Securities which are in a form eligible for deposit with the Depository Trust
Company;

(o) in connection with not more than two underwritten offerings of
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, enter into
an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance as is customary in
underwritten offerings and take all such other actions as are reasonably
requested by the managing underwriter in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities and in such connection (1) make
such representations and warranties to the underwriters in form, substance and
scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in primary underwrit-
ten offerings with respect to the business of the Company and the Shelf
Registration Statement; (2) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and
updates thereof

<PAGE>174

(which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the managing underwriters addressed to the underwriters
covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten
offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by under-
writers); (3) obtain "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof from the
Company's independent certified public accountants addressed to the under-
writers such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type
customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters by underwriters in connection
with primary underwritten offerings; (4) if an underwriting agreement is
entered into, the same shall set forth in full the indemnification provisions
and procedures of Section 9 hereof with respect to all parties to be indem-
nified pursuant to said Section; and (5) the Company shall deliver such docu-
ments and certificates as may be requested by the managing underwriters to
evidence compliance with clause (h) above and with any customary conditions
contained in the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the
Company. The above shall be done at each closing under such underwriting or
similar agreement (subject to the Holders' agreement that the Company not be
required to assist in more than two such underwritings), as and to the extent
required thereunder, and if at any time the representations and warranties of
the Company contemplated in clause (o)(1) above cease to be true and correct,
the Company shall so advise the underwriter(s), if any, and each selling
Holder promptly and, if requested by such Persons, shall confirm such advice
in writing;

(p) make available for inspection by a representative of the holders
of the Registrable Securities being sold (such representative to be selected
by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities
being sold), any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such
Shelf Registration Statement, and any attorney or accountant retained by such
representative or underwriter, at the offices where normally kept, during
reasonable business hours, all financial and other records, pertinent
corporate documents and properties of the Company, and cause the Company's
officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably
requested by any such representative, underwriter, attorney or accountant in

otherwise become public, and without limiting the foregoing, no such

required for the Indenture to continue to be qualified in accordance with the
terms of the Trust Indenture Act and execute, and use its best efforts to
cause the trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such
changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to
enable the Indenture to continue to be so qualified in a timely manner; and

(s) make its appropriate representatives of management available,
upon the reasonable request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities, but in no event upon less than 30 days' notice (or 15 days' notice
if at least 30 days' notice of a possible need to make management available
shall have been given), for a period not to exceed five days for a road show
in connection with the placement or underwritten offering of the Registrable
Securities by an underwriter. The Company will only be obligated under this
Section 7(s) with respect to one actual road show. The Company will also make
representatives of management available for conference calls in connection
with any public offering upon reasonable advance notice.

The Company may require each seller of Registrable Securities as to
which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Company such
information regarding the distribution of such securities as the Company may
from time to time reasonably request in writing.

Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of such
Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of
the happening of any event of the kind described in Sections 7(b)(3), 7(b)(5)
or 7(b)(6) hereof, such holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement until
such holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus
contemplated by Section 7(k) hereof, or until it is advised in writing (the
"Advice") by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be
resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings
which are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, and, if so directed by
the Company, such holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company's
expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's
possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at
the time of receipt of such notice. In the event the Company shall give any
such notice, the Effectiveness Period shall be extended by the number of days
during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to
and including the date when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by
such Shelf Registration Statement shall have received the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 7(k) hereof or the
Advice.

the Registrable Securities in a form eligible for deposit with Depository

Persons retained by the Company (all such expenses being herein called

and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting
duties), the expense of any annual audit, the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the listing of the securities to be registered on each
securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company are then

the Company will reimburse the holders of Registrable Securities being
registered in such registration for the reasonable fees and disbursements of
not more than one firm of counsel for all holders of Registrable Securities

Securities.

9. Indemnification

(a) Indemnification by Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each Holder of Registrable
Securities, the officers, directors and employees of each of them and each
Person who controls each such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act), the partners,
representatives, agents, officers, directors and employees of each such
controlling person, and any underwriters participating in the distribution
against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and reasonable expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees (and, any other expenses reasonably
incurred by any underwriter or any such controlling person in connection with
defending or investigating any action or claim)) arising out of or based upon
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Shelf Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein

<PAGE>177

or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as
the same arise out of or are based upon information furnished in writing to
the Company by such indemnified party or the related Holder of Registrable
Securities expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
any such preliminary Prospectus if (a) such indemnified party or the related
Holder of Registrable Securities failed to deliver a copy of the Prospectus
with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale by such
Person to the Person asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense
and (b) the Prospectus would have corrected such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission; and provided, further, that
the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based upon an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
in the Prospectus, if (a) such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement,
omission or alleged omission is corrected in an amendment or supplement to the
Prospectus delivered to the indemnified party prior to the sale of Registrable
Securities and (b) such indemnified party or the related Holder of Registrable
Securities thereafter failed to deliver such Prospectus as so amended or
supplemented prior to or concurrently with the sale of the Registrable
Securities to the Person asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense; and provided further, that the Company shall not be liable in any
such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission in the Prospectus, if (a) such
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission is
contained in a Prospectus or an amendment or supplement thereto which is the
subject of a notice delivered by the Company pursuant to, and in accordance
with, Sections 7(b)(3), 7(b)(5) or 7(b)(6), and (b) to the extent that such
losses arise out of the breach by such indemnified party or the related Holder
of Registrable Securities of the obligations of such indemnified party or the
related Holder of Registrable Securities contained in the penultimate
paragraph of Section 7.

(b) Indemnification by Holder of Registrable Securities. In
connection with each Shelf Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, an authorized officer of such Holder
of Registrable Securities will furnish to the Company in writing such
information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests for use in
connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus and each such
Holder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by
law, the Company and its directors, officers and employees and each Person who
controls the Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act
and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), the directors, officers and employees of
such controlling persons and any underwriters participating in the
distribution against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and reasonable
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or based upon
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated in the Shelf
Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information
so furnished in writing by such Holder to the Company

<PAGE>178

specifically for use in such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus. In
no event shall the liability of any selling Holder of Registrable Securities
hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received
by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such
indemnification obligation. The Company shall be entitled to receive
indemnities from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar
securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, to the
same extent as provided above with respect to information so furnished in
writing by such Persons specifically for inclusion in any Prospectus or Shelf
Registration Statement.

(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt notice to the indemnifying
party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and
(ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however,
that any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person
unless (a) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or
(b) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such
claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person or (c) in the
reasonable judgment of any such Person, based upon advice of its counsel, a
conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party
with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the
indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such
Person). If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably
withheld). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of
any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such
consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying
party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or
liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party
shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any
settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any
indemnified party is a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by
such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional
release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the
subject matter of such proceeding. An indemnifying party who is not entitled
to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified
by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the
reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist
between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with
respect to such claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels.

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this
Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold
such indemnified party harmless for any losses in respect of which this
Section 9 would otherwise apply by its terms, then each applicable
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified

<PAGE>179

party, shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in
connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such
losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified party, on
the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such
indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any
such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as
a result of any losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or
expenses incurred by such party in connection with any proceeding, to the
extent such party would have been indemnified for such expenses if the
indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or 9(b) was available to such
party.

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. Notwithstanding the provision of this Section 9(d), an
indemnifying party that is a selling Holder of Registrable Securities shall
not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
total price at which the Registrable Securities sold by such indemnifying
party and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the
amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required
to pay by reasons of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

(e) The indemnity, contribution and expense reimbursement obligations
under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability each indemnifying
party may otherwise have; provided that any payment made by the Company which
results in the indemnified party receiving from any source(s) indemnification,
contribution or reimbursement for an amount in excess of the actual loss,
liability or expense incurred by such indemnified party, shall be refunded to
the Company by the indemnified party receiving such excess payment.

10. Rule 144

The Company covenants that it will file the reports required to be
filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (as if the Company were subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act
whether or not it is so subject) and it will take such further action as any
holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable

<PAGE>180

Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation
of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such
Rule may be amended from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation
hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable
Securities, the Company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to
whether it has complied with such information and requirements.

11. Participation in Underwritten Registrations

If any of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or
investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering
will be selected by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
such Registrable Securities included in such offering; provided that such
investment bankers and managers must be reasonably satisfactory to the
Company.

In the event any Debentureholder proposes to sell Registrable
Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement in an underwritten
offering, it will so notify the Company and provide the Company with the
information to be included in the notice to be given by the Company
hereinafter set forth. Promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days) after receipt of such notice, the Company will give written notice to
each other Holder of Registrable Securities of (i) the name of the proposing
Holder, (ii) the principal amount of Registrable Securities proposed to be
sold by such proposing Holder, and (iii) the right of each other Holder to
elect to have all or a portion of the Registrable Securities owned by such
Holder included in such underwritten offering by notifying the Company and the
proposing Holder of such election (and specifying the principal amount of
Registrable Securities to be so included) within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of such notice from the Company. A Holder making such an election on
a timely basis shall be entitled to have the aggregate principal amount of
Registrable Securities specified in such election included in the underwritten
offering; provided, however, that, if the managing underwriter advises the
participating Holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation
of the principal amount of Registrable Securities to be underwritten, the
amount of Registrable Securities that may be included in the underwriting
shall be so limited and shall be allocated among the participating Holders pro
rata in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of Registrable
Securities proposed to be included in the underwritten offering by the
participating Holders.

No Person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder
unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Person's securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled
hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
Nothing in this Section 11 shall be construed to create any additional rights
regarding the registration of Registrable Securities in any Person otherwise
than as set forth herein.

<PAGE>181

12. Miscellaneous

(a) Remedies. Each Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise
all rights provided herein, in the Indenture or granted by law, including
recovery of liquidated or other damages, will be entitled to specific
performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company and F4L
Supermarkets agree that monetary damages (including the liquidated damages
contemplated hereby) would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred
by reason of a breach by them of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby
agree to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate.

(b) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company will not on or after the
date of this Agreement enter into any agreement with respect to its securities
which is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable
Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions
hereof. The Company has not previously entered into any agreement with
respect to its securities granting any registration rights to any Person,
except as disclosed in the Merger Agreement or as may be required in
connection with the Financing (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The
rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder do not in
any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the
holders of the Company's securities under any such agreements.

(c) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement,
including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof
may not be given unless the Company has obtained the written consent of
holders of at least a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding
Registrable Securities.

(d) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or
permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, registered
first-class mail, telex, telecopier, or air courier guaranteeing overnight
delivery:

(i) if to a holder of Registrable Securities, at the most current
address given by such holder to the Company in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 12(d), which address initially is, with respect
to each Selling Debentureholder, the address set forth next to such Selling
Debentureholder's name on the signature pages of the Merger Agreement, with
a copy to Willkie Farr & Gallagher, One Citicorp Center, 153 East 53rd
Street, New York, New York 10022, Attention: William E. Hiller, Esq.; and

(ii) if to the Company, initially at its address set forth in the
Merger Agreement and thereafter at such other address, notice of which is
given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12(d), with a copy
to Latham & Watkins, 633 West Fifth Street, Suite 4000, Los Angeles, CA
90071, Attention: Thomas C. Sadler, Esq.

<PAGE>182

All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly
given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; five business
days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when
answered back, if telexed; when receipt acknowledged, if telecopied; and on
the next business day if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing
overnight delivery.

Copies of all such notices, demands or other communications shall be
concurrently delivered by the Person giving the same to the trustee under the
Indenture at the address specified in the Indenture.

(e) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the
parties, including without limitation and without the need for an express
assignment, subsequent holders of Registrable Securities. Any Holder may
transfer, pledge or assign its rights hereunder (including indemnification
rights) to any lender (a "Lender"), subject to compliance with the provisions
of Section 2 hereof. Upon notice to the Company by such Lender that the
Lender has become authorized to exercise rights hereunder, no further written
instrument shall be required under this Agreement provided the Lender provides
the Company at the time the Lender exercises any rights on behalf of a Holder
with such indemnifications and certifications as are reasonably satisfactory
to the Company in form and substance as to the Lender's authorization to
exercise such rights.

(f) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

(g) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

(h) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

(i) Severability. In the event that any one or more of the
provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance,
is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the
remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired
thereby.

(j) Joint and Several Obligations. F4L Supermarkets will have joint
and several obligations for all of the obligations of the Company hereunder.

(k) Entire Agreement. This Agreement is intended by the parties as a
final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and
exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto
in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions,
promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred
to herein with respect to the registration rights granted by

<PAGE>183

the Company with respect to the securities sold pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

(l) Attorneys' Fees. In any action or proceeding brought to enforce
any provision of this Agreement, the successful party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to its costs and expenses and
any other available remedy.

<PAGE>184

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the
date first written above.
