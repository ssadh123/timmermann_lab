Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of
December 22, 1993 by and between Martin Marietta Corporation
("Martin Marietta"), General Dynamics Corporation ("General
Dynamics"), General Dynamics Space Services Company and General
Dynamics Commercial Launch Services, Inc. ("Asset Purchase
Agreement"), effective at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Daylight Savings
Time on May 1, 1994, Martin Marietta, acting through a direct
wholly-owned subsidiary, Martin Marietta Technologies, Inc., and
an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Martin Marietta Commercial
Launch Services, Inc., acquired substantially all of the assets
and business (together with certain associated liabilities), all
as more particularly described in the Asset Purchase Agreement,
of General Dynamics's Space Systems Division ("Division"). The
primary asset of the Division is business relating to the Atlas
series of space launch vehicles and the Centaur upper stages used
with Atlas and Titan IV launch vehicles.

The purchase consideration of $208.5M was established
by negotiation. Martin Marietta paid such amount from its working
capital. The Asset Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase
consideration is subject to post-closing adjustment based generally
upon changes in the economic value of the Division as reflected in
the Division's financial statements (subject to certain adjustments)
between that existing on August 29, 1993 and that existing on the
date of closing as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

The assets acquired include, among other things,
machinery, equipment and other physical property the primary use
of which relates to the design, development, production,
processing, sale and launching of expendable launch vehicles and
upper stage boosters as well as to other advanced space programs.
It is the present intent of Martin Marietta to continue to devote
the assets to such purposes.

GENERAL DYNAMICS SPACE SYSTEMS GROUP

COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993, 1992 AND 1991
TOGETHER WITH AUDITORS' REPORT

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To General Dynamics Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of the GENERAL
DYNAMICS SPACE SYSTEMS GROUP as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
combined statements of operations and net investment and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These combined
financial statements are the responsibility of the Group's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial statements
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the General
Dynamics Space Systems Group as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

The accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Group will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1, the
Group has suffered pretax losses from operations in each year since inception,
aggregating approximately $577 million as of December 31, 1993. These losses
have been funded by General Dynamics Corporation. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Group's ability to operate on a standalone basis
without continued financial support. The accompanying combined financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.

As discussed in Note 9 to the combined financial statements, effective January
1, 1993, the Group changed its method of accounting for postretirement
benefits other than pensions.

GENERAL DYNAMICS SPACE SYSTEMS GROUP

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 1993, 1992 AND 1991
(Amounts in thousands)

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business

The General Dynamics Space System Group (the Group) specializes in the
design, engineering, manufacturing and support of space launch vehicles and
related launch services. The major programs of the Group include the
Commercial Atlas Expendable Launch Vehicle (Atlas) program and the
Titan/Centaur program (Titan). Atlas includes the production and launch of
Atlas/Centaur vehicles for various U.S. and foreign Government, Civil, and
commercial customers. Titan includes the production of fifteen Centaur upper
stages for launch on the Titan IV launch vehicle. The Group is a
subcontractor to Martin Marietta on Titan.

Reporting Entity, Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying combined financial statements of the Group include the
accounts of General Dynamics Space Systems Division (GDSS), which is the
primary operating entity providing launch vehicles and services. GDSS is a
division of General Dynamics Corporation (GD). Also included are the accounts
of Commercial Launch Services, Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of GD
that provides sales and marketing services to GDSS, and General Dynamics
Space Services Corporation, also a wholly owned subsidiary of GD which
provides engineering services to GDSS and other corporations in the aerospace
industry.

All intercompany transactions within the Group have been eliminated.

Assumption Regarding Going Concern

The accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Group will continue as a going concern. The Group has suffered
pretax losses from operations in each year since inception, aggregating
approximately $577 million as of December 31, 1993. These losses have been
funded by GD. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Group's ability
to operate on a standalone basis without continued financial support. The
accompanying combined financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Asset Purchase Agreement

On December 22, 1993, GD and Martin Marietta Corporation entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) to sell certain assets and liabilities of
the Group (excluding primarily certain property, plant and equipment) to
Martin Marietta Corporation for approximately $208,500, subject to certain
post-closing adjustments. GD management expects the transaction to be
completed during the second quarter of 1994.

Sales and Earnings Under Long-Term Contracts and Programs

The Atlas program is accounted for using the completed contract method of
accounting. Sales are recognized upon launch at the contract price. Atlas
revenues approximated $273,000, $245,000 and $130,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Cost of sales is based upon
the estimated unit cost. General and administrative expenses and product
development costs are treated as contract costs to the extent allocable to a
firm contract, otherwise these costs are expensed as incurred.

All other programs and contracts are accounted for using the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Sales and earnings on fixed
price type and cost reimbursement contracts are recognized as costs are
incurred on each individual contract. The sales and earnings on these
contracts are based, in part, on estimates. These estimates are revised
periodically and adjustments to sales and earnings resulting from such
revisions are recorded on a cumulative basis in the period of revision.

Any anticipated losses on contracts or programs are charged to earnings when
identified. Such losses encompass all costs, including general and
administrative expenses, allocable to the contracts. Revenue arising from the
claims process is not recognized either as income or as an offset against a
potential loss until it can be reliably estimated and its realization is
probable.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses are allocated to contracts in process and
included in operating costs and expenses at the time of sales recognition with
the exception of certain Atlas contracts as discussed above. Total general
and administrative expenses incurred amounted to approximately $65,000 in
1993, $62,000 in 1992, and $60,000 in 1991.

Certain GD corporate general and administrative costs attributed to the
Group's operations are charged to the Group by GD. Total allocated corporate
expenses were approximately $12,000, $8,000 and $5,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. No assurances can be given that such expenses would not vary
significantly if the Group had operated as an unaffiliated entity.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Research and Development Costs

Customer-sponsored research and development costs are accounted for as direct
costs.

Company-sponsored research and development costs, including bid and proposal
costs, amounted to approximately $9,000 in 1993, $12,000 in 1992 and $10,000
in 1991. Specifically reimbursable costs are allocated to contracts in
process and included in operating costs and expenses at time of sales
recognition.

Contracts in Process

Contracts in process for the Atlas program are stated at cost incurred less
cost allocated to delivered units. All other contracts in process are stated
at cost incurred, plus estimated earnings, less progress payments. Incurred
costs consist of, among other things, production costs and related overhead,
which includes general and administrative expenses allocated to contracts.

Revenue which has not yet been billed is included in contracts in process.

Property, Plant and Equipment

The Group uses straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation for its
depreciable assets.

Customer Deposits

Customer deposits represent primarily advance payments from Atlas program
customers. In the event of contract termination, a certain portion of the
deposit would be refunded to the customer in accordance with contract terms.

At December 31, 1993, customer deposits are net of $67,616 of notes receivable
from a related party received in connection with one specific contract in the
Atlas program. These notes are due 60 days prior to launch, which is
currently scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1994, and bear interest at rates
ranging from 6.5% to 7%.

Classification

Consistent with industry practice, contracts in process, customer deposits and
other assets and liabilities relating to long-term contracts and programs are
classified as current although a portion of these amounts is not expected to
be realized within one year.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

2. ATLAS PROGRAM

During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Group recognized $29,000, $53,000 and
$8,000, respectively, of losses on certain contracts in the Atlas program
representing primarily the costs to investigate launch failures, related
corrective actions, the estimated impact of launch delays on existing
contracts, and certain other increases in expected costs.

All of the aforementioned losses, as well as losses identified in
earlier periods, have been reflected in contract loss reserves in the
accompanying balance sheets.

The Group's investment in the Atlas program includes recorded amounts
of inventoried costs, customer deposits and liabilities relating to the
previously discussed losses. The Group's ability to recover its significant
investment in the Atlas program is dependent upon, among other things, the
vehicle demonstrating the level of reliability required by its customers. In
addition, the Group has a remaining firm commitment for the purchase of rocket
engines of approximately $300,000 and other firm commitments of approximately
$165,000 as of December 31, 1993.

3. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Accounts receivable consist of the following as of December 31:

1993 1992

Government: long-term contracts
or programs $13,172 $2,212
Commercial and other 18,255 2,684
------- ------
$31,427 $4,896
======= ======

Direct sales to the U.S. Government were approximately $387,000, $359,000, and
$243,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

4. CONTRACTS IN PROCESS

Contracts in process consist of the following as of December 31:

1993 1992

Government contracts in process $ 194,969 $ 298,453
Commercial programs in process 1,385,138 1,289,883
---------- ----------
1,580,107 1,588,336
Less--Advances and progress payments (130,206) (235,800)
---------- ----------
$1,449,901 $1,352,536
========== ==========

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Substantially all government contracts in process represent unbilled costs
incurred plus estimated earnings that will be billed to the customer upon the
completion of certain milestones.

Under the contractual arrangements by which progress payments are received,
the U.S. Government asserts that it has a security interest in the contracts
in process identified by the related contracts.

5. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. The major classes of
property, plant and equipment are as follows:

1993 1992

Land and improvements $ 1,750 $ 1,750
Buildings and improvements 75,564 72,660
Machinery and equipment 80,299 76,500
-------- --------
157,613 150,910
Less--Accumulated depreciation
and amortization (76,844) (63,455)
-------- --------
$ 80,769 $ 87,455
======== ========

Certain plant facilities aggregating approximately 815 square feet are
provided by the U.S. Government at an annual lease cost of approximately $873.

6. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

Accounts payable and other current liabilities consist of the following at
December 31:

1993 1992

Accounts payable $57,358 $73,178
Accrued salaries and wages 17,654 12,982
Other current liabilities 19,656 6,943
------- -------
$94,668 $93,103
======= =======

7. INCOME TAXES

The Group is included in GD's consolidated federal income tax return. Under
the provisions of an informal tax sharing agreement with GD, the Group
computes federal income taxes to approximate a separate company basis. Taxes
currently payable or refundable based on this computation are reflected in the
Group's intercompany account balance with GD. Such intercompany balance is
reflected in Net Investment by General Dynamics Corporation in the
accompanying combined financial statements. Deferred taxes are shown
separately in the accompanying combined financial statements.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
The benefit for federal income taxes is summarized as follows:

1993 1992 1991
Current $ (5,743) $(56,162) $(46,785)
Deferred (3,257) 39,250 41,839
---------- ---------- ----------
$ (9,000) $ (16,912) $ (4,946)
========== ========== ==========

Deferred federal income taxes result primarily from differences in accounting
for long-term contracts, certain accrued costs, contract loss reserves, and
depreciation for financial reporting and income tax reporting purposes.
Earnings under long-term contracts (other than Atlas, see Note 1) are recorded
either under the percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods of
accounting for income tax reporting purposes.

The provision for state and local income taxes, which is primarily allocable
to U.S. Government contracts, is included in operating costs and expenses.

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Outsourcing of Information Technology Operations

In November 1991, GD signed an agreement with Computer Sciences
Corporation (CSC) for the sale of the information technology operations of
GD's Data Systems Division. Under a related agreement, CSC has the exclusive
right to provide information technology services to the Group for the next ten
years. The agreement provides for minimum aggregate payments to CSC during
the first three years of the service agreement and payments equal to 90
percent of the Company's estimated annual usage thereafter.

Atlas Program Commitments

The Group has offered different types of launch insurance coverage to
its customers under certain Atlas contracts. This insurance coverage is
generally designed to protect the customer from incurring losses relating to
any one or a combination of the following:

- Launch failure
- Damage or other loss to the satellite during launch and flight
- Satellite performance for specified period subsequent to launch

Generally, the Group has sold this insurance to its customers at fixed
premium rates. However, the Group generally does not purchase the related
insurance until sometime thereafter. The future availability and cost of this
insurance is subject to market conditions which can vary greatly and
significantly impact the profitability of launch contracts. The Group has
committed to providing, in certain circumstances, significant amounts of
launch insurance coverage falling outside of the insurance contract currently
in place.

The Company has entered into debt and lease guarantees in connection
with certain contracts in the Atlas program. As of December 31, 1993, the
Company was contingently liable on guarantees and other arrangements
aggregating up to a maximum of approximately $104,000.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Rental Expense and Lease Commitments

Rent expense, substantially all of which is minimum rental expense, was
approximately $7,000, $7,000 and $10,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
Rental commitments under existing operating leases at December 31, 1993, are
approximately $5,000 in 1994, $4,000 in 1995, $4,000 in 1996, $4,000 in 1997,
$4,000 in 1998 and $3,000 thereafter.

Legal

The Group is involved in various legal matters in the ordinary course
of its business activities. Management does not expect these matters to have
a significant impact on the Group's financial condition or results of its
operations.

9. RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Group participates in five GD sponsored trustee noncontributory retirement
plans covering substantially all of its employees. Under certain of the
plans, retirement benefits are primarily a function of both the employee's
years of service and level of compensation. Under other plans, benefits are a
function only of years of service.

It is GD's policy to fund retirement plans to the maximum extent deductible
under existing federal income tax regulations. Such contributions are
intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but
also for those expected to be earned in the future.

Assumptions used in accounting for the plans are as follows as of December 31:

1993 1992 1991

Discount rates 7% 8% 8%
Varying rates of increase in
compensation levels based on age 4.5-10% 4.5-10% 4.5-10%
Expected long-term rate on assets 8% 8% 8%

The Group's net periodic pension cost calculated pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards NO. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions,"
included the following:
1993 1992 1991

Year ended December 31:
Service costs - benefits earned
during period $ 9,404 $ 9,096 $ 8,935
Interest cost on projected
benefit obligation 15,325 12,651 11,004
Actual return on plan assets (26,289) (11,863) (33,501)
Net amortization and deferral 11,309 (1,275) 23,243
------- ------- --------
$ 9,749 $ 8,609 $ 9,681
======== ======= ========

Increases in prior service cost resulting from plan amendments are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of
employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. If the unrecognized

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

gain or loss at the beginning of the year exceeds 10 percent of the greater of
the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets,
the excess is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining
service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.

GD's stock is not included in the assets of any of the plans. At December 31,
1993, approximately 54 percent of the assets are invested in U.S. Government
securities, 34 percent in common stock and equivalents and 12 percent in
diversified corporate fixed income securities. In the event GD terminates
certain plans with assets that exceed accumulated benefits, the U.S.
Government may receive an equitable interest in those assets.

The following table sets forth the Group's share of the plans' funded status:

benefit obligations:

The Group provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees. The cost of these benefits totaled $1,756, $1,450 and $750 in
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, based on the claims paid.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Group adopted FAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", which requires
the recognition of postretirement benefits over the period in which active
employees become eligible for such benefits. Previously, the Group recognized
these costs on the cash basis. The Group has elected to implement this new
standard by recognizing the transition obligation prospectively over the
average estimated remaining service life of active employees. The remaining
transition obligation at January 1, 1994, is approximately $9,000.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of
earnings presents the historical results of operations of the Corporation
and the General Dynamics Space Systems Group for the year ended December
31, 1993, with pro forma adjustments as if the transaction had taken place
on January 1, 1993. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance
sheet presents the historical balance sheets of the Corporation and the
General Dynamics Space Systems Group as of December 31, 1993, as if the
transaction had been consummated as of December 31, 1993, in a transaction
accounted for as a purchase in accordance with generally accepted account-
ing principles.

No reclassifications have been made to the historical financial
statements of the General Dynamics Space Systems Group in preparing
the pro forma combined condensed financial statements.

2. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

The following adjustments give pro forma effect to the transaction:

(a) To record the cash purchase consideration at closing in the
amount of $208.5 million.

(b) To reflect the excluded assets and liabilities at closing.

(c) To adjust the acquired assets and assumed liabilities to their
estimated fair values, including the recording of the cost in
excess of net assets acquired of $144.7 million.

(d) Adjustments for the elimination of the Titan/Centaur program
intercompany sales and cost of sales which would not have been
recognized if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 1993.

(e) Adjustments for: (i) items charged to General Dynamics Space
Systems Group which would or would not have been incurred if the
transaction had occurred on January 1, 1993; (ii) additional
depreciation expense on the step-up of certain fixed assets
to fair value over an estimated life of ten years; and (iii) the
amortization of excess costs over acquired net assets over an
estimated life of 20 years. Such depreciation and amortization
expenses are subject to possible adjustment resulting from
completion of the valuation analyses.

(f) The tax effect, using a 38% statutory rate, on the pro forma
adjustments.

The pro forma combined condensed statements of earnings do not reflect
the total cost savings or economies of scale that the Corporation's
management believes would have been achieved had the transaction occurred
on January 1, 1993.

transfer or conveyance or attempted sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance

cooperate with Purchaser in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to
provide the benefits of such Interest to Purchaser (including, with respect to
any Property leased by Seller which would otherwise be an Asset and as to which
Seller has been unable to obtain the lessor's consent to the assignment thereof
to Purchaser, to sublease such Property (to the extent permitted under the
pertinent lease) to Purchaser, upon substantially the same terms and conditions
as are set forth in such lease with respect to Seller), so long as Purchaser
cooperates with Seller in such arrangements and promptly reimburses Seller for
any and all payments required to be made by Seller after the Closing Date by

above, such Interest shall be deemed to have been conveyed to Purchaser for the
purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that the approvals and consents
listed on Schedule 3.1(b) shall be obtained as a condition to Closing, unless
waived by Purchaser.

ARTICLE IV

POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT

Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that they may have differences of
opinion regarding the underlying assumptions used for the earnings accrual
rates and estimates at completion in the Atlas Program. The purpose of the
preparation of the Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold is to determine
the net change in the economic value of the Space Systems Division between that
existing on August 29, 1993 and that existing on the Closing Date, by comparing
financial statements as of those dates prepared by Seller on a consistent
basis; the purpose is not to resolve any differences of opinion that may exist
with respect to the underlying assumptions used for the earnings accrual rates
and estimates at completion in the Atlas Program.

4.1 Preparation of August Balance Sheet. Seller has provided to
Purchaser prior to the execution of this Agreement a balance sheet, including
related footnotes thereto, of the Space Systems Division as of August 29, 1993
(the "August Balance Sheet"), which August Balance Sheet (i) except as provided
in clause (ii) hereof, has been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently

-16-

<PAGE>

applied and (ii) takes into account all accruals and other adjustments (a)
required to present the Space Systems Division as a stand alone entity,
including certain liabilities or reserves which may previously have been
recorded at the headquarters level, and (b) appropriate for a balance sheet
being prepared at a financial year end.

4.2 Preparation of Initial Statement of Net
Assets to be Sold and Initial Reconciling Statement. Seller has provided to
Purchaser prior to the execution of this Agreement the Initial Statement of Net
Assets to be Sold which is based upon the August Balance Sheet and which (i)
except as otherwise provided in the remainder of this Section 4.2, has been
prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the August Balance
Sheet and the basis of accounting described in the footnotes to the Initial
Statement of Net Assets to be Sold, which footnotes are attached to the Initial
Statement of Net Assets to be Sold, (ii) has been based upon estimate-at-
complete assumptions set forth on Schedule 4.2, and (iii) includes the
following adjustments to the August Balance Sheet:

(a) Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities (except
for the Space Systems Division's investment and related customer deposits with
respect to AMSC) have been excluded;

(b) All intercompany accounts between
the Space Systems Division and Seller, or any other divisions, units,
Affiliates or Subsidiaries of Seller, have been eliminated;

(c) To the extent that any such fee or expense would
not otherwise have been incurred by the Space Systems Division in the ordinary
course of business, liabilities or reserves with respect to any accounting,
legal, investment or other professional or advisory fees or expenses relating
to the negotiation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein
have been excluded;

(d) An adjustment has been made to include any
employee or employee benefit matters that have been designated as Assumed
Liabilities in Article XI and which are not otherwise included on the August
Balance Sheet; and

(e) eliminate all accrued liabilities or benefits
for current or deferred federal income taxes and all accrued liabilities or
benefits for deferred state income taxes (including deferred state franchise
taxes).

The resulting document shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Initial
Statement of Net Assets to be Sold." Seller has provided to Purchaser in
conjunction with the Initial Statement of Net Assets to be Sold an Initial
Reconciling Statement which traces, reconciles and explains in reasonable
detail all adjustments made to the August Balance Sheet in order to comply with
this Section 4.2. The resulting document shall hereinafter be referred to as
the "Initial Reconciling Statement."

<PAGE>

4.3 Preparation of Closing Date Balance Sheet. As promptly as
practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare or cause to be prepared a balance sheet of the Space Systems
Division as of the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date (the
"Closing Date Balance Sheet") which balance sheet shall (i) except as provided
in clause (ii) hereof, be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
and (ii) shall take into account all accruals and other adjustments (a)
required to present the Space Systems Division as a stand alone entity,
including certain liabilities or reserves which may previously have been
recorded at the headquarters level and were included in the August Balance
Sheet, and (b) appropriate to a balance sheet being prepared at a financial
year end. Purchaser shall, at the request of Seller, cooperate with Seller in
the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

4.4 Preparation of Closing Statement of Net
Assets to be Sold and Closing Reconciling Statement. As promptly as
practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date,
Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, the Closing Statement of Net
Assets to be Sold, which shall be based upon the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
which shall:

(i) except as otherwise provided in the remainder of
this Section 4.4, be prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent
with the Closing Date Balance Sheet;

(ii) make the same adjustments as were made to the
Initial Statement of Net Assets to be Sold as provided for by Section 4.2;

(iii) be adjusted to remove the effects, if any,
resulting from any change in the assets or liabilities of the Space Systems
Division during the period after the Initial Statement of Net Assets to be Sold
through the Closing Date, caused by any write-ups or similar re-evaluations in
the book value of any of the Assets that are not realizable within 12 months
after the Closing Date Balance Sheet;

(iv) include an adjustment for any differences noted
between a physical count of all fixed assets, equipment and inventories which
are noted as a result of any physical inventory observation procedures
conducted by Arthur Andersen;

(v) except as otherwise provided in clause (vi), for
those Contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method
(Titan/Centaur program), the earnings accrual rates applied to Contracts in
process, and for those Contracts accounted for under the completed contract
method (Atlas Program), the estimates at completion applied to Contracts in
process, shall, in each case, be identical to those used in the preparation of
the Initial Statement of Net Assets to be Sold (the significant estimate-at-
complete assumptions underlying the Initial Statement of Net Assets to be sold
are reflected in Schedule 4.2);

-18-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

(vi) except with respect to the Atlas Program, make
those adjustments to the earnings accrual rates and estimates at completion
underlying the Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold which are of such a
nature as would under GAAP consistently applied require a change in the cost
estimates at completion;

(vii) eliminate any amount that has been recorded in
any asset account to the extent that the benefits associated with the related
asset cannot be transferred to or realized by Purchaser, including, without
limitation, any amounts (i) intended to reflect potential prospective benefits
of the carryover of losses or of tax benefits or attributes of the Space
Systems Division from periods prior to or ending on or as of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, and (ii) in respect of any insurance policy covering any of the
Assets if such insurance policy and the benefits thereof will not be assigned
or otherwise transferred to the Purchaser at the Closing; provided, however,
that, for the purposes of the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller agree that this
subsection shall not be construed to prevent an amount from being recorded in
an asset account if Purchaser's sole basis for excluding it is that the benefit
will not be realized because the estimates at completion on the Atlas Program
are not sufficiently conservative; and

(viii) eliminate all cash balances, including all
negative cash balances.

The resulting document shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Closing
Statement of Net Assets to be Sold." Seller shall provide to Purchaser in
conjunction with the Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold, the Closing
Reconciling Statement which shall trace, reconcile and explain in reasonable
detail all adjustments made to the Closing Date Balance Sheet in order to
comply with this Section 4.4. The resulting document shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Closing Reconciling Statement."

4.5 Audit. Seller has engaged, or immediately upon execution of
this Agreement shall engage, at Seller's expense, Arthur Andersen to conduct an
examination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards and to issue an unqualified report thereon. Arthur
Andersen's judgment as to the audit scope and materiality threshold for
proposed adjusting entries shall not be restricted by any limitations imposed
by Seller or Purchaser. In addition, Arthur Andersen shall report on the
Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold and attest that the Closing
Statement of Net Assets to be Sold was prepared in accordance with Section 4.4.
Seller shall agree to and shall make any adjustments necessary to (i) the
Closing Date Balance Sheet in order to obtain and deliver to Purchaser as soon
as is practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
Arthur Andersen's unqualified report thereon (except for (a) the going concern
statement and (b) the fact that the Closing Date Balance Sheet contains no
accrual for current federal income taxes and deferred federal and state income
taxes) and (ii) the Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold in order to
obtain and deliver to Purchaser as soon as is practicable, but no later than
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Arthur Andersen's report attesting that

-19-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

the Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold was prepared in accordance with
this Article IV of this Agreement (the "Attestation Report").

4.6 Review of Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold.

(a) For a period of thirty (30) days after the delivery of
the last to be delivered of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and Arthur
Andersen's unqualified report thereon or the Closing Statement of Net Assets to
be Sold and Arthur Andersen's Attestation Report thereon, Purchaser and
Purchaser's independent accountants shall be entitled to review such documents
and submit to Arthur Andersen in writing any suggestions for changes to the
Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold that Purchaser believes are
appropriate in order to cause the Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold to
be prepared in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement. Any
suggestions submitted to Arthur Andersen shall be accompanied by a reasonable
explanation of Purchaser's basis for the suggested change and shall
concurrently be submitted to Seller. Purchaser acknowledges that with respect
to the Space Systems Division's accounting for its Atlas Program, which is
included in the audited Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold, Purchaser
will not challenge the underlying accounting practices that are used for the
Atlas Program, as long as such accounting practices are consistent with those
practices that were used in the preparation of the Initial Statement of Net
Assets to be Sold. For a period of fifteen (15) days after the expiration of
such thirty (30) day period, the parties shall consult with each other and with
Arthur Andersen to determine if any such suggested changes and/or the proposed
responses thereto may be resolved to the mutual satisfaction in writing of each
party hereto. If any such suggested change and/or the proposed responses
thereto shall not have been resolved to the mutual written satisfaction of each
party hereto (the "Unresolved Changes") within such fifteen (15) day period or
such additional period as the parties may mutually agree upon in writing, an
independent auditing firm of recognized national standing (the "Arbiter") shall
be selected by Purchaser and Seller, which shall not be the regular auditing
firm of Purchaser or Seller, to review the Unresolved Changes. The parties
hereto shall present their differences in writing (each party simultaneously
providing to the other a copy of all documents submitted) to the Arbiter and
shall cause the Arbiter promptly to review this Agreement and the Unresolved
Changes and determine, as the Arbiter deems necessary or appropriate, to what
extent the Unresolved Changes are appropriate in order to cause the Closing
Statement of Net Assets to be Sold to be prepared (i) in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied, (ii) on a basis consistent with the Initial Statement of
Net Assets to be Sold, and (iii) in accordance with this Agreement. In
reaching such resolution, the Arbiter shall consider only the Unresolved
Changes, it being understood that the Arbiter shall not be retained to conduct
its own independent audit or review, but rather shall be retained to resolve
specific differences between Purchaser and Seller within the range of such
differences. The resolution by the Arbiter of the Unresolved Changes shall be
reflected in the Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold. Within three (3)
days after the resolution of the Unresolved Changes or, if there were no
Unresolved Changes, within three (3) days after the expiration of the requisite
review period, such Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold (the "Final
Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold") shall be delivered concurrently to

-20-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Purchaser and Seller and shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto.
Purchaser and Seller shall each pay one-half of the costs of the Arbiter.

(b) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in
this Article IV, each party shall cooperate with and make available to the
other party and its auditors and representatives, all information, records,
data, auditors' working papers, and access to its personnel and shall permit
access to its facilities as may be reasonably required in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold, and
the resolution of any Unresolved Changes or other dispute(s) thereunder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) Seller shall permit
Purchaser and its independent accountants and representatives (A) to review all
working papers and computations prepared or used by Seller in preparing such
financial statements and in making any adjustments thereto, (B) to review and
have access to all working papers and computations prepared or used by Arthur
Andersen or any independent accounting firm retained by Seller to review or
assist in the preparation of such financial statements, (C) to observe and
participate in the taking of the physical count of any of the fixed assets,
equipment and inventories of the Space Systems Division deemed necessary by
Arthur Andersen, and (D) to review all Documents and other relevant data of the
Space Systems Division, and (ii) Purchaser shall permit Seller and its
independent public accountants and representatives to (A) review all working
papers and compilations used by Purchaser in reviewing the Closing Statement of
Net Assets to be Sold and in suggesting any proposed adjustments thereto, (B)
have reasonable access to the former employees of Seller who became employees
of Purchaser, (C) to review all working papers used by any independent
accounting firm retained by Purchaser to review or assist in the preparation of
any proposed adjustments, and (D) have reasonable access to the Documents and
other relevant data of the Space Systems Division, in each case, for the
purpose of attempting to resolve the Unresolved Changes. After the Closing,
Purchaser's auditors shall also have access to Arthur Andersen's working papers
for the Final Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold as necessary for the
purpose of providing regular auditing services to the Space Systems Division.

4.7 Adjustment of Purchase Price. If the Final Closing Net
Assets to be Sold are less than the Initial Net Assets to be Sold, Seller shall
pay to Purchaser, as an adjustment to the Purchaser Price, an amount equal to
such difference in the manner and with interest as provided below. If the
Final Closing Net Assets to be Sold exceed the Initial Net Assets to be Sold,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller, as an adjustment to the Purchaser Price, an
amount equal to such excess in the manner and with interest as provided below.
Any such payment pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be made in immediately
available funds within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Final
Closing Statement of the Net Assets to be Sold. The amount of any payment made
pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall bear interest from and including the Closing
Date to, but excluding, the date of payment at the rate per annum equal to the
rate announced by Citibank, N.A. in the City of New York as its base rate as in
effect at the end of the day on the Closing Date.

ARTICLE V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

The following representations and warranties are made by and with
respect to Seller. Each such representation and warranty shall be deemed to
have been made by each of GDC, SSC and CLS in their individual capacities.
Accordingly Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

5.1 Organization and Authority of Seller. Seller is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation with full power and authority,
corporate and otherwise, to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as and where presently conducted, to enter into and to perform
its obligations under this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Seller is required by virtue of the nature and characteristics of the
assets, business and operations of the Space Systems Division to be duly
qualified or otherwise authorized to do business as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction set forth in Schedule 5.1, and Seller is so qualified and in
good standing in each such jurisdiction.

5.2 Authorization of Agreements. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements by Seller
have been duly authorized by all necessary action, corporate or otherwise, of
Seller, and this Agreement has been, and each of the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is a party will be, duly executed and delivered by Seller and this
Agreement constitutes, and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party when executed will constitute, the valid and binding obligation of
Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium, and
other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or
in equity).

5.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party by
Seller and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
do not and will not (with or without the giving of notice or the passage of
time or both) (a) conflict with the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
Seller or, except as set forth in Schedule 5.3, conflict with, or result in the
breach or termination of, or constitute a default under, (1) any Authorization
or Contracts or (2) any order, judgment, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental authority, foreign or domestic, to which Seller is a party or by
which it or any of its assets or properties are bound; (b) constitute a
violation of any law, statute or regulation of any governmental authority,

-22-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

domestic or foreign, applicable to Seller; or (c) result in the creation of any
lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the assets or properties of the Space
Systems Division.

5.4 Consents. No consent, approval or authorization of, or
designation, declaration or filing with, any governmental authority or other
third party is required on the part of Seller in connection with Seller's
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party, except for (a) any required filings with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act
and due expiration of the waiting period (including any extensions) thereunder,
(b) any novations required in connection with Government Contracts, (c) any
filings required under the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual for
Safeguarding Classified Information (the "DoD Manual"), (d) any filings
required under United States Export Control Laws, (e) those consents or
approvals which are listed in Schedules 3.1(b) and 5.4 and (f) consents under
Contracts (other than any Government Contract), which Contracts individually or
in the aggregate are not material to the Business.

5.5 Financial Statements. (a) Seller has delivered to
Purchaser balance sheets and statements of operations for the Business as at
and for the periods ended December 31, 1991, December 31, 1992 and August 29,
1993 (collectively, the "Financial Statements"), copies of which are attached
to Schedule 5.5(a) hereto. All such Financial Statements have been prepared
based upon the books and records of the Space Systems Division in conformity
with GAAP consistently applied (except for changes, if any, required by GAAP
and disclosed therein). Such statements of operations present fairly the
results of operations of the Business for the periods covered, and the balance
sheets present fairly the financial condition of the Business as of their
respective dates. The August 29, 1993 Financial Statements reflect all
adjustments (which consist only of normal recurring adjustments or adjustments
not material in amount and include, but are not limited to, estimated
provisions for year-end adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation. Seller
has made available to Purchaser copies of each management letter or other
letter delivered to Seller by Arthur Andersen relating to any review by Arthur
Andersen of the other matters of the Business during the five-year period ended
December 31, 1992 or thereafter. Since December 31, 1992, there has been no
change in any of the significant accounting policies, practices or procedures
of Seller as they relate to the Business.

(b) The August Balance Sheet, the Initial Statement of Net
Assets to be Sold and the Initial Reconciling Statement have been prepared in
accordance with the provisions of Article IV of this Agreement.

(c) Set forth in Schedule 5.5(c) is a complete and correct
list of all Atlas Program and Contract cost reserves (i.e., reserves provided
for in Seller's estimates at completion), reserves for warranties, and reserves
for defective pricing maintained by Seller with respect to the Space Systems
Division as of the date of the Initial Statement of Net Assets to be Sold, and
disclosure of any change in such reserves between the date of the Initial
Statement of Net Assets to be Sold and the Closing Date.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

5.6 Forecasts. Notwithstanding any disclaimers to the contrary
(whether oral or in writing) made by or on behalf of Seller, all forward
looking statements (including, but not limited to, forecasts and projections of
revenues, cash flow, income or losses, capital expenditures, or other financial
items, management plans and objectives for future operations, statements of
future economic performance, and statements of the assumptions underlying or
relating to any of the foregoing), contained in the items identified on
Schedule 5.6, were based upon grounds which, to Seller's Knowledge, were
reasonable when made and were disclosed to Purchaser in good faith.

5.7 Absence of Certain Developments. Since August 29, 1993,
there has not been any material adverse change in the business, condition
(financial or otherwise), revenues, earnings, assets, prospects or results of
operations of the Space Systems Division, other than changes in the prospects
of the Space Systems Division resulting from a General Industry Development.

5.8 Material Contracts. (a) All Contracts of Seller which
relate to the Space Systems Division are in full force and effect and are
valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms, except to the
extent that the failure, individually or in the aggregate, of any Contract to
be valid, binding and enforceable would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Space Systems Division, and subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity). Schedule 5.8(a)(1) sets forth a complete and
correct list of all Contracts which contain an obligation on the part of Seller
to pay more than $1 million, to which Seller is a party relating to the Space
Systems Division, excluding Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business relating to products and services provided or to be provided by Seller
to customers of the Space Systems Division (which Contracts are covered by
Section 5.14). Except as set forth in Schedule 5.8(a)(2), there are no
defaults or threatened defaults by Seller under any Contract or, to the best of
Seller's knowledge, by any other party under a Contract, other than such
default or defaults under a Contract (other than a Government Contract) which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Space Systems Division.

(b) Except as set forth in Schedules 5.8(b)(1) through
(b)(9), Seller neither has participated in, nor is bound by or subject to: (1)
any employment, consulting, sales representative or similar Contract relating
to the Space Systems Division which is not terminable without penalty or
further obligation on the part of Seller within 30 days or which contains an
obligation to pay more than $98,000 per year; (2) any Contract which could
result in the imposition on any Person of an excise tax under Section 4999 of
the Code; (3) any Contract of guarantee or indemnification by Seller on behalf
of the Space Systems Division running to any Person which involves,
individually or in the aggregate, an amount of more than $100,000; (4) any
indebtedness of Seller on behalf of the Space Systems Division for borrowed

-24-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

money; (5) any indebtedness of whatsoever nature (including, without
limitation, open account indebtedness) to any Affiliate of Seller or any
Contract with or to any Affiliate of Seller; (6) any Contract containing any
covenant limiting the freedom of Seller in respect of the business or
operations of the Space Systems Division to engage in any line of business or
compete with any Person or in any geographic area; (7) any Contract relating
to the disposition or acquisition of the assets of, or any interest in, any
business enterprise which relates to the Space Systems Division; (8) any

5.8(b)(8) and involving future payments which, together with future payments
under all other Contracts relating to the same capital project, exceed
$100,000; or (9) except for Contracts entered into with customers and suppliers
of the Space Systems Division in the ordinary course of business, any other
Contract which relates to the Space Systems Division and which involves
$100,000 or more and which is not cancelable without penalty within 30 days.

(c) Seller has made available or delivered to Purchaser
complete and correct copies of all Contracts of Seller that relate to the Space
Systems Division, together with all amendments thereto, which involve $98,000
or more.

(d) Schedule 5.8(d) sets forth all bids, proposals or
quotations made by the Space Systems Division and which were outstanding as of
August 29, 1993 (which shall be updated as of the Closing Date). Schedule
5.8(d) identifies each such bid, proposal or quotation by number and the party
to which such bid, proposal or quotation was made, the proposed price and
Seller's current assessment of profit or loss at completion for each such bid,
proposal or quotation. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.8(d), there are no
outstanding bids, proposals or quotations made by the Space Systems Division
for which the total costs estimated at the time of the bid, including allocable
overhead and general and administrative expenses, as estimated in good faith by
Seller, would result in a net loss on the applicable Contract.

5.9 Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Schedule 5.9(a) contains a
complete and correct list of all Employee Benefit Plans and any other employee
benefit arrangements or payroll practices, including, without limitation,
employment agreements, severance agreements, executive compensation
arrangements, incentive programs or arrangements, sick leave, vacation pay,

Business, maintained by Seller or to which Seller has contributed or is or was
obligated to make payments, in each case with respect to any employees (or, if
the Seller has any existing liability, former employees) of Seller who are
employed in the Space Systems Division (hereinafter, the "GD Employee Benefit
Plans"). All Employee Pension Plans maintained by Seller, or to which Seller
has contributed or is obligated to contribute, in each case with respect to any
employees of Seller who are employed in the Space Systems Division

has occurred with respect to the operation of the GD Savings Plans which could
cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any
material liability, penalty, or tax under ERISA or the Code;

(2) to Seller's Knowledge, no GD Employee Benefit
Plans have been amended in any manner which would require the posting of a
security under Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or Section 307 of ERISA;

(3) there are no Multiemployer Plans or Multiple
Employer Plans in which employees of the Space Systems Division currently
participate or have participated in within the last five (5) years;

(5) to Seller's Knowledge, there are no material
pending claims or lawsuits which have been asserted or instituted against the
GD Employee Benefit Plans, the assets of any of the trusts under such plans or
the plan sponsor or the plan administrator, or against any fiduciary of the GD
Employee Benefit Plans (other than routine benefit claims) nor does Seller have
knowledge of facts which could form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit;

(6) all amendments and actions required to bring the
GD Savings Plans into conformity in all material respects with all of the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable laws
(including the rules and regulations thereunder) have been made or taken except
to the extent that such amendments or actions are not required by law to be
made or taken until a date after the Closing Date and are disclosed on Schedule
5.9(b)(6);

currently conducted without cost to Purchaser in collection efforts therefor
except to the extent of any applicable reserves provided for in the Closing
Statement of Net Assets to be Sold.

complete and correct copies of (i) the deeds for the Owned Properties and (ii)
the Leases, other than the Leases on Schedule 1(B) hereto, as the same have
been amended, modified or supplemented, have been delivered to Purchaser by
Seller. Seller or an Affiliate of Seller has (x) good, marketable and
insurable fee simple title to all Owned Properties and (y) good, marketable,
insurable (where recorded) and valid leasehold estates in all Leased Properties
(Owned Property and Leased Property are sometimes referred to as a "Seller

Properties is free and clear of all Liens and encumbrances of any nature except
(A) Liens and encumbrances set forth on Schedule 5.20(a)(v), (B) Liens for

5.20(b), a "material" default means any (x) monetary default or (y) non-
monetary default that cannot be cured by expenditure of $50,000 or less. No
previous or current party to any such Lease has furnished notice to Seller of
or made a claim against Seller with respect to any breach or default thereunder
which, if not cured, would prevent or materially interfere with the ability of
Purchaser to continue to use such Leased Properties in the manner currently
used.

the extent otherwise disclosed by Seller elsewhere in this Agreement or on
Schedule 5.20(d), each Owned Property and each Leased Property complies in all
material respects, with all applicable Laws (including, without limitation,

improvements included within the Owned Properties, including, without
limitation, the roofs and structural elements thereof and the sprinkler and

the Owned Properties. All water, gas, electrical, steam, compressed air,
telecommunication, sanitary and storm sewage lines and systems and other
similar systems serving the Owned Properties are installed and operating and
are sufficient to enable the Owned Properties to continue to be used and
operated in the manner currently being used and operated. As of the Closing

conditions thereof in all material respects. No default or violation, or event
that with the lapse of time or giving of notice or both would become a default
or violation, has occurred in the due observance of any Authorization. All
such Authorizations are in full force and effect and do not require further
consent or approval of any Person. Seller has not received any notice from any
governmental entity and has no knowledge to the effect that there is lacking
any Authorization required in connection with the current or continued use or
operation of any Owned Property or Leased Property.

(l) No labor has been performed or material furnished for
any portion of any Owned Property or Leased Property to or for the benefit of
Seller or, to Seller's knowledge, any other Person for which any Lien, the

$50,000 in the aggregate can be claimed.

(m) No improvements constituting a part of any Owned
Property or Leased Property encroach on real property not a part of the Assets,

and operation of such improvements.

provided that all necessary consents required by such Lease are obtained prior
to the Closing.

Schedule 3.1(b)) which relate to the business or operations of the Space
Systems Division or the Assets and which by their terms can be transferred.

7.4 HSR Act Compliance. Each party hereto hereby agrees with
each other party hereto that, with respect to each reportable transaction to
which it is a party, each will, as soon as reasonably practicable, take all
action (to the extent not previously taken) necessary in order to file with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice all filings, reports and
other information required under the HSR Act in order to commence the running
of the waiting period thereunder, to continue the running of said waiting
period (including any extensions) and prevent or minimize any tolling thereof,
to cause such waiting period to expire without enforcement action, and to
provide to each other such cooperation as may be reasonably necessary in order
to cause such filings and reports to be prepared and duly filed and all waiting
periods to expire. Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall require Purchaser
to divest or hold separate any of its Properties or any of the Assets, or to
accept any conditions, limitations or restrictions on the business or
operations of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Business
acquired pursuant to this Agreement, which Purchaser determines, in its sole
discretion, to be unacceptable.

and the Closing Date, each party hereto shall inform the other parties hereto
promptly upon obtaining knowledge of any pending or threatened litigation or
other fact or event which may reasonably be anticipated to (i) prevent, delay

Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") Section42.1204, Seller and Purchaser are
required to enter into a novation agreement or agreements with the U.S.
Government. Seller and Purchaser will cooperate fully with each other and will
use all reasonable efforts to obtain the assignment or the novation of all
Government Contracts, and Seller hereby agrees expeditiously to take all steps
necessary to file and to use its best efforts to obtain approvals of all

-48-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

required novations or assignments, including the provision of the guarantee of
performance required for novation of contracts pursuant to FAR Sections
42.1201, 42.1204(d)(3), and 42.1204(e). Nothing in this Agreement, however,
shall require (i) Seller or Purchaser to pay any consideration for any such
assignment or novation, or (ii) Purchaser to accept any conditions,
requirements, amendments or limitations (other than those contained in the
underlying contract) which Purchaser determines, in its sole discretion, to be
unacceptable.

(c) With respect to any Government Contracts that cannot be
assigned to Purchaser or novated on the Closing Date, the performance
obligations of Seller thereunder shall, unless not permitted by such Government
Contract, be deemed to be subcontracted or delegated to Purchaser until such
Government Contract has been assigned or novated. Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, as a subcontractor or delegate, shall perform such Government
Contracts and Seller shall, as soon as practicable, pay over to Purchaser in
full any amounts received by Seller as a result of performance by Purchaser of
such Government Contracts. Prior to the assignment or novation of such
Government Contracts to Purchaser, Seller, as the contracting party, shall take
such timely action as is reasonably necessary to allow Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries to perform such Government Contracts and to protect any rights
that may exist or accrue under such Government Contracts until they are
assigned or novated. In connection therewith, Purchaser or its Subsidiaries is
authorized to act as agent on behalf of Seller for purposes of performing and
administering Contracts and subcontracts during the period after the Closing
until such Contracts and subcontracts are novated or assigned to Purchaser;
provided, however, such authority to act as agent shall not authorize Purchaser
to settle or compromise claims under such Contracts or subcontracts where such
claims are not Assumed Liabilities. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller
and its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents and assigns harmless
from any loss which directly results from any action Purchaser takes pursuant
to the grant of authority to act as agent provided in the preceding sentence.

(d) Effective upon the assignment or novation of a
Government Contract to Purchaser, the Government Contract shall be assumed by
Purchaser provided that Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for any monetary
benefit received by Seller (net of any actual out-of-pocket costs of Seller in
connection with such Government Contract) that would have accrued to Purchaser
had the Government Contract been assigned or novated as of the Closing Date.
Any subcontract or other delegation which Seller and Purchaser have theretofore
entered into or agreed upon in respect of such Government Contract shall be
terminated as of the effective date of such assignment or novation.

(e) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other to
preserve all bids, quotations and proposals made in the ordinary course of
business by the Space Systems Division and to facilitate the award thereof
consistent with applicable legal requirements. Any contracts awarded to Seller
pursuant to such bids, quotations and proposals shall be deemed to be assumed
and, in the case of Contracts with the U.S. Government, shall be deemed to be

-49-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

"Government Contracts" for purposes of this Agreement and shall be governed by
this Section 7.6.

7.7 [Intentionally Omitted]

7.8 Noncompete.

(a) For a period of five years after the Closing Date,
Seller shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to: (i) cause, induce or
encourage any employees of the Space Systems Division who are or become
employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates to leave such employment; (ii) cause,
induce or encourage any material actual or prospective customer, supplier,
manufacturer or licensor of the Space Systems Division, or any other Person who
has a business relationship with Seller which is material to the Space Systems
Division, to terminate or change any such actual or prospective relationship in
a manner which would be adverse to the Space Systems Division; or (iii)
conduct, participate or engage, directly or indirectly, in any business
involving the design, development, production, processing, sale and launching
of expendable launch vehicles and upper stage rockets, other advanced space
programs or energy and magnetics programs (excluding, however, energy and
magnetic programs as they relate to the principal business of the Seller's
Electric Boat and Land Systems divisions), or support of any product or any
business that is competitive with the Space Systems Division, as conducted on
the Closing Date, anywhere in the world (a "Restricted Business"); provided,
that the restrictions contained in this Section 7.8 shall not restrict the
acquisition by Seller, directly or indirectly, of less than 5% of the capital
stock of any Person engaged in a Restricted Business nor shall they restrict
the business conducted by an entity with or into which Seller may merge or be
consolidated or which acquires all or substantially all of Seller's assets,
provided such activity was conducted by such entity on or prior to the date of
such merger, consolidation or acquisition.

(b) The covenants and undertakings contained in this
Section 7.8 relate to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary
character and a violation of any of the terms of this Section 7.8 will cause
irreparable injury to Purchaser, the amount of which will be impossible to
estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Therefore,
Purchaser will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other
equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any
breach of this Section 7.8. The rights and remedies provided by this Section
7.8 are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which
Purchaser may have hereunder or at law or in equity. In the event that
Purchaser were to seek damages for any breach of this Section 7.8, the portion
of the consideration delivered to Seller hereunder which is attributed by the
parties to the foregoing covenant shall not be considered a measure of or limit
on such damages.

(c) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of
competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment determines that a
specified time period, a specified geographical area, specified business
limitation or any other relevant feature of this Section 7.8 is unreasonable,
arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time period, geographical

-50-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

area, business limitation or other relevant feature which is determined to be
reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced against
the applicable party.

7.9 Non-Solicitation. If this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof (other than by virtue of a default or failure to
perform by Seller), for a period of one year after the date of such
termination, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to
induce or encourage any employees of the Business to leave such employment
(provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to responses to or
follow-up hiring in respect of general solicitations or advertisements for job
positions not specifically directed to employees of the Space Systems Division
or the Business).

7.10 Certain Payments to Employees. Seller shall make whatever
payments may become due, and satisfy any and all claims or liabilities that may
exist, now or in the future, in connection with or arising out of any
agreements of Seller or its Affiliates with any of their current or former
employees concerning compensation for inventions, such as, without limitation,
that provided in paragraph 2(f) of the General Dynamics Proprietary Information
and Invention Agreement, form 86 221 R1 (GDP Form 3-243).

7.11 Use of Stationery, etc. To the extent that any stationery,
checks or other printed materials acquired by Purchaser pursuant hereto shall
contain the name "General Dynamics," "Convair" or the name of any Affiliate of
Seller, Purchaser may continue to use such materials until the earlier to occur
of (i) the date that is six months after the Closing Date and (ii) the date on
which the existing supply thereof shall be exhausted, and neither Seller nor
any Affiliate of Seller shall prohibit or bring any action to enjoin the use of
such materials by Purchaser. In addition, Purchaser may retain for six months
after the Closing Date and then shall remove, all exterior signs bearing the
name "General Dynamics" or "Convair" on any of the real Property or buildings
which constitute Assets.

7.12 Administration of Accounts. (a) All payments and
reimbursements made in the ordinary course by any third party in the name of
or to Seller in connection with or arising out of the Assets and Assumed
Liabilities after the Closing Date shall be held by Seller in trust to the
benefit of Purchaser and, immediately upon receipt by Seller of any such
payment or reimbursement, Seller shall pay over to Purchaser the amount of such
payment or reimbursement without right of set off.

(b) All payments and reimbursements made in the ordinary
course by any third party in the name of or to Purchaser in connection with or
arising out of the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities after the Closing
Date shall be held by Purchaser in trust to the benefit of Seller and,

Purchaser as soon as practicable after the end of the period a balance sheet
and statement of operations for the Business as at and for the period ended

Division (the "Audited Financial Statements") in Purchaser's filings under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1993 Act") and the Securities Exchange

transactions consummated under this Agreement, Seller, with the cooperation of
the Purchaser, shall promptly, and in any event within sixty (60) days after

(iii) will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
information contained therein not misleading. Seller agrees, from time to time
upon the request of the Purchaser, to take such actions and provide to Arthur
Andersen and Purchaser such certificates, documents and other information as
may be necessary or appropriate to obtain the consent of Arthur Andersen to
include the Audited Financial Statements and the opinion of Arthur Andersen in
respect thereof in the Purchaser's filings under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act,
including any filings on Form 8-K.

by Purchaser):

(a) Representations and Warranties of Seller. All
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement and in all

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

its representatives pursuant to this Agreement and/or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be true, complete and accurate in all

Purchaser, reflect in a material adverse way on the Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities, or the results of operations or the financial condition of the
Space Systems Division, or the Space Systems Division's business, prospects,
assets, liabilities (absolute, contingent or otherwise) or reserves, or
Purchaser's ability to conduct the business and operations of the Space Systems
Division as such is presently conducted, Purchaser may, by written notice to
Seller within twenty five (25) days after the date of this Agreement, terminate
this Agreement.

(e) No Injunctions or Litigation, etc.; Compliance. (1)

Purchaser to conduct the business presently carried
on by the Space Systems Division after Closing or (iii) seek to compel

policy and other matters will be resolved with the U.S. Government such that
Purchaser will be able to realize the benefits that Purchaser anticipates will
occur as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; provided, however, that this
condition shall be considered not satisfied and this Agreement shall
automatically terminate pursuant to this subsection 8.1(l) unless, within sixty

-54-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

progress is being made toward receipt of the assurances necessary for Purchaser

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) to the extension of the sixty (60)
day period provided for in this subsection for an additional thirty (30) days;
and, provided further, that if Seller properly withholds its consent, Seller
will provide written notice of such decision within two (2) Business Days after
receipt of Purchaser's notice and Purchaser may waive this condition by
providing notice of such waiver to Seller within two (2) Business Days after

and CLS, in each case in an amount sufficient to satisfy Seller's mission
risks/ refund obligations in full with respect to such launch service programs
for a premium amount not in excess of $52,000,000 for each launch service
program, which premium amount Purchaser agrees is for the account of the Space
Systems Division and will be the responsibility of Purchaser after the Closing.
If the risk guarantee coverage premiums are in excess of $52,000,000 per launch
service program, Seller may satisfy this condition, at its option, by providing
adequate evidence or assurances to Purchaser that Seller has paid or will pay
all risks guarantee coverage premium amounts in excess of $52,000,000 per
launch service program.

former employees receiving or eligible to receive short-term or long-term
disability benefits (such employees being hereafter referred to as the

Section 11.2 or any applicable Law, Purchaser shall honor any pre-existing
recall rights, reinstatement rights or rights to reemployment of any inactive
or former employee of the Seller's Business existing at the time of Closing,
provided that any such inactive or former employee reinstated or reemployed by
the Purchaser shall be treated as an Employee only upon the effective date of
such recall, reinstatement or reemployment.

(b) The Employees who are covered by collective bargaining
agreements shall be referred to herein as "Transferred Union Employees". The
Employees who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements shall be

reasonable access to data before and after the Closing (including computer data

-60-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

and personnel records) regarding the ages, dates of hire, benefits,
compensation and job description of Employees. Seller will provide Purchaser
with reasonable opportunities to enter into discussions with and to advise any
of the Employees concerning the terms of any future employment of such
individuals by Purchaser and will permit Purchaser reasonable access to
Employees for such purpose. Seller shall not discourage any Employees from
accepting an offer of employment, if any, made by Purchaser to such Employee.
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in preparing and disbursing materials
concerning the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the effect of the
transaction upon the Employees' employment or the terms or conditions of the
Employees' employment. Seller and Purchaser will provide each other with
reasonable opportunity to review any written materials and to attend any
scheduled meetings concerning the foregoing.

(d) Except with respect to the Assumed Liabilities, Seller and
Purchaser agree that matters arising out of or relating to the terms and
conditions of the employment of employees or former employees of the Space

Plans prior to the Closing Date) are the exclusive responsibility of Seller and
that matters arising out of or relating to the terms and conditions of the
employment of Transferred Employees while employed by Purchaser on or after the

Purchaser on or after the Closing Date) are the exclusive responsibility of
Purchaser. For the purposes of this Agreement, those liabilities of the Space
Systems Division constituting Assumed Liabilities by virtue of clause (vi) of

Schedule 1(A); (viii) long-term disability benefits and associated medical
benefits payable under the GD Employee Benefit Plans to employees or former
employees of the Space Systems Division as described in Schedule 1(A); and (ix)
any incurred but not reported expenses of Employees arising from GD Employee
Benefit Plans that are reserved for on the Closing Statement of Net Assets to
be Sold and not otherwise described in this Section 11.1(d); provided, however,
that in the case of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vii), (viii) and (ix),
the Assumed Liabilities in each case shall not exceed the reserve for such item
on the Closing Statement of Net Assets to be Sold.

11.2 Collective Bargaining Agreements. At Closing, Purchaser
shall assume until their scheduled expiration dates, the collective bargaining
agreements listed on Schedule 5.22, except to the extent it would be
impracticable for Purchaser to assume or duplicate Seller's benefit plans under
such agreements, in which event Purchaser shall establish and provide subject
to the agreement of affected labor organizations, comparable substitute
benefits, provided, however, that Purchaser explicitly reserves the right to

-61-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

renegotiate such collective bargaining agreements prior to or upon the
expiration thereof. To the extent pension benefits have accrued prior to the
Closing Date in accordance with the collective bargaining agreements and the
plans as of the Closing Date, such benefits will be provided by the Seller in
the GD Employee Pension Plans. To the extent pension benefits accrue
subsequent to the Closing Date in accordance with the collective bargaining
agreements, such benefits will be provided by the Purchaser in its designated
plans. Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser prior to the Closing Date in
Purchaser's efforts to reach agreement with affected labor organizations with
respect to providing comparable substitute benefits. Except with respect to
the Assumed Liabilities, Seller (and not Purchaser) shall be solely liable and
shall indemnify Purchaser from any Damages as a result of any claims incurred
prior to the Closing Date by any employee of the Business or retiree arising
under the collective bargaining agreements listed on Schedule 5.22, as well as
any claims arising under any predecessor collective bargaining agreements
covering the bargaining units that include the Transferred Union Employees.

11.3 Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Benefits.

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser will make
available to Transferred Employees who were at least 55 years of age with five
years of service or who were 50 years of age or older with at least 70 age plus
"service" points on July 1, 1993, in the case of Transferred Non-Union
Employees, and on January 1, 1994, in the case of Transferred Union Employees,
a post-retirement medical plan (or plans) which provides medical benefits to
Transferred Employees (and their dependents) who retire on or after the Closing
Date until such retired Transferred Employees reach age 65 (the "Pre-Medicare
Plan"). Subject to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement listed on
Schedule 5.22, participants in such Pre-Medicare Plan will be required to
contribute towards the cost of such plan. The Pre-Medicare Plan will be
subject to the right of the Purchaser to modify or terminate benefits under
such plan at any time. Other than with respect to Transferred Employees
eligible for the Pre-Medicare Plan (and their dependents), Purchaser shall have
no obligation to provide any post-retirement or post-employment medical
insurance benefits to any Employee. Purchaser shall have no obligation to
provide post-retirement or post-employment life insurance benefits. Seller
shall be solely liable and shall indemnify Purchaser for any Damages as a
result of any claims made by any employee or former employee of the Business or
any beneficiary thereof for post-employment or post-retirement medical or life
insurance benefits arising under or relating to the plans maintained by Seller
as of the Closing Date or prior to the Closing Date.

(b) In the event that an individual not covered by a
collective bargaining agreement (i) retires from Seller on or after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) subsequently commences
employment with Purchaser, such individual will permanently cease receiving
post-retirement medical benefits from Seller. Seller will advise such
individuals of this condition before any such employee elects to retire.

(c) Seller shall provide complete and adequate notice to
the Employees regarding the effect of their becoming Transferred Employees on

-62-

<PAGE>

the benefits provided or promised to them by Seller or under any of the GD
Employee Benefit Plans including the ability of eligible employees to retire
from Seller and receive post-retirement medical benefits prior to the Closing
Date. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in coordinating communications to
the Employees.

11.4 Health and Welfare Benefits for Active Employees.

(a) For each of the employee medical, life insurance or
disability plans included on Schedule 5.9 (other than post-retirement and post-
employment medical and life insurance which shall be governed by Section 11.3),
the Purchaser shall adopt, subject to any applicable collective bargaining
agreement listed on Schedule 5.22, as of the Closing Date comparable employee
medical, life insurance and disability plans, and to the extent required by any
collective bargaining agreements assumed pursuant to Section 11.2, other
welfare plans. Seller shall provide Purchaser all reasonable assistance which
Purchaser may request in establishing such plans, including assistance in
duplicating or transferring contracts applicable to such benefits. If any such
contracts cannot be duplicated or transferred to Purchaser by the Closing Date,
Seller shall assist Purchaser until the end of 1994 in administering the plans
and obtaining the duplicate or transferrable contracts. Seller shall provide
Purchaser with administrative and payroll services through its financial
services company in accordance with the terms of the Services Agreement for a
period not to last beyond the earlier to occur of (i) the expiration of the
respective Facility Leases, or (ii) Purchaser no longer has employees at the
Kearny Mesa Facility. Seller shall be entitled to reasonable compensation from
Purchaser with respect to the rendition of such assistance. Any benefits
adopted by Purchaser shall be subject to the right of the Purchaser to modify
or terminate such benefits at any time. With respect to medical, life
insurance and disability benefits offered by Purchaser to Transferred
Employees, Purchaser shall credit the Transferred Employees with service with
Seller for purposes of eligibility for such health and welfare benefits and
with expenses incurred in 1994 for purposes of meeting annual deductible and
out of pocket expense limitations in 1994 under Purchaser's plans; provided,
however, that such plans may contain, in the discretion of Purchaser,
exclusions for pre-existing conditions as were applicable under the plans
provided to such Transferred Employees by Seller before the Closing Date. Any
benefits provided pursuant to this Section 11.4 by Purchaser to Transferred
Employees will apply only to claims incurred by Transferred Employees on or
after the Closing Date, and, except with respect to the Assumed Liabilities,
Purchaser shall have no liability for costs and expenses related to those
claims incurred prior to the Closing Date.

(b) The parties agree that for purposes of providing
welfare benefit continuation coverage pursuant to the provisions of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, welfare benefit plan
coverage under Purchaser's plans will be considered to have commenced on the
Closing Date and all eligible individuals will not be considered to have lost
coverage under Seller's plans on the Closing Date.

<PAGE>

(c) To the extent assets have been accumulated in
connection with any GD Employee Benefit Plans as of the Closing Date, Seller
shall transfer or cause to be transferred to the Purchaser the allocable
portion of the balance existing as of the Closing Date in any trust, voluntary
employee beneficiary association, reserve, premium stabilization account or
other similar account or arrangement established by Seller or any other Person
and which is attributable to the Assumed Liabilities. The transfer shall take
place as soon as practicable but in no event later than December 31, 1994.
Seller shall permit Purchaser to review the process by which it determines,
based on the balance existing as of the Closing Date, the allocable share
attributable to the Assumed Liabilities and shall provide Purchaser with access
to all documentation requested by Purchaser to verify that the allocable share
has been properly determined. In the event Purchaser and Seller do not agree
on the allocable share, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly engage an
independent enrolled actuary to make a determination within sixty (60) days of
the engagement as to the proper allocable share. The conclusion of the
independent enrolled actuary shall be binding on Purchaser and Seller.
Purchaser and Seller shall share equally the cost of the actuary.

11.5 Pension Benefits.

(a) As of the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause each
Employee to become 100% vested in his accrued benefits in each pension plan (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) maintained by Seller (and where applicable
each collective bargaining agreement assumed by the Purchaser in accordance
with Section 11.2) with respect to each Employee. Seller shall amend its plans
to credit each Employee's service on or after the Closing Date with the
Purchaser and age attained after the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility
for early retirement benefits. Following notification to Purchaser, Seller
shall seek the consent of the representative of each collective bargaining unit
identified in Schedule 5.22 of its intent to vest employee pension benefits in
accordance with Section 11.5. Seller shall retain all liabilities attributable
to accrued benefits under its pension plans (whether qualified or
nonqualified), and within six months after the Closing Date, shall provide
Purchaser a listing of the service credited and the vested benefits payable to
each Employee under the terms of such plans (including the portion attributable
to retiree medical benefits). At the same time, Seller also shall provide each
Transferred Employee with a statement of his vested accrued benefits.
Purchaser shall have no liability of any kind with respect to pension benefits
accrued under Seller's Plans.

(b) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish a
pension plan (or plans), or designate an existing pension plan (or plans),
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code to cover Transferred
Employees (the "Purchaser's Plans"). Purchaser's Plans will contain such terms
as Purchaser may determine in its sole discretion (subject to the terms of
applicable collective bargaining agreements) and will provide for benefits
based on service with Purchaser on or after the Closing Date, except that the
Purchaser's Plans shall recognize service by Transferred Employees with the
Seller prior to the Closing Date for purposes of vesting and participation.

11.6 Savings Plans.

(a) As of the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause each
Employee to become 100% vested in his account balance in each savings, thrift
or 401(k) plan maintained by Seller with respect to each Employee. Following
notification to Purchaser, Seller shall seek the consent of the representative
of each collective bargaining unit identified in Schedule 5.22 of its intent to
vest employees in their account balances in accordance with this Section 11.6.

(b) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or
designate an existing individual account plan (or plans) intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code to cover each Transferred Employee.
Purchaser's plans shall permit Transferred Employees who receive a distribution
(as defined in Section 402(f)(2)(A) of the Code) from Seller's Plans to make a
direct rollover in accordance with Section 401(a)(31) of the Code of the cash
portion of such distribution to a plan designated or established pursuant to
this Section 11.6(b).

11.7 Procedural Matters.

(a) Commencing with the date hereof, the Seller shall make
reasonably available to Purchaser and its agents, employees, accountants and
other representatives, such actuarial, financial, personnel and other benefit-
related information as may be requested by Purchaser, including but not limited
to benefit records, employment histories, policies, interpretations, insurance,
service contracts and other related records needed for the administration of
Purchaser's plans.

(b) Purchaser and Seller agree that the flexible spending
accounts on behalf of Transferred Employees will be maintained throughout 1994
in a manner that ensures that each Transferred Employee receives no more and no
less than he would have received had the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not occurred.

11.8 Incentive Closing Agreements. Seller shall be solely
responsible for the liabilities under any incentive closing agreements entered
into between Seller and employees of the Space Systems Division. Seller has
delivered to Purchaser a letter dated December 21, 1993 (which letter is hereby
incorporated by reference herein) which sets forth a complete and accurate list
of all such incentive closing agreements.

11.9 Indemnification.

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from
any Damages it may incur with respect to any claims of, or liabilities or
obligations to, Transferred Employees or employees (including former employees)
of Seller arising out of or relating to the terms and conditions of their
employment during their employment with Seller prior to the Closing Date

-65-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

whether such claim is made before or after the Closing Date, including, but not
limited to, claims arising out of any GD Employee Benefit Plans), except to the
extent the Damages arise from (i) Purchaser's failure to perform its
obligations under this Article XI (including Damages relating to the Assumed
Liabilities), applicable Law, or collective bargaining agreements assumed by
Purchaser pursuant to 11.2 or (ii) Purchaser's Plans explicitly provide for
benefits based on service prior to the Closing Date; provided however, that
nothing in Section 11.9 shall modify or expand the indemnification contained in
Sections 11.2 or 11.3.

(b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from
any Damages it may incur with respect to any claims of, or liabilities or
obligations to, Transferred Employees arising out of or related to the terms
and conditions of their employment during their employment with Purchaser after
the Closing Date, including, but not limited to, claims arising out of any
employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser unless the Damages result from
(i) Seller failing to perform its obligations under the incentive closing
agreements referred to in Section 11.8 or (ii) incorrect data provided to
Purchaser by Seller under Section 11.7.

11.10 Intellectual Property. Seller shall cooperate with
Purchaser in communicating terms and conditions of employment for Employees
being hired by Purchaser, including advising the Employees that their current
agreements with Seller or its Affiliates concerning proprietary information and
inventions (such as the General Dynamics Proprietary Information and Invention
Agreements, Form 86-221 R1 (GDP Form 3-243)) shall not apply to their
employment relationship with Purchaser, and that all Employees, whether or not
they signed such agreements with Seller, upon becoming Transferred Employees,
shall be required to sign a new agreement containing provisions concerning
inventions, patents and other intellectual property.

of Sections 5.9, 5.10, 5.11, and 5.14(b)(1) through (b)(5), shall survive

deemed to be waived or otherwise affected by any prior knowledge of, or any
investigation made by or on behalf of, any party hereto.

12.2 Indemnification.

(a) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, and their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents, from and against any and all Damages arising out of,
based upon or with respect to: (1) the failure of any representation or
warranty made by Purchaser herein to have been true and correct in all respects

or the operation of the Business (including, without limitation, the design,
manufacture and assembly of products or the provision of services, the leasing
of property (real and personal), the incurrence of commitments and obligations,
the employment of persons, the provision of services and the giving of
warranties and warnings) by Purchaser after the Closing Date, except for the
Excluded Liabilities. Purchaser shall also fully and promptly pay, perform,
discharge, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller, and its respective
directors and officers, from and against any and all Loss or Damages arising
out of, based upon or attributable to any Environmental Claim or Remedial
Action which is attributable to (but only to the extent attributable to) the
operations of the Facilities or the act or omission of Purchaser following the
Closing, including without limitation, any investigation, remediation or
removal of any Contaminant; provided, however, that the indemnity provided in
this sentence shall not be assignable by Seller.

(b) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents, from and against any and all Damages arising out of,
based upon or with respect to: (1) the failure of any representation or

Section 11.9, (B) Section 5.18 to the extent indemnification therefor is
available under Section 12.2(d), (C) Section 5.11 to the extent indemnification
therefor is available under Section 12.4, and (D) Sections 5.1 through 5.4,

Seller in any of Sections 5.1 through 5.4, 5.10 and 5.26 hereof (including,
without limitation, all statements made on any Schedule hereto or in any
Exhibit hereto) to have been true and correct in all respects when made or
deemed to have been made, and (3) the breach by Seller of any of the covenants
and agreements on its part to be performed under this Agreement.

its Affiliates and Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,

-67-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

resulting from the ownership or occupancy of the Assets (including, without
limitation, the Kearny Mesa Facility, Plant 19 and the Sycamore Canyon
Facility) or the Excluded Assets or the operation of the Business (including,
without limitation, the design, manufacture and assembly of products or the
provision of services, regardless of whether sold before, at or after the
Closing Date, the leasing of property (real and personal), the incurrence of
commitments and obligations, the employment of persons, the provision of
services and the giving of warranties) by GDC, SSC or CLS on or before the
Closing Date, whether asserted before or after the Closing Date, except for the
Assumed Liabilities and (B) without duplication, any and all Excluded
Liabilities. To the extent that a given claim for indemnification in favor of
Purchaser could be deemed to arise under both Section 12.2(b) and this Section
12.2(c), then such claims shall be deemed to only have arisen under this
Section 12.2(c).

(d) Seller shall fully and promptly pay, perform,
discharge, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
customers, past, present or future, from and against any and all Loss or
Damages arising out of, based upon or attributable to (i) any Environmental
Claim or Remedial Action or (ii) the breach of any representation or warranty
under Section 5.18 (including any statement in Schedule 5.18), in each case to
the extent arising out of or based upon anything relating to the Facilities or
their operation by the Seller or other Persons or the act or omission of Seller
or any Subsidiary or any predecessor thereof prior to the Closing, including,
without limitation, any investigation, remediation or removal of any
Contaminant (whether such Contaminant is now located at the Facilities or
elsewhere) and any Environmental Claim or Remedial Action required in respect
of any matter disclosed in or pursuant to Schedule 5.18. Without limiting the
rights or obligations of Purchaser and Seller set forth above, Purchaser agrees
to (x) on a basis consistent with Seller's past practices, continue to seek
payment or reimbursement from the U.S. Government with respect to Environmental
Claims and Remedial Actions relating to Plant 19, Cape Canaveral Air Force
Station and Vandenberg Air Force Base Facilities and (y) otherwise reasonably
cooperate with Seller in its efforts to assert good faith claims for recovery
against third parties in connection with Environmental Claims or Remedial
Actions; provided, however, that, except as set forth in clause (x) above, (i)
the Purchaser shall not be required to pursue claims against third parties
before having a right to make claims against the Seller, (ii) Purchaser shall
have no obligation to continue to pursue the U.S. Government as required by
clause (x) in respect of any Environmental Claim or Remedial Action as to which
no payment has been received within ninety (90) days after the original demand
by Purchaser, and then shall be entitled to immediate indemnification from
Seller as provided herein and (iii) Purchaser shall not in any event be
required to increase its overhead rates in order to facilitate a recovery by
Seller. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for all costs incurred by Purchaser
in making third party claims or assisting Seller in connection with the
foregoing.

(e) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions herein
contained, including any indemnification provisions, neither Seller or any of
its Affiliates, on the one hand, nor Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, shall have any liability or obligation to indemnify or hold

-68-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

harmless any Person by reason of the fact that the consummation of the
transactions provided for by this Agreement is found, held, determined or
alleged to have violated the antitrust laws of the United States or any foreign
jurisdiction; provided, however, that this Section 12.2(e) shall not, at or
subsequent to the consummation of such transactions, be deemed to relieve any
Person from liability with respect to a knowing and willful misrepresentation
as to the propriety of such transactions under any such laws.

(f) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, and
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and customers from and against any and all Damages based upon
the infringement, or inducing or contributory infringement, of any patent,
copyright, mask work right, or right in trade secret, by reason of the
manufacture, lease, sale or use after the Closing Date of any apparatus
manufactured or sold, or process practiced, by the Space Systems Division at
any time during the six years prior to the Closing Date; provided, however,
that the obligations under this Section 12.2(f) shall not apply to any Damages
for any such infringement, other than contributory or inducing infringement,
based solely on the combination or use of any such product or process with any
other apparatus or process not manufactured, sold or practiced by Seller during
the six years prior to the Closing Date; and provided, further that the
obligations of Seller under this Section 12.2(f) shall not apply to
infringements which occur as a result of any modification to any apparatus or
process from the form in which it was made, used or sold by the Space Systems
Division on or before the Closing Date. Seller's obligations under this
Section 12.2(f) with regard to acts of contributory or inducing infringement
after the Closing Date shall apply only if the same acts which give rise to
such inducing or contributory infringement were also performed by the Space
Systems Division on or before the Closing Date.

(g) For the purposes of administering the indemnification
provisions of this Agreement, the following procedures shall apply from and
after the Closing Date:

(1) Each indemnified party shall notify the Indemnitor
of any Indemnification Event in writing within 30 days following the receipt of
notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding or within 60 days of (A)
the assertion of any claim against such indemnified party or (B) the discovery
by such indemnified party of any loss, giving rise to indemnity pursuant to
this Agreement (any 30 or 60 day notification requirement shall begin to run,
in the case of a claim which is amended so as to give rise to an
Indemnification Event, from the first day such claim is amended to include any
claim which is an Indemnification Event hereunder) and shall indicate in such
notification whether such indemnified party is requesting indemnification with
respect to such Indemnification Event. The failure to give notice as required
by this Section 12.2(g)(1) in a timely fashion shall not result in a waiver of
any right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnitor's ability to defend against the event with respect to which
indemnification is sought is materially adversely affected by the failure of
the indemnified party to give notice in a timely fashion as required by this
Section.

-69-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

(2) After notification is given as aforesaid, the
Indemnitor shall be entitled (but not obligated, except with respect to Assumed
Liabilities, as to which Purchaser shall be so obligated) to assume the defense
or settlement of any such action or proceeding, or to participate in any
negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate any claim;
provided, however, that in the event the Indemnitor assumes any such defense or
settlement or any such negotiations, it shall actively pursue such defense,
settlement or negotiations in good faith. If the Indemnitor fails to elect in
writing within 10 Business Days after the notification referred to above to
assume the defense, the indemnified party may engage counsel to defend, settle
or otherwise dispose of such action or proceeding.

(3) In cases where the Indemnitor has assumed the
defense or settlement with respect to an Indemnification Event, the Indemnitor
shall be entitled to assume the defense or settlement thereof with counsel of
its own choosing, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party, provided that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to
settle, compromise, decline to appeal, or otherwise dispose of any such action,
proceeding or claim without the consent or agreement of the indemnified party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) provided, that if
the terms of the settlement provide only for payment of monies and do not
provide for any agreement to act or refrain from acting in any manner and such
consent is withheld, then the Indemnitor's liability shall be limited to the
amount for which the Indemnitor agreed with the claimant to settle together
with Indemnitor's cost and attorneys' fees to the date such settlement was
rejected by the indemnified party.

(4) In any case in which the Indemnitor assumes the
defense or settlement thereof, the indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate at its own cost in any such action or proceeding or in any
negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate any claim for
which indemnification is being sought and shall have the right to employ its
own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall
be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (A) the employment of such
counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the Indemnitor in connection
with the defense of such suit, action, claim or proceeding, (B) the Indemnitor
shall not have employed counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party) to take charge of the defense of such action, suit, claim or proceeding
within 10 Business Days after notice of commencement of the action, suit, claim
or proceeding, or (C) such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded
that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnitor which, if the Indemnitor and
the indemnified party were to be represented by the same counsel, could result
in a conflict of interest for such counsel or materially prejudice the
prosecution of the defenses available to such indemnified party. If any of the
events specified in clauses (B) or (C) of the preceding sentence shall have
occurred or shall otherwise be applicable, then the reasonable fees and
expenses of one counsel or firm of counsel selected by the indemnified party
shall be borne by the Indemnitor and, in the event of clause (C), such counsel
shall be reasonable acceptable to the Indemnitor. In no event shall an
Indemnitor be liable to any indemnified party for the cost of employing or

-70-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

using in-house legal counsel regardless of whether such Indemnitor has, or has
not, assumed the defense or settlement of such action, proceeding or claim.

(5) In the event indemnification is requested, the
relevant Indemnitor, its representatives and agents shall have access to the
premises, books and records of the indemnified party or parties seeking such
indemnification to the extent reasonably necessary to assist it in defending or
settling any action, proceeding or claim; provided, however, that such access
shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of the business of the indemnified party or parties and shall only
take place in the presence of a representative of the indemnified party or
parties unless otherwise so agreed and the indemnified party shall not be
required to disclose any information with respect to itself or any of its
Affiliates or former Affiliates (other than any such Affiliate or former
Affiliate which is a party to this Agreement), and shall not be required to
participate in the defense of any claim to be indemnified hereunder (except as
otherwise expressly set forth herein), unless such disclosure or participation
is otherwise required or reasonably necessary in the defense of any claim to be
indemnified hereunder.

(6) Any amount which is required to be paid by an
Indemnitor to any party, including any reimbursement to which the indemnified
party is entitled, shall be paid by such Indemnitor promptly.

(h) From the date hereof until the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, each party to this Agreement agrees to retain all Documents with
respect to all matters as to which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement
(except to the extent that such Documents in the possession of a party may be
transferred to the possession of another party at the Closing pursuant to or as
contemplated by this Agreement). Before disposing of or otherwise destroying
any such Documents, the possessor thereof shall give reasonable notice to such
effect and deliver to any Indemnitor, at such Indemnitor's expense and upon its
request, a copy of any such Documents. In addition, each party to this
Agreement agrees to use its reasonable efforts to cause its employees to
cooperate with and assist the appropriate Indemnitor and indemnified party in
connection with any claim, action or proceeding for which indemnity is sought
hereunder or with respect to which an Indemnitor has elected to participate in
the defense.

(i) Seller shall not be liable to any Person under Section
12.2(b)(1) and 12.2(f) unless and until the aggregate amount for which
indemnity would otherwise be due from Seller under Section 12.2(b)(1) and
12.2(f), together with any Basket Limited Liabilities (as defined in Schedule
1(A)), exceeds $2,500,000 (it being understood that Seller shall be liable only
for all amounts in excess thereof) and, provided further, that Seller shall not
be liable under Sections 12.2(b)(1) and 12.2(f) to make payments in excess of
an aggregate of $50,000,000. The foregoing limitations shall not be applicable
in respect of any other obligations of Seller hereunder nor in respect of
obligations of Seller under Section 12.2(f) hereof for products manufactured by
the Space Systems Division on or prior to the Closing Date, whether sold
before, on or after the Closing Date.

-71-

<PAGE>

(j) The indemnities provided for in Sections 12.2(a)(1),
12.2(b)(1) and (2) shall survive until the second anniversary of the Closing
Date or, if applicable, such longer period of time as may be specified in
Section 12.1 for survival of the representation or warranty giving rise to such
indemnity claim (except with respect of any Indemnification Event as to which
the indemnified party shall have given the Indemnitor notice prior to the
applicable survival date, which shall survive until the payment in full by the
Indemnitor of any Damages following final settlement or non-appealable judgment
with respect to such Indemnification Event). The remaining indemnities
provided for under this Agreement shall remain in effect in perpetuity
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement.

(k) The indemnities provided for in Sections 12.2(a)(1) and
12.2(b)(1) and (2) shall be the exclusive remedies under this Agreement with
respect to the failure of any representation or warranty covered thereby to
have been true and correct when made or deemed made, except in the case of
intentional misrepresentation or fraud.

(l) Notwithstanding any facilitating undertakings by
Purchaser of Seller's liability to third parties to effectuate or facilitate
the Closing and the transactions contemplated herein, (such as under leases,
contracts, assignments, novations or permits), this Agreement shall be the sole
governing document in determining the rights and liabilities as between the
Purchaser and Seller and no inference shall be formed that an undertaking
contained in any other agreement is an Assumed Liability with respect to a pre-
Closing act, event, omission or condition. In the absence of an express
written provision to the contrary in this Agreement setting forth a specific
third party undertaking as an Assumed Liability under this Agreement, any
undertaking of this type shall not be deemed an Assumed Liability for purposes
of Section 12.2(a) or 12.2(c) of this Agreement nor in any event so as to
operate to lessen or obviate the indemnity protection afforded to Purchaser
under Section 12.2(d) of this Agreement.

12.3 Payment of Brokers' or Finders' Fees. Seller shall pay any
and all brokers' or finders' fees, or any other commission or similar fee,
payable to any person acting on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates or
under the authority of any of them, in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated herein, and Purchaser shall pay any and all brokers' or finders'
fees, or any other commission or similar fee, payable to any person acting on
behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or under the authority of any of
them, in connection with any of the transactions contemplated herein, in each
case regardless of whether any claim for payment is asserted before or after
the Closing of the transactions contemplated hereby, or before or after any
termination of this Agreement.

12.4 Tax Matters

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate fully with each
other and make available or cause to be made available to each other in a
timely fashion such tax data, prior tax returns and filings and other
information as may be reasonably required for the preparation by Purchaser or

-72-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Seller of any tax returns, elections, consents or certificates required to be
prepared and filed by Purchaser or Seller and any audit or other examination by
any taxing authority, or judicial or administrative proceeding relating to
liability for Taxes. Purchaser and Seller will each retain and provide to the
other party all records and other information which may be relevant to any such
Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding or determination, and will each
provide the other party with any final determination of any such audit or
examination, proceeding or determination that affects any amount required to be
shown on any Tax Return of the other party for any period. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing but subject to Section 12.2(h), each of
Purchaser and Seller will retain copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work
schedules and other records relating to tax periods or portions thereof ending
prior to or on the Closing Date. Purchaser will cause appropriate personnel to
prepare usual and customary tax return packages for (i) the tax period ending
December 31, 1993 (the "1993 Packages") and (ii) the tax period beginning
January 1, 1994, and ending as of the Closing Date (the "Short Period
Packages"). Except as otherwise provided below, the 1993 Packages will be
delivered to Seller not later than April 30, 1994 and the Short Period Packages
will be delivered to Seller not later than 120 days after the Closing Date. If
the Purchaser determines that it is impractical to deliver the Packages on or
before the prescribed times, it shall deliver the Packages to Seller as soon
after the initially prescribed times as is reasonably practicable but in no
event shall the 1993 Packages be delivered later than July 31, 1994, nor shall
the Short Period Packages be delivered later than 210 days after the Closing
Date, Purchaser having no obligation to incur additional out-of-pocket expenses
to accelerate the delivery. Purchaser will provide Seller with any necessary
payroll records attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Any sales, transfer, use or other similar taxes imposed
as a result of the sale of the Assets to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement
shall be shared equally by Seller and Purchaser. At the Closing, Purchaser
shall remit to Seller such properly completed resale exemption certificates and
other similar certificates or instruments as are necessary to claim available
exemptions from the payment of sales, transfer, use or other similar taxes
under applicable law. All recording, transfer and other similar taxes and fees
payable as a result of the public recordation of the instruments of conveyance
or transfer of the Assets executed and delivered to Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement shall be allocated between the Purchaser and the Seller in accordance
with the customary practice prevailing in the place where any such Assets are
located.

(c) Seller shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates in respect of
any Damages attributable to all Taxes with respect to the ownership, use or
leasing of the Assets on or prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates in respect of any Damages attributable
to all Taxes with respect to the ownership, use or leasing of the Assets after
the Closing Date. Seller's share of all real and personal property Taxes,
state and local ad valorem Taxes and assessments applicable to the Assets for
any period commencing on or prior to the Closing Date and ending after the

-73-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Closing Date shall be determined on a pro rata basis based on the length of
such period and when the Closing Date occurs therein.

(d) Seller and Purchaser agree that the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement constitutes a sale of a trade or business
within the meaning of Section 41(f)(3) of the Code. Seller agrees to provide
Purchaser upon request with all information necessary to permit Purchaser to
timely apply the provisions of Section 41(f)(3)(A) of the Code with respect to
the Assets. Seller agrees to furnish Purchaser upon request clearance
certificates or similar documents that may be required by any state, local or
other taxing authority to relieve Purchaser of any obligations to withhold any
portion of the purchase consideration to be transferred pursuant to Article II
hereof.

(e) The Purchase Price and the liabilities assumed by
Purchaser shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets as provided in Section
1060 of the Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder. Such allocation shall
initially be based on an appraisal by one of the "Big 6" national certified
public accounting firms to be selected by Purchaser, other than the regular
auditing firm of Purchaser. Seller shall have 30 days from the later of (i)
receipt of such initial allocation or (ii) receipt of the appraisal and
supporting work papers, to review and approve the allocation or make suggested
modifications thereto. The final allocation shall be such allocation as is
agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller. Purchaser and Seller agree to provide
reasonable access by their respective employees and representatives (including,
without limitation, the appraiser) to those assets and records of Seller prior
to the Closing necessary for the purpose of making such appraisal and
allocation. Upon agreement as to the final allocation, Purchaser and Seller
shall not take any position on their respective Tax Returns that is
inconsistent with such allocation of the purchase price, and Purchaser and
Seller shall duly prepare and timely file such reports and information returns
as may be required to report the allocation of the purchase price pursuant to
this Section 12.4(h). The parties acknowledge that the purchase price subject
to allocation will be different amounts for each of Purchaser and Seller (e.g.,
due to inclusion of differing amounts of transaction costs). If, after 60
days, Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree upon the final allocation, any
disputed matters shall be finally and conclusively determined by an independent
auditing firm of recognized national standing (the "Allocation Arbiter")
selected by Purchaser and Seller, which shall not be the regular auditing firm
of Purchaser or Seller or the firm which made the initial allocation. The
Allocation Arbiter's determination shall constitute the final allocation of the
purchase price for purposes hereof. Seller shall pay a portion of the fees
incurred in connection with the initial appraisal equal to the lesser of (i)
$100,000 or (ii) 50% of the total amount of such fees. Purchaser shall pay the
remainder of the fees incurred in connection with the initial appraisal. The
Allocation Arbiter's fees shall be paid 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Seller.

(f) Prior to or as of the Closing, Seller will effectively
terminate all safe harbor lease agreements and arrangements under Section
168(f)(8) of the 1954 Code relating to the Assets such that, following the
Closing, none of the Assets will be property that Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates will be required to treat as being owned by any other Person

-74-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

pursuant to the provisions of Section 168(f)(8) of the 1954 Code. Seller will
indemnify and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless against (i) any and
all Damages arising pursuant to or in connection with, and all obligations to
any other party to, any and all safe harbor lease agreements or arrangements to
which any of the Assets were subject prior to the Closing and (ii) any and all
damages arising in connection with or pursuant to the termination thereof.

(g) In the event any taxing authority mistakenly delivers
to or otherwise credits Purchaser with a refund of Tax relating to Taxes paid
or arising in periods prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser will promptly
negotiate such refund to Seller or pay an amount equal to such credit to
Seller, as the case may be.

12.5 [Intentionally Omitted]

12.6 Liquidating Events.

(a) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, GDC
shall not distribute all or substantially all of its assets to its shareholders
or a liquidating trust or similar entity, dissolve or sell all or substantially
all of its assets for less than fair value (as determined in good faith by the
board of directors of GDC) unless:

(1) at least thirty (30) days prior thereto Seller
shall have notified Purchaser in writing of the proposed action; and

(2) Seller shall have, together with such notice,
offered to Purchaser such security as Seller deems sufficient to provide
compensation to Purchaser, within any applicable limits of this Agreement, for
all matured, pending, contingent, conditional or unmatured indemnification or
other claims against, or liabilities or obligations of, Seller under this
Agreement, assuming such claims, liabilities or obligations are to mature at
the maximum potential amount thereof; and

(3) Purchaser shall either (a) have notified Seller in
writing that Purchaser accepts such offered security or (b) within 10 days
after receipt of Seller's notice under Section 12.6(a)(2), have notified Seller
in writing that Purchaser rejects such offered security; and

(4) If Purchaser has rejected Seller's offered
security pursuant to Section 12.6(a)(3), Seller has complied with the
requirements of Section 12.6(b) and the security required to be provided to
Purchaser has been determined, as provided therein, and offered to Purchaser.

-75-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

(b) If Purchaser rejects any offered security as permitted
by Section 12.6(a)(3), Purchaser and Seller shall determine the required amount
of any security for claims to be provided to Purchaser as follows:

(1) Within fifteen (15) days after Purchaser rejects
any security offered by Seller as permitted by Section 12.6(a)(3), Purchaser
and Seller shall petition an arbitrator, as provided in this Section 12.6(b),
to determine the amount and form of security which would be reasonably likely
to be sufficient to provide compensation to Purchaser for all contingent,
conditional or unmatured claims of Purchaser against Seller under this
Agreement, if such claims mature.

(2) The arbitration required under Section 12.6(b)(1)
shall be resolved by arbitration conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules or then-existing rules for commercial arbitration of the
American Arbitration Association; provided, however, that the parties shall
select an arbitrator and agree upon a schedule of arbitration such that the
commencement of the arbitrator's hearing shall commence no later than ninety
(90) days after the Purchaser has rejected the Seller's offer of security. The
arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties to the maximum extent
permitted by Law.

(3) Each party shall pay the fees of its own
attorneys, expenses of witnesses and all other expenses connected with the
presentation of such party's case. One-half the cost of any arbitration
pursuant to this Section 12.6, including the cost of the record or transcripts
thereof, if any, administrative fees, and all other fees involved, shall be
paid by Purchaser, and the balance shall be paid by Seller, except as the
arbitrator may otherwise direct.

(4) Proceedings under and the provisions of this
Section 12.6(b) shall be subject to Section 13.3.

(5) Any arbitration proceedings hereunder shall be
held in the State of Maryland.
