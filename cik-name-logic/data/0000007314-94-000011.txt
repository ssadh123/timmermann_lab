Claims Against NorAm Energy Dismissed in RTC Litigation

Houston TX -- August 30, 1994 -- NorAm Energy Corp. learned

today that Federal Judge David Hittner has dismissed all causes

of action against NorAm Energy and its Entex division in the

litigation brought by the Resolution Trust Corporation against

NorAm Energy, Entex and various individual defendants in

connection with the 1989 receivership of University Savings

Association. The Court permitted the RTC to pursue causes of

action against the individual defendants, who are former

directors of University Savings, if the RTC can demonstrate gross

negligence, or an entire or total want of care, or total

abdication of directorial duties.

Judge Hittner did not grant the RTC the right to replead any

of its causes of action. NorAm Energy does not know if the RTC

plans to appeal the Judge's orders.

University Savings, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of

Entex, was sold by Entex to University's management in a

transaction approved by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 1987. 

Entex and NorAm Energy merged in 1988.

NorAm Energy Corp., formerly Arkla, Inc., is the nation's<PAGE>

third largest natural gas utility serving 2.7 million customers

through its Entex, Arkla and Minnegasco operating divisions. 

NorAm Energy is also a major natural gas pipeline and energy

marketer providing supply, gathering, storage and transportation

services.
