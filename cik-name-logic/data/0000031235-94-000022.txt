Notes to Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On May 3, 1994, the Company announced its intent to divest the following 
non-imaging health businesses: the pharmaceutical and consumer health 
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division. Beginning with the second quarter of 1994, these businesses are 
being reported as discontinued operations with results for prior periods 
restated. On June 23, 1994, the Company announced Sanofi has agreed to 
acquire the pharmaceutical business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. for $1.675 
billion in cash and its interest in the "Over-the-Counter" alliance with 
Sterling Winthrop Inc. On October 1, 1994, the Company completed this sale. 
On August 29, 1994, the Company announced SmithKline Beecham plc has agreed to 
acquire the consumer health business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. for $2.925 
billion in cash. On September 6, 1994, the Company announced Johnson & Johnson 
has agreed to acquire the Clinical Diagnostics Division for $1.008 billion in 
cash. On September 26, 1994, the Company announced Reckitt & Colman plc has
agreed to acquire the worldwide household businesses of L&F Products for
$1.55 billion in cash. On October 14, 1994, the Company announced Forstmann 
Little & Co. has agreed to acquire the do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F
Products for $700 million in cash. The Company expects to complete these 
transactions upon receipt of regulatory approvals. In addition, as part of the 
divestiture, the Company is actively negotiating with potential buyers for its
pharmaceutical research and development facility and anticipates closing dates
for these transactions over the next few months.

As of June 30, 1994, the Company concluded that measurement dates had occurred 
for the sales of the non-imaging health businesses. Accordingly, the 
financial statement information related to these businesses has been presented 
on one line in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, "net assets 
of discontinued operations", and in the "discontinued operations" section of 
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The amounts presented for prior 
periods have been restated for appropriate comparability. The "net assets of 
discontinued operations" represents the assets intended to be sold offset by 
the liabilities anticipated to be assumed by potential buyers of these 
businesses. The amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings 
for prior periods have been restated to reflect the allocation of interest 
expense from continuing operations to discontinued operations. The allocation 
of interest expense was performed by reference to the interest expense on 
indebtedness that is anticipated to be repaid from the net proceeds received 
from the divestment transactions.

The Company currently does not anticipate an overall loss on the divestment 
transactions including income from operations during the phase-out period 
which is estimated to end on or about December 31, 1994. Consequently, all 
gains estimated at this time will be recognized by the Company at the closing 
date of such transactions.

Summarized results of the Health businesses, including an allocation of 
interest expense, are as follows:
(in millions) 1993 1992 1991

Sales $3,764 $3,645 $3,551
====== ====== ======
Earnings (loss) before income taxes $ (225) $ (133) $ (272)
Provision (benefit) for income taxes (50) (35) 30 
------ ------ ------
Earnings (loss) before cumulative effect 
of changes in accounting principle $ (175) $ (98) $ (302) 
====== ====== ======
Allocated interest expense included in earnings before income taxes was 
approximately $450 million for 1993, $450 million for 1992 and $450 million for 
1991.

Net assets of the Health businesses as reported in the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position are comprised of the following:
Dec. 31, Dec. 31,
(in millions) 1993 1992

Current assets $1,164 $1,150
