ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

(a) Financial Statements of Business Acquired.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of Novalta Resources Inc. and
Subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 are
incorporated by reference herein to Exhibit 2.1 to Amendment No. 1 to the
Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 4, 1994.

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On January 4 1994, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Seagull Energy
Corporation ("Seagull" or the "Company") acquired all of the outstanding shares
of stock (the "Stock") of Novalta Resources Inc. ("Novalta") and an
intercompany note (the "Note") from Novalta to its parent, Novacor
Petrochemicals Ltd. ("Novacor Petrochemicals"). The Stock and the Note were
acquired for a purchase price of approximately $203 million in cash, subject to
customary post-closing adjustments (the "Seagull Canada Acquisition"). The 
economic effective date of the Seagull Canada Acquisition was December 31,
1993 (the "Effective Date"). Effective as of the January 4, 1994 Closing Date,
Novalta was amalgamated with one of its subsidiaries along with Seagull Energy
Canada Ltd., the indirect subsidiary of Seagull that acquired Novalta. The
resulting amalgamated company was named Seagull Energy Canada Ltd. ("Seagull
Canada").

The unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 and the
unaudited pro forma condensed statement of earnings for the year ended December
31, 1993 give effect to the Seagull Canada Acquisition, financed initially
under a new $175 million reducing revolving credit facility (the "Canadian
Credit Agreement") as well as borrowings under Seagull's amended and restated
$475 million revolving credit line (the "Revolver") with a group of major U.S.
and international banks.

The following unaudited pro forma information has been included as required by
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is provided for
comparative purposes only. The unaudited pro forma information presented is
based on the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Seagull
and Novalta and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements
and the related notes thereto. The historical consolidated financial
statements of Novalta as presented do not reflect the effect of certain
transactions between Novalta and NOVA Corporation of Alberta and its
subsidiaries that were completed prior to the closing of the Seagull Canada
Acquisition, such as the elimination of intercompany debt balances. The effect
of such transactions is reflected in the conforming adjustments to the
unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements. The unaudited pro forma
information presented does not purport to be indicative of actual results, if
the combinations had been in effect on the dates or for the periods indicated,
or of future results.

All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.

(A) To eliminate Novalta's historical cost of property, plant and equipment 
and accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization.

(B) To adjust the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Seagull
Canada Acquisition to reflect the allocation of the estimated purchase 
price. The adjusted cost of property, plant and equipment was calculated 
as follows:

</TABLE>

The purchase price was determined pursuant to arm's length negotiations
between the Company and Novacor Petrochemicals, based on the economic
effective date of December 31, 1993. The purchase price was based to a
large extent on the net present value of natural gas and oil reserves
attributable to the properties acquired as a result of the Seagull Canada 
Acquisition.

(C) To record the financing of the Seagull Canada Acquisition, including
approximately $193.3 million of borrowings under the Canadian Credit
Agreement and the Revolver, a cash deposit of approximately $7.5 million
paid in November 1993 and other costs in connection with the acquisition.

(D) To eliminate long-term debt, deferred income taxes and shareholder's
equity of Novalta.

(E) Assets and liabilities of Novalta were translated from Canadian dollars to
U.S. dollars using the conversion rate in effect on January 4, 1994 of
