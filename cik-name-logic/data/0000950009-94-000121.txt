FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
---------------------

SOUTHFIELD, Mich., October 11, 1994 -- Chrysler Financial Corporation
(CFC) today reported net earnings of $50 million for the third quarter of
1994, compared to net earnings of $22 million for the third quarter of
1993. 

John P. Tierney, Chairman of CFC, said the third quarter net earnings
were favorably impacted by the company's larger automotive financing
portfolio and lower costs of bank facilities. These factors were partially
offset by reduced retail automotive margins. The 1993 third quarter
earnings were reduced by the recognition of the retroactive increase in the
U.S. corporate tax rate.

CFC's net earnings were $141 million for the first nine months of
1994, compared to net earnings of $73 million for the same period a year
ago. 

At September 30, 1994, CFC was managing $30.1 billion in receivables,
up $3.8 billion from a year ago. The increase in receivables managed was
caused by a higher volume of automotive financing. The company's total
assets at the end of the third quarter were $15.4 billion, up $1.6 billion
from a year ago. 

Chrysler Credit, CFC's core automotive finance operation, had
receivables managed of $27.2 billion at September 30, 1994, compared to
$22.8 billion a year ago.

During the third quarter of 1994, retail automotive financing volume
was 113,000 new passenger cars, trucks and minivans, representing 23
percent of Chrysler's U.S. new retail deliveries, compared to 117,000 new
retail vehicles or 24 percent in the third quarter of 1993.

In the third quarter of 1994, Chrysler Credit also financed at
wholesale 371,000 vehicles representing 76 percent of Chrysler's U.S.
factory shipments, compared to 332,000 or 77 percent in the third quarter
of 1993. 

CFC's nonautomotive operations, consisting of Chrysler Capital, a
commercial leasing and lending unit, and Chrysler First Business Credit, a
small business loan operation, were managing $2.9 billion in receivables at
September 30, 1994, compared to $3.5 billion in receivables a year ago.

Chrysler Insurance, an automotive-related insurance operation, had
direct insurance premiums written of $133 million during the first nine
months of 1994, compared to $112 million for the same period a year ago.

In 1994 third quarter capital markets activity, CFC received net
proceeds of $1.6 billion from the sale of U.S. and Canadian automotive
receivables, and sold $73 million of medium term notes. At the end of the
third quarter, CFC had commercial paper outstanding of $3.1 billion,
compared to $2.5 billion a year ago.

Shortly after the close of the third quarter, Tierney, 63, announced
he would retire December 31, 1994, after 31 years in the automotive
industry, the last seven as Chairman of CFC. The Chrysler Board of
Directors on October 6 announced that Thomas W. Sidlik, 44, a Chrysler Vice
President, will become Chairman of CFC effective November 7, 1994.

Gains or losses from the sale of retail receivables are recognized in the
period in which such sales occur. Provisions for expected credit losses
are generally provided during the period in which such receivables are
acquired. Since the allowance for credit losses is separately provided
prior to the receivable sales, gains from receivable sales are not reduced
for expected credit losses. Included in "Investment and other income" are
gains before expected credit losses totaling $55 million and $104 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The
provision for credit losses related to such sales amounted to $105 million
and $97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

Note 4 - Accounting Changes

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities." This new accounting standard specifies the
accounting and reporting requirements for changes in the fair values of
investments with readily determinable fair values.

At September 30, 1994, the Company had investments in securities with an
aggregate carrying value of $366 million, consisting primarily of commercial
paper, governmental securities and corporate debt. Of these securities, $342
million were categorized as available-for-sale, and $24 million were categorized
as held-to-maturity. The adjustment of available-for-sale securities to market
value at September 30, 1994 decreased Shareholder's Investment by $8 million.

Other Postretirement Benefits

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," ("OPEB") which
requires the accrual of such benefits during the years the employees provide
services. The adoption of SFAS No. 106 resulted in an after-tax charge of $29
million in 1993, which represented the immediate recognition of the OPEB
transition obligation of $45 million, partially offset by $16 million of
estimated tax benefits. Implementation of SFAS No. 106 did not increase the
Company's cash expenditures for postretirement benefits. Recognition of on-going
expenses under OPEB will not materially affect the Company's results of
operations.

Postemployment Benefits

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." This accounting standard requires the
accrual of benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment
but prior to retirement. The adoption of this accounting standard resulted in
the recognition of an after-tax charge of $1 million in 1993. Adoption of SFAS
No. 112 has not materially increased the annual expense recognized for these
benefits, and there is no cash impact. Previously reported results for the nine
months ended September 30, 1993 have been restated to reflect the adoption of
SFAS No. 112, effective January 1, 1993.

Impairment of a Loan

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," which amends SFAS No. 5,
"Accounting for Contingencies," by requiring creditors to evaluate the
collectibility of both contractual interest and principal of receivables when
evaluating the need for a loss accrual. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 114
on or before January 1, 1995. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have
a material impact upon the Company's results of operations and financial
position.

Note 5 - Income Taxes

During the third quarter of 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993 was enacted. This legislation increased the federal maximum statutory tax
rate for corporations to thirty-five percent, retroactive to January 1, 1993.
The effect of adjusting to the higher tax rate was to reduce third quarter 1993
net earnings by $16 million as follows: (a) increase earnings before income
taxes by $9 million resulting from the adjustment of tax rate assumptions
associated with the Company's leveraged lease portfolio; and (b) increase the
provision for income taxes by $25 million primarily due to the adjustment of net
deferred tax liabilities.

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT

Shareholder and Board of Directors
Chrysler Financial Corporation
Southfield, Michigan

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler
Financial Corporation (a subsidiary of Chrysler Corporation) and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of September 30, 1994 and 1993, and the
related consolidated statements of net earnings and cash flows for the
three-months and nine-months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical
procedures to financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope
than an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do
not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above
for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Financial
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, and
the related consolidated statements of net earnings and cash flows for the
year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated January
18, 1994, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1993
is fairly presented, in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
