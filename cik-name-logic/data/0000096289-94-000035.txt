Item 5. Other

Tandy Corporation (NYSE:TAN) today announced that its Board
of Directors authorized management to purchase up to
7,500,000 shares of its common stock in addition to shares
required for employee plans. Purchases will be made from
time to time in the open market, and it is expected that
funding of the program will come from existing cash and
short-term debt.

John V. Roach, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated,
"The Board of Directors has just completed an annual review
of the Five-Year Strategic Plan which anticipates significant
growth of our retail operations. This growth will likely
generate cash that further deleverages the Company's existing
strong financial position and supports this share repurchase
program. As a part of Tandy's financial strategy, the Board
will review additional share repurchase programs from time to
time."

On June 30, 1994, Tandy had 63,713,000 common shares
outstanding, excluding 21,932,000 held in treasury, and
15,000,000 common stock equivalent in the form of PERCS.
Total debt represented 10.5% of total capital and Tandy's
cash balance was $278.3 million as of June 30, 1994.

Tandy Corporation, one of the nation's largest retailers of
consumer electronics, sells its products through
approximately 6,500 Radio Shack stores, 310 VideoConcepts
/McDuff/The Edge in Electronics stores, 49 Computer City
SuperCenters, and 5 Incredible Universe stores.
