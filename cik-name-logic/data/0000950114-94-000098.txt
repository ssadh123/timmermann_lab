FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- ---------------------

BOATMEN'S BANCSHARES TO ACQUIRE WORTHEN BANKING CORPORATION
-----------------------------------------------------------

ST. LOUIS, August 18, 1994 - Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:BOAT)
announced today that it has agreed to acquire Worthen Banking Corporation
(ASE:WOR) of Little Rock, Arkansas, in a stock transaction valued at
approximately $595 million.

Boatmen's will exchange one share of its common stock for each share of
Worthen's approximately 17.3 million common shares including shares issued for
stock options. The transaction will be accounted for on a pooling of interest
basis and will be a tax-free exchange for Worthen shareholders.

Worthen is the second largest bank holding company in Arkansas with
approximately $3.5 billion in assets and $3.0 billion in deposits at June 30,
1994, and operates 112 retail banking offices throughout Arkansas and six
offices in the Austin, Texas, area.

"We are extremely pleased with this opportunity to significantly expand
our existing franchise in Arkansas," explained Andrew B. Craig, III, chairman
and chief executive officer of Boatmen's Bancshares. "Worthen fits our
acquisition criteria perfectly, with superior asset quality and an excellent
management team. Moreover, the size of its market share and breadth of its
banking relationships will give us a dominant market position in Arkansas,
as well as enhance our presence in Texas."

Boatmen's currently owns Superior Federal Bank, based in Fort Smith,
Arkansas, with assets of about $1.2 billion. Superior has 39 locations in
Arkansas and 18 locations in Oklahoma. Boatmen's also has banking operations
in Amarillo and El Paso, Texas.

Curt Bradbury, chairman and chief executive officer of Worthen, said,
"We are looking forward to being affiliated with Boatmen's, which is one of
the nation's best performing regional bank holding companies. We will be able
to leverage Boatmen's banking strengths to continue providing exceptional
service to our customers in Arkansas and Texas."

In the first half of 1994 Worthen earned $23.8 million, an increase of 16
percent over year-ago results, excluding nonrecurring items, while Boatmen's
posted record net income of $173.6 million, representing an increase of 9
percent over the comparable year-earlier period.

The transaction is expected to close by the first quarter of 1995,
subject to regulatory approval and approval by Worthen shareholders.
Revenue enhancements and cost savings due to increased efficiencies are
projected to total $13 million after-tax in 1995 and $26 million after-tax
in 1996, and will make the transaction accretive to earnings per share during
1996, Boatmen's pointed out.

Boatmen's Bancshares, with assets of approximately $28 billion, is one
of the 30 largest U.S. bank holding companies, operating more than 400
locations in nine states. In addition, Boatmen's is among the nation's
largest providers of trust services with assets under management in excess
of $34 billion.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
----------------------------

This is an AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement")
made August 18, 1994, by and among WORTHEN BANKING CORPORATION, an
Arkansas corporation ("Worthen"), BOATMEN'S BANCSHARES, INC., a
Missouri corporation ("Boatmen's"), and BBI ACQUISITIONCO, INC., an
Arkansas corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Boatmen's
("AcquisitionCo").

In consideration of the premises and the mutual terms and
provisions set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows.

ARTICLE ONE
-----------

TERMS OF THE MERGER & CLOSING
-----------------------------

SECTION 1.01. THE MERGER. Pursuant to the terms and
------------ ----------
provisions of this Agreement and the Arkansas Business Corporation
Act (the "Corporate Law"), AcquisitionCo shall merge with and into
Worthen (the "Merger").

SECTION 1.02. MERGING CORPORATION. AcquisitionCo shall be
------------ -------------------
the merging corporation under the Merger and its corporate identity
and existence, separate and apart from Worthen, shall cease on
consummation of the Merger.

SECTION 1.03. SURVIVING CORPORATION. Worthen shall be the
------------ ---------------------
surviving corporation in the Merger. No changes in the articles of
incorporation of Worthen shall be effected by the Merger.

SECTION 1.04. EFFECT OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have
------------ --------------------
all of the effects provided by this Agreement and the Corporate
Law.

SECTION 1.05. CONVERSION OF SHARES.
------------ --------------------

(a) At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.08 hereof),
each share of common stock, par value $1.00, of Worthen (the
"Worthen Common") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than shares the holders of which have duly
exercised and perfected their dissenters' rights under the
Corporate Law, shall be converted into the right to receive one (1)
share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Boatmen's (the
"Boatmen's Common") (together with any cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares, as provided below, the "Merger Consideration").
No fractional shares of Boatmen's Common shall be issued and, in
lieu thereof, holders of shares of Worthen Common who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share interest (after taking
into account all shares of Worthen Common held by such holder)
shall be paid an amount in cash equal to the product of such
fractional share interest and the closing price of a share of
Boatmen's Common on the Nasdaq Stock Market's National Market
("Nasdaq") on the business day immediately preceding the date on
which the Effective Time occurs.

(b) At the Effective Time, all of the shares of Worthen
Common, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holders thereof, shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
any certificate or certificates which immediately

<PAGE> 6
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Worthen
Common (the "Certificates") shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares, except the right of such holders to
receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration upon the
surrender of such Certificate or Certificates in accordance with
Section 1.07.

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Worthen Common, if
any, held in the treasury of Worthen or by any direct or indirect
subsidiary of Worthen (other than shares held in trust accounts for
the benefit of others or in other fiduciary, nominee or similar
capacities) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled.

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
AcquisitionCo outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one share of Worthen Common.

(e) If between the date hereof and the Effective Time a share
of Boatmen's Common shall be changed into a different number of
shares of Boatmen's Common or a different class of shares by reason
of reclassification, recapitalization, splitup, exchange of shares
or readjustment, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared
with a record date within such period, then the number of shares of
Boatmen's Common into which a share of Worthen Common shall be
converted pursuant to subsection (a) above shall be appropriately
and proportionately adjusted so that each shareholder of Worthen
shall be entitled to receive such number of shares of Boatmen's
Common as such shareholder would have received pursuant to such
reclassification, recapitalization, splitup, exchange of shares or
readjustment or as a result of such stock dividend had the record
date therefor been immediately following the Effective Time of the
Merger.

(f) If holders of Worthen Common are entitled to dissent from
the Agreement and Merger under the Corporate Law, any issued and
outstanding shares of Worthen Common held by a dissenting holder
shall not be converted as described in this Section 1.05 but from
and after the Effective Time shall represent only the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
dissenting holder pursuant to the Corporate Law; provided, however,
that each share of Worthen Common outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a dissenting holder who shall, after
the Effective Time, withdraw his demand for appraisal or lose his
right to dissent shall have only such rights as are provided under
Corporate Law.

SECTION 1.06. THE CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the
------------ -----------
"Closing") shall take place at a location mutually agreeable to the
parties at 10:00 A.M. Central Time on the Closing Date described in
Section 1.08 of this Agreement.

SECTION 1.07. EXCHANGE PROCEDURES; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.
------------ ----------------------------------------------

(a) Boatmen's Trust Company, St. Louis, Missouri, shall act
as Exchange Agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent").

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each record holder of any
Certificate or Certificates whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the

2
<PAGE> 7
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Boatmen's may
reasonably specify) (each such letter, the "Merger Letter of
Transmittal") and instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a
Merger Letter of Transmittal duly executed and any other required
documents, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor solely the Merger Consideration. No
interest on the Merger Consideration issuable upon the surrender of
the Certificates shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of Certificates. If the Merger Consideration is to be
issued to a person other than a person in whose name a surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of issuance that
the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such

proceeding, law or regulation (except as specifically referred to

and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or to the Merger would
prohibit or inhibit Worthen from consummating this Agreement and
the Merger on the terms and conditions herein contained. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Worthen and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Worthen, enforceable against Worthen in accordance with its terms.
To the best knowledge of Worthen, Worthen and its subsidiaries are
not in default under, nor in violation of, any provision of their

SECTION 4.05. CONFORMING ACCOUNTING AND RESERVE POLICIES;
------------ ------------------------------------------
RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES.
- ----------------------

(a) Notwithstanding that Worthen believes that it and its

for possible loan losses required by generally accepted accounting
principles and applicable laws, rules and regulations, Worthen
recognizes that Boatmen's may have adopted different loan, accrual
and reserve policies (including loan classifications and levels of
reserves for possible loan losses). From and after the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, Worthen and Boatmen's shall
consult and cooperate with each other with respect to conforming,
as specified in a written notice from Boatmen's to Worthen, based
upon such consultation and as hereinafter provided, the loan,
accrual and reserve policies of Worthen and its subsidiaries to
those policies of Boatmen's.

(b) In addition, from and after the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, Worthen and Boatmen's shall consult and
cooperate with each other with respect to determining, as specified
in a written notice from Boatmen's to Worthen, based upon such
consultation and as hereinafter provided, appropriate accruals,
reserves and charges to establish and take in respect of excess
equipment write-off or write-down of various assets and other
appropriate charges and accounting adjustments taking into account
the parties' business plans following the Merger.

(c) Worthen and Boatmen's shall consult and cooperate with
each other with respect to determining, as specified in a written
notice from Boatmen's to Worthen, based upon such consultation and
as hereinafter provided, the amount and the timing for recognizing
for financial accounting purposes the expenses of the Merger and
the restructuring charges related to or to be incurred in
connection with the Merger.

(d) At the request of Boatmen's, Worthen shall establish and
take such reserves and accruals as Boatmen's shall request to
conform Worthen's loan, accrual and reserve policies to Boatmen's
policies, shall establish and take such accruals, reserves and
charges in order to implement such policies in respect of excess
facilities and equipment capacity, severance costs, litigation
matters, write-off or write-down of various assets and other
appropriate accounting adjustments, and to recognize for financial
accounting purposes such expenses of the Merger and restructuring
charges related to or to be incurred in connection with the Merger,
in each case at such times as are mutually agreeable to Boatmen's
and Worthen; provided, however, that it is the objective of
Boatmen's and Worthen that such reserves, accruals and charges
referred to in this Section 4.05 be taken as at or immediately
prior to December 31, 1994, and, in all events, not later than as
of immediately prior to the Closing Date, provided that if such reserves,

16
<PAGE> 21
accruals and charges are to be taken as at or prior to
December 31, 1994 and the Closing Date is to occur thereafter,
Boatmen's shall certify to Worthen on or prior to January 15, 1995,
that the bank regulatory approval conditions to its obligations
contemplated by Section 6.01(d) have been satisfied or waived
(except to the extent that any waiting period associated therewith
may then have commenced but not expired) and Boatmen's and Worthen
shall have mutually agreed by January 15, 1995 to the scheduling of
the Closing Date to be no later than February 15, 1995; and
provided, further, that Worthen shall not be required to take any
such action that is not consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles.

SECTION 4.06. CONSUMMATION OF AGREEMENT. Worthen shall,
------------ -------------------------
subject to the fulfillment of the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of Worthen, use its best efforts to perform and fulfill
all conditions and obligations on its part to be performed or
fulfilled under this Agreement and to effect the Merger in
accordance with the terms and provisions hereof. Worthen shall
furnish to Boatmen's in a timely manner all information, data and
documents in the possession of Worthen requested by Boatmen's as
may be required to obtain any necessary regulatory or other
approvals of the Merger or to file with the S.E.C. a registration
statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement") relating to
the shares of Boatmen's Common to be issued to the shareholders of
Worthen pursuant to the Merger and this Agreement and shall
otherwise cooperate fully with Boatmen's to carry out the purpose
and intent of this Agreement.

SECTION 4.07. ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS. Worthen shall provide
------------ ---------------------
to Boatmen's, as soon as reasonably practical, but not later than
sixty (60) days after the date hereof, a report of a phase one
environmental investigation on all real property owned, leased or
operated by Worthen or its subsidiaries as of the date hereof (but
excluding space in retail and similar establishments leased by
Worthen for automatic teller machines or bank branch facilities
where the space leased comprises less than 20% of the total space
leased to all tenants of such property) and within ten (10) days
after the acquisition or lease of any real property acquired or
leased by Worthen or its subsidiaries after the date hereof (but
excluding space in retail and similar establishments leased by
Worthen for automatic teller machines or bank branch facilities
where the space leased comprises less than 20% of the total space
leased to all tenants of such property), except as otherwise
provided in Section 4.01(b)(xiv). If required by the phase one
investigation in Boatmen's reasonable opinion, Worthen shall
provide to Boatmen's a report of a phase two investigation on
properties requiring such additional study. Boatmen's shall have
fifteen (15) business days from the receipt of any such phase two
investigation report to notify Worthen of any dissatisfaction with
the contents of such report. Should the cost of taking all
remedial or other corrective actions and measures (i) required by
applicable law, or (ii) recommended or suggested by such report or
reports or prudent in light of serious life, health or safety
concerns, in the aggregate, exceed the sum of Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) as reasonably estimated by an environmental expert
retained for such purpose by Boatmen's and reasonably acceptable to
Worthen, or if the cost of such actions and measures cannot be so
reasonably estimated by such expert to be such amount or less with
any reasonable degree of certainty, then Boatmen's shall have the
right pursuant to Section 7.03 hereof, for a period of fifteen (15)
business days following receipt of such estimate or indication that
the cost of such actions and measures can not be so reasonably
estimated, to terminate this Agreement, which shall be Boatmen's
sole remedy in such event.

date of this Agreement, the signed agreement, in the form of
Exhibit 4.08 hereto (the "Shareholder Letters"), of each person who
may reasonably be deemed an "affiliate" of Worthen within the
meaning of such term as used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act

affiliate, regarding (i) compliance with the provisions of such
Rule 145, and (ii) compliance with the requirements of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 16 regarding the disposition of shares
of Worthen Common or Boatmen's Common (or reduction of risk with
respect thereto) until such time as financial results covering at
least thirty (30) days of post-Merger combined operations have been
published. Worthen shall notify all affiliates as far in advance
as is reasonably practicable of the date on which the thirty (30)
day period prior to the Closing Date is likely to begin.

SECTION 4.09. ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Worthen shall permit
------------ ---------------------
Boatmen's reasonable access in a manner which will avoid undue
disruption or interference with Worthen's normal operations to its
properties and shall disclose and make available to Boatmen's all
books, documents, papers and records relating to its assets, stock,
ownership, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities,
including, but not limited to, all books of account (including the

stockholders' meetings, organizational documents, material
contracts and agreements, loan files, filings with any regulatory
authority, accountants' workpapers (if available and subject to the

waiver of the attorney-client or attorney work product privileges
under the rules of evidence), plans affecting employees, and any
other business activities or prospects in which Boatmen's may have
a reasonable and legitimate interest in furtherance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Worthen shall deliver

disclosed in Section 2.12(c) of the Disclosure Schedule and, with
respect to each such plan or program, all (i) amendments or

and the transactions contemplated herein. Boatmen's shall not take
any action at any time after the Effective Time which would cause

Section 368 of the Code.

SECTION 5.02. BREACHES. Boatmen's shall, in the event it has
------------ --------
knowledge of the occurrence, or impending or threatened occurrence,
of any event or condition which would cause or constitute a failure
of any condition precedent to either party's obligations to effect
the Merger or a material breach (or would have caused or
constituted a material breach had such event occurred or been known

agreements contained or referred to herein, give prompt written
notice thereof to Worthen and use its best efforts to prevent or

SECTION 5.04. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.
------------ -------------------------------------------

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Worthen Common (a "Worthen Stock Option") issued pursuant
to the Worthen Banking Corporation 1984 Amended and Substituted
Stock Option Plan and the Worthen Banking Corporation 1993 Stock
Option Plan (together the "Stock Option Plans") whether or not
exercisable or vested, shall be assumed by Boatmen's as hereinafter
provided. Each Worthen Stock Option shall be deemed to constitute
an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Worthen Stock Option, the same number of full
shares of Boatmen's Common as the holder of such Worthen Stock
Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger
had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to
the Effective Time, at a price per share equal to (y) the aggregate
exercise price for Worthen Common otherwise purchasable pursuant to
such Worthen Stock Option divided by (z) the number of full shares
of Boatmen's Common deemed purchasable pursuant to such Worthen
Stock Option. In no event shall Boatmen's be required to issue
fractional shares of Boatmen's Common.

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding stock appreciation
right (a "Worthen SAR") issued pursuant to the Stock Option Plans
shall be assumed by Boatmen's as hereinafter provided. Each

19
<PAGE> 24
Worthen SAR shall be deemed to constitute a right to receive, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Worthen
SAR, an amount equal to the value of such Worthen SAR determined on
the applicable exercise date. From and after the Effective Time,
any references in the Stock Option Plans to the fair value of
Worthen Common shall mean and refer to the fair market value of the
number of shares of Boatmen's Common included in the Merger
Consideration.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Boatmen's
shall deliver to each holder of Worthen Stock Options and Worthen
SARs appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights
pursuant to the Stock Option Plans, and the agreements evidencing
the grants of such Worthen Stock Options and Worthen SARs shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
conversion required by this Section 5.04 after giving effect to the
Merger and the assumption by Boatmen's as set forth above). To the
extent necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.04,
Boatmen's may deliver new or amended agreements reflecting the
terms of each Worthen Stock Option or Worthen SAR option assumed by
Boatmen's and amend the Stock Option Plans to reflect the terms
hereof.

(d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Boatmen's
shall file with the S.E.C. a registration statement on an
appropriate form with respect to the shares of Boatmen's Common
subject to such options and shall use its best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses with respect thereto) for so long as such options
remain outstanding.

SECTION 5.05. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS' LIABILITY INSURANCE AND
------------ -----------------------------------------------
INDEMNIFICATION.
- ---------------

(a) Following the Effective Time, Boatmen's will provide the
directors and officers of Worthen and its subsidiaries with the
same directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage that
Boatmen's provides to directors and officers of its other banking
subsidiaries generally, and, in addition, for a period of three
years will use its best efforts to continue Worthen's directors'
and officers' liability insurance coverage with respect to actions
occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such
coverage is obtainable for an aggregate premium not to exceed the
annual premium presently being paid by Worthen. If the aggregate
premium of such insurance would exceed such maximum amount,
Boatmen's shall use its best efforts to procure such level of
insurance having the coverage described above as can be obtained
for an aggregate premium equal to such maximum amount.

(b) For ten years after the Effective Time, Boatmen's shall
cause the Surviving Corporation (the survivor of the Merger of
Worthen and AcquisitionCo following the Effective Time, the
"Surviving Corporation") to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
present and former officers, directors, employees and agents of
Worthen and its subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party") against
all losses, expenses, attorneys fees, claims, damages or
liabilities arising out of their status as such officer, director,
employee or agent or actions or omissions occurring on or prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, further, including without
limitation, any proceeding in which an Indemnified Party becomes or
may become involved as a witness, defendant or otherwise as a
result of any such action or omission) to the fullest extent
permitted under the Corporate Law and by Worthen's Articles of
Incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, including
provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the defense
of any action or suit. Boatmen's shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide indemnification in all situations in which
the Surviving Corporation board of directors could lawfully grant
such indemnification.

20
<PAGE> 25
(c) If after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation or
any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or
merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other
entity, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation
shall assume any remaining obligations set forth in this Section
5.05. If the Surviving Corporation shall liquidate, dissolve or
otherwise wind up its business, then Boatmen's shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party to the same extent
and on the same terms that the Surviving Corporation was so
obligated pursuant to this Section 5.05.

SECTION 5.06. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. Boatmen's shall, with
------------ -----------------
respect to each person who remains an employee of Worthen or its
subsidiaries following the Closing Date (each a "Continued
Employee"), provide the benefits described in this Section 5.06.
Subject to the right of subsequent amendment or termination in
Boatmen's discretion, each Continued Employee shall be entitled, as
a new employee of a subsidiary of Boatmen's, to participate in such
employee benefit plans, as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any
non-qualified employee benefit plans or deferred compensation,
stock option, bonus or incentive plans, or other employee benefit
or fringe benefit programs that may be in effect generally for
employees of all of Boatmen's subsidiaries (the "Boatmen's Plans"),
if and as a Continued Employee shall be eligible and, if required,
selected for participation therein and otherwise shall not be
participating in a similar plan maintained by Worthen after the
Effective Time. Worthen employees will be eligible to participate
on the same basis as similarly situated employees of other
Boatmen's subsidiaries. All such participation shall be subject to
such terms of such plans as may be in effect from time to time and
this Section 5.06 is not intended to give Continued Employees any
rights or privileges superior to those of other employees of
Boatmen's subsidiaries. Boatmen's may terminate or modify all
Employee Plans except insofar as benefits thereunder shall have
vested on the Closing Date and cannot be modified and Boatmen's
obligation under this Section 5.06 shall not be deemed or construed
so as to provide duplication of similar benefits but, subject to
that qualification, Boatmen's shall, for purposes of vesting and
any age or period of service requirements for commencement of
participation with respect to any Boatmen's Plans in which
Continued Employees may participate, credit each Continued Employee
with his or her term of service with Worthen and its subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.07. ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Boatmen's shall permit
------------ ---------------------
Worthen reasonable access in a manner which will avoid undue
disruption or interference with Boatmen's normal operations to its
properties and shall disclose and make available to Worthen all
books, documents, papers and records relating to its assets, stock,
ownership, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities,
including, but not limited to, all books of account (including the
general ledger), tax records, minute books of directors' and
stockholders' meetings, organizational documents, material
contracts and agreements, loan files, filings with any regulatory
authority, accountants' workpapers (if available and subject to the
respective independent accountants' consent), litigation files (but
only to the extent that such review would not result in a material
waiver of the attorney-client or attorney work product privileges
under the rules of evidence), plans affecting employees, and any
other business activities or prospects in which Worthen may have a
reasonable and legitimate interest in furtherance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Worthen will hold any
such information which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance
with the provisions of Section 8.01 hereof.

TERMINATION OR ABANDONMENT
--------------------------

SECTION 7.01. MUTUAL AGREEMENT. This Agreement may be
------------ ----------------
terminated by the mutual written agreement of Boatmen's and Worthen
at any time prior to the Closing Date, regardless of whether
approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the shareholders of
Worthen shall have been previously obtained.

SECTION 7.02. BREACH OF AGREEMENTS. In the event that there
------------ --------------------
is a breach in any of the representations and warranties or
agreements of Boatmen's or Worthen which, if not cured, would cause
a condition set forth in Sections 6.01(a) or (b), or 6.02(a) or
(b), respectively, not to be satisfied, which breach is not cured
within thirty (30) days after notice to cure such breach is given
to the breaching party by the non-breaching party, then the non-
breaching party, regardless of whether approval of this Agreement
and the Merger by the shareholders of Worthen shall have been
previously obtained, may terminate and cancel this Agreement by
providing written notice of such action to the other party hereto.

SECTION 7.03. ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS. Boatmen's may terminate
------------ ---------------------
this Agreement to the extent provided by Section 4.07 and this
Section 7.03 by giving written notice thereof to Worthen.

24
<PAGE> 29
SECTION 7.04. FAILURE OF CONDITIONS. In the event any of the
------------ ---------------------
conditions to the obligations of either party are not satisfied or
waived on or prior to the Closing Date, and if any applicable cure
period provided in Section 7.02 hereof has lapsed, then such party
may, regardless of whether approval of this Agreement and the
Merger by the shareholders of Worthen shall have been previously
obtained, terminate and cancel this Agreement by delivery of
written notice of such action to the other party on such date.

SECTION 7.05. REGULATORY APPROVAL DENIAL. If any regulatory
------------ --------------------------
application filed pursuant to Section 5.01 hereof should be finally
denied or disapproved by the respective regulatory authority, then
this Agreement thereupon shall be deemed terminated and canceled.
A request for additional information or undertaking by Boatmen's,
as a condition for approval, shall not be deemed to be a denial or
disapproval so long as Boatmen's diligently provides the requested
information or undertaking. In the event an application is denied
pending an appeal, petition for review, or similar such act on the
part of Boatmen's (hereinafter referred to as the "appeal") then
the application will be deemed denied unless Boatmen's prepares and
timely files such appeal and continues the appellate process for
purposes of obtaining the necessary approval.

SECTION 7.06. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL DENIAL. If this Agreement
------------ ---------------------------
and the Merger is not approved by the requisite vote of the
shareholders of Worthen at the Shareholders' Meeting, then either
party may terminate this Agreement.

SECTION 7.07. REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT MATTERS. In the event
------------ ------------------------------
that Worthen or any of its subsidiaries shall become a party or
subject to any new or amended written agreement, memorandum of
understanding, cease and desist order, imposition of civil money
penalties or other regulatory enforcement action or proceeding with
any federal or state agency charged with the supervision or
regulation of banks or bank holding companies (a "Regulatory
Matter") after the date of this Agreement, which such Regulatory
Matter is material to the financial condition, results of
operations, business or prospects of Worthen and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole, then Boatmen's may terminate this Agreement.

SECTION 7.08. FALL-APART DATE. If the Closing Date does not
------------ ---------------
occur on or prior to the expiration of the first anniversary of the
date of this Agreement, then this Agreement may be terminated by
either party by giving written notice thereof to the other.

SECTION 7.09. TERMINATION FEE. Upon the occurrence of a
------------ ---------------
Triggering Event (as defined below in this Section 7.09) after the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.06 hereof,
Worthen shall pay to Boatmen's, within two (2) business days after
the occurrence of the Triggering Event, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the sum of Eighteen Million Dollars
($18,000,000). As used herein, the term Triggering Event shall
mean the occurrence, prior to eighteen (18) months after the
termination of this Agreement as provided in the first sentence of
this Section 7.09, of any of the following: Worthen shall have
authorized, recommended, proposed or announced an intention to
authorize, recommend or propose, or entered into, an agreement with
any person (other than Boatmen's or a subsidiary thereof) to
(A) effect a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving
Worthen, (B) sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of assets of Worthen
or its subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the consolidated
assets of Worthen and its subsidiaries, or (C) issue, sell or
otherwise dispose of (including by way of merger, consolidation,
share exchange or any similar transaction) securities representing
20% or more of the voting power of Worthen or any subsidiaries
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Triggering Event shall
occur and no termination fee shall be payable as a result of
Worthen's acquisition by means of any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, stock issuance, purchase

25
<PAGE> 30
or any similar transaction of any entity having total consolidated
assets equal to or less than 50% of the total consolidated assets of
Worthen, provided Worthen is the surviving parent corporation in any
such transaction.

SECTION 7.10. SUPERIOR TRANSACTION. (a) Worthen may
------------ --------------------
terminate this Agreement if a corporation, partnership, person or
other entity or group shall have made an Acquisition Proposal (as
defined below) and, without causing a breach of any agreement of
Worthen as set forth in Article Four hereof, the Worthen Board of
Directors reasonably determines, in its good faith judgment and in
the exercise of its fiduciary duties (based as to legal matters on
the written opinion of legal counsel and as to financial matters on
the written opinion of an investment banking firm of national
reputation), that such Acquisition Proposal is more favorable to
the Worthen stockholders than this Agreement from a financial point
of view and that the failure to terminate this Agreement and accept
such alternative Acquisition Proposal would constitute a breach of
such fiduciary duties.

(b) The term "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean the making by
a qualified and financially capable person of any bona fide
proposal or offer to Worthen to effect a merger, consolidation or
similar transaction with Worthen, to acquire from Worthen
securities representing 20% or more of the voting power of Worthen
or to acquire subsidiaries or other assets of Worthen or its
subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the consolidated assets of
Worthen and its subsidiaries.

(c) In the event Worthen terminates this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.10, then Worthen shall pay to Boatmen's, within
two (2) business days of such termination by a wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the sum of Eighteen Million Dollars
($18,000,000). The provisions of this Section 7.10 shall be an
alternative to, but not in addition to, the termination fee
provisions of Section 7.09 hereof.

SECTION 7.11. DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW. In accordance with
------------ --------------------
Section 4.09 hereof, Worthen shall provide Boatmen's full and
complete access to its books, records and staff and those of its
subsidiaries to facilitate Boatmen's due diligence review of the
asset quality of Worthen and its subsidiaries. If Boatmen's, in
its sole and absolute discretion, should not be satisfied with the
results of such asset quality due diligence review or the asset
quality of Worthen and its subsidiaries generally, then Boatmen's
may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice thereof to
Worthen on or before the fifth (5th) business day after the date of
this Agreement.

SECTION 7.12. SHAREHOLDER LETTERS. Boatmen's may terminate
------------ -------------------
this Agreement if Worthen shall fail to obtain and deliver to
Boatmen's all of the Shareholder Letters of affiliates of Worthen
as of the date of this Agreement, as provided in Section 4.08
hereof, by giving written notice thereof to Worthen within a
reasonable time after such Shareholder Letters should have been
delivered, which shall be Boatmen's sole remedy in such event.

-------------------, 1994

Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.
One Boatmen's Plaza
800 Market Street
St. Louis, Missouri 63101
Attention: Gregory L. Curl
Vice Chairman

Re: Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 18, 1994
(the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Worthen Banking
Corporation ("Worthen"), Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.
("Boatmen's"), and BBI AcquisitionCo, Inc.
("AcquisitionCo")

Gentlemen:

I have been advised that I may be deemed to be an affiliate of
Worthen, as that term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and
(d) of Rule 145 ("Rule 145") of the Rules and Regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act").

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
each share of common stock of Worthen owned by me as of the
effective time of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(the "Merger") may be converted into the right to receive one (1)
share of common stock of Boatmen's and cash in lieu of any
fractional share. As used in this letter, the shares of common
stock of Worthen owned by me as of the date which is thirty (30)
days prior to the anticipated effective time of the Merger are
referred to as the "Pre-Merger Shares" and the shares of common
stock of Boatmen's which may be received by me in the Merger in
exchange for my Pre-Merger Shares are referred to as the "Post-
Merger Shares." This letter is delivered to Boatmen's pursuant to
Section 4.08 of the Merger Agreement.

A. I represent and warrant to Boatmen's and agree that:

1. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other
disposition of the Post-Merger Shares I receive pursuant to
the Merger in violation of Rule 145 under the Securities Act
(or any successor rule or regulations promulgated by the
Commission).

2. I understand that the issuance of the Post-Merger
Shares to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with
the Commission under the Securities Act. I also understand
that because I may be deemed an "affiliate" of Worthen and
because any distributions by me of the Post-Merger Shares will
not be registered under the Securities Act, such Post-Merger
Shares must be held by me unless (i) the sale, transfer or
other distribution has been registered under the Securities
Act, (ii) the sale, transfer or other distribution of such
Post-Merger Shares is made in accordance with the provisions
of Rule 145 (or any successor rule or regulations promulgated
by the Commission), or (iii) in the opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to Boatmen's some other exemption from
registration under the Securities Act is available with
respect to any such proposed distribution, sale, transfer or
other disposition of such Post-Merger Shares.

<PAGE> 38
Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.
- --------------------, 1994
Page 2

3. In no event will I sell the Pre-Merger Shares or the
Post-Merger Shares, as the case may be, or otherwise transfer
or reduce my risk relative to the Pre-Merger Shares or Post-
Merger Shares, as the case may be, during the period beginning
30 days prior to the date on which the Merger is consummated
(the "Commencement Date") and ending on the date that
Boatmen's has published financial results covering at least 30
days of the combined operations of Boatmen's and Worthen. I
understand that Worthen has undertaken, in the Merger
Agreement, to give me as much advance notice of the
Commencement Date as is practicable under the circumstances.

B. I understand and agree that:

1. Stop transfer instructions will be issued with
respect to the Post-Merger Shares and there will be placed on
the certificates representing such Post-Merger Shares, or any
certificate delivered in substitution therefor, a legend
stating in substance:

"The shares represented by this Certificate were issued
in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, applied. The shares represented
by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance
with the terms of a letter agreement dated
-----------------, 1994, by the registered holder in favor
of Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc., a copy of which agreement
is on file at the principal offices of Boatmen's
Bancshares, Inc."

2. Unless the transfer by me of Post-Merger Shares is a
sale made in compliance with the provisions of paragraph A.2
above, Boatmen's reserves the right to place the following
legend on the Certificates issued to my transferee:

"The shares represented by this Certificate have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and were acquired from a person who received such shares
in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, applied. The shares have not
been acquired by the holder with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may
not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred unless the
shares have been registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, or an exemption from registration is
available."

I understand and agree that the legends set forth in
paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall be removed by delivery of substitute
Certificates without any legend if I deliver to Boatmen's a copy of
a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Boatmen's, to the
effect that no such legend is required for the purpose of the
Securities Act.

I have carefully read this letter and have had an adequate
opportunity to review the Merger Agreement and understand the
requirements and the limitations imposed upon the distribution,
sale, transfer or other disposition of Pre-Merger Shares or Post-
Merger Shares by me.

Very truly yours,

WORTHEN BANKING CORPORATION
Annual Report on Form 10-K
For The Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 1993

PARTI

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Worthen Banking Corporation (hereinafter referred to as "WBC", "Company"
or "Registrant" and includes WBC's subsidiaries and affiliates unless the
context otherwise requires), was incorporated in the State of Arkansas in August
1968 to buy, sell, own and operate banks and to offer a diversified range of
commercial banking, trust and other financial services to retail and commercial
customers. The Company is the second largest multi-bank holding company in
Arkansas with corporate headquarters located in the Worthen National Bank
Building in Little Rock, Arkansas. Operations of the Company are conducted
through bank and nonbank subsidiaries and affiliates. The existing and future
activities of the Company are limited by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,
as amended, which generally prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring or
engaging in any businesses other than banking, managing or controlling banks,
and furnishing or performing certain bank related services and activities.

The Company is primarily engaged in buying, selling, owning, managing and
operating commercial banks and other financial services companies and its
subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the commercial banking, trust and
securities brokerage businesses. The income and other operating results of the
nonbank subsidiaries and affiliates as compared to the consolidated operating
results of the Company, are not substantial enough to require financial and
other information concerning industry segments to be included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

The Company commenced active operations in March, 1969 with the
acquisition of a controlling interest in Worthen National Bank of Arkansas,
Little Rock, Arkansas ("WNBA") and became a multi-bank holding company upon the
acquisition of a controlling interest in Worthen National Bank of Hot Springs,
Arkansas ("WNB-Hot Springs") in October, 1970. In 1971, the Arkansas legislature
enacted a law prohibiting the acquisition of additional banks, which law
remained in effect until the passage of Act 128 of 1983, the Arkansas Bank
Holding Company Act of 1983. Act 128, which permits the acquisition of
additional banks in accordance with certain guidelines, became effective
September 30, 1983. During fiscal year 1993, WBC owned eleven banks, which were
located in Arkansas and the Austin, Texas area. All of these are national banks,
chartered pursuant to the laws of the United States. Since its organization and
commencement of operations, WBC's revenues and net income or net losses have
resulted principally from its banking subsidiaries. In addition to commercial
banking, WBC also provides, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, mortgage
banking, appraisal services, trust services, credit life and disability
insurance, investment advisory services, full service and discount brokerage
services, data processing and other related financial services.

On May 7, 1993, Worthen Banking Corporation acquired 100% of the stock of
The Union of Arkansas Corporation ("Union") with the issuance of 4,550,000
shares of WBC common stock to the Union stockholders. Union's principal
subsidiary bank, Union National Bank of Arkansas ("Union-Little Rock"), was
merged with WNBA on May 28, 1993. Union-Little Rock was a commercial bank with
approximately $595 million in assets, $482 million in deposits and $54 million
in equity operating from twenty-two locations in central and southern Arkansas
and had two mortgage banking subsidiaries. Union's only other banking subsidiary
was Union National Bank of Texas ("Union-Texas") operating out of six locations
in Austin, Texas. Union-Texas had approximately $120 million in assets, $112
million in deposits and $6 million in equity at December 31, 1992. Union-Texas
has been renamed Worthen National Bank of Texas. This transaction was accounted
for using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting.

On September 10, 1993, the Company acquired 100% of First Bentonville
Bancshares, Inc., the parent corporation of First Bank of Bentonville, Arkansas
("FirstBank"). WBC paid approximately $3.9 million in cash, $4.1 million in debt
repayment and 250,000 newly-issued shares of WBC's common stock. For the year
ended December 31, 1992, FirstBank reported total assets of $88,546,000, net
interest income of $2,826,000 and net income of $805,000. FirstBank was merged
into Worthen National Bank of Northwest Arkansas on October 31, 1993. This
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations of
FirstBank are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from
the date of purchase.

<PAGE>

Each subsidiary of the Company operates with a high degree of autonomy.
WBC, as the corporate parent, provides various technical and advisory services
and establishes general policy for the management and coordination of the
resources of its subsidiaries to more effectively service the credit and
financial services needs of the subsidiaries' customers and communities. The
Company coordinates the activities of its subsidiaries in certain areas,
including without limitation, credit policy, accounting, internal auditing,
regulatory compliance, loan review, investment coordination, asset/liability
management, public relations, and business development. However, the
subsidiaries operate under the direct supervision and day-to-day management of
their own directors and officers who formulate their own policies subject to the
Company's general policy guidelines and regulatory compliance.

WBC's principal sources of income are dividends and management service
fees paid by its subsidiaries. Dividend payments are determined quarterly in
relation to subsidiary income, assets, deposit growth and capital position in
compliance with regulatory guidelines and, in certain cases, prior regulatory
approval. Management service fees represent reimbursements received for services
performed by the corporate parent.

COMMERCIAL BANKING SUBSIDIARIES

The Company's principal source of income is derived from its eleven
subsidiary commercial banks and through certain of its nonbank subsidiaries. The
main offices of these subsidiaries are located in Batesville, Camden, Conway,
Fayetteville, Harrison, Hot Springs, Little Rock, Newark, Pine Bluff and
Russellville, Arkansas and Austin, Texas. All offer a broad range of commercial
bank services to the markets and communities which they serve, as well as
provide other related financial services in a majority of locations.

BANK RELATED SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

The Company's non-bank subsidiaries include: 1) a full service and
discount brokerage company, which is a registered broker dealer and investment
adviser, whose business is conducted at a majority of the Company's banking
subsidiaries throughout the state; 2) a mortgage banking company whose business
is originating and servicing mortgage loans; 3) a credit life insurance company
which insures or reinsures credit life and accident and health insurance; 4) a
data processing and operations support company which provides data processing
and transmission services, item processing and similar functions for the
Company's banking subsidiaries; 5) a trust company which provides trust
administration and operations; 6) an appraisal company whose business is
appraising property proposed to be offered as loan collateral; and 7) two small
and relatively inactive companies related to industrial lending and real estate
development.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

The following summaries of statutes and regulations affecting bank
holding companies and their commercial banking subsidiaries do not purport to be
complete but are given to provide a general overview. The summaries are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of the statutes and
regulations summarized.

STATE USURY LAW

Prior to its amendment in 1982, the Constitution of the State of Arkansas
limited the rate of interest which could be charged on borrowed funds to 10% per
annum simple interest, and provided for forfeiture of principal and interest in
the event that a greater amount of interest was charged or received. The effect
of that constitutional limitation had been mitigated to some extent by Public
Law 96-221 (the "Deregulation Act") under which the United States Congress,
pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, pre-empted
state constitutions and state usury laws in regard to business-and agricultural
loans over $1,000 in amount and in regard to first mortgage residential real
estate loans. Under the Deregulation Act, WBC's lending affiliates were
permitted to make business and agricultural loans at 5% over the applicable
Federal Reserve Bank discount rate and first mortgage residential real estate
loans without any percentage limitation. The usury pre-emptive provisions of the
Deregulation Act expired generally on April 15, 1985, although loans made prior
to that date continue to be governed by the provisions of the Deregulation Act
The first mortgage real estate loan preemption in the Deregulation Act continues
in effect and will constitute a permanent preemption of the Constitution of the
State of Arkansas in regard to first mortgage residential real estate loans.

<PAGE>

In 1982, The Interest Rate Control Amendment ("Constitutional Amendment")
to the Constitution of the State of Arkansas was adopted, which provides, in
summary, that "consumer loans and credit sales" have a maximum percentage
limitation of 17% per annum and that all "general loans" have a maximum
limitation of 5% over the Federal Reserve Discount Rate in effect at the time
the loan was made. In 1983, the Arkansas Supreme Court determining that
"consumer loans and credit sales" are "general loans" and are subject to the
limitation of 5% over the Federal Reserve Discount Rate, as well as a maximum
limitation of 17% per annum. The Constitutional Amendment also provided
penalties for usurious "general loans" and "consumer loans and credit sales,"
including forfeiture of all principal and interest on consumer loans and credit
sales made at a greater rate of interest than 17% per annum, and, on "general
loans" made at usurious rates, forfeiture of uncollected interest and refund to
the borrower of twice the interest collected.

The relative importance of the Arkansas usury laws and federal
pre-emption thereof to the financial operations of WBC varies from time to time,
depending on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and
prevailing interest rates. Limitations on the interest earnings of WBC
subsidiary banks occur during periods of high interest rates. The effect of
such limitations cannot be accurately predicted because of the factors
mentioned above.

The Texas usury law establishes different usury limits for various
types of loans. These interest rate limits may vary from time to time. The
interest rate limitations currently in effect are more than sufficient when
compared to prevailing interest rates.

STATE REGULATION

The Arkansas Bank Holding Company Act of 1983 permits Arkansas bank
holding companies to own and control multiple banks and subjects Arkansas bank
holding companies to regulation by the Arkansas State Bank Department. Under
Arkansas law, bank holding companies are limited to owning or controlling banks
having in the aggregate no more than 25% of the total deposits held by all state
and national banks in Arkansas. For purposes of this limitation, deposits
include all individual, partnership, and corporate deposits, but not
correspondent accounts of banks or the fluids of national, state, or local
government authorities.

The Arkansas State Bank Department ("ASBD") is authorized to administer
the provisions of the Arkansas Bank Holding Company Act and to determine those
activities of bank holding companies that it deems to be "directly related to
banking activities." Under current interpretations and regulations of the ASBD,
permissible non-banking activities under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,
as amended, are given due consideration as being "directly related to banking
activities" under the Arkansas Act.

During 1988, the Arkansas General Assembly passed Act 539 which
authorized county-wide and eventually statewide branching and regional
interstate banking effective January 1, 1989. Unlimited branching in contiguous
counties will be allowed beginning alter 1993 while unlimited statewide
branching will become effective after 1998.

The Texas Banking Code permits an "out-of state" bank holding company
to acquire control of a bank located in the state of Texas, if such bank
received a charter and was continually operated for at least five years prior
to the acquisition, and subjects the "out-of state" bank holding company to the
supervision and regulation by the Banking Department of Texas. On January 29,
1993, the Company entered into an agreement with the Banking Department of
Texas as required by the Texas Banking Code. Pursuant to the agreement, the
Company represented that Worthen National Bank of Texas ("Worthen-Texas")
would comply with applicable capital adequacy guidelines and that the
consolidated equity capital of Worthen-Texas during the first three years
after the acquisition will at all times equal or exceed the dollar level
existing immediately prior to the acquisition. The Company further agreed that
a majority of the board of directors of Worthen-Texas will reside in the state
of Texas, that it would not acquire an institution located in the state of
Texas, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, unless the institution is a bank as defined by the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended, and that additional information or reports
would be filed with the Banking Department of Texas upon request.

Under the Texas Banking Code an "out-of state" bank holding company is
limited in that it can not control more than 25% of the total deposits of all
state and national banks domiciled in the state of Texas. For purpose of this
limitation, the term "deposit" is given the meaning assigned to that term in
Section 23 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended.

ARKANSAS CORPORATE CODE

In 1987, the Arkansas General Assembly passed the Arkansas Business
Corporation Act of 1987 (the "1987 Act"), which was signed into law on April 14,
1987, and which became effective January 1, 1988. As a compromise to the passage
of the 1987 Act, the General Assembly included a provision allowing existing
Arkansas corporations to continue to be governed by the present corporate code
(the "1965 Act"), unless a corporation affirmatively elected to be governed
under the 1987 Act The 1987 Act provides that existing Arkansas corporations,
such as WBC, may elect to be governed by its provisions upon receiving requisite
stockholder approval and further that such an election, once made, is
irrevocable.

On February 23, 1988, WBC's stockholders adopted and approved various
proposals, including a proposal to amend and restate the Articles of
Incorporation adopting the 1987 Act as the corporate law which shall govern the
affairs of WBC. WBC's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation were
subsequently filed with the Arkansas Secretary of State and became effective
February 24, 1988. Upon the filing of the Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation, the 1987 Act became the applicable state corporate code governing
the affairs of WBC. The 1987 Act was based primarily upon the American Bar
Association's Model Business Corporation Act as substantially revised in 1984
and was legislated in partly the need to update and modernize the law affectIng
Arkansas corporations. In general as compared to the 1965 Act, the 1987 Act is
thought to be more flexible, easier to understand, and to permit corporations to
avail themselves of many modern financIng techniques and management procedures
not available under the 1965 Act. The 1987 Act should result in more predictable
judicial interpretations by Arkansas courts.

BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED

WBC is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHC Act"), and is registered as such with the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System("FRB"). As a bank holding
company, WBC is required to file with the FRB an annual report and such
additional information as the FRB may require pursuant to the BHC Act The FRB
also periodically examines WBC and each of its subsidiaries. Under the terms of
the BHC Act, WBC, as a bank holding company, is generally required to obtain
regulatory approval from the FRB before it may acquire or dispose of a
substantial interest in any bank or bank holding company.

With certain exceptions, the BHC Act further restricts nonbanking
acquisitions by registered bank holding companies to shares of companies whose
activities the FRB deems to be so closely related to banking or managing or
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In making such
determinations, the FRB is required to consider whether the performance of such
activities by an affiliate can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the
public, such as increased competition or gains in efficiency, against the risks
of possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.

The FRB has determined by regulation that certain activities, including
among others making and servicing loans, operating an industrial loan
institution, performing certain fiduciary functions, leasing real and personal
property, providing certain investment and financing advice and brokerage
services, performing certain data processing operations, acting as an insurance
agent for certain types of insurance, and underwriting credit life and
disability insurance related to credit transactions within the particular
holding company system, among others, are permissible activities for bank
holding companies and their affiliates.

Further the BHC Act and regulations of the FRB prohibit bank holding
companies, such as WBC, from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in
connection with extensions of credit, lease or sale transactions or the
furnishing of services.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES

On January 19, 1989, the FRB issued final guidelines to implement
risk-based capital requirements for bank holding companies. The guidelines
establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital
requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking
organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures into account in assessing
capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk
assets. The Company's year end 1993 total risk based capital ratio of 14.11%
exceeds the current minimum regulatory requirement of 8.00%.

FEDERAL RESERVE ACT

The FRB has cease-and-desist powers over parent holding companies and
nonbanking subsidiaries where actions of such holding companies and nonbanking
subsidiaries would constitute a serious threat to the safety, soundness or
stability of a subsidiary bank. The FRB also has authority to regulate debt
obligations, other thin commercial paper, issued by bank holding companies.

The Company is an "affiliate" of its subsidiary banking institutions and
will be an "affiliate" of any other acquired banks within the meaning of the
Federal Reserve Act The Federal Reserve Act imposes restrictions on loans by the
subsidiary banks to WBC or to any other affiliated companies, on investments by
the subsidiary banks in the securities of WBC, and on the use of such securities
as collateral security for loans by subsidiary banks to any borrower. WBC is
also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the business of
issuing, underwriting, public sale and distribution of securities. In the event
that WBC's subsidiary banks experience significant loan losses or rapid growth
of loans or deposits, WBC may, as the sole or majority shareholder, be required
by regulatory authorities to invest additional capital in order to maintain the
capital of each subsidiary bank at or above applicable regulatory minima.

GENERAL

The national bank subsidiaries of WBC are subject to supervision and
regular examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC").
All of WBC's subsidiary banks are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") which currently insures the deposits of each member bank
to a maximum of $100,000 per deposit relationship. For this protection, each
bank pays a semi-annual statutory assessment to the FDIC and is subject to the
rules and regulations of the FDIC and to examinations by the FDIC. WBC and its
subsidiaries (including bank-related subsidiaries) are also subject to
examinations and regulation by the FRB under provisions of the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended, and WBC is required to file annual reports with
the FRB and the ASBD, annual and other periodic reports with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, and to file such additional reports as the
FRB may require pursuant to that Act.

The bank subsidiaries and their affiliates are subject to various state
and federal statutes and regulations governing capital, reserves, deposits,
investments, loans, mergers, issuance of securities, dividends, establishment of
branches, brokerage and investment advisory services and other aspects of their
operations.

The approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends
declared by the Board of Directors of any national bank subsidiary in any
calendar year exceeds the total of the respective bank's net income for that
year combined with retained net profit for the preceding two years, less any
transfers to surplus.

Various bills and regulations including the Financial Institutions
Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978, the Depository Institutions
Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, the Garn-St. Germain Depository
Institutions Act of 1982, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and
Enforcement Act of 1989 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 have been enacted or adopted, and other legislation is
being considered in the United States Congress and various other governmental
regulatory and legislative bodies which could result in additional regulation
affecting WBC and its subsidiaries and otherwise affect the powers of banks,
bank holding companies, and bank-related companies.

MONETARY POLICY

The monetary policy of the FRB has a significant effect on the operating
results of bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks as a result of its
controlling influence upon the national supply and cost of bank credit. The FRB
implements monetary policy principally through open market operations in U.S.
Government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings,
and change in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are
used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of
bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use affects interest rates
charged on loans or paid for deposits. The policies of the FRB have a direct
effect on the amount of bank loans and deposits and the interest rates charged
and paid thereon.

FRB monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of
commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the
future. WBC's financial statements reflect the various effects of monetary
policies. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies
on the future business and earnings of WBC cannot be accurately predicted;
however, such economic policies can materially affect the revenues and net
income of commercial banks.

PATENTS, SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS AND CUSTOMERS

Patents or trademarks are not material to the conduct of the Company's
business. Historically, the business of the Company has not been seasonal in
nature nor does management of WBC anticipate any differences or seasonal trends
in the future. Although certain depositors and loan customers are important to
the Company's banking subsidiaries, the Company is not dependent upon any single
customer or a few customers, the loss of any one or more of which would have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of
the Company on a consolidated basis.

COMPETITION

The activities engaged in by WBC and its subsidiaries are highly
competitive. With each activity engaged in, the Company encounters intense
competition from other banks, lending institutions, credit unions, savings and
loan associations, brokerage firms, mortgage companies, industrial loan
associations, finance companies, and several other financial and financial
service institutions. The amount of competition has increased significantly over
the past few years since the deregulation of the banking industry. The Company's
subsidiary banks actively compete with other banks and financial institutions in
their efforts to obtain deposits and make loans, in the scope and type of
services offered, in interest rates paid on time deposits and charged on loans
and in other aspects of commercial banking. They are also in competition with
major international retail establishments, brokerage firms and other financial
institutions within and outside Arkansas. Competition with these financial
institutions is expected to increase, especially with the passage of
legislation authorizing interstate banking.

According to information obtained from the Arkansas Association of Bank
Holding Companies, during 1993 there were approximately 34 multi-bank holding
companies in Arkansas and an approximate 104 additional single bank holding
companies. As of December 31, 1993, the Company was the second largest
multi-bank holding company in Arkansas in terms of total assets and total
deposits.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 1993, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 2,252
persons. None of the employees are represented by any union or similar groups
and the Company has not experienced any labor disputes or strikes arising from
any such organized labor groups. The Company considers its relationship with its
employees to be good.

In addition to the foregoing persons, executive officers of the Company's
banking subsidiaries are members of a committee that exercises certain policy

subsidiaries to serve for terms set from time to time by such Boards until
re-elected or replaced.

SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION

The information required in response to this portion of Item 1 is
incorporated by reference from the disclosures contained in the Registrant's
1993 Annual Report to Stockholders, portions of which are included herein as
Exhibit 13.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

The principal offices of the Company and its largest subsidiary, WNBA, are
located in the Worthen National Bank of Arkansas building at 200 West Capitol
Avenue in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas. The building is owned by WNBA.

The Company and its banking subsidiaries maintain 119 locations throughout
the State of Arkansas and the Austin, Texas area. The majority of these offices
are owned by the respective subsidiary banks. In the opinion of management of
the Company, the physical properties of the Company and its subsidiaries are
adequate and fully utilized.

<PAGE>

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

In the ordinary course of business, there are various legal proceedings
pending against the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, most of which are
considered litigation incidental to the conduct of business, including, among
other matters, defense of routine corporate, employment, banking, lender
liability and securities related litigation. Management, after consultation with
legal counsel and based upon available facts and proceedings to date which are
preliminary in certain instances, is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution
of these proceedings will have no material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position of the Company. However, certain matters disclosed in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993, may be
considered to be material in amount or nature.

In January of 1993, the Company, its directors, and certain of its officers
and shareholders were sued in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, in WINICKI V. WORTHEN BANKING CORPORATION, ET AL..
93-CIV-0135. The complaint alleged that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), Rule 14a-9 of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC" or "Commission"), and certain state
law provisions relating to fiduciary duties in connection with the matters
disclosed in the Company's proxy statement distributed in December of 1992. The
complaint was filed as a class action and sought an injunction to prevent the
Company from holding a special meeting or from consummating certain transactions
which were the subject of the proxy statement, and unspecified monetary damages.

The Company has denied all material allegations in the complaint and in
January 1993, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU")
under which the Company agreed to distribute revised disclosure material to its
shareholders and not to oppose an application by plaintiff's counsel for fees
in an agreed amount.

On January 21, 1994, the Court provisionally certified a class for purposes
of settlement. The settlement remains subject to Court approval following a
fairness hearing at which class members may raise any objections to the
settlement. Notice of the settlement was sent to class members beginning on
February 9, 1994, and a fairness hearing is scheduled for April 5, 1994.

On March 31, 1993, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
("FED") advised WBC that the Company's application to merge The Union of
Arkansas Corporation with a subsidiary of WBC had been approved. The FED
approved the merger, in part, in reliance upon representations and commitments
made to the FED by the Company, by Stephens Group, Inc.
and by certain Stephens family members. These included a representation that
Stephens Group, Inc. does not and will not exert control over the management and
policies of WBC and that Stephens Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries will comply
with the restrictions imposed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve
Act. Management believes that such representations and commitments will not
materially affect the Company's general business policies, financial condition,
or results of operations. The Company has also been advised that the FED has
made a determination that Stephens Group, Inc. and its affiliates, are
affiliates of the Company, as that term is defined in Sections 23A and 23B of
the Federal Reserve Act.

The Board of Governors also notified the Company on March 31, 1993 that the
Board of Governors had ordered an investigation to review the ownership and
control of the Company for compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act and the
Change in Bank Control Act, including the nature and extent of the relationships
between the Company and Stephens Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Company
is not aware of any assertion by the Board of Governors that the Company is not
in compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act or the Change in Bank Control
Act. In the event the Board of Governors determines that there has been a
violation of the Bank Holding Company Act, it is authorized to initiate certain
administrative enforcement actions against the Company and its
institution-affiliated parties. These actions could include, among other things,
the issuance of an order to cease and desist or the assessment of monetary
penalties against the Company or its institution-affiliated parties. The amount
of such monetary penalties, if any, would be determined by the Board of
Governors on the basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged
violations and might or might not have a material adverse effect upon the
Company's financial condition or results of operations. In addition, under
regulations promulgated by the Board of Governors, in the event it determines
that an impermissible control relationship exists, it would have discretion to
order either termination of the impermissible control relationship, or the
filing of an application seeking the approval of such control relationship, or
to pursue other remedial actions. However, the Company cannot now predict the
results or the final outcome of the investigation. The Company intends to
continue to cooperate with the Board of Governors in this investigation.

WILKINS V. UNION NATIONAL BANK Case No. 90 CH 9203, in the Circuit Court of
Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division. In September of
1990, plaintiffs Herbert L. Wilkins and Mary Wilkins sued Union National Bank
("Union") in a purported class action complaint which sought remedies against
both Union and WNBA as successor of Union, including: (1) a declaration that
Union's method of calculating escrow deposit requirements was unlawful, (2)
refunds of excess escrow balances existing in mortgage escrow accounts (through
application of such balances as prepayments of mortgage principal or through
direct refunds), (3) payment of interest on excess escrow balances carried in
such escrow accounts, (4) punitive damages in an unspecified amount, (5) an
injunction prohibiting defendant from imposing excessive escrow requirements in
the future, and (6) attorney's fees.

Union and WNBA have denied all material allegations of the complaint.
Management of WNBA believes that WNBA has valid and meritorious defenses to
the allegations set forth in the complaint and intends to defend this matter
vigorously unless a settlement satisfactory to WNBA can be reached. WNBA has
reached a settlement agreement on a basis favorable to WNBA with counsel for
plaintiffs. The settlement is subject to court approval, which has not yet
been obtained.

WORTHEN BANKING CORPORATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
During May of 1993, Worthen Banking Corporation ("WBC" or the "Company")
merged with The Union of Arkansas Corporation ("Union"), a $700 million bank
holding company headquartered in Little Rock. This transaction was accounted for
using the "pooling-of-interests" method of acquisition accounting. Under this
method, all historical financial information is added together as if the
combining companies had always been one company. Accordingly, no goodwill is
established in a transaction of this type. Also, every number presented in this
report, both current and historical for all periods presented, has been restated
to reflect this method of accounting.
The Company recorded net income of $32.3 million or $1.92 per share in 1993
which was slightly below the $33.9 million or $2.05 per share recorded in 1992.
As a result of the merger described above, the Company recorded approximately
$11.0 million of pre-tax non-recurring expenses related to the merger. Of this
amount, approximately $1.4 million of expense was taken related to a write-down
of purchased mortgage servicing rights to reflect WBC's analysis methods. Also,
a provision for loan losses of $1.5 million and expenses related to foreclosed
property of $0.3 million were recorded. These additional expenses were recorded
to conform the loan loss allowance methodology and policies of Union to WBC's
policies. The remainder of the expenses were net cash outflows for expenses
occurring primarily during the second quarter and also throughout the remainder
of 1993. Additional expenses were non-recurring employment expenses of $0.7
million, legal expenses of $1.5 million, investment banking fees of $2.1
million, expenses related to closed and closing branches of $1.3 million and
office supplies and expenses of $0.3 million. The remainder of the expenses were
for signage, various data processing conversions, accounting fees and other
non-recurring amounts. WBC also recorded gains of approximately $5.4 million
related to the sale of certain investment securities of Union in order to
realign the maturity of Union's investment portfolio consistent with WBC's
investment policies. A gain of $0.8 million was recognized on the sale of the
Union corporate jet airplane. Management of WBC believes that none of these
expenses or gains would have occurred without the merger.
The Company's pretax income for 1993 was $47.6 million compared to $40.6
million in 1992, a 17.2% increase. Excluding the effects of the net expenses
described above, the Company's pretax income would have increased by $4.8
million or 29%.
The effective income tax rate in 1993 was 34.0% compared to 16.5% in 1992.
Income tax expense increased by $9.5 million to $16.2 million. Prior to 1993,
the Company utilized tax loss carry forwards and previously unrecognized
deferred tax assets to reduce income taxes. WBC expects to experience tax
rates in the 34% to 36% range in 1994.
During September of 1993, the Company acquired 100% of First Bentonville
Bancshares, Inc. ("FirstBank"). With assets of approximately $110 million,
FirstBank was merged with another of WBC's affiliate banks, Worthen National
Bank of Northwest Arkansas, in October 1993.
In May of 1993, the Company borrowed $43 million in senior, unsecured notes
from several institutional investors. Approximately $39.3 million, or
substantially all, of the Company's existing term debt was repaid with the
proceeds of these notes. These notes mature in five to seven years and have a
weighted average fixed rate of interest of approximately 7.61%.

</TABLE>

As shown by the table above, if the effects of changes in the balances of
bankers' acceptances and commercial paper are excluded, the Company's loan
portfolio realized growth of approximately $173 million in 1993, representing
annualized growth of almost 12%. Although approximately $68 million of the loan
growth is attributable to the acquisition of FirstBank in September 1993, the
remaining bank franchise of the Company added $105 million in loans during the
year. Economic conditions in Arkansas were favorable for loan growth during
1993, but management also encouraged the development of good quality loans more
in the current year than was emphasized in the recent past. Improvements in the
asset quality and financial performance of the Company coincided with good
economic conditions to create the appropriate environment for quality loan
portfolio growth.
Roughly half of the 1993 loan growth, or $89 million, was in the real
estate mortgage and real estate construction loan balances. Much of this growth
is the result of the FirstBank acquisition which, at the date of acquisition,
had $56 million in real estate loans. Bentonville is located in the economically
vibrant northwest Arkansas region, resulting in a high proportion of real estate
mortgage and development loans. Several of the other banking affiliates,
primarily those located in the central and river valley regions of the state
also experienced good loan demand in 1993, as reflected in the strong increases
in the commercial and consumer loan balances. Those components grew by $39
million and $45 million, respectively, in the current year. The Company's
extensive branch network and focus on community bank lending produced those
results. The lowest interest rates since the 1970's also provided the impetus
for new construction and refinancings, particularly in the single-family
residential market.
Concentrations in the loan portfolio are monitored as part of our risk
management strategy. As a matter of policy, the Company

9

<PAGE>

infrequently provides financing for speculative ventures, preferring instead to
act as a short-term financing source for loan customers that are building or
expanding owner-occupied properties. The exception to this strategy is the
single-family development market, in which the Company is an active lender.
Single family residential lending is an important source of lending volume for
the Company, accounting for approximately $255 million in outstanding loans at
December 31, 1993, or almost one third of the real estate portfolio. The loan
loss and delinquency performance of this portion of the portfolio has been
exceptional, and the Company therefore considers this concentration to contain
little risk. The Company's credit policies discourage the financing of certain
types of properties that have proven to be sources of loan problems in the past,
such as hotels, shopping centers, and multi-family properties. The total of
extensions secured by these property types was approximately $60 million at
December 31, 1993, or less than 10% of the real estate portfolio. Unsecured
lending is tightly controlled, with unsecured loans totalling less than $50
million at the end of 1993. In addition, almost $110 million of outstanding
loans at December 31, 1993 were secured by marketable securities or cash
collateral. Because of the Company's risk management practices, the commercial
and real estate loan portfolio is considered to be well-diversified. The table
depicting the Company's 1993 net charge-off's to average loan ratios underscores
the degree of caution exercised in our lending activities.
During 1993, the Company made notable improvements in the level of
nonperforming assets, reducing the total from $30 million at December 31, 1992
to $23 million at December 31, 1993, in spite of the acquisition of Bentonville
and overall loan portfolio growth of $173 million. At December 31, 1993, the
Company's nonperforming assets equalled just 1.4% of total loans plus
nonperforming assets, after being as high as 3.8% in the earlier periods
presented. Based upon September 30, 1993 data, this ratio is substantially
better than the Company's peer group, which recorded a nonperforming asset ratio
of 1.74% of loans plus nonperforming assets. All components of nonperformings
were improved, which management attributes to diligent workout efforts over the
past year and to the Company's credit risk management practices, which serve to
reduce the number of new relationships that enter nonperforming status.
Management is not aware of any specific relationships or groups of loans whose
trends would indicate a reversal of the recent decline in nonperformings is
anything but permanent, in fact, subsequent to December 31, 1993 the Company
negotiated the sale of one parcel of Other Real Estate Owned with a book value
of $2.4 million. The consummation of the sale, which is expected to occur m the
first or second quarter of 1994, will result in a gain and will produce a
meaningful reduction in nonperforming assets. One other nonperforming asset with
a book balance of $0.8 million was also paid off subsequent to year end.

</TABLE>

The activity in the allowance for loan losses ("ALLL") is shown in the
previous table. The acquisition of FirstBank is reflected by the $892 thousand
"allowance of purchased bank at date of acquisition" in the 1993 activity.
During 1993, loan losses of $6.0 million were recognized, the lowest total in
the five years presented. This reduction mirrors the trend in asset quality
discussed previously. Approximately $ 1.1 million of the 1993 charge-offs were
realized from two large loan relationships acquired in the Union merger, which
were anticipated by the preacquisition due diligence. The majority of the
remaining charge-offs experienced in 1993 were related to the consumer lending
business, and remained fairly consistent with the experience of previous years.
Recoveries of loans previously charged-off totaled $3.6 million in 1993 and
exceeded the experience of 1992; as a result, net loans charged-off declined to
$2.4 million in 1993 compared to $5.2 million in 1992, representing a paltry net
loss ratio of 0.15% of average loans as compared to 0.34% in 1992. Management is
pleased with these results and remains confident that the conservative credit
risk management practices will continue to manifest themselves in manageable
future loan loss experience.
Loan loss provisions charged to operations totaled $4.6 million in 1993
compared to $2.8 million in 1992. As a component of the non-recurring expenses
recorded during the Union merger, a special $ 1.5 million loan loss provision
was made by the Little Rock bank upon consummation of the merger. Additional
loan loss provisions of $2.5 million were recorded by the Little Rock affiliate
throughout 1993 in accordance with the established 1993 budget, primarily to
accommodate the bank's loan growth. Because of the assessment of ALLL adequacy
at the Company's other banking subsidiaries, nominal loan loss provisions were
required to maintain the allowance at an acceptable level.
The ALLL to loans ratio was 2.02% at December 31, 1993 as compared to 1.93%
at the end of 1992. The Company prefers to maintain the allowance ratio at
levels that may not appear to be commensurate with the reported asset quality
and risk profile of the loan portfolio, in order to preserve the flexibility to
absorb temporary fluctuations in asset quality or growth without requiring
abnormal loan loss provisions. The Company's peer group ratio averaged 2.67% at
September 30, 1993 (the latest data available). Further, the ratio of the
allowance to nonperforming loans was a solid 185% at December 31, 1993
versus 144% at the end of 1992 and a corresponding peer ratio of 124% at
September 30, 1993.
The allowance for loan losses is evaluated for adequacy utilizing
methodologies that management believes conform to the documentation and analysis
requirements of the Company's regulatory agencies. The methodologies used
consider the

12

<PAGE>

Company's historical loss experience of certain risk categories, portfolio and
borrower concentrations, economic conditions, portfolio growth and asset quality
trends, among other factors, as a means to measure allowance adequacy. Based
upon the latest such evaluation performed as of December 31, 1993, management
considers the allowance fully adequate to absorb the potential losses inherent
in the loan portfolio. Additionally, the Company is examined periodically by its
regulators. Part of the examination procedures include an evaluation of ALLL
adequacy, the results of which were favorable in the last examination performed
in 1993.

INVESTMENTS
Assets managed as investments, including interest-bearing deposits in other
banks, federal funds sold, and investment securities, represent approximately
43% of the total assets of the Company. Management's philosophy remains
unchanged from prior years: to remove virtually all credit risk from the
investment portfolio and to use the maturity structure to maintain liquidity and
interest rate risk within an acceptable range. The over all weighted average
maturity of the investment securities portfolio is 29 months. Approximately 35%
of the portfolio consists of mortgage-related securities, with relatively short
expected maturities. Approximately 56% of the portfolio represents treasury and
agency non-mortgage obligations.
During 1993, holdings in treasury and agency securities and state and
political subdivision securities increased while "other" securities and bankers
acceptances and commercial paper (classified as loans in this report) declined
as a consequence of market conditions and the corporation's tax status.
Management does not foresee any change in its investment

it is anticipated that between 10% and 15% of the portfolio will be classified

DEPOSITS AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
Total average deposits have increased less than 1% from
1992 to 1993 as compared to a $367 million increase from 1991 to
1992. Approximately 66% of the deposit increase in 1992 was due
to acquisitions while the remainder came from growth in the
market place. The deposit base as a percentage of average assets
has decreased slightly to 85.9% at December 31, 1993, compared to
87.9% and 88.1% at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
The year-end balances of certificates of deposit and other
time deposits over $100,000 has fluctuated from $209.0 million
and $207.0 million at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively,
to $209.7 million at December 31, 1993. The accompanying table

Short-term borrowings, which consist of U.S. Treasury Note
borrowings (see Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements), have fluctuated from $20.6 million at December 31,
1992 to $57.8 million at December 31, 1993. The fluctuations in
short-term borrowings directly relate to treasury tax deposits
from bank customers at year end in transit through the Federal
Reserve System to the Internal Revenue Service.
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement
to repurchase increased $26.9 million from the previous year. No

NET INTEREST INCOME
Both net interest income and the net interest margin improved slightly
during 1993, compared with the prior year. Additional volumes of net earning
assets due to acquisitions and growth contributed approximately 65% or $13.7
million of the $21.2 million increase in net interest income from 1991 to 1992.
The loan to deposit ratio has increased from 50.3% in December 1992 to
53.0% in December 1993, thereby increasing the percentage of loans to total
assets. WBC currently has the largest banks in the northwest and central areas
of the state. Average earning assets increased $70 million in 1993 compared to
1992 and $380 million in 1992 compared to 1991.
Interest rates in the current interest rate cycle peaked in mid-1989 and
have fallen since that time. During this decline in the overall level of
interest rates, the Company's net interest spread narrowed, especially in 1991,
when WBC was affected by deposits acquired from the RTC during the latter part
of 1990. At that time, the Company locked in one to two year rates on
certificates of deposit ("CDs"). As interest rates dropped in 1991, the yield
earned on assets dropped faster than CDs repriced. However, this effect on
spread was mitigated as these CDs matured and were renewed at substantially
lower rates. With a 53.0% loan to deposit ratio at December 31, 1993, the
Company maintains a significant portion of its assets in investment securities
with relatively short maturities which tends to decrease our overall asset
yields.
Interest rate spread increased by 9 basis points (100 basis points equals
one percentage point) from 3.66% in 1992 to 3.75% in 1993. While average earning
asset yields decreased 67 basis points between years, the average cost of
interest bearing liabilities declined 76 basis points, creating the net rate
increase.
Comparing the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1992, net
interest income increased $1.6 million. Rate spread decreased 5 basis points
between periods from 3.85% to 3.80%.

LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY
The Company's negative gap increased by $148 million compared to year-end
1992. Most of the change took place in rate sensitive assets ("RSA"), which
declined by $133 million over the past twelve months. Rate sensitive liabilities
("RSL") also increased by $15 million.
The most significant change in RSA occurred in the federal funds sold and
securities purchased under agreement to resell which declined by $103 million.
This is directly related to the Union transaction. Union had a significant
portion of their balance sheet in these assets at December 31, 1992. Since the
completion of that transaction, management redeployed those assets into higher
yielding, longer-term instruments such as securities and loans. Although it
might appear that interest rate exposure has increased, the shifting of these
assets actually reduced the risk of decreased earnings due to falling rates.
Other factors that contributed to the increase in the negative gap were the
continued shifting of customer dollars from fixed maturity accounts, such as
CDs, into transaction accounts and repurchase agreements ("repos"). As interest
rates have declined steadily over the past three years, the difference in rates
between CDs and transaction accounts and repos has narrowed sharply. In January
1991, the spread between the Company's average six-month CD rate and the rate on
a transaction deposit account and a repo was approximately 2.7% and 2.95%,
respectively. That spread has declined to 1.0% for transaction accounts and
0.57% for repos as of December 1993. In response to this change, customers have
decreased holdings of CDs and increased balances of transaction accounts and
short-term borrowings. Customers perceive little incentive to sacrifice
liquidity and extend the maturity of their funds in CDs given this small spread.
One factor that would tend to decrease the negative gap would

be the representation of maturities on mortgage-backed investment securities,
which represent 34% of total securities. For financial reporting purposes, these
instruments are shown at their stated final maturity. However, these products
are subject to unscheduled payments of principal on the loans underlying the
security. As a result, the average maturity of these instruments is reduced.
This would increase the level of RSA repricing in under one year. Management
attempts to anticipate the possibility of principal prepayments when these
securities are purchased to avoid any unexpected changes in security yields.
Management has analyzed the historical volatility of deposit accounts,
particularly transaction accounts, to determine the risk to earnings posed by
the negative gap. Through this analysis, management has determined that while
these accounts have the option to be repriced immediately, a large percentage of
these instruments are highly stable throughout a wide range of interest rate
cycles. As a result, the gap analysis used by management and the Company's board
of directors is adjusted to account for those instruments, primarily deposits,
with repricing dates that would appear to be more extended than those stated for
that product. Using this approach, the Company's gap position becomes well
balanced. A forecast of changes to earnings under a number of interest rate
scenarios indicates that only a small percentage of the Company's income would
be affected using this adjusted balance sheet position. As interest rates have
changed over the years, the resulting effects on the Company's net interest
margin have confirmed the accuracy of this analysis.
The Company's liquidity position is closely monitored and considered to be
adequate. The aggregate of federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreement to resell, and securities with maturities of three months or less
represent 6.7% of total liabilities. Securities with repricings in under one
year comprise another 8.2% of the remaining liabilities and would be available
for contingency funding needs.

CAPITAL RESOURCES
At December 31, 1992 and prior to the restatement for the Union merger,
capital was $189.6 million. At December 31, 1993 and after the Union merger and
other 1993 effects, capital was $276.6 million, an increase of $87 million or
45.9%. The risk-based capital table presented below sets forth various capital
ratios and reveals that all ratios are substantially above regulatory minimums.
Based on regulations issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
("FDIC"), all eleven of WBC's affiliate banks were considered "well
capitalized."
WBC reinstated its dividend policy during the second quarter of 1992 and
began paying $0.05 per share each quarter. Dividends paid out during 1993 were
$3.1 million or approximately 9.7% of net income. The Company continuously
evaluates its dividend policy. In the first quarter of 1994, the WBC board of
directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share each quarter for
an annualized rate of $0.60 per share. Based on 1993 net income, this amounts to
a payout ratio of over 29%.
The parent company's sources of cash to pay dividends are its net working
capital and the dividends received from subsidiary banks. Based on the
relatively high levels of capital at the banks and their sustained earnings
performance, a special cash dividend of approximately $16.9 million was taken
from the affiliate banks during the fourth quarter of 1993. Currently, the
parent company could receive dividends, without prior regulatory approval, of
approximately $17.9 million plus amounts equal to net income of the affiliate
banks during 1994.
Capital also increased approximately $6.2 million with the shares issued in
the FirstBank acquisition. Nominal increases also occurred due to the exercise
of stock options by various officers of WBC.
In order to take advantage of low interest rates, in May of 1993, WBC
borrowed $43 million in senior, unsecured fixed rate notes from several
institutional investors. Substantially all (approximately $39.3 million) of the
Company's pre-existing higher cost term-debt was repaid with the proceeds of
these notes.

OTHER INCOME
Other income reached $66.6 million in 1993 compared to $57.5 million in
1992. Immediately alter the Union merger, WBC sold securities previously held in
the Union investment portfolio which had characteristics inconsistent with WBC's
asset/liability policy guidelines. These sales produced gains of approximately
$5.4 million. Excluding these gains, other income increased $4.0 million or
almost 7% over 1992. Solid gains were recorded in every reported category.
Worthen Investments, Inc. is the Company's full service and discount
brokerage subsidiary. Commission income increased from $5.3 million in 1992 to
$6.3 million in 1993, a 19.5% increase. Due to the continued high level of stock
market activity, the Company expects the earnings from this enterprise to
continue to grow. The number of sales staff increased from 37 in 1992 to 44 in
1993.
With the merger of Union, Worthen Mortgage Company's mortgage servicing
portfolio grew to almost $1.6 billion at year end. WBC expects to focus more
effort on the profitability of this company during 1994.

OTHER EXPENSE
Excluding the $9.5 million in non-recurring expenses related to the Union
merger described elsewhere in this report, noninterest expenses fell by $6.5
million or 4.5% in 1993 compared to 1992. Although the effects of the cost
reductions related to the in-market merger with Union are masked in the fourth
quarter by the acquisition of FirstBank, the Company has nevertheless
experienced significant cost savings from the Union merger.
Even after closing 13 overlapping branches resulting from the Union
merger, the Company increased its number of branch offices statewide from 100 in
1992 to 119 at the end of 1993. The expense to maintain this extensive branch
network is significant but is considered vital to the overall corporate
franchise. During 1993, the Company substantially completed the installation of
a new computer system at each of these branch locations to automate the work
performed by our bank tellers. This system is expected to significantly increase
the efficiency of their work. The second phase of this project is to implement
this computer platform to all customer service representatives. This automated
computer network will further increase employee efficiency and allow much better
customer service and is expected to be completed during 1994.
The Company intends to focus increased attention on the level of operating
expenses during 1994 in order to achieve ratios closer to peer levels.

The Company's Common Stock, $1.00 par value, is traded on the American Stock
Exchange, Inc. under the AMEX ticker symbol "WOR."

On December 31, 1993, the Company had approximately 2,720 record holders of its
Common Stock. The Board of Directors discontinued the Company's policy of
regular cash dividends on its Common Stock in the second quarter of 1985. The
policy was reinstated during the second quarter of 1992. Dividends were paid by
subsidiaries prior to merger with the Company during the years 1989, 1990 and
1991. There is no assurance as to future cash dividends as they are dependent
upon future earnings, capital requirements and the financial condition of the
Company.

The Company is currently restricted from paying cash dividends in excess of
certain levels on its Common Stock pursuant to the terms of debt agreements
entered into by the Company with its primary lenders. See Note Q of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete discussion relating to
restrictions on the transfer of funds to the Company through dividends, loans or
advances from its subsidiaries.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION
The Company makes pricing and investment decisions based upon anticipated
changes in the economic environment. These decisions are based upon an
asset/liability management program which seeks to maintain an appropriate
balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities while aggressively
pricing services within the competitive constraints of the market. While the
effects of inflation cannot be eliminated, the Company has adopted policies
which effectively manage the effects of inflation on its operating results.

EFFECTS OF RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan." Statement 114 prescribes the recognition criterion
for loan impairment and the measurement methods for certain impaired loans and
loans whose terms are modified in troubled-debt restructurings. Statement 114
prescribes that a loan is impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be
unable to collect all amounts due, both principal and interest, according to the
contractual terms of the loan agreement. When measuring impairment, the expected
future cash flows of an impaired loan are required to be discounted at that
loan's effective interest rate. Alternatively, impairment can be measured by
reference to an observable market price, if one exists, or the fair value of the
collateral for a collateral-dependent loan.
Statement 114 must be adopted in 1995. Upon adoption, the impact of
initially applying the Statement will be recorded as a provision for loan losses
as required by Statement 114. Adoption of this standard is expected to have no
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Also in May 1993, the FASB issued Statement 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." Statement 115 addresses the
accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values and all investments in debt securities. The Statement
prescribes classifying investments into three categories: held to maturity
securities, trading securities, and available for sale securities. Held to
maturity securities are debt securities that the enterprise has the positive
intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost.
Trading securities are debt and equity securities that are bought and held for
the purpose of selling in the near term and are reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Available for sale securities
are those securities neither classified as held to maturity or trading and are
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a
separate component of stockholders' equity (net of tax effects).
Statement 115 must be adopted in 1994. Upon adoption, the Company plans to
transfer a portion of its securities currently accounted for at amortized cost
to the available for sale category with the unrealized holding gain or loss, net
of tax, reported as an adjustment to a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on
the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In February 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." Under the asset and liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.
The Company adopted Statement 109 during 1993. The cumulative effect of
this change in accounting for income taxes of $868,000 is reported separately in
the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 1993.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The management of Worthen Banking Corporation ("WBC") is responsible for the
integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and other financial
information contained in the Annual Report. The financial statements and related
information were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, based on recorded transactions and management's best judgments and
estimates, in order to set forth a fair presentation of financial position and
results of operations.

WBC and its subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting control
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that
the Company's books and records reflect accurately the transactions of the
Company. This system is augmented by written policies, operating procedures, and
a strong program of internal audit and loan review.

The Board of Directors oversees these financial statements through an audit
committee comprised solely of outside directors. The committee meets
periodically with the internal auditors and management to monitor the discharge
of each of its responsibilities. The independent auditors, who are engaged to
express an opinion on the financial statements, meet periodically with and have
free access to the committee, without management present, to discuss control,
audit and financial matters.

KPMG Peat Marwick, certified public accountants, has been engaged to audit the
financial statements of WBC and its subsidiaries. Their report on WBC's
financial statements is set forth below.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Worthen Banting Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Worthen Banking
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the
year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Worthen Banking
Corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31, 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

We previously audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of
Worthen Banking Corporation and Subsidiaries as of and for the years ended
December 31, 1992 and 1991, prior to their restatement for the 1993 pooling of
interests. The contribution of Worthen Banking Corporation and Subsidiaries to
total assets represented 79% and 78% of the respective restated totals as of
December 31, 1992 and 1991; and, the contribution of Worthen Banking Corporation
and Subsidiaries to net interest income and net income represented 78% and 90%
of the respective restated totals for 1992 and 75% and 80% of the respective
restated totals for 1991. Separate financial statements of the other companies
included in the 1992 and 1991 restated consolidated financial statements were
audited and reported on separately by other auditors. We also audited the
combination of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and
for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, after restatement for the 1993
pooling of interests; in our opinion, such consolidated statements have been
properly combined on the basis described in Note B of notes to consolidated
financial statements.

As discussed in Note R to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, in 1993.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORTHEN BANKING CORPORATION

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Worthen Banking Corporation (The "Company" or "WBC") is a multibank holding
company which offers through its subsidiaries a diversified range of banking and
financial services to retail and commercial customers. The Company's revenues
and net income are derived principally from its bank subsidiaries. WBC is
subject to competition from other financial institutions. The Company is subject
to the regulations of certain federal agencies and undergoes periodic
examinations by those regulatory authorities. The financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Company's financial statements have been restated to reflect the 1993
acquisition of The Union of Arkansas Corporation using the pooling-of-interests
method of accounting.

CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES: Investment securities are stated at cost adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. The adjusted cost of the
specific security sold is used to compute gain or loss on the sale of investment
securities. It is a policy of the Company that all securities purchased will be
held until the final maturity of the instrument. The Company has both the intent
and the ability to hold securities until their final maturity. No securities are
held for trading purposes. Certain investment securities are sold prior to final
maturity due to risk changes subsequent to initial purchase or for liquidity
needs.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities." This statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1993, with earlier application allowed. The Company
has elected to defer adoption of this statement until January 1, 1994. It is
estimated that adoption of Statement 115 will have no material effect upon the
1994 consolidated financial statements.

TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS: Trading account assets consist solely of real estate
loans held for resale by the Company's mortgage banking subsidiary. Trading
account assets are valued at the lower of cost or market on an aggregate basis.

REVENUE RECOGNITION: Interest on loans other than installment loans is credited
to operations when earned on the simple interest method. Interest on installment
loans is credited to operations when earned on either the simple interest method
or the sum of the years' digits method, depending on the terms of the loan
agreement. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of
management, the collection of additional interest is unlikely or a specified
loan meets the criteria for nonaccrual status established by regulatory
authority - when principal or interest is in default for 90 days or more unless
the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. No interest is
recorded on nonaccrual loans unless principal payments are current, the loan is
well-secured, and cash is received. A loan remains on nonaccrual status until
the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest and the
borrower demonstrates the ability to remain current on payments.

LEASE FINANCING: In prior years the Company provided equipment financing to its
customers through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are
carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus estimated residual
values. Unearned income on direct financing leases is amortized over the lease
terms resulting in an approximately level rate of return.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES: The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a
level management believes is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan
portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based
on the ongoing evaluation of internally identified problem loans, historical
loan loss experience, current economic conditions, volume, growth and
composition of the loan portfolio, the estimated value of underlying collateral
and other relevant factors.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT: Premises and equipment owned by the Company are stated
at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Premises and equipment
leased by the Company under capital leases are stated at an amount equal to the
present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term less
accumulated amortization. The provision for depreciation and capital lease
amortization (included in depreciation and amortization expense) is computed
generally by the straight-line method.

PROPERTIES ACQUIRED IN SETTLEMENT OF LOANS: Properties acquired in settlement of
loans, included in Other Assets in the consolidated financial statements,
consist of properties acquired through foreclosure or otherwise in settlement of
debt. These properties are initially recorded at the lower of cost or current
fair value determined by appraisal at foreclosure. Losses arising from the
acquisition of such properties are charged against the allowance for loan
losses. Carrying values are subsequently reduced through a charge to operations
when current appraisals indicate a decline in value. At December 31, 1993, 1992
and 1991, these properties amounted to $4,842,000, $8,076,000 and $8,148,000,
respectively.

29
<PAGE>

EXCESS COSTS OF PURCHASED SUBSIDIARIES: Unamortized costs of purchased
subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of underlying net tangible assets
acquired are included in other assets in the consolidated financial statements
and aggregated $23,080,000, $15,481,000 and $10,813,000 (net of accumulated
amortization of $24,927,000, $23,980,000 and $22,788,000) at December 31, 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively. A portion of such excess costs was allocated to
values associated with the future earnings potential of acquired deposits and
was being amortized over the estimated life of the deposits, an average of
approximately five years. The cost so identified was $ 162,000, net of
amortization, at December 31, 1991, which became fully amortized during 1992.
The remaining costs (goodwill) are being amortized by the straight-line method
over 15 and 25-year periods for purchases after 1982 and over a 40-year period
for purchases prior to 1983.

INCOME TAXES: In February, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income
Taxes." Under the asset and liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement 109 and has reported
the cumulative effect of that change in the method of accounting for income
taxes in the 1993 consolidated statement of earnings.

The Company previously used the asset and liability method under Statement 96.
Under the asset and liability method of Statement 96, deferred tax assets and
liabilities were recognized for all events that had been recognized in the
financial statements. Under Statement 96, the future tax consequences of
recovering assets or settling liabilities at their financial statement carrying
amounts were considered in calculating deferred taxes. Generally Statement 96
prohibited consideration of any other future events in calculating deferred
taxes.

CASH EQUIVALENTS: For presentation of the Statement of Cash flows, cash
equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 107, "Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" (Statement 107),
requires that the Company disclose estimated fair values for its financial
instruments. Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set forth in the
following notes to the consolidated financial statements. The carrying amounts
for cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with other banks and
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell
approximate fair value because of their short maturities and they do not present
unanticipated credit concerns. Fair value estimates for other financial
instruments are based on relevant market information and information about
the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or
discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company's
entire holding of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists
for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, fair value
estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience,
current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial
instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature
and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and
therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on existing
on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate
the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities
that are not considered financial instruments. For example, the Company has a
substantial trust operation that contributes net fee income annually. The trust
operation is not considered a financial instrument, and its value has not been
incorporated into the fair value estimates. Other significant assets and
liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include the
mortgage banking operation, deferred tax benefits, and property, plant and
equipment. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the
unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value
estimates and have not been considered.

INCOME PER SHARE: Per common share amounts were computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.

RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the current year presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on net
earnings for 1992 and 1991.

NOTE B - ACQUISITIONS

On July 1, 1991, Worthen National Bank of Arkansas, Little Rock ("WNBA")
acquired approximately $153 million of certain assets and deposit liabilities
from One National Bank, located in North Little Rock, Arkansas for approximately
$5.3 million in cash.

On July 25, 1991, WNBA and Worthen National Bank of Hot Springs assumed
approximately $0.3 million in assets and $111 million of the deposit
liabilities of three First Savings of Arkansas locations in Little Rock, North
Little Rock and Hot Springs from the Resolution Trust Corporation. The
Company paid a premium of approximately $0.4 million to the Resolution Trust
Corporation.

On January 31, 1992, the Company purchased 100% of the common stock of First
National Bank, Fayetteville, Arkansas from One National BancShares, Inc. for
$15,750,000 in cash and the issuance of 1,200,000 shares of the Company's common
stock. For the year ended December 31, 1991, First National Bank, Fayetteville
reported total assets of $252,237,000, net interest income of $10,587,000 and
net income of $3,279,000. Substantially all the assets and liabilities of First
National Bank, Fayetteville and Worthen National Bank of Northwest Arkansas were
combined as of the date of acquisition. This acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase and the results of operations of the bank are included in the Company's
1992 consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The excess
of the purchase price over the recorded value of the net assets acquired is $5.4
million and is being amortized over 15 years using the straight line method. The
proforma unaudited results of operations for the year ended December 31,
1992, assuming that the acquisition of First National Bank, Fayetteville had
been consummated on January 1, 1992, would have been as follows:

On May 7, 1993, the Company issued 4,550,000 shares of its common stock to
acquire all the outstanding common stock of The Union of Arkansas Corporation
("Union"), an Arkansas bank-holding company. The business combination has been
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests combination and, accordingly, the
Company's historical consolidated financial statements presented in this report
have been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of Union as
if the companies had always been combined. On December 31, 1992, Union reported
total assets of $713,474,000.

The results of operations previously reported by the separate enterprises and
the combined amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements are summarized below:

On September 10, 1993, the Company acquired 100% of First Bentonville
Bancshares, Inc., the parent corporation of FirstBank of Bentonville, Arkansas
("FirstBank"). WBC paid approximately $3.9 million in cash, $4.1 million in debt
repayment and 250,000 newly-issued shares of WBC's common stock. For the year
ended December 31, 1992, First Bank reported total assets of $88,546,000, net
interest income of $2,826,000 and net income of $805,000. FirstBank was merged
into Worthen National Bank of Northwest Arkansas on October 31, 1993. This
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations of
FirstBank are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from
the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the recorded
value of the net assets acquired is $8.4 million and is being amortized over 15
years using the straight line method. The proforma results of operations for
1993 and 1992, assuming that the acquisition of FirstBank had been consummated
on January 1, 1992, would have been as follows:

The fair value of investment securities, except certain obligations of states
and political subdivisions, is estimated based on bid prices published in
financial newspapers or bid quotations received from securities dealers. The
fair value of certain obligations of states and political subdivisions is not
readily available through market sources other than dealer quotations, so fair
value estimates are based on quoted market prices of similar instruments,
adjusted for differences between the quoted instruments and the instruments
being valued.

stock option plan, as amended, and its 1993 stock option plan to key officers
and employees of the Company and subsidiaries at prices no less than the market
price of the Company's common shares on the date of grant.

Transactions in stock options are as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
- -----------------------------------------------------------------
(Number of shares) 1993 1992 1991
- -----------------------------------------------------------------
<S> <C> <C> <C>

----------------------------
Outstanding, December 31 ....... 680,214 529,675 378,425
----------------------------
----------------------------
</TABLE>

Generally, stock options are exercisable in specified increments over a nine or
ten year period and expire ten years alter date of grant; certain options become
exercisable immediately upon occurrence of events specified in the grant. The
exercise price may be paid in cash, in already-owned shares, or in a combination
of both. At December 31, 1993, 274,745 options were exercisable at prices from
$8.75 to $24.25 per share; the weighted average price was $10.88.

In 1987, stock appreciation rights for 115,000 shares and an associated grant of
100,000 options were canceled and reissued at a price of $8.75. DurIng 1991, the
expiration of these rights and options was extended an additional five years.
The rights are exercisable only for cash limited to the amount of income tax
incurred by the optionee upon exercise of the options and rights, as determined
by a formula in the grant. The rights are exercisable over a specific period or
within one year of a "taxable event," as defined in the grant. There were new
grants of options totalIng 205,850 during 1993, 174,875 during 1992 and 135,000
during 1991. At December 31, 1993, 115,000 rights were outstanding and
exercisable. Compensation expense of $400,000 and $826,000 was recorded in 1992
and 1991, respectively, for the difference between exercisable stock
appreciation rights and the market price of these instruments. No such
compensation expense was recognized for 1993.

The 1984 pian authorizes grants of options and rights for an aggregate of
750,000 shares. At December 31,1993, options and rights for 181,948 shares were

NOTE N - PENSION PLANS

During 1986, the Company instituted a defined contribution savings and profit
sharing plan to replace its defined benefit pension plan, which was terminated
effective December 31, 1985. All employees are eligible to participate in the
defined contribution plan upon attaining a minimum age and period of
employment. The plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their
salaries to the savings plan and obligates the Company to make contributions
equal to fifty percent of matchable compensation, which is the amount of
participants' contributions that are not in excess of six percent of their
annual compensation determined in accordance with the plan. Additionally,
except in certain circumstances, the Company must make an annual contribution
of the Company's common stock or of cash to be used to purchase such stock
equal to ten percent of participants' matchable compensation. The Company's
expense for contributions it made pursuant to the plan was $1,460,000,
$1,374,000 and $945,000 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

The amount, if any, of the Company's discretionary contribution made pursuant to
the profit sharing component of the plan is determined annually by the Board of
Directors. In 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company made discretionary contributions
of $306,000, $229,000 and $193,000, respectively.

NOTE O - REPURCHASE AGREEMENT LOSS/RECOVERY

During 1985, WNBA suffered a loss of $52,147,000 in connection with repurchase
agreements entered into with Bevill, Bresler and Schulman, Inc. and certain of
its affiliates (collectively "BBS") on behalf of a customer. BBS failed to honor
the repurchase agreements and subsequently filed bankruptcy. The Company
collected $20,000,000 initially from the proceeds of a professional liability
insurance policy which was recorded as a reduction of the loss. The Company
entered into an agreement with the insurance carrier whereby 40% of bankruptcy
distribution recoveries received by WNBA net of 40% of WNBA's expenses incurred
in effecting such recoveries would be paid to the carrier. The Company has an
additional agreement whereby approximately 21% of BBS recoveries are paid to a
separate insurance carrier who provided directors' and officers' liability
coverage to the Company.

WNBA received gross recoveries of $783,000 and $2,136,000 in 1993 and 1991,
respectively. Payments and accruals of $474,000 and $1,342,000 in 1993 and 1991,
respectively, were paid to insurance carriers in accordance with the agreements
mentioned above. No gross recoveries were received or payments made during 1992.
The distributions received in 1993 are the final recoveries the Company will
receive in connection with the BBS bankruptcy.

The United States District Court approved an amended agreement in 1988 which
settled all pending shareholder derivative lawsuits arising from, among other
matters, the repurchase agreement loss involving the Company and WNBA. The terms
of the agreement stipulate a number of actions to be taken by the Company in
regards to related party transactions and regulatory compliance among other
matters. Management believes that the Company is in compliance with the terms of
the settlement agreement.

NOTE P - COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk consist of the following:

CONTRACT OF
NOTIONAL AMOUNTS

Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written. . . . . . . 26,854 13,745 14,912
----------------------------------
----------------------------------
</TABLE>

The financial statements do not reflect various commitments and contingencies,
such as commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, guarantees and
liabilities for assets held in trust, all of which arise in the normal course of
the Company's business. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to
extend credit and standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written is
represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Company
uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations
as it does for balance-sheet instruments. Commitments generally have fixed
maturity dates, most of which expire within a year, or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. The terms of standby letters of credit are
generally less than five years. Fees are recognized as income on the
straight-line method over the term of the debt guaranteed. Unearned fee income
was not material at December 31, 1993, 1992 or 1991. Potential losses on standby
letters of credit are provided for in the allowance for loan losses. The amount
and type of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based upon credit
policy. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory,
property, plant, and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. The
Company has a diversified loan portfolio with no concentrations of credit risk
deemed significant Most of the Company's lending activity is with customers
located within the State of Arkansas and the Austin, Texas area.

The fair value of commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and
financial guarantees would be estimated using the fees currently charged for
similar agreements. Due to the insignificance of the fees that would currently
be charged for such agreements and the short term nature of current agreements,
no fair value estimates have been made for financial instruments with
off-balance sheet risk.

In the ordinary course of business, There are various legal proceedings pending
against the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, most of which are
considered litigation incidental to the conduct of business, including, among
other matters, defense of routine corporate, employment, banking, lender
liability and securities related litigation. Management, alter consultation with
legal counsel and based upon available facts and proceedings to date which are
preliminary in certain instances, is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution
of these proceedings will have no material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position or future results of operations of the Company.

NOTE Q - RESTRICTIONS ON SUBSIDIARY DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR ADVANCES

Certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of the bank subsidiaries to
transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.
The approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") is
required for the Company's national bank subsidiaries to pay dividends in excess
of earnings retained in the current year plus retained net profits with certain
adjustments for the preceding two years.

Under Federal Reserve regulations, the bank subsidiaries are also limited as to
the amount they may loan to The Company, unless such loans are collateralized by
specified obligations. At December 31, 1993, the maximum amour available for
transfer from the banks to the Company in the form of loans approximated 23% of
consolidated equity. Under current Federal Reserve regulations, the subsidiary
banks are limited to the amount they may loan to other affiliates, including the
Company. Loans to a single affiliate may not exceed 10% and loans to all
affiliates may not exceed 20% of the lender's capital, surplus and undivided
profits after adding back the allowance for loan losses.

NOTE R - INCOME TAXES

As discussed in Note A, the Company adopted Statement 109 as of January 1, 1993.
In adopting Statement 109, the Company recorded income and a deferred tax asset
equal to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $868,000.
In order to fully realize the deferred tax asset the Company will need to
generate future federal taxable income of approximately $2,500,000. The Company
has federal taxable income and pre-tax book income for the years ended as
follows:

In 1991, the Company utilized the remainder of a NOL carryforward which was
generated in 1985-1987. Based on the Company's historical and current taxable
income before NOL deductions, management believes it is more likely than not
that the Company will generate sufficient future federal taxable income in the
periods in which the existing deductible temporary differences reverse.

Federal and state income taxes (benefit) consist of the following:

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has
established a valuation allowance for a portion of its state deferred tax
assets. State law prohibits the carryback of NOL's, limits NOL carryforwards to
five years, and historically, the Company has not generated sufficient state
taxable income to warrant full recognition of the deferred tax assets. The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of January 1, 1993 was
$1,414,000. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended
December 31, 1993 was a decrease of $169,000.

At December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company had current income taxes
payable of$2,371,000, $3,162,000 and $3, 103,000, respectively, included in
Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 1992 and
1991, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of $2,444,000 and a net deferred
tax liability of $1,466,000 included in Other Assets and Other Liabilities,
respectively. The Company acquired deferred tax liabilities of $3 96,000 and
deferred tax assets of $377,000 during 1993 and 1992, respectively, in
conjunction with the acquisition of First National Bank, Fayetteville and
FirstBank.

NOTE T - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following are the fair value estimates, methods and assumptions for the
Company's financial instruments for which the fair value differs from the
carrying value, except for investment securities which are disclosed in Note E.
See Note P for a discussion of the fair values of financial instruments with
off-balance sheet risk.

LOANS: Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial
characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as commercial, financial and
agricultural, bankers' acceptances and commercial paper; real estate mortgage,
real estate construction, installment and other; and direct lease financing.
Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and variable rate interest
terms and by performing and non-performing (nonaccrual) categories. The fair
value of performing fixed rate loans is calculated by discounting scheduled
cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates
that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan. The fair
value of performing variable rate loans is equal to the carrying value of such
loans, due to the regular repricing at market rates. The fair value of
nonperforming loans is based on estimated cash flows discounted using a rate
commensurate with the risk associated with the estimated cash flows.
Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows, timing of cash flows, and
discount rates are judgmentally determined using available market and specific
borrower information.

The following table presents carrying values and estimated fair values of loans
at December 31:

TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS: The fair value of the Company's trading account assets
is based upon quoted market sources of similar instruments, adjusted for
differences between the quoted instruments and the instruments being valued. At
December 31, 1993, the carrying value and estimated fair value of trading
account assets is $65,324,000 and $65,254,000, respectively. At December 31,
1992, the carrying value and estimated fair value of trading account assets is
$37,462,000 and $37,518,000, respectively.

DEPOSITS: The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as demand
deposits and savings, is equal to the carrying value amount payable on demand as
of December 31, 1993 and 1992. The fair value of time deposits is based on the
discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using
the rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.

The following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair values of
deposits at December 31:

NOTE U - REGULATORY MATTERS

On March 31, 1993, the Company was notified by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System ("FED") that its approval of the Company's application to
merge with The Union of Arkansas Corporation was given in reliance upon
representations and commitments made to the FED by the Company, Stephens Group,
Inc., and certain Stephens family members in connection with the application,
including representations and commitments to the effect that Stephens Group,
Inc., and its subsidiaries do not and will not exert control over the management
or policies of the Company, and that Stephens Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries
will comply with the restrictions imposed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal
Reserve Act, as amended, in connection with any business transacted between
subsidiary banks of the Company and Stephens Group, Inc. Management does not
believe that any of such regulations have been violated and management of the
Company believes that such representations and commitments will not
significantly affect the general business policies or financial performance of
the Company.

In addition, the FED notified the Company in March of 1993 that the Board has
ordered an investigation to review the ownership and control of the Company for
compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act,
including the nature and extent of the relationships between the Company and
tephens Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries. The Company is cooperating with the
FED in this investigation. However, the Company cannot accurately predict the
results of the final outcome of the investigation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

Board of Directors
The Union of Arkansas Corporation
Little Rock, Arkansas

We have audited the consolidated and parent only balance sheets of The
Union of Arkansas Corporation as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the
related consolidated and parent only statements of income, retained
earnings and cash flows for the years then ended (not presented
separately herein). These consolidated and parent only financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated and
parent only financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and parent only financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit Includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
and parent only financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall consolidated and parent only financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated and parent only financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated and
parent only financial position of The Union of Arkansas Corporation as of
December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the consolidated and parent only results of
their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

On May 7, 1993, the Company issued 4,550,000 shares of its common stock to
acquire all the outstanding common stock of The Union of Arkansas Corporation
("Union"), an Arkansas bank-holding company. The business combination has
been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests combination and, accordingly,
the Company's historical consolidated financial statements presented in this
report have been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of
Union as if the companies had always been combined. On December 31, 1992,
Union reported total assets of $713,474,000.

The results of operations previously reported by the separate enterprises and
the combined amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements are summarized below:

On September 10, 1993, the Company acquired 100% of First Bentonville
Bancshares, Inc., the parent corporation of First Bank of Bentonville,
Arkansas ("FirstBank"). WBC paid approximately $3.9 million in cash,
$4.1 million in debt repayment and 250,000 newly-issued shares of WBC's
common stock. For the year ended December 31, 1992, FirstBank reported
total assets of $88,546,000, net interest income of $2,826,000 and net
income of $805,000. FirstBank was merged into Worthen National Bank of
Northwest Arkansas on October 31, 1993. This acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase and the results of operations of FirstBank are included
in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of purchase.

NOTE 6 - CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE - INCOME TAXES

During the first quarter of 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under the asset
and liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates which apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under
Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the
enactment date. The Company previously used the asset and liability method
prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 96. In adopting
Statement 109 the Company recorded income and a deferred tax asset equal to
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $868,000.

NOTE 7 - CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE - INVESTMENT SECURITIES

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities" ("Statement 115"). Statement 115 prescribes classifying
investments into three categories: held to maturity securities, trading
securities, and available for sale securities. Held to maturity securities
are debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to
hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. Trading securities are
debt and equity securities that are bought and held for the purpose of selling
in the near term and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses included in earnings. Available for sale securities are those
securities neither classified as held to maturity or trading and are reported
at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity (net of tax effects).

Adoption of Statement 115 resulted in an increase of $544,000 to the Company's
stockholders' equity as of January 1, 1994, representing the unrealized
appreciation, net of taxes, for those securities having a fair value of
approximately $197,000,000 classified by the Company as available for sale,
previously carried at amortized cost. The unrealized valuation on these
available for sale securities decreased during the first quarter of 1994 to a
net unrealized loss of $300,000 as of March 31, 1994. The Company has no
securities deemed to be trading securities.

NOTE 8 - TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS

Trading account assets consist solely of real estate loans held for resale by
the Company's mortgage banking subsidiary. Trading account assets are valued
at the lower of cost or market on an aggregate basis.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

HIGHLIGHTS

The Company's net income for the first quarter of 1994 of $10.2 million was
12.2% higher than the $9.1 of income before a change in accounting principle
recorded in the same quarter of last year and 9.2% higher than in 1993's
fourth quarter. The improvement in 1994's first quarter as compared to the
first quarter of 1993 was primarily the result of a higher net interest margin
and lower noninterest expenses resulting from savings realized in the Union
merger. The net interest margin increase was the result of an increase in net
earning assets, growth of higher yielding loans and close monitoring of rates
paid on deposits. Net earning assets increased as a result of the retention
of earnings, the acquisition of FirstBank, lower levels of nonperforming
assets and higher levels of demand deposits. Despite additional operating
expenses incurred as a result of the acquisition of FirstBank in
September 1993, expense levels declined by $1.8 million from the first quarter
of 1993. Approximately $1.5 million of these savings were from salaries and
benefits resulting from staffing efficiencies of the Union merger.

Income taxes increased from $3.3 million or an effective tax rate of 26.7% in
the first quarter of 1993 to $5.7 million or an effective tax rate of 36.0% in
the first quarter of 1994. Pretax income before this change in accounting
principle increased from $12.4 million to $15.9 million, an increase of $3.5
million or approximately 28%.

</TABLE>

During the first quarter of 1994, the loan portfolio increased by approximately
$27 million, representing controlled annualized growth of 6.68%. The bulk of
the growth occurred in the real estate and consumer loan portfolios, while
commercial loans were relatively unchanged during the period. The increase in
real estate lending reflects the economic activity that the Company's Central
and Northwest Arkansas markets, in particular, are experiencing. The consumer
loan portfolio growth is in response to a concerted marketing effort in the
retail sector, with emphasis on the establishment of indirect lending
relationships with dealers and the utilization of the Company's extensive
branch network around the state.

11

<PAGE>
The Company monitors concentrations in the portfolio constantly and is
cognizant of such concentrations in the evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses. The real estate mortgage and construction
portfolios totalled approximately $800.5 million at March 31, 1994,
representing 47.8% of the loan portfolio. While this is a significant
concentration, the real estate portfolio contains $250 million of loans
secured by first mortgage single-family dwellings that management considers
to contain little risk. Additionally, internal lending policies discourage
lending to speculative properties and other types of high-risk loan types such
as hotels and restaurants. As a result, management considers the real estate
loan portfolio to be well-diversified with a manageable risk profile.

The consumer loan portfolio grew to $438 million at March 31, 1994, an
increase of $12.6 million during the first quarter. Within the portfolio,
approximately $255 million of loans are secured by new and used automobiles.
A significant portion of this business is generated through a large dealer
network, an area that several of the Company's subsidiary banks have developed
considerable expertise in over many years. The past due and net charge-off
performance of the consumer loan portfolio has been excellent and the Company
considers the retail segment critical from marketing and competitive
standpoints.

ASSET QUALITY AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

</TABLE>

Nonperforming assets declined slightly in the first quarter of 1994 to
$22.7 million, representing 1.35% of total loans plus other nonperforming
assets. More significant improvement was prevented due to placing a
$1.4 million loan on nonaccrual during the quarter. Management anticipates
that nonperforming assets will improve further in the second quarter of 1994,
based on offers that have been accepted to sell certain foreclosed
properties. The Company's largest nonperforming asset, with a book value of
$2.4 million, is scheduled to sell during the second quarter, along with other
smaller properties. The known sales will reduce nonperforming assets by more
than 10%, which is considered very positive for the asset quality indicators
of the Company. The improved local economic conditions in Arkansas and the
Southwest region have assisted in the disposition of foreclosed properties
and/or the improvement in financial condition of credit relationships that are
on nonaccrual status.

Presented in the table on the following page is the summary of activity in the
allowance for loan losses for the three months ended March 31, 1994 and 1993,
as well as the year ended December 31, 1993:

</TABLE>

Concurrent with the continued improvement in asset quality of the Company,
loan loss provisions have been reduced accordingly. In addition to the
improvements in asset quality, loan loss recoveries continue to keep pace
with the levels of loan charge-offs which have further negated the need for
current period loan loss provisions. During the first quarter of 1994, loan
loss provisions of $385,000 were made which, when reduced by the nominal
$95,000 of net loan losses, caused the allowance for loan losses to increase
by $290,000 to $33.6 million as of March 31, 1994. The reduction in
nonperforming assets referred to previously elevated the ratio of the
allowance to nonperforming assets to 148% at March 31, and the ratio of the
allowance to nonperforming loans to 189% at quarter-end. Management desires
to maintain at least 100% coverage of the Company's nonperforming loans at all
times, and maintains the overall allowance for loan losses at levels
sufficient to absorb temporary fluctuations in asset quality and/or loan
growth without requiring periodic extraordinary loan loss provisions. The
internal methodologies utilized to assess the adequacy of the allowance have
determined that the allowance is adequate to absorb the loss potential
in the loan portfolio as of March 31, 1994.

LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY

The Company's negative gap increased by $60 million compared to year end
1993. Most of the change took place in rate sensitive assets, which declined
by $84 million. All of that decline ($135 million total) occurred in loans.
During the same period, rate sensitive liabilities declined by $24 million.

The Federal Reserve Bank began to raise the interest rates on short term money
market instruments, particularly federal funds, early in 1994. There have
been two reactions to this movement. One has been taken by Company management
through the increase in balances of federal funds sold ($47 million since year
end 1993). This will permit interest earnings to increase along with rates.
The second change has been a stronger preference by loan customers to lock in
longer term rates and move away from floating rate and short term credits.
This phenomenon accounts for the decrease in loans repriceable in under one
year. As rates increase, management expects the pattern of lengthening loan
maturities to continue.

Management believes that certain types of deposit accounts have a high degree
of stability and less than complete sensitivity to rate changes. This
determination is based on a review of historical activity in these accounts
over a broad range of interest rate cycles. This assessment has been
supported through the most recent increases in short term rates. The rates on
transaction accounts have remained stable without a decline in the balances in
the accounts. Therefore, a large part of the rate sensitivity risk implied by
the negative gap at the thirty day interval is mitigated because it is a
result of stable transaction accounts.

The Company's liquidity position is closely monitored and considered to be
adequate. The aggregate of federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreement to resell, and securities with maturities of three months or less
represent 8.2% of total liabilities.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

As shown in the following table, the capital ratios of the Company continued
to improve during the first quarter of 1994 compared to December 31, 1993 and
March 31, 1993. All of the Company's subsidiary banks maintain leverage and
risk-based capital ratios that exceed regulatory minimums. Worthen announced
in January 1994 that the Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly
dividend to $0.15 per share from $0.05 per share. The dividend increase
reflects the improved capital position of the Company's largest bank resulting
from the merger with Union and management's confidence in the Company's
current operations. The dividend payout ratio reflecting the increased
dividend rate for the first quarter of 1994 is approximately 25.1% compared
to a ratio of 9.7% for the year ended 1993.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income in the first quarter of 1994 was $2.4 million higher than
the same period in 1993 for a number of reasons. A higher volume of earning
assets had the largest effect. This was evident mainly in loans, which
increased by $102 million over the period. Since this category of assets had
the highest yield, this contributed positively to earnings. This shift of
assets over the past four quarters was funded, in part, by a decline in
federal funds sold, which declined by $74 million. Interest-bearing
liabilities increased over the period, but by only $18 million.
Non-interest-bearing liabilities also grew by $85 million, which more than
offset a $27 million increase in non-interest-earning assets. The difference
in this growth supported the increase in earning assets, with no associated
interest expense. The combination of these factors helped to create a
favorable effect to earnings due to volume changes.

There were also favorable effects to earnings due to changes in balance sheet
mix. Loans increased as a percentage of earning assets, from 49.6% in 1993 to
51.6% in 1994. On the liability side of the balance sheet, time accounts
declined as a percentage of interest-bearing liabilities from 47.6% to 43.2%.
There were corresponding increases in other deposit accounts with lower
interest rates, particularly transaction and savings accounts.

The Company has been able to deal effectively with the decline of interest
rates that occurred between the first quarter of 1993 and 1994. While asset
yields fell from 6.90% to 6.76%, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities
declined more rapidly from 3.12% to 2.75%. The most significant adjustments
were realized in transaction and savings accounts, where the average cost
declined by half of one percent in the period.

OTHER INCOME

The Company continues to emphasize the importance of growth in noninterest
related sources of income. Other income includes fees for deposit services,
trust services provided by Worthen Trust Company, full service and discount
brokerage commissions provided by Worthen Investments, Inc. ("WII"), mortgage
loan servicing fees and many other corporate and retail products.

During the first quarter of 1994, other income was $14.7 million or
approximately $1.0 million below the $15.7 million recorded in the first
quarter of 1993. Trust fees were down by approximately $.3 million primarily
as a result of adjusting from the cash to accrual basis of recording income at
one of the Company's affiliate trust locations in January 1993. Brokerage
commissions were down by approximately $.2 million. The overall decline in
stock market activity in the first quarter of 1994 as compared to the first
quarter of 1993 resulted in lower commission sales. The Company continues to
emphasize this business and believes that the results of WII will follow the
stock market activity. Additionally, first quarter 1993 results included
$.2 million of nonrecurring income related to net repurchase agreement
recoveries.

OTHER EXPENSE

During the first quarter of 1994, other expense decreased 5.2% compared to the
first quarter of 1993 and 6.7% from the fourth quarter of 1994. Reductions in
salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy, professional fees and business
development are direct results of savings realized in the Union merger. The
24.6% increase in data processing fees reflects the installation of an
automated computer network at each branch location to increase employee
efficiency and provide much better customer service. The company intends to
continue focusing attention on the level of noninterest expenses in order to
achieve better operating efficiencies.

REGULATORY MATTERS

On March 31, 1993, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FED")
advised WBC that the Company's application to merge The Union of Arkansas
Corporation with a subsidiary of WBC had been approved. The FED approved the
merger, in part, in reliance upon representations and commitments made to the
FED by the Company, by Stephens Group, Inc. and by certain Stephens family
members. These included a representation that Stephens Group, Inc. does not and
will not exert control over the management and policies of WBC and that Stephens
Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries will comply with the restrictions imposed by
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Management believes that such
representations and commitments will not materially affect the Company's general
business policies, financial condition, or results of operations. The Company
has also been advised that the FED has made a determination that Stephens Group,
Inc. and its affiliates, are affiliates of the Company, as that term is defined
in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.

The Board of Governors also notified the Company on March 31, 1993 that the
Board of Governors had ordered an investigation to review the ownership and
control of the Company for compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act and the
Change in Bank Control Act, including the nature and extent of the relationships
between the Company and Stephens Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Company
is not aware of any assertion by the Board of Governors that the Company is not
in compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act or the Change in Bank Control
Act. In the event the Board of Governors determines that there has been a
violation of the Bank Holding Company Act, it is authorized to initiate certain
administrative enforcement actions against the Company and its institution-
affiliated parties. These actions could include, among other things, the
issuance of an order to cease and desist or the assessment of monetary penalties
against the Company or its institution-affiliated parties. The amount of such
monetary penalties, if any, would be determined by the Board of Governors on the
basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged violations and
might or might not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial
condition or results of operations. In addition, under regulations promulgated
by the Board of Governors, in the event it determines that an impermissible
control relationship exists, it would have discretion to order either
termination of the impermissible control relationship, or the filing of an
application seeking the approval of such control relationship, or to pursue
other remedial actions. However, the Company cannot now predict the results or
the final outcome of the investigation. The Company intends to continue to
cooperate with the Board of Governors in this investigation.

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes was $5,704,000 for the first quarter of 1994
compared to $4,074,000 for the fourth quarter of 1993 and $3,300,000 for the
first quarter of 1993. The effective tax rates for the respective quarters
were 36.0%, 30.0% and 26.7%. The Company expects to be taxable at an
approximate effective rate of 36% during the remainder of 1994.

A complete discussion of the $868,000 gain recorded in the first quarter of
1993 related to the adoption of the Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," can be found at Note 6
(Change in Accounting Principle - Income Taxes) to the financial statements.

PART II

OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, there are various legal proceedings
pending against WBC, its subsidiaries and affiliates, most of which are
considered litigation incidental to the conduct of business, including, among
other matters, defense of routine corporate, employment, banking, lender
liability and securities related litigation. Management, after consultation
with legal counsel and based upon available facts and proceedings to date
which are preliminary in certain instances, is of the opinion that the ultimate
resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial position or results of operations of WBC. However,
certain matters disclosed in this Form 10-Q may be considered to be material in
amount or nature.

In January of 1993, the Company, its directors, and certain of its officers and
shareholders were sued in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, in WINICKI V. WORTHEN BANKING CORPORATION, ET AL.
93-CIV-0135. The complaint alleged that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), Rule 14a-9 of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC" or "Commission"), and certain state
law provisions relating to fiduciary duties in connection with the matters
disclosed in the Company's proxy statement distributed in December of 1992. The
complaint was filed as a class action and sought an injunction to prevent the
Company from holding a special meeting or from consummating certain transactions
which were the subject of the proxy statement, and unspecified monetary damages.
The Company has denied all material allegations in the complaint and in January
1993, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") under which
the Company agreed to distribute revised disclosure material to its shareholders
and not to oppose an application by plaintiff's counsel for fees in an agreed
amount. On April 5, 1994, the Court held a fairness hearing on the proposed
settlement. On the basis of that hearing, the Court approved the settlement, and
the matter has been settled pursuant to the approval of the Court, on terms
believed by WBC's management to be favorable to WBC.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

The annual meeting of stockholders of WBC was held April 26, 1994. At the
annual meeting, the following persons were re-elected as directors of WBC for

NOTE 4 - ACQUISITIONS

On May 7, 1993, the Company issued 4,550,000 shares of its common stock to
acquire all the outstanding common stock of The Union of Arkansas Corporation
("Union"), an Arkansas bank-holding company. The business combination has been
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests combination and, accordingly, the
Company's historical consolidated financial statements presented in this report
have been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of Union as
if the companies had always been combined. On December 31, 1992, Union reported
total assets of $713,474,000.

On September 10, 1993, the Company acquired 100% of First Bentonville
Bancshares, Inc., the parent corporation of First Bank of Bentonville, Arkansas
("FirstBank"). WBC paid approximately $3.9 million in cash, $4.1 million in
debt repayment and 250,000 newly-issued shares of WBC's common stock. For the
year ended December 31, 1992, FirstBank reported total assets of $88,546,000,
net interest income of $2,826,000 and net income of $805,000. FirstBank was
merged into Worthen National Bank of Northwest Arkansas on October 31, 1993.
This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations
of FirstBank are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements
from the date of purchase.

NOTE 5 - CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE - INCOME TAXES

During the first quarter of 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under the asset
and liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates which apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under
Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the
enactment date. The Company previously used the asset and liability method
prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 96. In adopting
Statement 109 the Company recorded income and a deferred tax asset equal to the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $868,000.

NOTE 6 - CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE - INVESTMENT SECURITIES

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities" ("Statement 115"). Statement 115 prescribes classifying
investments into three categories: held to maturity securities, trading
securities, and available for sale securities. Held to maturity securities are
debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity and are reported at amortized cost. Trading securities are debt and
equity securities that are bought and held for the purpose of selling in the
near term and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
included in earnings. Available for sale securities are those securities
neither classified as held to maturity or trading and are reported at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of
stockholders' equity (net of tax effects).

Adoption of Statement 115 resulted in an increase of $544,000 to the Company's
stockholders' equity as of January 1, 1994, representing the unrealized
appreciation, net of taxes, for those securities having a fair value of
approximately $197,000,000 classified by the Company as available for sale,
previously carried at amortized cost. The unrealized valuation on these
available for sale securities decreased $1,990,000 during the second quarter of
1994 to a net unrealized loss of $2,290,000 as of June 30, 1994. The Company
has no securities deemed to be trading securities.

NOTE 7 - MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Mortgage warehouse loans held for sale consist solely of real estate loans held
for resale by the Company's mortgage banking subsidiary. Mortgage warehouse
loans held for sale are valued at the lower of cost or market on an aggregate
basis.

NOTE 8 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS

A summary of intangible assets (net of accumulated amortization) is as follows:

Intangible assets are included in other assets in the consolidated financial
statements. During 1993, goodwill increased approximately $8.4 million due to
the acquisition of First Bentonville Bancshares, Inc. In January 1994, the
Company's mortgage banking subsidiary acquired $1.7 million in mortgage
servicing rights.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

HIGHLIGHTS

Net income for the second quarter of 1994 was $13.7 million or $0.80 per common
share as compared to net income of $4.6 million or $0.28 per common share for
the second quarter of 1993. The 1994 second quarter results include
nonrecurring income, gains on the sale of a foreclosed property and the former
Union headquarters building, approximating $0.16 per share after tax. Excluding
this nonrecurring income, net income would have been $0.64 per common share for
the second quarter of 1994. During the second quarter of 1993, the Company
recorded net nonrecurring items, approximating $0.19 per share after tax,
related to the Union merger. Excluding these nonrecurring items, last year's
second quarter net income would have been $0.47 per share. Omitting all
nonrecurring items, 1994 second quarter net income is approximately 36% higher
than the second quarter of 1993.

The Company's net income for the first six months of 1994 of $23.8 million was
63% higher than the $14.6 of income recorded in the same period of last year.
Omitting all nonrecurring items, the 1994 year to date net income is 16% higher
than the same period in 1993. The improvement in 1994's first six months as
compared to the first six months of 1993 was primarily the result of a higher
net interest margin and lower noninterest expenses resulting from savings
realized in the Union merger. The net interest margin increased to 4.55% in the
second quarter of 1994 and was the result of an increase in net earning assets,
growth of higher yielding loans and close monitoring of rates paid on deposits.
Loan growth was strong with an annualized growth rate of over 26% for the
quarter and 16.5% for the six month period. Nonperforming assets declined to
1.02% of loans.

Income taxes recorded in the second quarter of 1993 were $4.0 million or an
effective tax rate of 46.3% compared to $8.1 million or an effective tax rate of
37.3% in the second quarter of 1994. The higher effective tax rate for the
second quarter of 1993 was due to a significant amount of acquisition costs
incurred during the quarter which were nondeductible for tax purposes.

Nonrecurring items were recorded in both the second quarter of 1993 and 1994.
During the second quarter of 1994, nonrecurring income of $4.9 million was
recorded representing gains on the sale of a foreclosed shopping center and the
former Union headquarters building. In 1993, as a result of the Union merger,
the Company recorded approximately $11.0 million of pre-tax nonrecurring
expenses during the second quarter of 1993.

Jim G. Farmer joined the executive management team of Worthen Banking
Corporation as president and chief operating officer of the Company in June,
1994. Prior to joining the Company, Farmer was president and CEO of two private
sector St. Louis-based companies, and previously served as an executive vice
president for Mark Twain Bancshares, a $2.5 billion banking organization. The
hiring of Farmer completes the senior management team of Andrew T. Melton,
executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer, Jim Patridge,
executive vice president and senior credit officer, and Gary Smith, executive
vice president. Another change in management during the second quarter was the
resignation of Jack Fleischauer, Jr. as president and chief operating officer of
Worthen National Bank of Arkansas ("WNBA"), the Company's largest banking
subsidiary. Curtis F. Bradbury, chairman of the board, and chief executive
officer of the Company will remain chairman and chief executive officer of WNBA.
Mr. Bradbury has served as chairman of the board of WNBA since August, 1988 and
as chief executive officer of WNBA since September, 1989. He will continue to
serve as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the Company.

The price of Worthen's common stock rose 39% during the quarter from a closing
price of $21 at March 31, 1994 to $29 1/8 at June 30, 1994, amid speculation
regarding changes in management and a possible business combination. The
Company is engaged in a comprehensive evaluation of its various strategic
alternatives in an effort to determine which are in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders. This evaluation is being conducted through a
methodical process which involves a comprehensive evaluation of possible
strategic alternatives for Worthen, including the alternative of remaining an
independent company. PaineWebber Incorporated has been engaged to assist with
the Company's review of these strategic alternatives. No decision has been made
to change Worthen's strategy of building long-range value for its shareholders
by working to achieve improvements in expense control, efficiency of operations
and profitability.

</TABLE>

The Company experienced unusually high loan growth in the second quarter,
especially in consumer loans. The quarterly growth of $108.4 million represents
an annualized growth rate of almost 26%, significantly higher than expected for
1994. The Company does not expect the growth rate to be sustained at levels
this high. For the first six months of 1994, loans have increased by $135.6
million or 16.5% on an annualized basis. Growth in the consumer, commercial and
real estate components was $65.8 million, $35.0 million and $34.7 million for
the first six months of 1994.

The consumer loan growth is the result of strong automobile sales in Arkansas
and a concerted marketing effort that targeted the indirect lending market.
Throughout the first half of 1994, relationships with several new customers were
established which produced significant new volume for the Little Rock affiliate.
At June 30, 1994 automobile loans totaled $288 million or approximately 58% of
the consumer loan outstandings, predominantly originated through the indirect
lending program.

11

<PAGE>

Loans secured by real estate continue to dominate the loan portfolio,
constituting $819 million or 46% of total loans. Management carefully manages
this concentration and explicitly considers the real estate concentration in the
evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Mitigating the overall risk of
this concentration is a high level of single-family loans totaling $255 million
and credit risk policies that restrict certain types of real estate lending
known to contain higher than acceptable risk, such as speculative investment
properties, hotels and restaurants. Generally, the real estate lending of the
Company is restricted to properties located in the State of Arkansas as a matter
of policy. As a result, management considers the real estate loan portfolio to
be well-diversified with a manageable risk profile.

ASSET QUALITY AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

The following table presents total nonperforming assets at June 30, 1994 and
1993, and December 31, 1993:

% of total loans plus other
nonperforming assets................................... 1.02% 1.40% 1.61%
Nonperforming as a % of equity.......................... 6.22 8.37 9.68
</TABLE>

Total nonperforming assets have declined from $23.2 million at December 31, 1993
to $18.2 million at June 30, 1994, a reduction of $5.0 million or 21%. The sale
of a foreclosed shopping center during the quarter ended June 30 resulted in a
reduction in nonperforming assets of $2.4 million, which was the most
significant event influencing these results. Additionally, two loans to
unrelated borrowers totaling $2.9 million that had been on nonaccrual status in
accordance with the Company's policies were returned to accruing status during
the quarter when the collection of principal and interest due was no longer
considered unlikely. Both of these loans are current as to principal and
interest due and collateral values are considered sufficient in relation to the
loan balances. Offsetting these events was a loan relationship totaling $2.6
million that was placed on nonearning status during the quarter. At the time
the relationship was placed on nonaccrual all principal and interest payments
were current; however, due to concerns with the value of the commercial building
collateralizing the loans and the borrower's ability to maintain the loans in
current status, it was determined that the recognition of interest income was no
longer appropriate.

Management is not aware of any trends or conditions that would forecast any
meaningful change in the level of problem assets in the near term. It is
management's opinion that the Company has reduced nonperforming assets to a
level such that additional improvements will likely be nominal, given that some
level of nonperforming assets will always exist due to the inherent risks of
lending. It is a management priority to minimize the dollar level of problem
assets at any point in time.

</TABLE>

Over the past several years, with the exception of 1993 which was distorted
somewhat due to the acquisition of Union, the Company has steadily been reducing
the amount of annual loan loss provisions in correlation with the improvements
in asset quality. The three month and six month periods ended June 30, 1994 are
no exception to this trend. For the quarter ended June 30, 1994, loan loss
provisions of $368,000 were recorded compared to $2.5 million in the comparable
quarter of 1993; for the six months ended June 30, 1994, loan loss provisions
were $753,000 compared to $3.2 million recorded in the same period of 1993.
Both 1993 periods include a special provision of $1.5 million that was made as a
result of the acquisition of Union. Excluding the special provision, the 1994
provision level is still considerably less than the 1993 provision, reflecting
the continuing improvement in asset quality of the Company. Net loan losses are
somewhat higher in 1994 than the levels of the prior year, but are still nominal
in relation to the loan portfolio, representing an annualized net charge-off
ratio of 0.06% of average loans. In addition to low levels of loan losses, the
Company has realized strong recoveries which has been a significant factor in
the declining net losses in 1993 and 1994.

The ending allowance in all periods presented has hovered near the $33 million
level, which, according to the internal evaluation methodologies, is an adequate
level given all factors considered. Because the allowance balance has remained
somewhat flat, however, the allowance as a percentage of loans has declined to
1.88% at June 30, 1994 due to the exceptional loan growth the Company has
realized in the first half of the year. Should the loan growth continue at the
recent pace, it may result in modest increases in the level of provisions in the
second half of 1994 and into 1995 in order to prevent an erosion in the
allowance as a percentage of loans.

LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY

The Company's negative gap increased by $88 million from year end 1993. This
reflects a $189 million decrease in assets repricing within one year, of which
$98 million occurred in loans. During the same period rate sensitive
liabilities declined by $100 million.

The decline in interest rate sensitive assets reflects a changing balance sheet
structure. Loan volume increased in the first six months of 1994, particularly
in installment loans. Installment loans are generally fixed rate and have an
initial maturity of greater than one year. There has also been a stronger
preference by loan customers to lock in longer term rates and move away from
floating rates. This is evidenced by the $146 million decline in loans
repriceable under 30 days. Another result of the increase in loans was a
decline in security and federal funds sold balances, which decreased by $187
million in total during 1994. However, securities with repricings under 30 days
increased by $68 million in an effort to take advantage of higher short term
rates and ensure adequate liquidity.

Interest-bearing deposits decreased by $58 million during the first six months
of 1994. This decline was more pronounced for deposits with repricing dates
under one year, which decreased by $94 million. Most of this decline occured in
time accounts as customers added balances to certificates with due dates beyond
one year ($36 million increase) to lock in more attractive yields.

Management believes that certain types of deposit accounts have a high degree of
stability and less than complete sensitivity to rate changes. This determination
is based on a review of historical activity in these accounts over a broad range
of interest rate cycles. This assessment has been supported through the most
recent increases in short term rates. The rates on transaction accounts have
remained stable without a decline in the balances in the accounts. Therefore, a
large part of the rate sensitivity risk implied by the negative gap at the
thirty day interval is mitigated because it is a result of stable transaction
accounts.

The Company's liquidity position is closely monitored and considered to be
adequate.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

As shown in the following table, the capital ratios of the Company continued to
improve during the second quarter of 1994 compared to December 31, 1993 and June
30, 1993. All of the Company's subsidiary banks maintain a rating of "well
capitalized" as defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991. The Company's risk-based capital ratio's of 13.41% for Tier I and
14.66% for total capital well exceed the regulatory required minimums.

Worthen announced in January 1994 that the Board of Directors increased the
regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share from $0.05 per share. The
dividend increase reflects the improved capital position of the Company's
largest bank resulting from the merger with Union and management's confidence in
the Company's current operations. The dividend payout ratio for the six month
period ending June 30, 1994 is approximately 21.4% compared to a ratio of 9.9%
for the first six months of 1993.

In April 1994, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan giving
management the authority to periodically repurchase up to a maximum of 450,000
shares of WBC common stock. These shares would then be reissued to individuals
participating in various employee stock incentive plans as the need arose. No
shares have been repurchased under this plan as of June 30, 1994.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Measured on a fully taxable equivalent basis, net interest income for the first
six months of 1994 was $5.9 million higher than the same period in 1993 for a
number of reasons. A higher volume of earning assets had a positive impact.
This was evident mainly in loans, which increased by $152 million over the
period. Since this category of assets has the highest yield, this contributed
positively to earnings. This shift of assets over the past four quarters was
funded, in part, by a decline in federal funds sold, which declined by $106
million. Interest-bearing liabilities increased over the period, but by only $21
million. Non-interest-bearing liabilities also grew by $68 million, which more
than offset a $15 million increase in non-interest-earning assets. The
difference in this growth supported the increase in earning assets, with no
associated interest expense. The combination of these factors helped to create
a favorable effect to earnings due to volume changes.

Interest income increased for the quarter because of volume growth and mix
changes. Loans increased as a percentage of earning assets, from 49% in 1993 to
54% in 1994. The total balance of loans grew by $201 million for the quarter.
These factors, along with a slight increase in market interest rates, were
responsible for the increase in interest income. Interest expense declined
during this period mainly because of a shift from time accounts to transaction
deposits and a decrease in the rates for savings and transaction accounts.

For the first six months of 1994, interest income was relatively unchanged. The
average yield of earning assets declined slightly, despite a general increase in
market rates. This was caused by an increase in consumer related loans at low
introductory rates. This was undertaken to gain a foothold in this highly
competitive market. For the period, loans grew by $152 million, although the
average yield on loans declined by seven basis points. Another factor that
prevented an increase in income was a $106 million decline in federal funds
sold, which experienced an increase in yield of almost one percent. These
liquid funds were used to support the growth of loans. Interest expense
declined for virtually the same reasons as mentioned above. Customers shifted
balances from time accounts into more liquid transaction accounts to take
advantage of expected increases in rates. Management has been able to keep the
costs of these accounts well controlled as market rates have increased.

Net interest income in the second quarter of 1994 was $3.5 million higher than
the second quarter of 1993. Net interest margin increased to 4.55% as compared
to 4.48% for the first quarter of 1994 and 4.28% for the fourth quarter of 1993.

OTHER INCOME

During the second quarter of 1994, nonrecurring income of $4.9 million was
recorded representing gains on the sale of a foreclosed shopping center and the
former Union headquarters building. The Company recorded $6.2 million in
nonrecurring income during the second quarter of 1993 including gains on sales
of securities acquired from Union and a gain on the sale of Union's corporate
jet. The Company sold all of Union's treasury securities with maturities in
excess of seven years to adjust Union's investment portfolio to Worthen's
investment policy guidelines. Excluding these nonrecurring items, other income
was $15.7 million in the second quarter of 1994 compared to $15.6 million in
1993. During the first six months of 1994, other income (excluding nonrecurring
items) was $30.4 million as compared to $31.3 million recorded during the same
period in 1993.

Year to date trust fees were down primarily as a result of adjusting from the
cash to accrual basis of recording income at one of the Company's affiliate
trust locations in January 1993. Brokerage commissions were down by
approximately $.0.5 million year to date. The overall decline in stock market
activity in the first six months of 1994 as compared to the first six months of
1993 resulted in lower commission sales.

The Company continues to emphasize the importance of growth in noninterest
related sources of income. Other income includes fees for deposit services,
trust services provided by Worthen Trust Company, full service and discount
brokerage commissions provided by Worthen Investments, Inc. ("WII"), mortgage
loan servicing fees and many other corporate and retail products.

OTHER EXPENSE

Excluding the nonrecurring items totalling $9.5 million in the second quarter of
1993 detailed below, operating expenses for the second quarter of 1994 increased
only 1.4% compared to 1993. Salaries and employee benefits include a $459,000
provision for stock appreciation rights expense during the second quarter of
1994 due to a 39% increase in WBC's common stock price during the quarter. Year
to date operating expenses decreased 1.9% from 1993 to 1994, excluding
nonrecurring items. Reductions in salaries and employee benefits, net
occupancy, advertising and business development are direct results of savings
realized in the Union merger. These reductions are impressive since 1994
results also include operating expenses attributable to First Bank of
Bentonville, which was acquired in September 1993. The increase in data
processing fees reflects the installation of an automated computer network at
each branch location to increase employee efficiency and provide much better
customer service. The sale of the former Union headquarters building will result
in additional savings in the net occupancy category in future quarters.

Approximately $9.5 million of nonrecurring other expenses related to the Union
merger were recorded during the second quarter of 1993. These nonrecurring
expenses include: employment expenses of $0.7 million, legal expenses of $1.5
million, investment banking fees of $2.1 million, expenses related to closing
branches of $1.3 million and $1.4 million in expense from writedowns of
purchased mortgage serving rights. The remainder of the expenses were for
signage, office supplies, various data processing conversions and various other
charges related to the merger.

The net overhead ratio was 1.82% for the first six months of 1994 as compared to
2.38% for the comparable period in 1993. Adjusting net overhead for the
nonrecurring other income and expense items, the net overhead ratio for the
first six months of 1994 was 2.10% as compared to 2.18% for 1993. The Company
intends to continue focusing attention on the level of noninterest expenses in
order to achieve better operating efficiencies.

REGULATORY MATTERS

On March 31, 1993, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FED")
advised WBC that the Company's application to merge The Union of Arkansas
Corporation with a subsidiary of WBC had been approved. The FED approved the
merger, in part, in reliance upon representations and commitments made to the
FED by the Company, by Stephens Group, Inc. and by certain Stephens family
members. These included a representation that Stephens Group, Inc. does not and
will not exert control over the management and policies of WBC and that Stephens
Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries will comply with the restrictions imposed by
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Management believes that such
representations and commitments will not materially affect the Company's general
business policies, financial condition, or results of operations. The Company
has also been advised that the FED has made a determination that Stephens Group,
Inc. and its affiliates, are affiliates of the Company, as that term is defined
in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.

The Board of Governors also notified the Company on March 31, 1993 that the
Board of Governors had ordered an investigation to review the ownership and
control of the Company for compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act and the
Change in Bank Control Act, including the nature and extent of the relationships
between the Company and Stephens Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Company
is not aware of any assertion by the Board of Governors that the Company is not
in compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act or the Change in Bank Control
Act. In the event the Board of Governors determines that there has been a
violation of the Bank Holding Company Act, it is authorized to initiate certain
administrative enforcement actions against the Company and its institution-
affiliated parties. These actions could include, among other things, the
issuance of an order to cease and desist or the assessment of monetary penalties
against the Company or its institution-affiliated parties. The amount of such
monetary penalties, if any, would be determined by the Board of Governors on the
basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged violations and
might or might not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial
condition or results of operations. In addition, under regulations promulgated
by the Board of Governors, in the event it determines that an impermissible
control relationship exists, it would have discretion to order either
termination of the impermissible control relationship, or the filing of an
application seeking the approval of such control relationship, or to pursue
other remedial actions. However, the Company cannot now predict the results or
the final outcome of the investigation. The Company intends to continue to
cooperate with the Board of Governors in this investigation.

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes was $8,135,000 for the second quarter of 1994
compared to $5,704,000 for the first quarter of 1994 and $4,003,000 for the
second quarter of 1993. The effective tax rates for the respective quarters
were 37.3%, 36.0% and 46.3%. The higher effective tax rate for the second
quarter of 1993 was due to a significant amount of acquisition costs incurred
during the quarter which were nondeductible for tax purposes. The Company
expects to be taxable at an approximate effective rate of 36% during the
remainder of 1994.

A complete discussion of the $868,000 gain recorded in the first quarter of 1993
related to the adoption of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," can be found at Note 5 (Change in
Accounting Principle - Income Taxes) to the financial statements.

PART II

OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, there are various legal proceedings pending
against WBC, its subsidiaries and affiliates, most of which are considered
litigation incidental to the conduct of business, including, among other
matters, defense of routine corporate, employment, banking, lender liability and
securities related litigation. Management, after consultation with legal
counsel and based upon available facts and proceedings to date which are
preliminary in certain instances, is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution
of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of WBC.
