Independent Auditors' Report

To the Owners of 
Walnut Creek Apartments

We have audited the accompanying statement of rental operations (as defined in
Note 2) of Walnut Creek Apartments for the year ended December 31, 1993. This
financial statement is the responsibility of the management of Walnut Creek
Apartments. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this statement based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in a
Current Report on Form 8-K of United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.), as described
in Note 4, and is not intended to be a complete presentation of Walnut Creek
Apartments revenues and expenses.

In our opinion, the statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material
respects, the income and operating expenses, as described in Note 2, of Walnut
Creek Apartments for the year ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO SUMMARY OF REVENUES AND CERTAIN RENTAL EXPENSES

The summaries of revenues and certain rental expenses reflect the
operations of Walnut Creek Apartments (the "Property") for the year ended
December 31, 1993 based upon the audited statement of rental operations of the
property appearing elsewhere herein and for the three month period ended March
31, 1994 based upon the unaudited statements of rental operations of
the property through the date on which it was acquired. During 1993 and a
portion of 1994, the property was owned and operated by an entity other than
United Dominion Realty Trust (the "Trust").

The summaries have been prepared on the accrual method of accounting.
Rental expenses include repair and maintenance expenses, utilities, real estate
taxes, insurance and certain other expenses. In accordance with the regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, mortgage interest expenses,
depreciation, and general and administrative costs have been excluded from
operating expenses, as they are dependent upon a particular owner, purchase
price or financial arrangement.

In assessing the property, management considered the existing and
potential tenant base, expected job growth in the area, occupancy rates, the
competitive nature of the market and comparative rental rates. Furthermore,
current and anticipated maintenance and repair costs, real estate taxes and
anticipated capital improvements were assessed.
