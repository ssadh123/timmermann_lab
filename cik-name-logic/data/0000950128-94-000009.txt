EXPLANATORY NOTE REGARDING FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Although the financial statements of the Marathon Group, the U.
S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group separately report the
assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and
stockholders' equity of USX attributed to each such group, such
attribution does not affect legal title to such assets and
responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of USX-Marathon
Group Common Stock, USX-U.S. Steel Group Common Stock and
USX-Delhi Group Common Stock are holders of common stock of USX
and continue to be subject to all the risks associated with an
investment in USX and all of its businesses and liabilities.
Financial impacts arising from any of the Marathon Group, the
U.S. Steel Group or the Delhi Group which affect the overall
cost of USX's capital could affect the results of operations
and financial condition of all groups. In addition, net losses
of any group, as well as dividends or distributions on any
class of USX common stock or series of Preferred Stock and
repurchases of any class of USX common stock or certain series
of Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally
available for payment of dividends on all classes of USX common
stock.

Management's Report

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of USX
Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (USX) are the
responsibility of and have been prepared by USX in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. They necessarily
include some amounts that are based on best judgments and
estimates. The consolidated financial information displayed in
other sections of this report is consistent with that in these
consolidated financial statements.
USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its
financial records by careful selection of its managers, by
organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate
division of responsibility and by communications programs aimed
at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
throughout the organization.
USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal
accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance
that assets are safeguarded and that financial records are
reliable. Appropriate management monitors the system for
compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure its
effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto. In
addition, as part of their audit of the consolidated financial
statements, USX's independent accountants, who are elected by
the stockholders, review and test the internal accounting
controls selectively to establish a basis of reliance thereon
in determining the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to
be applied.
The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the
area of financial reporting and internal accounting control
through its Audit Committee. This Committee, composed solely of
nonmanagement directors, regularly meets (jointly and
separately) with the independent accountants, management and
internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each of
its responsibilities relative to internal accounting controls
and the consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements appearing on pages U-4 through U-26 present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of USX
Corporation and Subsidiary Companies at December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility
of USX's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.
As discussed in Note 1, page U-10, in 1993 USX adopted new
accounting standards for postemployment benefits and for
retrospectively rated insurance contracts. As discussed in Note
8, page U-15, and Note 9, page U-16, in 1992 USX adopted new
accounting standards for postretirement benefits other than
pensions and for income taxes, respectively.

Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity

USX has three classes of common stock, being USX -- Marathon
Group Common Stock (Marathon Stock), USX -- U. S. Steel Group
Common Stock (Steel Stock), and USX -- Delhi Group Common Stock
(Delhi Stock), which are intended to reflect the performance of
the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group, and the Delhi Group,
respectively. (See Note 6, page U-12 for a description of the
three groups.)
The Marathon Stock and Steel Stock were initially
authorized and issued on May 6, 1991, when the USX Certificate
of Incorporation was amended and a distribution was made to
holders of USX common stock of one-fifth of a share of Steel
Stock, for each share of USX common stock held. Concurrent with
the Steel Stock distribution, each share of USX common stock
was changed into one share of Marathon Stock. Retroactive
effect has been given to the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock in
these consolidated financial statements. Also on May 6, 1991,
all shares of existing USX treasury stock were retired. The USX
Certificate of Incorporation was amended on September 30, 1992,
to authorize a new class of common stock. On October 2, 1992,
USX sold 9,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock to the public.
On all matters where the holders of Marathon Stock, Steel
Stock and Delhi Stock vote together as a single class, Marathon
Stock has one vote per share, and Steel Stock and Delhi Stock
each have a fluctuating vote per share based on the relative
market value of a share of Steel Stock or Delhi Stock, as the
case may be, to the market value of a share of Marathon Stock.
In the event of a disposition of all or substantially all the
properties and assets of either the U. S. Steel Group or the
Delhi Group, USX must either distribute the net proceeds to the
holders of the Steel Stock or Delhi Stock, as the case may be,
as a special dividend or in redemption of the stock, or
exchange the Steel Stock or Delhi Stock, as the case may be,
for one or the other remaining two classes of stock. In the
event of liquidation of USX, the holders of the Marathon Stock,
Steel Stock and Delhi Stock will share in the funds remaining
for common stockholders based on the relative market
capitalization of the respective Marathon Stock, Steel Stock or
Delhi Stock to the aggregate market capitalization of all
classes of common stock.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of USX Corporation
and its majority-owned subsidiaries (USX).
Investments in unincorporated oil and gas joint ventures are
accounted for on a pro rata basis. 
Investments in other entities in which USX has significant 
influence in management and control are accounted for using
the equity method of accounting and are carried in the
investment account at USX's share of net assets plus advances.
The proportionate share of income from equity investments is
included in other income.
Investments in marketable equity securities are carried at
lower of cost or market and investments in other companies are
carried at cost, with income recognized when dividends are
received.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS -- The following accounting standards
were adopted by USX during 1993: 
Postemployment benefits -- Effective January 1, 1993, USX 
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS 
No. 112). SFAS No. 112 requires employers to recognize the 
obligation to provide postemployment benefits on an accrual
basis if certain conditions are met. USX is affected 
primarily by disability-related claims covering indemnity 
and medical payments. The obligation for these claims is 
measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
including appropriate discount rates. The cumulative effect 
of the change in accounting principle determined as of 
January 1, 1993, reduced net income $86 million, net of $50
million income tax effect. The effect of the change in 
accounting principle reduced 1993 operating income by $23 
million. 
Accounting for multiple-year retrospectively rated insurance
contracts -- USX adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 
Consensus No. 93-14, "Accounting for Multiple-Year 
Retrospectively Rated Insurance Contracts". EITF No. 93-14
requires accrual of retrospective premium adjustments when 
the insured has an obligation to pay cash to the insurer 
that would not have been required absent experience under 
the contract. The cumulative effect of the change in 
accounting principle determined as of January 1, 1993, 
reduced net income $6 million, net of $3 million income tax
effect.

USX has not adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan" (SFAS No. 114). SFAS No. 114 requires impairment of loans
based on either the sum of discounted cash flows or the fair
value of underlying collateral. USX expects to adopt SFAS No.
114 in the first quarter of 1995. Based on preliminary
estimates, USX expects the unfavorable effect of adopting SFAS
No. 114 will be less than $2 million.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents includes
cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid debt instruments
with maturities generally of three months or less.

INVENTORIES -- Inventories are carried at lower of cost or
market. Cost of inventories is determined primarily under the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

HEDGING TRANSACTIONS -- USX enters into futures contracts,
commodity swaps and options to hedge exposure to price
fluctuations relevant to the purchase or sale of crude oil,
refined products and natural gas. Such transactions are
accounted for as part of the commodity being hedged. Forward
contracts are used to hedge currency risks, and the accounting
is based on the requirements of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 52.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT -- USX follows the successful
efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
development.

GAS BALANCING -- USX follows the sales method of accounting for
gas production imbalances.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Except for oil and gas
producing properties, depreciation is generally computed on the
straight-line method based upon estimated lives of assets.
USX's method of computing depreciation for steel producing
assets modifies straight-line depreciation based on level of

U-10
<PAGE> 14
production. In 1992, USX revised the modification factors used
in the depreciation of steel assets accounted for by the
modified straight-line method to reflect that raw steel
production capability is entirely continuous cast. The revised
modification factors range from a minimum of 85% at a
production level below 81% of capability, to a maximum of 105%
for a 100% production level. No modification is made at the 95%
production level, considered the normal long-range level.
Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing
properties are computed using predetermined rates based upon
estimated proved oil and gas reserves applied on a
units-of-production method.
Depletion of mineral properties, other than oil and gas, is
based on rates which are expected to amortize cost over the
estimated tonnage of minerals to be removed.
When an entire property, plant, major facility or facilities
depreciated on an individual basis are sold or otherwise
disposed of, any gain or loss is reflected in income. Proceeds
from disposal of other facilities depreciated on a group basis
are credited to the depreciation reserve with no immediate
effect on income.

INSURANCE -- USX is insured for catastrophic casualty and
certain property exposures, as well as those risks required to
be insured by law or contract. Costs resulting from noninsured
losses are charged against income upon occurrence.
RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain reclassifications of prior years'
data have been made to conform to 1993 classifications.

2. SALES
The items below were included in both sales and operating
costs, resulting in no effect on income:

(a) Gains resulted primarily from the sale of the Cumberland
coal mine, an investment in an insurance company and the
realization of deferred gain resulting from collection of
a subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of Transtar,
Inc. (Transtar). The collection also resulted in interest
income of $37 million.
(b) Included a $29 million favorable minority interest effect
related to a loss of RMI Titanium Company (a 51%-owned
company), of which $19 million resulted from restructuring
charges.
(c) Included a $177 million favorable adjustment related to
interest income from a refund of prior years' production
taxes.

U-11
<PAGE> 15
4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
The 1993 restructuring action involving the planned closure of
a Pennsylvania coal mine resulted in a $42 million charge to
operating income, primarily related to the writedown of
property, plant and equipment, contract termination, and mine
closure cost. In 1992, restructuring actions resulted in a $125
million charge to operating income, of which $115 was for the
disposition of nonstrategic domestic exploration and production
properties, and $10 million for the completion of the 1991
restructuring plan related to steel operations. The 1991
restructuring actions resulted in a $426 million charge to
operating income, primarily related to write-downs of property,
plant and equipment and employee costs related to the permanent
closing of certain steel facilities.

5. B&LE LITIGATION
Pretax income (loss) in 1993 included a $506 million charge
related to the adverse decision in the Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore
Antitrust Litigation against a former USX subsidiary, the
Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad (B&LE) (Note 25, page U-24).
Charges of $342 million were included in operating costs and
$164 million included in interest and other financial costs.
The effect on 1993 net income (loss) was $325 million
unfavorable ($5.04 per share of Steel Stock). At December 31,
1993, accounts payable included $376 million for this
litigation.

6. SEGMENT INFORMATION
USX has three classes of common stock: Marathon Stock, Steel
Stock and Delhi Stock, which are intended to reflect the
performance of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and
the Delhi Group, respectively. The segments of USX conform to
USX's group structure. A description of each group and its

7. PENSIONS
USX has noncontributory defined benefit plans covering
substantially all employees. Benefits under these plans are
based upon years of service and final average pensionable
earnings, or a minimum benefit based upon years of service,
whichever is greater. In addition, contributory pension
benefits, which cover certain participating salaried employees,
are based upon years of service and career earnings. The
funding policy for defined benefit plans provides that payments
to the pension trusts shall be equal to the minimum funding
requirements of ERISA plus such additional amounts as may be
approved from time to time.
USX also participates in multi-employer plans, most of
which are defined benefit plans associated with coal
operations.

PENSION COST (CREDIT) -- The defined benefit cost for major
plans was determined assuming an expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets of 10% for 1993 and 11% for 1992 and
1991.

FUNDS' STATUS -- The assumed discount rate used to measure the
benefit obligations of major plans was 6.5% and 7% at December
31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, respectively. The assumed rate
of future increases in compensation levels was 3% and 4% at
December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992, respectively. Plans
with accumulated benefit obligations (ABO) in excess of plan
assets were not material in 1992.

8. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

USX has defined benefit retiree health and life insurance plans
covering most employees upon their retirement. Health benefits
are provided, for the most part, through comprehensive
hospital, surgical and major medical benefit provisions subject
to various cost sharing features. Life insurance benefits are
provided to nonunion and certain union represented retiree
beneficiaries primarily based on employees' annual base salary
at retirement. For other union retirees, benefits are provided
for the most part based on fixed amounts negotiated in labor
contracts with the appropriate unions. Except for certain life
insurance benefits paid from reserves held by insurance
carriers, benefits have not been prefunded. In 1994, USX agreed
to establish a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association
(VEBA) Trust to prefund health care and life insurance benefits
for retirees who are covered under the USWA union agreement.
Minimum contributions, in the form of USX Corporation stock or
cash, are expected to be $25 million in 1994 and $10 million
per year thereafter.
In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS No. 106), which requires
accrual accounting for all postretirement benefits other than
pensions. USX elected to recognize immediately the transition
obligation determined as of January 1, 1992, which represents
the excess accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
for current and future retirees over the fair value of plan
assets and recorded postretirement benefit cost accruals. The
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle reduced
net income $1,306 million, consisting of the transition
obligation of $2,070 million, net of $764 million income tax
effect.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST -- Postretirement benefit cost for
defined benefit plans for 1993 and 1992 was determined assuming
a discount rate of 7% and 8%, respectively, and an expected
return on plan assets of 10% for each year presented below:

.................................................................................................
</TABLE>

(a)In 1993, a new multi-employer benefit plan created by the
Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 replaced
the previous plan provided under the collective bargaining
agreement with the United Mine Workers of America. USX is
required to make payments to the plan based on assigned
beneficiaries receiving benefits and such payments are
expected to increase to approximately $15 million to $25
million in 1994 and subsequent years. The present value
of this unrecognized obligation is broadly estimated to
be $220 million, including the effects of future medical
inflation, and this amount could increase if additional
beneficiaries are assigned.

Prior to 1992, the cost of providing health care benefits
to retired employees was recognized as an expense primarily as
claims were paid, and the cost of life insurance benefits for
retirees was generally accrued during their working years.
These costs totaled $155 million for 1991.

FUNDS' STATUS -- The following table sets forth the plans'
funded status and the amounts reported in USX's consolidated
balance sheet:

</TABLE>

The assumed discount rate used to measure the APBO was
6.5% and 7% at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
respectively. The assumed rate of future increases in
compensation levels was 4% at December 31, 1993, and December
31, 1992. The weighted average health care cost trend rate in
1994 is approximately 8%, gradually declining to an ultimate
rate in 1997 of approximately 6%. A one percentage point
increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates for each
future year would have increased the aggregate of the service
and interest cost components of the 1993 net periodic
postretirement benefit cost by $34 million and would have
increased the APBO as of December 31, 1993, by $372 million.

SETTLEMENTS -- Other income disclosed in Note 3, page U-11,
included a settlement gain of $24 million resulting from the
sale of the Cumberland coal mine.

9. INCOME TAXES

In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No.
109), which requires an asset and liability approach in
accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income
tax assets and liabilities are established to reflect the
future tax consequences of carryforwards and differences
between the tax bases and financial bases of assets and
liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle determined as of January 1, 1992, reduced net income
$360 million.

(a)Computed in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 11. The deferred tax benefit of $144 million in
1991 was primarily the net result of the generation of
federal tax loss carryforwards and timing differences
related to restructuring charges and pension accruals.

In 1993, the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principles for postemployment benefits and for retrospectively
rated insurance contracts included deferred tax benefits of $50
million and $3 million, respectively (Note 1, page U-10). In
1992, the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle for other postretirement benefits included a deferred
tax benefit of $764 million (Note 8, page U-15).

The consolidated tax returns of USX for the years 1988
through 1991 are under various stages of audit and
administrative review by the IRS. USX believes it has made
adequate provision for income taxes and interest which may
become payable for years not yet settled.
Pretax income (loss) included $(53) million, $55 million
and $162 million attributable to foreign sources in 1993, 1992
and 1991, respectively.

12. SALES OF RECEIVABLES

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE -- USX has entered into agreements to sell
certain accounts receivable subject to limited recourse.
Payments are collected from the sold accounts receivable; the
collections are reinvested in new accounts receivable for the
buyers; and a yield based on defined short-term market rates is
transferred to the buyers. Collections on sold accounts
receivable will be forwarded to the buyers at the end of the
agreements in 1994 and 1995, in the event of earlier contract
termination or if USX does not have a sufficient quantity of
eligible accounts receivable to reinvest in for the buyers. The
balance of sold accounts receivable averaged $733 million, $703
million and $704 million for years 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. At December 31, 1993, the balance of sold
accounts receivable that had not been collected was $740
million. Buyers have collection rights to recover payments from
an amount of outstanding receivables equal to 120% of the
outstanding receivables purchased on a nonrecourse basis; such
overcollateralization cannot exceed $150 million. USX does not
generally require collateral for accounts receivable, but
significantly reduces credit risk through credit extension and
collection policies, which include analyzing the financial
condition of potential customers, establishing credit limits,
monitoring payments and aggressively pursuing delinquent
accounts. In the event of a change in control of USX, as
defined in the agreements, USX may be required to forward
payments collected on sold accounts receivable to the buyers.

LOANS RECEIVABLE -- Prior to 1993, USX Credit, a division of
USX, sold certain of its loans receivable subject to limited
recourse. USX Credit continues to collect payments from the
loans and transfer to the buyers principal collected plus yield
based on defined short-term market rates. In 1993, 1992 and
1991, USX Credit net sales (repurchases) of loans receivable
totaled $(50) million, $(24) million and $85 million,
respectively. At December 31, 1993, the balance of sold loans
receivable subject to recourse was $205 million. USX Credit is
not actively seeking new loans at this time. USX Credit is
subject to market risk through fluctuations in short-term
market rates on sold loans which pay fixed interest rates. USX
Credit significantly reduces credit risk through a credit
policy, which requires that loans be secured by the real
property or equipment financed, often with additional security
such as letters of credit, personal guarantees and committed
long-term financing takeouts. Also, USX Credit diversifies its
portfolio as to types and terms of loans, borrowers, loan
sizes, sources of business and types and locations of
collateral. As of December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, USX
Credit had outstanding loan commitments of $29 million and $32
million, respectively. In the event of a change in control of
USX, as defined in the agreement, USX may be required to
provide cash collateral in the amount of the uncollected loans
receivable to assure compliance with the limited recourse
provisions.
Estimated credit losses under the limited recourse
provisions for both accounts receivable and loans receivable
are recognized when the receivables are sold consistent with
bad debt experience. Recognized liabilities for future recourse
obligations of sold receivables were $3 million and $1 million
at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, respectively.

commitment fee of 3/8%. Certain other banks provide
short-term lines of credit totaling $185 million which
require maintenance of compensating balances of 3%. No

(a) An agreement which terminates in October 1995 provides for
borrowing under a $1,000 million revolving credit
facility and a $500 million term loan. A second agreement
provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility with
a second revolving credit period terminating on July 1,
1994, unless otherwise extended; any participating bank
failing to extend the revolving credit period has an
obligation, upon the demand of USX, to fund a term loan
which would be payable in October 1995. Interest is based
on defined short-term market rates. During the term of
these agreements, USX is obligated to pay a commitment fee
of 3/8% on the unused portions. At December 31, 1993, the
unused and available credit was $1,500 million; 
accordingly, the 9 1/2% Guaranteed Notes due 1994 have been
classified as long-term debt. 
(b) Foreign currency exchange agreements were executed in 
connection with these foreign currency obligations,
which effectively fixed the amount of interest and debt in
U.S. dollars, thereby eliminating currency exchange risks. 
(c) The Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures have a 
principal at maturity of $920 million. The original
issue discount is being amortized recognizing a yield to
maturity of 7 7/8% per annum. The carrying value represents
the principal at maturity less the unamortized discount.
Each debenture of $1,000 principal at maturity is
convertible into a unit consisting of 8.207 shares of
Marathon Stock and 1.6414 shares of Steel Stock subject to
adjustment or, at the election of USX, cash equal to the
market value of the unit. At the option of the holder, USX
will purchase debentures at the carrying value of $430
million and $625 million on August 9, 1995, and August 9,
2000, respectively; USX may elect to pay the purchase price
in cash, shares of both common stocks or notes. USX may
call the debentures for redemption at the issue price plus
amortized discount beginning on August 9, 1995, or earlier
if the market value of one share of Marathon Stock and
one-fifth of a share of Steel Stock equals or exceeds
$57.375 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days. 
(d) The debentures are convertible into one share of Marathon
Stock and one-fifth of a share of Steel Stock subject to
adjustment for $62.75 and are redeemable at USX's option.
Sinking fund requirements for all years through 1995 have
been satisfied through repurchases. 
(e) The debentures are convertible into one share of Marathon
Stock and one-fifth of a share of Steel Stock subject to
adjustment for $38.125 and may be redeemed by USX. The
sinking fund begins in 1997. 
(f) At December 31, 1993, USX had outstanding obligations 
relating to short-term maturity Environmental Improvement 
Bonds in the amount of $203 million, which were supported 
by long-term credit arrangements. 
(g) The notes may be redeemed at par by USX on or after March 
1, 1996. 
(h) The notes pay interest monthly at 9 3/4% per annum until 
March 1, 1994, and at 7% per annum thereafter. 
(i) The guaranteed loan was used to fund a portion of the 
costs in connection with the development of the East
Brae Field and the SAGE pipeline in the North Sea. A
portion of proceeds from a long-term gas sales contract is
dedicated to loan service under certain circumstances.
Prepayment of the loan may be required under certain
situations, including events impairing the security
interest. 
(j) Required payments of long-term debt for the years 1995-
1998 are $595 million, $349 million, $233 million and
$509 million, respectively. 
(k) In the event of a change in control of USX, as defined in 
the related agreements, debt obligations totaling $3,795
million may be declared immediately due and payable. The
principal obligations subject to such a provision are
Revolving credit/term loan agreements -- $500 million;
Senior Notes -- $100 million; Notes payable -- $2,098
million; Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures -- $378
million; Guaranteed Loan -- $300 million; and 9 3/4%
Guaranteed Notes -- $161 million. In such event, USX may
also be required to either repurchase the leased Fairfield
slab caster for $116 million or provide a letter of credit
to secure the remaining obligation. 
(l) At December 31, 1993, $82 million of 4 5/8% Sinking Fund 
Subordinated Debentures due 1996, which have been
extinguished by placing securities into an irrevocable
trust, were still outstanding.

At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, the LIFO
method accounted for 87% and 91%, respectively, of total
inventory value. Current acquisition costs were estimated to
exceed the above inventory values at December 31 by
approximately $340 million and $390 million in 1993 and 1992,
respectively.
Cost of sales was reduced and operating income was
increased by $11 million, $24 million and $36 million in 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively, as a result of liquidations of
LIFO inventories.
The inventory market valuation reserve reflects the extent
that the recorded cost of crude oil and refined products
inventories exceeds net realizable value. The reserve is
decreased to reflect increases in market prices and inventory
turnover and increased to reflect decreases in market prices.
Changes in the inventory market valuation reserve resulted in
charges (credits) to operating income of $241 million, $(62)
million and $260 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

19. PREFERRED STOCK

USX is authorized to issue 40,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, without par value. The following series were
outstanding as of December 31, 1993:

ADJUSTABLE RATE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK -- As of December
31, 1993, a total of 2,099,970 shares (stated value $50 per
share) were outstanding. Dividend rates vary within a range of
7-1/2% to 15-3/4% per annum in accordance with a formula based
on various U.S. Treasury security rates. In 1993, dividend
rates on an annualized basis ranged from 7.5% to 8.15%. This
stock is redeemable, at USX's sole option, at a price of $50
per share.

6.50% CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (6.50%
CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK) -- As of December 31, 1993,
6,900,000 shares (stated value of $1.00 per share; liquidation
preference of $50.00 per share) were outstanding. The 6.50%
Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at any time, at the
option of the holder, into shares of Steel Stock at a
conversion price of $46.125 per share of Steel Stock, subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances. On and after April 1,
1996, this stock is redeemable at USX's sole option, at a
price of $52.275 per share, and thereafter at prices declining
annually on each April 1 to an amount equal to $50.00 per
share on and after April 1, 2003.

20. STOCK PLANS

The 1990 Stock Plan (1990 Plan) and its predecessor plans were
amended in 1991 to reflect the distribution of Steel Stock and
change of USX common stock into Marathon Stock and in 1992 to
reflect the issuance of Delhi Stock. Each option or stock
appreciation right outstanding on May 6, 1991, was converted
into two awards: one for the same number of shares of Marathon
Stock and the other for one-fifth of that number of shares of
Steel Stock, separately exercisable at prices based on the
former exercise price apportioned on the basis of the fair
market value of the two stocks on May 7, 1991. No adjustment
of previously granted options or stock appreciation rights was
made to reflect the authorization or the issuance of Delhi
Stock.
The 1990 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors to grant the following awards to key
management employees; no further options will be granted under
the predecessor plans.

OPTIONS -- the right to purchase shares of Marathon Stock,
Steel Stock or Delhi Stock at not less than 100 percent of
the fair market value of the stock at date of grant.

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS -- the right to receive cash
and/or common stock equal to the excess of the fair market
value of a share of common stock, as determined in
accordance with the plan, over the fair market value of a
share on the date the right was granted for a specified
number of shares.

RESTRICTED STOCK -- stock for no cash consideration or for
such other consideration as determined by the Compensation
Committee, subject to provisions for forfeiture and
restricting transfer. Restriction may be removed as
conditions such as performance, continuous service and other
criteria are met.

Such employees are generally granted awards of the
class of common stock intended to reflect the performance of
the group in which they work. Up to .5 percent of the
outstanding Marathon Stock and .8 percent of each of the
outstanding Steel Stock and Delhi Stock, as determined on
December 31 of the preceding year, are available for grants
during each calendar year the 1990 Plan is in effect. In
addition, awarded shares that do not result in shares being
issued are available for subsequent grant in the same year,
and any ungranted shares from prior years' annual allocations
are available for subsequent grant during the years the 1990
Plan is in effect. As of December 31, 1993, 3,984,949 Marathon
Stock shares, 1,246,329 Steel Stock shares and 74,307 Delhi
Stock shares were available for grants in 1994.

21. DIVIDENDS

In accordance with the USX Certificate of Incorporation,
dividends on the Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock
are limited to the legally available funds of USX. Net losses
of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group or the Delhi
Group as well as dividends or distributions on any class of
USX common stock or series of preferred stock and repurchases
of any class of USX common stock or certain series of
Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally
available for payment of dividends on all classes of USX
common stock. Subject to this limitation, the Board of
Directors intends to declare and pay dividends on the Marathon
Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock based on the financial
condition and results of operations of the related group,
although it has no obligation under Delaware Law to do so. In
making its dividend decisions with respect to each of the
Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock, the Board of
Directors considers, among other things, the long-term
earnings and cash flow capabilities of the related group as
well as the dividend policies of similar publicly traded
companies.
Dividends on the Steel Stock and Delhi Stock are further
limited to the Available Steel Dividend Amount and the
Available Delhi Dividend Amount, respectively. At December 31,
1993, the Available Steel Dividend Amount was at least $1.849
billion, and the Available Delhi Dividend Amount was at least
$125 million. The Available Steel Dividend Amount and
Available Delhi Dividend Amount, respectively, will be
increased or decreased, as appropriate, to reflect the
respective group's separately reported net income, dividends,
repurchases or issuances with respect to the related class of
common stock and preferred stock attributed to the respective
groups and certain other items.
The initial dividends on the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock
were paid September 10, 1991. Dividends paid by USX prior to
that date were attributed to the Marathon Group and the U. S.
Steel Group based upon the relationship of the initial
dividends on the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock.

22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

Net income (loss) per share amounts are presented for the
Marathon Stock and Steel Stock to reflect the distribution of
the Steel Stock and change of USX common stock into Marathon
Stock effective at the close of business on May 6, 1991. For
purposes of computing net income (loss) per share data for
periods prior to May 7, 1991, the numbers of Marathon Stock
shares are assumed to be the same as the corresponding numbers
of shares of USX common stock, while the numbers of Steel
Stock shares are assumed to be one-fifth of the corresponding
numbers of shares of USX common stock.
The method of calculating net income (loss) per share for
the Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock reflects the
USX Board of Directors' intent that the separately reported
earnings and surplus of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel
Group and the Delhi Group, as determined consistent with the
USX Certificate of Incorporation, are available for payment of
dividends to the respective classes of stock, although legally
available funds and liquidation preferences of these classes
of stock do not necessarily correspond with these amounts. The
financial statements of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel
Group and the Delhi Group, taken together, include all
accounts which comprise the corresponding consolidated
financial statements of USX.
The USX Board of Directors initially deemed 14,000,000
shares of Delhi Stock to represent 100% of the common
stockholders' equity value of USX attributable to the Delhi
Group. The Delhi Fraction is the percentage interest in the
Delhi Group represented by the shares of Delhi Stock that are
outstanding at any particular time and, based on 9,282,870
outstanding shares at December 31, 1993, is approximately 66%.
The Marathon Group financial statements reflect a percentage
interest in the Delhi Group of approximately 34% (Retained
Interest) at December 31, 1993. Income per share applicable
to outstanding Delhi Stock is presented for the periods
subsequent to the October 2, 1992, initial issuance of Delhi
Stock.
Primary net income (loss) per share is calculated by
adjusting net income (loss) for dividend requirements of
preferred stock and, in the case of Delhi Stock, for the
income applicable to the Retained Interest; and is based on
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus
common stock equivalents, provided they are not antidilutive.
Common stock equivalents result from assumed exercise of stock
options and surrender of stock appreciation rights associated
with stock options where applicable.
Fully diluted net income (loss) per share assumes
conversion of convertible securities for the applicable
periods outstanding and assumes exercise of stock options and
surrender of stock appreciation rights, provided, in each
case, the effect is not antidilutive.

23. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Exchange adjustments resulting from foreign currency
transactions generally are recognized in income, whereas
adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements
are reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
For 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, the aggregate foreign
currency transaction gains (losses) included in determining
net income were $(3) million, $14 million and $(3) million. An
analysis of changes in cumulative foreign currency translation
adjustments follows:

24. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

USX's Board of Directors has adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan
and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each
outstanding share of Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi
Stock referred to together as "Voting Stock." Each right
becomes exercisable, at a price of $120, when any person or
group has acquired, obtained the right to acquire or made a
tender or exchange offer for 15 percent or more of the total
voting power of the Voting Stock, except pursuant to a
qualifying all-cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of
Voting Stock, which is accepted with respect to shares of
Voting Stock representing a majority of the voting power other
than Voting Stock beneficially owned by the offeror. Each
right entitles the holder, other than the acquiring person or
group, to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A
Junior Preferred Stock or, upon the acquisition by any person
of 15 percent or more of the total voting power of the Voting
Stock, Marathon Stock, Steel Stock or Delhi Stock (as the case
may be) or other property having a market value of twice the
exercise price. After the rights become exercisable, if USX is
acquired in a merger or other business combination where it is
not the survivor, or if 50 percent or more of USX's assets,
earnings power or cash flow are sold or transferred, each
right entitles the holder to purchase common stock of the
acquiring entity having a market value of twice the exercise
price. The rights and exercise price are subject to
adjustment, and the rights expire on October 9, 1999, or may
be redeemed by USX for one cent per right at any time prior to
the point they become exercisable. Under certain
circumstances, the Board of Directors has the option to
exchange one share of the respective class of Voting Stock for
each exercisable right.

25. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations
relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are
discussed below. The ultimate resolution of these
contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be
material to the consolidated financial statements. However,
management believes that USX will remain a viable and
competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these
contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS --
B&LE litigation; MDL-587
On January 24, 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a
petition for Writ of Certiorari by the B&LE in the Lower 
Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation (MDL-587). 
As a result, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Third Circuit affirming judgments of approximately $498
million, plus interest, relating to antitrust violations by 
the B&LE was permitted to stand. In addition, the Third Circuit
decision remanded the claims of two plaintiffs for retrial of
their damage awards. At trial these plaintiffs asserted claims
of approximately $8 million, but were awarded only nominal
damages by the jury. A new trial date has not been set. Any
damages awarded in a new trial may be more or less than 
$8 million and would be subject to trebling.
The B&LE was a wholly owned subsidiary of USX throughout the
period the conduct occurred. It is now a subsidiary of Transtar
in which USX has a 45% equity interest. These actions were
excluded liabilities in the sale of USX's transportation units
in 1988, and USX is obligated to reimburse Transtar for
judgments paid by the B&LE.

Following the Court of Appeals decision, USX, which had
previously accrued $90 million on a pretax basis for this
litigation, charged an additional amount of $619 million on a
pretax basis in the second quarter of 1993. In late 1993, USX
and LTV Steel Corp. ("LTV"), one of the plaintiffs in MDL-587,
agreed to settle all of LTV's claims in that action for $375
million. USX made a payment of $200 million on December 29,
1993, and is obligated to pay an additional $175 million not
later than February 28, 1994. Claims of three additional
plaintiffs were also settled in December 1993. 

These settlements resulted in a pretax credit of $127 million 
in the fourth quarter financial results of the U.S. Steel
Group. As a result of the denial of the Petition for Writ 
of Certiorari, judgments for the other MDL-587 plaintiffs 
(other than the two remanded for retrial), totaling 
approximately $210 million, including postjudgment interest, 
are due for payment in the first quarter of 1994.

U-24
<PAGE> 28
25. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

B&LE litigation; Armco
In June 1990, following judgments entered on behalf of
steel company plaintiffs in MDL-587, Armco Steel filed federal
antitrust claims against the B&LE and other railroads in the
Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. B&LE
successfully challenged the actions for lack of jurisdiction
and venue, and the case was transferred to the Federal
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Other
defendant railroads settled with Armco, leaving B&LE as the
only remaining defendant. On April7, 1993, B&LE's motion to
dismiss the federal antitrust claims on grounds of statute of
limitations was granted. Subsequently, Armco refiled its
claims under the Ohio Valentine Act. B&LE's motions for
summary judgment on time bar issues and for change of venue
are pending, and not yet fully briefed. No discovery has been
taken on the merits of Armco's claims, but if Armco survives
the present and possibly further pretrial motions and the case
proceeds to trial on the merits, Armco's claimed damages are
likely to be substantial. There is a dispute whether the Armco
case was an excluded liability in the sale of USX's
transportation units and whether USX is obligated to reimburse
Transtar for a judgment in this case.

Energy Buyers litigation
On December 21, 1992, an arbitrator issued an award for
approximately $117 million, plus interest under Ohio law,
against USX in Energy Buyers Service Corporation v. USX, a
case originally filed in the District Court of Harris County,
Texas. Such amount was fully accrued as of December 31, 1992.
On December 15, 1993, USX agreed to settle all claims in the
case for $95 million and deferrred payments of up to $9
million.

Pickering litigation
On November 3, 1992, the United States District Court for
the District of Utah Central Division issued a Memorandum
Opinion and Order in Pickering v. USX relating to pension and
compensation claims by approximately 1,900 employees of USX's
former Geneva (Utah) Works. Although the court dismissed a
number of the claims by the plaintiffs, it found that USX had
violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by
interfering with the accrual of pension benefits of certain
employees and amending a benefit plan to reduce the accrual of
future benefits without proper notice to plan participants.
Further proceedings were held to determine damages and,
pending the court's determinations, USX may appeal.
Plaintiffs' counsel has been reported as estimating
plaintiffs' anticipated recovery to be in excess of $100
million. USX believes actual damages will be substantially
less than plaintiffs' estimates.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS --
USX is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws
and regulations relating to the environment. These laws
generally provide for control of pollutants released into the
environment and require responsible parties to undertake
remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may
be imposed for noncompliance. USX provides for remediation
costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is
probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably
determinable. Generally, the timing of these accruals
coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the
commitment to a formal plan of action. At December 31, 1993,
and 1992, accrued liabilities for remediation, platform
abandonment and mine reclamation totaled $312 million and $280
million, respectively. It is not presently possible to
estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that
might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed.
For a number of years, USX has made substantial capital
expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance with
various laws relating to the environment. In 1993 and 1992,
such capital expenditures totaled $181 million and $294
million, respectively. USX anticipates making additional such
expenditures in the future; however, the exact amounts and
timing of such expenditures are uncertain because of the
continuing evolution of specific regulatory requirements.

LIBYAN OPERATIONS --
By reason of Executive Orders and related regulations
under which the U.S. Government is continuing economic
sanctions against Libya, USX was required to discontinue
performing its Libyan petroleum contracts on June 30, 1986. In
June 1989, the Department of the Treasury authorized USX to
resume performing under those contracts. Pursuant to that
authorization, USX has engaged the Libyan National Oil Company
and the Secretary of Petroleum in continuing negotiations to
determine when and on what basis they are willing to allow USX
to resume realizing revenue from USX's investment of $108
million in Libya. USX is uncertain when these negotiations can
be completed or how the negotiations will be affected by the
United Nations sanctions against Libya.

GUARANTEES --
Guarantees by USX of the liabilities of affiliated and
other entities totaled $227 million at December31, 1993, and
$258 million at December 31, 1992. In the event that any
defaults of guaranteed liabilities occur, USX has access to
its interest in the assets of most of the affiliates to reduce
losses resulting from these guarantees. As of December 31,
1993, the largest guarantee for a single affiliate was $96
million.

U-25
<PAGE> 29
25. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, USX's pro
rata share of obligations of LOOP INC. and various pipeline
affiliates secured by throughput and deficiency agreements
totaled $206 million and $216 million, respectively. Under the
agreements, USX is required to advance funds if the affiliates
are unable to service debt. Any such advances are prepayments
of future transportation charges.

COMMITMENTS --
At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, contract
commitments for capital expenditures for property, plant and
equipment totaled $389 million and $423 million, respectively.
USX has entered into a 15-year take-or-pay arrangement
which requires USX to accept pulverized coal each month or pay
a minimum monthly charge. In 1993, charges for deliveries of
pulverized coal which began in 1993 totaled $14 million. In
the future, USX will be obligated to make minimum payments of
approximately $16 million per year. If USX elects to terminate
the contract early, a maximum termination payment of $126
million, which declines over the duration of the agreement,
may be required.
USX is a party to a transportation agreement with Transtar
for Great Lakes shipments of raw materials required by steel
operations. The agreement cannot be canceled until 1999 and
requires USX to pay, at a minimum, Transtar's annual fixed
costs related to the agreement, including lease/charter costs,
depreciation of owned vessels, dry dock fees and other
administrative costs. Total transportation costs under the
agreement were $68 million in 1993 and $66 million in 1992,
including fixed costs of $21 million in each year. The fixed
costs are expected to continue at approximately the same level
over the duration of the agreement.

(a) The difference between carrying value and fair value
principally represented the subordinated note related to
the earlier sale of the majority interest in Transtar
which was carried at no value due to the highly leveraged
nature of the transaction. The note was paid in full in
1993 resulting in other income of $70 million and interest
income of $37 million (Note 3, page U-11).

Fair value of financial instruments classified as
current assets or liabilities approximate carrying value due
to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Fair value of
long-term receivables and other investments was based on
discounted cash flows or other specific instrument analysis.
Fair value of long-term debt instruments was based on market
prices where available or current borrowing rates available
for financings with similar terms and maturities.
USX's unrecognized financial instruments consist of
receivables sold subject to limited recourse, commitments to
extend credit, financial guarantees, and commodity swaps. It
is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these forms
of financial instrument obligations. For details relating to
sales of receivables and commitments to extend credit see Note
12, page U-18. For details relating to financial guarantees
see Note 25, page U-25. The contract value of open natural gas
commodity swaps, as of December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992
totaled $92 million and $13 million, respectively. The swap
arrangements vary in duration with certain individual
contracts extending into early 1996.

27. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On February 2, 1994, USX sold 5,000,000 shares of Steel Stock
to the public for net proceeds of $201 million, which will be
reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial
statements.

ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES
The following estimates of net reserves have been
determined by deducting royalties of various kinds from USX's
gross reserves. The reserve estimates are believed to be
reasonable and consistent with presently known physical data
concerning size and character of the reservoirs and are
subject to change as additional knowledge concerning the
reservoirs becomes available. The estimates include only such
reserves as can reasonably be classified as proved; they do
not include reserves which may be found by extension of proved
areas or reserves recoverable by secondary or tertiary
recovery methods unless these methods are in operation and are
showing successful results. Undeveloped reserves consist of
reserves to be recovered from future wells on undrilled
acreage or from existing wells where relatively major
expenditures will be required to realize production. Liquid
hydrocarbon production amounts for international operations
principally reflect tanker liftings of equity production. USX
did not have any quantities of oil and gas reserves subject to
long-term supply agreements with foreign governments or
authorities in which USX acts as producer.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS AND 
CHANGES THEREIN RELATING TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

Estimated discounted future net cash flows and changes
therein were determined in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 69. Certain information
concerning the assumptions used in computing the valuation of
proved reserves and their inherent limitations are discussed
below. USX believes such information is essential for a proper
understanding and assessment of the data presented.
Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end
prices of oil and gas relating to USX's proved reserves to the
year-end quantities of those reserves. Future price changes
are considered only to the extent provided by contractual
arrangements in existence at year-end.
The assumptions used to compute the proved reserve
valuation do not necessarily reflect USX's expectations of
actual revenues to be derived from those reserves nor their
present worth. Assigning monetary values to the estimated
quantities of reserves, described on the preceding page, does
not reduce the subjective and ever-changing nature of such
reserve estimates.
Additional subjectivity occurs when determining present
values because the rate of producing the reserves must be
estimated. In addition to uncertainties inherent in predicting
the future, variations from the expected production rate also
could result directly or indirectly from factors outside of
USX's control, such as unintentional delays in development,
environmental concerns, changes in prices or regulatory
controls.
The reserve valuation assumes that all reserves will be
disposed of by production. However, if reserves are sold in
place or subjected to participation by foreign governments,
additional economic considerations also could affect the
amount of cash eventually realized.
Future development and production costs are computed by
estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and
producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the
year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of
existing economic conditions.
Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the
appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration
of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pretax
net cash flows relating to USX's proved oil and gas reserves.
Permanent differences in oil and gas related tax credits and
allowances are recognized.
Discount was derived by using a discount rate of 10
percent a year to reflect the timing of the future net cash
flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction
with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME

SALES were $18.1 billion in 1993, compared with $17.8 billion in
1992 and $18.8 billion in 1991. The increase in 1993 primarily
reflected increased sales for the U. S. Steel Group due mainly to
higher steel shipment volumes and prices, and increased commercial
shipments of taconite pellets and coke. These were partially offset by
lower sales for the Marathon Group (excluding the effect of the
businesses of the Delhi Group which were included in the Marathon
Group for periods prior to October 2, 1992) due mainly to lower
worldwide liquid hydrocarbon volumes and prices and lower average
refined product prices, partially offset by increased excise taxes
(which have no effect on income) and higher refined product sales
volumes, excluding matching buy/sell transactions. The decrease from
1991 to 1992 primarily reflected reduced sales for the Marathon Group
due mainly to lower average refined product prices, reduced volumes
and prices for crude oil matching buy/sell transactions (which have no
effect on income) and lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon volumes.

OPERATING INCOME decreased by $14 million in 1993, following a
$329 million improvement in 1992. Results in 1993 included a $342
million charge as a result of the adverse decision in the Lower Lake
Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation against the Bessemer & Lake Erie
Railroad ("B&LE litigation") (which also resulted in $164 million of
interest costs) (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements),
a $241 million unfavorable noncash effect resulting from an increase
in the inventory market valuation reserve and restructuring charges of
$42 million related to the planned shutdown of the Maple Creek coal
mine and preparation plant. Results in 1992 included a favorable
impact of $119 million for the settlement of a tax refund claim
related to prior years' production taxes and a $62 million favorable
noncash effect resulting from a decrease in the inventory market
valuation reserve, partially offset by restructuring charges of $125
million primarily related to the disposition of certain domestic
exploration and production properties. Excluding the effects of these
items, operating income increased $667 million in 1993 predominantly
due to improved results in the U. S. Steel Group, as well as the
Marathon Group. The adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112 - Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits
("SFAS No. 112") resulted in a $23 million increase in operating costs
in 1993, principally in the U. S. Steel Group.

Operating income in 1991 included restructuring charges of $426
million mainly related to the shutdown of certain steel facilities and
a $260 million unfavorable noncash effect resulting from an increase
in the inventory market valuation reserve, partially offset by a
favorable $20 million adjustment of prior years' production tax
accruals. Excluding the effects of these items and the 1992 special
items previously discussed, operating income declined $393 million
from 1991 to 1992 due mainly to lower results in the Marathon Group.
Contributing to the decline was a $58 million increase in operating
costs resulting from the 1992 adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 - Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions ("SFAS No. 106"), $42
million in the U. S. Steel Group and $16 million in the Marathon
Group.

Net pension credits included in operating income totaled $211
million in 1993, compared with $260 million in 1992 and $224 million
in 1991. The decrease in 1993 was primarily due to a lower assumed
long-term rate of return on plan assets. The increase in 1992 from
1991 primarily reflected recognition of the growth in plan assets. In
1994, net pension credits are expected to decline by approximately $95
million primarily due to a further reduction in the assumed long-term
rate of return on plan assets. See Note 7 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

U-36
<PAGE> 40
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

OTHER INCOME was $257 million in 1993, compared with a loss of $2
million in 1992 and income of $39 million in 1991. The increase in
1993 primarily resulted from higher gains from the disposal of assets,
including the sale of the Cumberland coal mine, the realization of a
$70 million deferred gain resulting from the collection of a
subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of Transtar, Inc.
("Transtar") (which also resulted in $37 million of interest income)
and the sale of an investment in an insurance company. The increase in
1993 also reflected the absence of a $19 million impairment of an
investment recorded in 1992. The decline in 1992 relative to 1991
primarily resulted from the nonrecurrence of 1991's favorable minority
interest effect related to RMI Titanium Company and the $19 million
impairment of an investment in 1992.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCOME was $78 million in 1993,
compared with $228 million in 1992 and $38 million in 1991. The 1993
amount included $37 million of interest income resulting from
collection of the Transtar note. The 1992 amount included $177 million
of interest income resulting from the settlement of a tax refund claim
related to prior years' production taxes. Excluding these items,
interest and other financial income was $41 million in 1993, compared
with $51 million in 1992 and $38 million in 1991.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS were $630 million in 1993,
compared with $485 million in 1992 and $509 million in 1991. The 1993
amount included $164 million of interest expense related to the
adverse decision in the B&LE litigation. Excluding this amount, the
decrease in 1993 primarily reflected an increase in capitalized
interest. The 1991 amount included a $26 million favorable adjustment
related to interest accrued for prior years' production taxes.
Excluding this item, the decrease from 1991 to 1992 was mainly due to
the favorable effect of declining variable interest rates.

THE CREDIT FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES in 1993 was $72 million,
compared with credits of $29 million in 1992 and $113 million in 1991.
The 1993 U.S. income tax credit included an incremental deferred tax
benefit of $64 million resulting from USX Corporation's ("USX")
ability to elect to credit, rather than deduct, certain foreign income
taxes for U.S. federal income tax purposes when paid in future years.
The anticipated use of the U.S. foreign tax credit reflects the
Marathon Group's improving international production profile including
income which will be generated by the East Brae platform in the United
Kingdom sector of the North Sea. The 1993 U.S. income tax credit also
included a $29 million charge associated with an increase in the
federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%, reflecting remeasurement of
deferred federal income tax liabilities as of January 1, 1993.

THE TOTAL LOSS BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING
PRINCIPLES was $167 million in 1993, compared with a loss of $160
million in 1992 and a loss of $578 million in 1991.

THE UNFAVORABLE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING
PRINCIPLES totaled $92 million in 1993 and $1,666 million in 1992. The
cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 112, determined as of January
1, 1993, decreased 1993 income by $86 million, net of the income tax
effect. The cumulative effect of adopting Emerging Issues Task Force
Consensus No. 93-14 - Accounting for Multiple-Year Retrospectively
Rated Insurance Contracts, determined as of January 1, 1993, decreased
1993 income by $6 million, net of the income tax effect. The immediate
recognition of the transition obligation resulting from the adoption
of SFAS No. 106, measured as of January 1, 1992, decreased 1992 income
by $1,306 million, net of the income tax effect. The cumulative effect
of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 -
Accounting for Income Taxes, measured as of January 1, 1992, decreased
1992 net income by $360 million.

USX RECORDED A NET LOSS of $259 million in 1993, compared with a
net loss of $1,826 million in 1992 and a net loss of $578 million in
1991.

Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

CURRENT ASSETS increased $80 million from year-end 1992. The
increase primarily reflected higher cash and cash equivalents and
deferred income tax benefits, partially offset by a decrease in
inventories. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $268 million at
year-end 1993, compared to $57 million at year-end 1992. Cash from
operations, new debt borrowings, equity issued and asset sales
exceeded cash applied to capital spending, debt repayment and
dividends. Deferred income tax benefits increased $171 million,
resulting primarily from increases in the inventory market valuation
reserve and accruals related to the B&LE litigation. The decrease in
inventories primarily reflected a reduction in inventory values due to
an increase in the inventory market valuation reserve. This reserve
reflects the extent to which the recorded cost of crude oil and
refined product inventories exceeds net realizable value. Subsequent
changes to the inventory market valuation reserve are dependent on
changes in future crude oil and refined product price levels and
inventory turnover.

PREPAID PENSION ASSETS increased $234 million from year-end 1992
mainly as a result of pension credits which primarily reflected the
investment performance of defined benefit plan assets.

CURRENT LIABILITIES were lower at year-end 1993 mainly due to a
reduction in long-term debt due within one year, partially offset by
an increase in accounts payable. The increase in accounts payable
primarily reflected an increase in litigation accruals, partially
offset by a decrease in trade payables.

TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE at December 31, 1993, was
$5.9 billion. The $425 million decrease from year-end 1992 mainly
reflected cash provided from operating activities, issuance of common
and preferred stock and disposal of assets, partially offset by
capital expenditures, dividend payments and an increase in cash and
cash equivalents. Repayments under USX's revolving credit agreements
and of commercial paper and other debt were partially offset by new
issuances of debt. At December 31, 1993, USX had outstanding
borrowings of $500 million against credit agreements, leaving $1,675
million of available unused committed credit lines. In addition, USX
had $185 million of available unused short-term lines of credit, which
generally require maintenance of compensating balances. In the event
of a change of control of USX, debt and guaranteed obligations
totaling $5.1 billion at year-end 1993, may be declared immediately
due and payable or required to be collateralized (see Notes 12, 14 and
16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS liabilities increased $355 million compared with
year-end 1992 mainly due to increases in workers' compensation
liabilities (including the effects of the adoption of SFAS No. 112),
retiree medical liabilities and pension liabilities.

DEFERRED CREDITS AND OTHER LIABILITIES decreased $130 million in
1993 mainly as a result of transfers of certain litigation accruals to
current liabilities and the reclassification of certain amounts to the
employee benefits liability account in conjunction with the adoption
of SFAS No. 112.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY of $3.9 billion at year-end 1993 increased by
$155 million from the end of 1992 mainly reflecting the issuance of
additional common and preferred equity, partially offset by the 1993
net loss and dividend payments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS

NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES totaled $944 million
in 1993, compared with $920 million in 1992. The 1993 period was
negatively affected by payments of $314 million related to partial
settlement of the B&LE litigation and settlement of the Energy Buyers
litigation. The 1992 period included $296 million associated with the
refund of prior years' production taxes. Excluding these items, net
cash provided from operating activities improved $634 million from
1992. The increase primarily reflected improved operations for the 
U. S. Steel Group, improved refined product margins for the Marathon
Group and a $103 million favorable effect from the use of available
funds from previously established (now depleted) insurance reserves to
pay for certain active and retired employee insurance benefits.

<PAGE> 42
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

Excluding the 1992 refund discussed above, net cash provided from
operating activities in 1992 declined $399 million from 1991 primarily
due to lower income, partially offset by favorable changes in working
capital accounts.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES were $1,151 million in 1993, compared with
$1,505 million in 1992 and $1,392 million in 1991. The $354 million
decrease in 1993 was due primarily to lower expenditures for the
Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group. The $283 million decline for
the Marathon Group mainly reflected decreased expenditures for
environmental projects and for development of the East Brae Field and
SAGE system in the United Kingdom and other international projects,
partially offset by increased exploration drilling and development
projects in the Gulf of Mexico and increased drilling activity for
onshore domestic natural gas projects. The $100 million decrease for
the U. S. Steel Group primarily reflected completion of U. S. Steel's
continuous cast modernization program in 1992. Contract commitments
for capital expenditures at year-end 1993 were $389 million, compared
with $423 million at year-end 1992.

For the year 1994, capital expenditures are expected to total
approximately $1.1 billion. The slight anticipated decrease in 1994 is
expected to result mainly from lower expenditures for the Marathon
Group, partially offset by higher expenditures for the U. S. Steel
Group. The Marathon Group's capital expenditures are expected to
decrease by approximately $100 million in 1994 mainly reflecting lower
expenditures for development of the East Brae Field and SAGE system.
The U. S. Steel Group's capital expenditures are expected to increase
by approximately $60 million in 1994 and will include continued
expenditures for projects begun in 1993 relative to environmental,
hot-strip mill and pickle line improvements at Gary (IN) Works and
initial expenditures for a blast furnace reline project at Mon Valley
(PA) Works which is planned for completion in 1995.

CASH FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS was $469 million in 1993,
compared with $117 million in 1992 and $78 million in 1991. The 1993
amount primarily reflected the realization of proceeds from a
subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of Transtar, the sale of
the Cumberland coal mine, the sale/leaseback of interests in two LNG
tankers, and the sales of various domestic oil and gas production
properties and of an investment in an insurance company. No
individually significant sales transactions occurred in 1992 or 1991.

FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS decreased by $458 million in 1993, compared
with a decrease of $240 million in 1992 and an increase of $662
million in 1991. These amounts represent net cash flows on commercial
paper and the revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, other
debt and production financing and other agreements. During 1993, USX
issued an aggregate principal amount of $800 million of fixed rate
debt through its medium-term note program and three separate series of
unsecured, noncallable debt securities in the public market.
Maturities ranged from 5 to 30 years and interest rates ranged from
6-3/8% to 8-1/2% per annum. In addition, an aggregate principal amount
of $77 million of Marathon Oil Company's ("Marathon") 9-1/2%
Guaranteed Notes Due 1994 was tendered in exchange for its Monthly
Interest Guaranteed Notes Due 2002, 9-3/4% to March 1, 1994 and 7%
thereafter. During 1992, USX issued an aggregate principal amount of
$748 million of fixed rate debt through its medium-term note program
and three separate series of unsecured, noncallable debt securities in
the public market. Maturities ranged from 5 to 30 years and interest
rates ranged from 6.65% to 9.375% per annum. During 1991, debt
borrowings included the issuance of three separate series of
unsecured, noncallable debt securities in the public market in the
aggregate principal amount of $550 million and a $300 million loan to
Marathon Oil U. K., Ltd. from the European Investment Bank.

PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED totaled $336 million in 1993. This
amount reflected the sale of 6,900,000 shares of 6.50% Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock ($50.00 liquidation preference per share)
("6.50% Convertible Preferred") to the public for net proceeds of $336
million. The 6.50% Convertible Preferred is convertible at any time
into shares of USX-U. S. Steel Group Common Stock ("Steel Stock") at a
conversion price of $46.125 per share of Steel Stock.

U-39
<PAGE> 43
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

COMMON STOCK ISSUED, net of repurchases, totaled $371 million in
1993, compared with $942 million in 1992 and $70 million in 1991. The
1993 amount mainly reflected the sale of 10,000,000 shares of Steel
Stock to the public for net proceeds of $350 million. The increase in
1992 primarily reflected sales to the public of all three classes of
common stock. In 1992, USX sold 25,000,000 shares of USX-Marathon
Group Common Stock ("Marathon Stock") for net proceeds of $541
million, 8,050,000 shares of Steel Stock for net proceeds of $198
million and 9,000,000 shares of USX-Delhi Group Common Stock for net
proceeds of $136 million.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS decreased in 1993 primarily due to a decrease in
the dividend rate on Marathon Stock in the fourth quarter of 1992,
partially offset by increased dividends due primarily to the sale in
1993 of additional shares of Steel Stock and of the 6.50% Convertible
Preferred. The increase in 1992 from 1991 primarily resulted from
higher dividends due to the sale of additional shares of all three
classes of common stock in 1992, partially offset by the fourth
quarter decrease in the dividend rate on Marathon Stock.

In September 1993, Standard & Poor's Corp. ("S&P") lowered its
ratings on USX's and Marathon's senior debt to below investment grade
(from BBB- to BB+) and on USX's subordinated debt, preferred stock and
commercial paper. S&P cited extremely aggressive financial leverage,
burdensome retiree medical liabilities and litigation contingencies.
In October 1993, Moody's Investors Services, Inc. ("Moody's")
confirmed its Baa3 investment grade ratings on USX's and Marathon's
senior debt. Moody's also confirmed its ratings on USX's subordinated
debt and commercial paper, but lowered its ratings on USX's preferred
stock from ba1 to ba2. Moody's noted that the rating confirmation on
USX debt securities reflected confidence in the expected performance
of USX during the intermediate term, while the downward revision of
the preferred stock ratings incorporated a narrow fixed charge
coverage going forward. The downgrades by S&P and the downgrade of
ratings on preferred stock by Moody's could increase USX's cost of
capital.

In December 1993, USX filed a universal shelf registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission which became
effective on January 6, 1994 and allows USX to offer and issue up to
$850 million of debt and equity securities. The equity securities
include preferred stock as well as each class of USX's common stock.
In February 1994, USX sold 5,000,000 shares of Steel Stock to the
public for net proceeds of $201 million and issued $300 million in
aggregate principal amount of 7.2% Notes Due 2004 under the shelf
registration.

In February 1994, USX issued $150 million in aggregate principal
amount of LIBOR-based Floating Rate Notes Due 1996 through its
medium-term note program under a shelf registration statement which
became effective on April 26, 1993.

As a result of the settlement of LTV Steel Corp.'s ("LTV") portion
of the B&LE litigation, USX is obligated to pay an additional $175
million to LTV in the first quarter of 1994. In addition,
approximately $210 million in judgments for other plaintiffs in the
B&LE litigation are due for payment in the first quarter of 1994. See
Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

USX anticipates that it will begin funding the U. S. Steel Group's
pension plan by approximately $100 million per year commencing with
the 1994 plan year. The funding for both the 1994 and 1995 plan years
will impact cash flows in 1995.

USX believes that its short-term and long-term liquidity is
adequate to satisfy its obligations (including those related to the
B&LE litigation) as of December 31, 1993, and to complete currently
authorized capital spending programs. USX actively used its access to
capital markets during 1993 to meet its business needs beyond
internally generated funds. Future requirements for its business
needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt maturities
for the years 1994 to 1996 and amounts which may ultimately be paid in
connection with contingencies are expected to be financed by a
combination of internally generated funds, proceeds from the sale of
stock (including the Steel Stock sold in February 1994), proceeds from
debt issued in February 1994, future borrowings and other external
financing sources. Long-term debt of $734 million matures within one
year, including $699 million classified as long- term debt at December
31, 1993. The $699 million represents the Marathon 9-1/2 % Guaranteed
Notes Due March 1, 1994. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES

USX has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital,
operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of
environmental laws and regulations. In recent years, these
expenditures have increased primarily due to required product
reformulation and process changes in order to meet Clean Air Act
obligations, although ongoing compliance costs have also been
significant. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are
not ultimately reflected in the prices of USX's products and services,
operating results will be adversely affected. USX believes that
domestic competitors of the U. S. Steel Group and substantially all
the competitors of the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group are subject
to similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific
impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors,
including the age and location of their operating facilities, their
production processes and the specific products and services they
provide.

USX's environmental expenditures for 1993 and 1992 are discussed
below and have been estimated for the Marathon Group and the Delhi
Group based on American Petroleum Institute ("API") survey guidelines
and for the U. S. Steel Group based on U.S. Department of Commerce
("USDC") survey guidelines. These guidelines are subject to differing
interpretations which could affect the comparability of such data.
Some environmental related expenditures, while benefitting the
environment, also enhance operating efficiencies.

The Marathon Group's total environmental expenditures in 1993 were
$253 million compared with $370 million in 1992. These amounts
consisted of capital expenditures of $123 million in 1993 and $240
million in 1992 and estimated compliance expenditures (including
operating and maintenance) of $130 million in both 1993 and 1992.
Compliance expenditures were broadly estimated based on API survey
guidelines and represented 1% of the Marathon Group's total operating
costs in both 1993 and 1992. The decline in environmental capital
expenditures from 1992 to 1993 primarily reflected lower expenditures
for the Marathon Group's multi-year capital projects for diesel fuel
desulfurization. By the end of 1993, these projects were substantially
completed.

The U. S. Steel Group's total environmental expenditures in 1993
were $240 million compared with $220 million in 1992. These amounts
consisted of capital expenditures of $53 million in 1993 and $52
million in 1992 and estimated compliance expenditures (including
operating and maintenance) of $187 million in 1993 and $168 million in
1992. Compliance expenditures were broadly estimated based on USDC
survey guidelines and represented 3% of the U. S. Steel Group's total
operating costs in both 1993 and 1992.

The Delhi Group's total environmental expenditures in 1993 were
$10 million compared with $8 million in 1992. These amounts consisted
of capital expenditures of $5 million in 1993 and $3 million in 1992
and estimated compliance expenditures (including operating and
maintenance) of $5 million in both 1993 and 1992. Compliance
expenditures were broadly estimated based on API survey guidelines and
represented 1% of the Delhi Group's total operating costs in both 1993
and 1992.

USX's environmental capital expenditures totaled $181 million in
1993, $294 million in 1992 and $175 million in 1991. Such expenditures
accounted for 16%, 20% and 13% of total consolidated capital
expenditures in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. USX expects such
expenditures to approximate $150 million in 1994 or approximately 13%
of total estimated consolidated capital expenditures. The increase
from 1991 to 1992 and the decline in 1993 was primarily the result of
the Marathon Group's multi-year capital spending program for diesel
fuel desulfurization which was substantially completed in 1993.
Predictions beyond 1994 can only be broad-based estimates which have
varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of
specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more
stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among
other matters. Based upon currently identified projects, USX
anticipates that environmental capital expenditures in 1995 will total
approximately $90 million; however, actual expenditures may increase
as additional projects are identified or additional requirements are
imposed.

U-41
<PAGE> 45
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

USX has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party
("PRP") at 55 waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") as of December 31,
1993. In addition, there are 50 sites where USX has received
information requests or other indications that USX may be a PRP under
CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available to
confirm the existence of liability or make any judgment as to the
amount thereof. There are also 62 additional sites, excluding retail
gasoline stations, where state governmental agencies or private
parties are seeking remediation under state environmental laws through
discussions or litigation. At many of these sites, USX is one of a
number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation, as well
as USX's share thereof, is frequently dependent upon the outcome of
investigations and remedial studies.

Total environmental expenditures for the Marathon Group included
remediation related expenditures estimated at $38 million in 1993 and
$35 million in 1992. Remediation spending was primarily related to
retail gasoline stations which incur ongoing clean-up costs for soil
and groundwater contamination associated with underground storage
tanks and piping. Total environmental expenditures for the U. S.
Steel Group included remediation related expenditures estimated at $19
million in 1993 and $11 million in 1992. Remediation spending was
mainly related to dismantlement and restoration activities at former
and present operating locations. Remediation related expenditures for
the Delhi Group were not material. USX accrues for environmental
remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is
probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably
determinable. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward
ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise,
charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. See
Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

New or expanded requirements for environmental regulations, which
could increase USX's environmental costs, may arise in the future. USX
intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the
environment, but since many of them are not fixed or presently
determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by
future legislation, it is not possible to accurately predict the
ultimate cost of compliance, including remediation costs which may be
incurred and penalties which may be imposed. However, based on
presently available information, and existing laws and regulations as
currently implemented, USX does not anticipate that environmental
compliance expenditures will materially increase in 1994. As discussed
above, environmental capital expenditures are currently expected to
decrease in 1994 and again in 1995.

USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a
variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the
environment, certain of which are discussed in Note 25 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The ultimate resolution of these
contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to
the consolidated financial statements. However, management believes
that USX will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though
it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.
See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows."

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 - Accounting
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan ("SFAS No. 114") requires
impairment of loans based on either the sum of discounted cash flows
or the fair value of underlying collateral. USX expects to adopt SFAS
No. 114 in the first quarter of 1995. Based on preliminary estimates,
USX expects that the unfavorable effect of adopting SFAS No. 114 will
be less than $2 million.

Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT

THE MARATHON GROUP

The Marathon Group includes Marathon, a wholly owned subsidiary of
USX, which is engaged in worldwide exploration, production,
transportation and marketing of crude oil and natural gas; and
domestic refining, marketing and transportation of petroleum products.
The Marathon Group financial data for the periods prior to the
creation of the Delhi Group on October 2, 1992, include the combined
historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the businesses of the Delhi Group.

Sales of $12.0 billion in 1993 declined $820 million from 1992
mainly due to lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon volumes and prices,
lower average refined product prices and the absence of sales from the
Delhi Group. These decreases were partially offset by increased excise
taxes and higher refined product sales volumes, excluding matching
buy/sell transactions. Sales of $12.8 billion in 1992 declined $1.2
billion from 1991 primarily due to lower average refined product
prices, reduced volumes and prices for crude oil matching buy/sell
transactions and lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon volumes. Matching
buy/sell transactions and excise taxes are included in both sales and
operating costs, resulting in no effect on operating income.

The Marathon Group reported operating income of $169 million in
1993, compared with $304 million in 1992 and $358 million in 1991.
Results included a $241 million unfavorable effect in 1993, a $62
million favorable effect in 1992 and a $260 million unfavorable effect
in 1991 resulting from noncash adjustments to the inventory market
valuation reserve. The 1992 results also included a favorable impact
of $119 million for the settlement of a tax refund claim related to 
prior years' production taxes, compared with a favorable $20 million
adjustment of prior years' production tax accruals in 1991. Also, the
1992 results included a restructuring charge of $115 million related to
the disposition of certain domestic exploration and production
properties, compared with a 1991 restructuring charge of $24 million.
Excluding the effects of these items, operating income was $410
million in 1993, $238 million in 1992 and $622 million in 1991. The
increase in 1993 primarily reflected increased average refined product
margins and increased domestic natural gas prices, partially offset by
lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices and volumes. The decrease in
1992 predominantly reflected lower average refined product margins, as
well as reduced worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices and volumes and
lower international natural gas prices.

The outlook regarding prices and costs for the Marathon Group's
principal products is largely dependent upon world market developments
for crude oil and refined products. Market conditions in the petroleum
industry are cyclical and subject to global economics and events such
as the 1993 OPEC accord, winter oil and natural gas consumption and
resumption of Iraqi oil exports.

THE U. S. STEEL GROUP

The U. S. Steel Group includes U. S. Steel, which is primarily
engaged in the production and sale of a wide range of steel mill
products, coke and taconite pellets. The U. S. Steel Group also
includes the management of mineral resources, domestic coal mining,
engineering and consulting services and technology licensing (together
with U. S. Steel, the "Steel and Related Businesses"). Other
businesses that are part of the U. S. Steel Group include real estate
development and management, fencing products, leasing and financing
activities and a majority interest in a titanium metal products
company.

U-43
<PAGE> 47
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

Sales increased from $4.9 billion in 1992 to $5.6 billion in 1993.
The increase primarily reflected higher steel shipment volumes and
prices, and increased commercial shipments of taconite pellets and
coke. The $55 million increase in sales from 1991 to 1992 primarily
reflected significantly higher commercial shipments of coke,
improvements in steel shipment volumes from ongoing operations and an
improved shipment mix, partially offset by the absence of sales of
structural products due to the closure of South (IL) Works early in
1992.

The U. S. Steel Group reported an operating loss of $149 million
in 1993, compared with an operating loss of $241 million in 1992 and
an operating loss of $617 million in 1991. The 1993 operating loss
included a $342 million charge as a result of the adverse decision in
the B&LE litigation and restructuring charges of $42 million related
to the planned shutdown of the Maple Creek coal mine and preparation
plant. The 1992 operating loss included a charge of $10 million for
completion of the portion of the 1991 restructuring plan related to
steel facilities. The 1991 loss included $402 million of restructuring
charges primarily related to the shutdown of certain steel facilities.
Excluding the effects of these items, operating income was $235
million in 1993, compared with operating losses of $231 million in
1992 and $215 million in 1991. The $466 million improvement in 1993
was mainly due to higher steel shipment volumes and prices, improved
operating efficiencies and lower accruals for environmental and legal
contingencies. In addition, 1993 results benefitted from a $39 million
favorable effect from the utilization of funds from previously
established insurance reserves to pay for certain employee insurance
benefits, lower provisions for loan losses by USX Credit and the
absence of a 1992 unfavorable effect of $28 million resulting from
market valuation provisions for foreclosed real estate assets. These
were partially offset by higher hourly steel labor costs, unfavorable
effects associated with pension and other employee benefits, lower
results from coal operations and a $21 million increase in operating
costs related to the adoption of SFAS No. 112. The slight decrease
from 1991 to 1992 was primarily due to higher charges for legal
contingencies, increased costs of $42 million related to the adoption
of SFAS No. 106, higher depreciation charges, increased provisions for
loan losses by USX Credit and a $28 million unfavorable effect
resulting from market valuation provisions for foreclosed real estate
assets. These factors were partially offset by the favorable effects
of savings from cost reduction programs, higher utilization of raw 
steel and raw material production capability and the absence of costs
incurred in 1991 related to the lack of an early labor agreement with
the United Steelworkers of America ("USWA").

Based on strong recent order levels and assuming a continuing
recovery of the U.S. economy, the U. S. Steel Group
anticipates that steel demand will remain strong in 1994. The U. S.
Steel Group believes that domestic industry shipments will reach 89 to
90 million tons in 1994 as compared to approximately 88 million tons
in 1993. Price increases on sheet products have been announced
effective January 2 and July 3, 1994. Price increases on certain other
products have also been announced. Realization of these price
increases will be dependent upon steel demand and the level of
imports. Steel imports to the United States have increased in recent
months. Steel imports to the United States accounted for an estimated
19% of the domestic steel market during the first eleven months of
1993, and for an estimated 23% and 24% in October and November,
respectively.

U. S. Steel entered into a new five and one-half year contract
with the USWA, effective February 1, 1994, covering approximately
15,000 employees. The agreement will result in higher labor and
benefit costs for the U. S. Steel Group each year throughout the term
of the agreement. The agreement includes a signing bonus of $1,000 per
USWA represented employee that will be paid in the first quarter of
1994, $500 of which represents the final bonus payable under the
previous agreement. The agreement also provides for the establishment
of a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Trust to prefund
health care and life insurance benefits for retirees covered under the
agreement. Minimum contributions, in the form of USX stock
or cash, are expected to be $25 million in 1994 and $10 million per
year thereafter. The funding of the trust will have no direct effect
on income of the U. S. Steel Group. Management believes that this
agreement is competitive with labor agreements reached by U. S.
Steel's major domestic integrated competitors and thus does not
believe that U. S. Steel's competitive position with regard to such
other competitors will be materially affected by its ratification.

U-44
<PAGE> 48
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

Severe cold and extreme winter weather conditions disrupted steel
and raw materials operations and caused forced utility curtailments at
Gary Works, Mon Valley Works and Fairless (PA) Works in January 1994.
These events will have some negative effects on operations in the
first quarter of 1994.

Net pension credits for the U. S. Steel Group in 1994 are expected
to decline by approximately $85 million primarily due to a lower
assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets.

THE DELHI GROUP

The Delhi Group includes Delhi Gas Pipeline Corporation, a wholly
owned subsidiary of USX, and certain related companies which are
engaged in the purchasing, gathering, processing, transporting and
marketing of natural gas.

Sales of $535 million in 1993 increased $77 million from 1992,
mainly due to increased revenues from premium services and higher
average natural gas sales prices. Sales of $458 million in 1992
increased $35 million from 1991 primarily due to higher average
natural gas sales prices, increased systems throughput volumes and
increased gas processing revenues.

Operating income was $36 million in 1993, compared with $33
million in 1992 and $31 million in 1991. Operating income in 1993
included favorable effects of $2 million for the reversal of a
prior-period accrual related to a natural gas contract settlement, $1
million related to gas imbalance settlements and a net $1 million for
a refund of prior years' taxes other than income taxes. Operating
income in 1992 included favorable effects totaling $2 million relating
to the settlement of various lawsuits and third-party disputes.
Excluding the effects of these items, 1993 operating income improved
by $1 million, primarily as a result of higher gas sales margins and
lower operating and other expenses, partially offset by a 34% decline
in gas processing margins from the sale of natural gas liquids
("NGLs"). Operating income in 1991 included $8 million for favorable
settlements of certain contractual issues. Excluding the effects of
the settlements in 1992 and 1991, the $8 million improvement in 1992
operating income was primarily due to increased NGLs volumes from gas
processing, higher natural gas systems throughput volumes and lower
operating and other expenses. These favorable items were partially
offset by lower unit margins for NGLs, reflecting lower NGLs prices
and higher feedstock costs.

Marathon Group

Explanatory Note Regarding Financial Information

Although the financial statements of the Marathon
Group, the U.S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group
separately report the assets, liabilities (including
contingent liabilities) and stockholders' equity of
USX attributed to each such group, such attribution
does not affect legal title to such assets and
responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of
USX-Marathon Group Common Stock, USX-U.S. Steel
Group Common Stock and USX-Delhi Group Common Stock
are holders of common stock of USX and continue to be
subject to all the risks associated with an
investment in USX and all of its businesses and
liabilities. Financial impacts arising from any of
the Marathon Group, the U.S. Steel Group or the
Delhi Group which affect the overall cost of USX's
capital could affect the results of operations and
financial condition of all groups. In addition, net
losses of any group, as well as dividends or
distributions on any class of USX common stock or
series of Preferred Stock and repurchases of any
class of USX common stock or certain series of
Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally
available for payment of dividends on all classes of
USX common stock. Accordingly, the USX consolidated
financial information should be read in connection
with the Marathon Group financial information.

Management's Report

The accompanying financial statements of the Marathon
Group are the responsibility of and have been
prepared by USX Corporation (USX) in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. They
necessarily include some amounts that are based on
best judgments and estimates. The Marathon Group
financial information displayed in other sections of
this report is consistent with that in these
financial statements.
USX seeks to assure the objectivity and
integrity of its financial records by careful
selection of its managers, by organizational
arrangements that provide an appropriate division of
responsibility and by communications programs aimed
at assuring that its policies and methods are
understood throughout the organization.
USX has a comprehensive formalized system of
internal accounting controls designed to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and
that financial records are reliable. Appropriate
management monitors the system for compliance, and
the internal auditors independently measure its
effectiveness and recommend possible improvements
thereto. In addition, as part of their audit of the
financial statements, USX's independent accountants,
who are elected by the stockholders, review and test
the internal accounting controls selectively to
establish a basis of reliance thereon in determining
the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be
applied.
The Board of Directors pursues its oversight
role in the area of financial reporting and internal
accounting control through its Audit Committee. This
Committee, composed solely of nonmanagement
directors, regularly meets (jointly and separately)
with the independent accountants, management and
internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by
each of its responsibilities relative to internal
accounting controls and the consolidated and group
financial statements.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements
appearing on pages M-4 through M-20 present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of
the Marathon Group at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are
the responsibility of USX's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.
As discussed in Note 2, page M-7, in 1993 USX
adopted new accounting standards for postemployment
benefits and for retrospectively rated insurance
contracts. As discussed in Note 10, page M-13, and
Note 11, page M-14, in 1992 USX adopted new
accounting standards for postretirement benefits
other than pensions and for income taxes,
respectively.
The Marathon Group is a business unit of USX
Corporation (as described in Note 1, page M-7);
accordingly, the financial statements of the Marathon
Group should be read in connection with the
consolidated financial statements of USX Corporation
and Subsidiary Companies.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

USX Corporation (USX) has three classes of common stock:
USX -- Marathon Group Common Stock (Marathon Stock), USX
U. S. Steel Group Common Stock (Steel Stock) and USX --
Delhi Group Common Stock (Delhi Stock), which are intended
to reflect the performance of the Marathon Group, the U.S.
Steel Group and the Delhi Group, respectively.
The financial statements of the Marathon Group include
the financial position, results of operations and cash
flows for the businesses of Marathon Oil Company and
certain other subsidiaries of USX, and a portion of the
corporate assets and liabilities and related transactions
which are not separately identified with ongoing operating
units of USX. The Marathon Group is involved in worldwide
exploration, production, transportation and marketing of
crude oil and natural gas; and domestic refining, marketing
and transportation of petroleum products. The Marathon
Group financial statements are prepared using the amounts
included in the USX consolidated financial statements.
The Delhi Group was established October 2, 1992; the
Marathon Group financial data for the periods presented
prior to this date included the combined historical
financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the businesses of the Delhi Group. Beginning October 2,
1992, the financial statements of the Marathon Group do not
include the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for the businesses of the Delhi Group except for
the financial effects of the Retained Interest (Note 3,
page M-9).
Although the financial statements of the Marathon
Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group separately
report the assets, liabilities (including contingent
liabilities) and stockholders' equity of USX attributed to
each such group, such attribution does not affect legal
title to such assets and responsibility for such
liabilities. Holders of Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and
Delhi Stock are holders of common stock of USX and continue
to be subject to all the risks associated with an
investment in USX and all of its businesses and
liabilities. Financial impacts arising from any of the
Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group or the Delhi Group
which affect the overall cost of USX's capital could affect
the results of operations and financial condition of all
groups. In addition, net losses of any group, as well as
dividends or distributions on any class of USX common stock
or series of Preferred Stock and repurchases of any class
of USX common stock or certain series of Preferred Stock,
will reduce the funds of USX legally available for payment
of dividends on all classes of USX common stock.
Accordingly, the USX consolidated financial information
should be read in connection with the Marathon Group
financial information.

2. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION -- These financial
statements include the accounts of the businesses
comprising the Marathon Group. The Marathon Group, the 
U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group financial statements,
taken together, comprise all of the accounts included in
the USX consolidated financial statements.
Investments in unincorporated oil and gas joint
ventures are accounted for on a pro rata basis.
Investments in other entities in which the Marathon
Group has significant influence in management and
control are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting and are carried in the investment account at the
Marathon Group's share of net assets plus advances. The
proportionate share of income from equity investments is
included in other income.
The proportionate share of income represented by the
Retained Interest in the Delhi Group is included in other
income.
Investments in marketable equity securities are
carried at lower of cost or market and investments in other
companies are carried at cost, with income recognized when
dividends are received.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS -- The following accounting
standards were adopted by USX during 1993:
Postemployment benefits -- Effective January 1, 1993,
USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS No. 112). SFAS No. 112
requires employers to recognize the obligation to
provide postemployment benefits on an accrual basis if
certain conditions are met. The Marathon Group is
affected

M-7
<PAGE> 56
primarily by disability-related claims covering
indemnity and medical payments. The obligation for
these claims is measured using actuarial techniques
and assumptions including an appropriate discount
rate. The cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle determined as of January 1, 1993,
reduced net income $17 million, net of $10 million
income tax effect. The effect of the change in
accounting principle reduced 1993 operating income by
$2 million.

Accounting for multiple-year retrospectively rated
insurance contracts -- USX adopted Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) Consensus No. 93-14, "Accounting for
Multiple-Year Retrospectively Rated Insurance
Contracts". EITF No. 93-14 requires accrual of
retrospective premium adjustments when the insured has
an obligation to pay cash to the insurer that would
not have been required absent experience under the
contract. The cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle determined as of January 1, 1993,
reduced net income $6 million, net of $3 million
income tax effect.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents
includes cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid debt
instruments with maturities generally of three months or
less.

INVENTORIES -- Inventories are carried at lower of cost or
market. Cost of inventories is determined primarily under
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

HEDGING TRANSACTIONS -- The Marathon Group enters into
commodity swaps, futures contracts and options to hedge
exposure to price fluctuations relevant to the purchase or
sale of crude oil, refined products and natural gas. Such
transactions are accounted for as part of the commodity
being hedged. Forward contracts are used to hedge currency
risks, and the accounting is based on the requirements of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT -- The Marathon Group follows
the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
exploration and development.

GAS BALANCING -- The Marathon Group follows the sales method
of accounting for gas production imbalances.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Depreciation and depletion
of oil and gas producing properties are computed using
predetermined rates based upon estimated proved oil and gas
reserves applied on a units-of-production method. Other
items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated
principally by the straight-line method.
When an entire property, major facility or facilities
depreciated on an individual basis are sold or otherwise
disposed of, any gain or loss is reflected in income.
Proceeds from disposal of other facilities depreciated on a
group basis are credited to the depreciation reserve with
no immediate effect on income.

INSURANCE -- The Marathon Group is insured for catastrophic
casualty and certain property exposures, as well as those
risks required to be insured by law or contract. Costs
resulting from noninsured losses are charged against income
upon occurrence.

RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain reclassifications of prior
years' data have been made to conform to 1993
classifications.

3. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES

FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES -- As a matter of policy, USX manages
most financial activities on a centralized, consolidated
basis. Such financial activities include the investment of
surplus cash; the issuance, repayment and repurchase of
short-term and long-term debt; the issuance, repurchase and
redemption of preferred stock; and the issuance and
repurchase of common stock. Transactions related primarily
to invested cash, short-term and long-term debt (including
convertible debt), related net interest and other financial
costs, and preferred stock and related dividends are
attributed to the Marathon Group, the U.S. Steel Group and
the Delhi Group based upon the cash flows of each group for
the periods presented and the initial capital structure of
each group. Most financing transactions are attributed to
and reflected in the financial statements of all three
groups. See Note 5, page M-10, for the Marathon Group's
portion of USX's financial activities attributed to all
three groups. However, certain transactions such as leases,
production payment financings, financial activities of
consolidated entities which are less than wholly owned by
USX and transactions related to securities convertible
solely into any one class of common stock are or will be
specifically attributed to and reflected in their entirety
in the financial statements of the group to which they
relate.

CORPORATE GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- Corporate
general and administrative costs are allocated to the
Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group
based upon utilization or other methods management believes
to be reasonable and which consider certain measures of

M-8
<PAGE> 57
business activities, such as employment, investments and
sales. The costs allocated to the Marathon Group were $28
million, $30 million and $45 million in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively, and primarily consist of employment
costs including pension effects, professional services,
facilities and other related costs associated with
corporate activities.

COMMON STOCK TRANSACTIONS -- All financial statement impacts
of purchases and issuances of Marathon Stock after the
change of USX common stock into Marathon Stock and the
distribution of Steel Stock on May 6, 1991, are reflected
in their entirety in the Marathon Group financial
statements. Financial statement impacts of treasury stock
transactions occurring before May 7, 1991, have been
attributed to the two groups in relationship to their
respective common equity. The initial dividend on the
Marathon Stock was paid on September 10, 1991. Dividends
paid by USX prior to September 10, 1991, were attributed to
the Marathon Group and the U.S. Steel Group based upon the
relationship of the initial dividends on the Marathon Stock
and Steel Stock.
The USX Certificate of Incorporation was amended on
September 30, 1992, to authorize a new class of common
stock, Delhi Stock, which is intended to reflect the
performance of the Delhi Group. On October 2, 1992, USX
sold 9,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock to the public. The
businesses of the Delhi Group were previously included in
the Marathon Group. The USX Board of Directors deemed
14,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock to represent 100% of the
common stockholders' equity value of USX attributable to
the Delhi Group. The Delhi Fraction is the percentage
interest in the Delhi Group represented by the shares of
Delhi Stock that are outstanding at any particular time
and, based on 9,282,870 outstanding shares at December 31,
1993, is approximately 66%. The Marathon Group financial
statements reflect a percentage interest in the Delhi Group
of approximately 34% (Retained Interest) at December 31,
1993. Beginning October 2, 1992, the financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of the Delhi Group
were reflected in the financial statements of the Marathon
Group only to the extent of the Retained Interest. The
shares deemed to represent the Retained Interest are not
outstanding shares of Delhi Stock and cannot be voted by
the Marathon Group. As additional shares of Delhi Stock
deemed to represent the Retained Interest are sold, the
Retained Interest will decrease. When a dividend or other
distribution is paid or distributed in respect to the
outstanding Delhi Stock, or any amount paid to repurchase
shares of Delhi Stock generally, the Marathon Group 
financial statements are credited, and the Delhi Group 
financial statements are charged, with the aggregate 
transaction amount times the quotient of the
Retained Interest divided by the Delhi Fraction.

INCOME TAXES -- All members of the USX affiliated group are
included in the consolidated United States federal income
tax return filed by USX. Accordingly, the provision for
federal income taxes and the related payments or refunds of
tax are determined on a consolidated basis. The
consolidated provision and the related tax payments or
refunds have been reflected in the Marathon Group, the
U.S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group financial statements
in accordance with USX's tax allocation policy. In general,
such policy provides that the consolidated tax provision
and related tax payments or refunds are allocated among the
Marathon Group, the U.S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group,
for group financial statement purposes, based principally
upon the financial income, taxable income, credits,
preferences and other amounts directly related to the
respective groups.
For tax provision and settlement purposes, tax
benefits resulting from attributes (principally net
operating losses), which cannot be utilized by one of the
three groups on a separate return basis but which can be
utilized on a consolidated basis in that year or in a
carryback year, are allocated to the group that generated
the attributes. However, if such tax benefits cannot be
utilized on a consolidated basis in that year or in a
carryback year, the prior years' allocation of such
consolidated tax effects is adjusted in a subsequent year
to the extent necessary to allocate the tax benefits to the
group that would have realized the tax benefits on a
separate return basis.
The allocated group amounts of taxes payable or
refundable are not necessarily comparable to those that
would have resulted if the groups had filed separate tax
returns; however, such allocation should not result in any
of the three groups paying more income taxes over time than
it would if it filed separate tax returns and, in certain
situations, could result in any of the three groups paying
less.

9. PENSIONS
The Marathon Group has noncontributory defined benefit plans
covering substantially all employees. Benefits under these
plans are based primarily upon years of service and the highest
three years earnings during the last ten years before
retirement. Certain subsidiaries provide benefits for employees
covered by other plans based primarily upon employees' service
and career earnings. The funding policy for all plans provides
that payments to the pension trusts shall be equal to the
minimum funding requirements of ERISA plus such additional
amounts as may be approved from time to time.

PENSION COST (CREDIT) -- The defined benefit cost for major
plans was determined assuming an expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets of 10% for 1993 and 11% for 1992 and
1991.

FUNDS' STATUS -- The assumed discount rate used to measure the
benefit obligations of major plans was 6.5% and 7% at December
31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, respectively. The assumed rate
of future increases in compensation levels was 5% and 5.5% at
December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, respectively. Plans
with accumulated benefit obligations (ABO) in excess of plan
assets were not material in 1992.

10. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The Marathon Group has defined benefit retiree health and life
insurance plans covering most employees upon their retirement.
Health benefits are provided, for the most part, through
comprehensive hospital, surgical and major medical benefit
provisions subject to various cost sharing features. Life
insurance benefits are provided to nonunion and most union
represented retiree beneficiaries primarily based on employees'
annual base salary at retirement. Benefits have not been
prefunded.
In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS No. 106), which requires
accrual accounting for all postretirement benefits other than
pensions. USX elected to recognize immediately the transition
obligation determined as of January 1, 1992, which represents
the excess accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
for current and future retirees over the recorded
postretirement benefit cost accruals. The cumulative effect of
the change in accounting principle for the Marathon Group
reduced net income $147 million, consisting of the transition
obligation of $233 million, net of $86 million income tax
effect.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST -- Postretirement benefit cost for
defined benefit plans for 1993 and 1992 was determined 
assuming a discount rate of 7% and 8%, respectively.

...................................................................................
</TABLE>

Prior to 1992, the cost of providing health care and life
insurance benefits to retired employees was recognized as an
expense primarily as claims were paid. These costs totaled $11
million for 1991.

OBLIGATIONS -- The following table sets forth the plans'
obligations and the amounts reported in the Marathon Group's
balance sheet:

Unamortized prior service cost (20) --
------ ------
Accrued liability included in balance sheet $ (281) $ (257)
................................................................................... 
</TABLE>

The assumed discount rate used to measure the APBO was
6.5% and 7% at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
respectively. The assumed rate of future increases in
compensation levels was 5.0% and 5.5% at December 31, 1993, and
December 31, 1992, respectively. The weighted average health
care cost trend rate in 1994 is approximately 7%, gradually
declining to an ultimate rate in 1999 of approximately 5.5%. A
one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost
trend rates for each future year would have increased the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of the
1993 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $6 million and
would have increased the APBO as of December 31, 1993, by $46
million.

11. INCOME TAXES
Income tax provisions and related assets and liabilities 
attributed to the Marathon Group are determined in accordance 
with the USX group tax allocation policy (Note 3, page M-9).
In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
(SFAS No. 109), which requires an asset and liability approach
in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are established to reflect
the future tax consequences of carryforwards and differences
between the tax bases and financial bases of assets and
liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle determined as of January 1, 1992, reduced net income
$184 million.
Provisions (credits) for estimated income taxes:

(a) Computed in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 11. The deferred tax benefit of $5 million in 1991
was primarily the net result of timing differences related to
depreciation, depletion and amortization, intangible
development costs, pension accruals and the usage of business
credit carryforwards.

In 1993, the cumulative effects of the changes in
accounting principles for postemployment benefits and for
retrospectively rated insurance contracts included deferred tax
benefits of $10 million and $3 million, respectively (Note 2,
page M-7). In 1992, the cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle for other postretirement benefits included
a deferred tax benefit of $86 million (Note 10, page M-13).

The consolidated tax returns of USX for the years
1988 through 1991 are under various stages of audit and
administrative review by the IRS. USX believes it has made
adequate provision for income taxes and interest which may
become payable for years not yet settled.
Pretax income (loss) included $(55) million, $54
million and $155 million attributable to foreign sources in
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

nonstrategic domestic exploration and production properties,
resulted in a $115 million charge to operating income. In 1991,
a $24 million restructuring charge resulted from the planned
disposition of certain drilling operations and two regulated
utility companies.

</TABLE>

Inventories of crude oil and refined products are valued
by the LIFO method. The LIFO method accounted for 87% and 91%
of total inventory value at December 31, 1993, and December 31,
1992, respectively.
The inventory market valuation reserve reflects the extent
that the recorded cost of crude oil and refined products
inventories exceeds net realizable value. The reserve is
decreased to reflect increases in market prices and inventory
turnover and increased to reflect decreases in market prices.
Changes in the inventory market valuation reserve resulted in
charges (credits) to operating income of $241 million, $(62)
million and $260 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

19. SALES OF RECEIVABLES

The Marathon Group has entered into an agreement, subject to
limited recourse, to sell certain accounts receivable including
accounts receivable purchased from the Delhi Group. Payments
are collected from the sold accounts receivable; the
collections are reinvested in new accounts receivable for the
buyers; and a yield based on defined short-term market rates is
transferred to the buyers. Collections on sold accounts
receivable will be forwarded to the buyers at the end of the
agreement in 1995, in the event of earlier contract termination
or if the Marathon Group does not have a sufficient quantity of
eligible accounts receivable to reinvest in for the buyers. The
balance of sold accounts receivable averaged $400 million, $393
million and $354 million for the years 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. At December 31, 1993, the balance of sold
accounts receivable that had not been collected was $400
million. Buyers have collection rights to recover payments from
an amount of outstanding receivables equal to 120% of the
outstanding receivables purchased on a nonrecourse basis; such
overcollateralization cannot exceed $80 million. The Marathon
Group does not generally require collateral for accounts
receivable, but significantly reduces credit risk through
credit extension and collection policies, which include
analyzing the financial condition of potential customers,
establishing credit limits, monitoring payments and
aggressively pursuing delinquent accounts. In the event of a
change in control of USX, as defined in the agreement, the
Marathon Group may be required to forward payments collected on
sold accounts receivable to the buyers.

October 2, 1992 (Note 3, page M-9).
(b) The initial dividend on the Marathon Stock was paid on
September 10, 1991. Dividends paid by USX prior to that
date were attributed to the Marathon Group and the U. S.
Steel Group based upon the relationship of the initial
dividends on the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock.

M-17
<PAGE> 66
21. DIVIDENDS
In accordance with the USX Certificate of Incorporation,
dividends on the Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock
are limited to the legally available funds of USX. Net losses
of the Marathon Group, the U.S. Steel Group or the Delhi Group,
as well as dividends or distributions on any class of USX
common stock or series of Preferred Stock and repurchases of
any class of USX common stock or certain series of Preferred
Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally available for
payment of dividends on all classes of USX common stock.
Subject to this limitation, the Board of Directors intends to
declare and pay dividends on the Marathon Stock based on the
financial condition and results of operation of the Marathon
Group, although it has no obligation under Delaware Law to do
so. In making its dividend decisions with respect to Marathon
Stock, the Board of Directors considers among other things, the
long-term earnings and cash flow capabilities of the Marathon
Group as well as the dividend policies of similar publicly
traded companies.

22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

The method of calculating net income (loss) per share for the
Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock reflects the USX
Board of Directors' intent that the separately reported
earnings and surplus of the Marathon Group, the U.S. Steel
Group and the Delhi Group, as determined consistent with the
USX Certificate of Incorporation, are available for payment of
dividends to the respective classes of stock, although legally
available funds and liquidation preferences of these classes of
stock do not necessarily correspond with these amounts.
For purposes of computing net income (loss) per share of
Marathon Stock for periods prior to May 7, 1991, the numbers of
Marathon Stock shares are assumed to be the same as the total
corresponding numbers of shares of USX common stock.
Primary net income (loss) per share is calculated by
adjusting net income (loss) for dividend requirements of
preferred stock and is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents,
provided they are not antidilutive. Common stock equivalents
result from assumed exercise of stock options and surrender of
stock appreciation rights associated with stock options, where
applicable.
Fully diluted net income (loss) per share assumes
conversion of convertible securities for the applicable periods
outstanding and assumes exercise of stock options and surrender
of stock appreciation rights, provided, in each case, the
effect is not antidilutive.

23. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Exchange adjustments resulting from foreign currency
transactions generally are recognized in income, whereas
adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements
are reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
For 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, the aggregate foreign
currency transaction gains (losses) included in determining net
income were $1 million, $16 million and $(1) million. An
analysis of changes in cumulative foreign currency translation
adjustments follows:

25. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein is not
necessarily representative of the amount that could be realized
or settled, nor does the fair value amount consider the tax
consequences of realization or settlement. As described in
Note 3, page M-8, the Marathon Group's specifically attributed
financial instruments and the Marathon Group's portion of USX's
financial instruments attributed to all groups are as follows:

</TABLE>

Fair value of financial instruments classified as current
assets or liabilities approximate carrying value due to the
short-term maturity of the instruments. Fair value of long-term
receivables and other investments was based on discounted cash
flows or other specific instrument analysis. Fair value of
long-term debt instruments was based on market prices where
available or current borrowing rates available for financings
with similar terms and maturities.
The Marathon Group's unrecognized financial instruments
consist of accounts receivables sold subject to limited
recourse, financial guarantees and commodity swaps. It is not
practicable to estimate the fair value of these forms of
financial instrument obligations. For details relating to sales
of receivables see Note 19, page M-17. For details relating to
financial guarantees see Note 26, page M-20. The contract value
of open natural gas commodity swaps totaled $41 million at
December 31, 1993. The swap arrangements vary in duration with
certain individual contracts extending into early 1996.

26. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
relating to the Marathon Group involving a variety of matters,
including laws and regulations relating to the environment.
Certain of these matters are discussed below. The ultimate
resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the Marathon Group financial
statements. However, management believes that USX will remain a
viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible
that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to the
Marathon Group. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS --
The Marathon Group is subject to federal, state, local and
foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment. These
laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into
the environment and require responsible parties to undertake
remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be
imposed for noncompliance. The Marathon Group provides for
remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to
remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is
reasonably determinable. Generally, the timing of these
accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or
the commitment to a formal plan of action. At December 31,
1993, and December 31, 1992, accrued liabilities for
remediation and platform abandonment totaled $161 million and
$138 million, respectively. It is not presently possible to
estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that
might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed.
For a number of years, the Marathon Group has made
substantial capital expenditures to bring existing facilities
into compliance with various laws relating to the environment.
In 1993 and 1992, such capital expenditures totaled $123
million and $240 million, respectively. The Marathon Group
anticipates making additional such expenditures in the future;
however, the exact amounts and timing of such expenditures are
uncertain because of the continuing evolution of specific
regulatory requirements.

M-19
<PAGE> 68
LIBYAN OPERATIONS --
By reason of Executive Orders and related regulations
under which the U.S. Government is continuing economic
sanctions against Libya, the Marathon Group was required to
discontinue performing its Libyan petroleum contracts on June
30, 1986. In June 1989, the Department of the Treasury
authorized the Marathon Group to resume performing under those
contracts. Pursuant to that authorization, the Marathon Group
has engaged the Libyan National Oil Company and the Secretary
of Petroleum in continuing negotiations to determine when and
on what basis they are willing to allow the Marathon Group to
resume realizing revenue from the Marathon Group's investment
of $108 million in Libya. The Marathon Group is uncertain when
these negotiations can be completed or how the negotiations
will be affected by the United Nations sanctions against Libya.

GUARANTEES --
Guarantees by USX of the liabilities of affiliated and
other entities of the Marathon Group totaled $18 million and
$12 million at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
respectively.
At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, the Marathon
Group's pro rata share of obligations of LOOP INC. and various
pipeline affiliates secured by throughput and deficiency
agreements totaled $206 million and $216 million, respectively.
Under the agreements, the Marathon Group is required to advance
funds if the affiliates are unable to service debt. Any such
advances are prepayments of future transportation charges.

COMMITMENTS --
At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, contract
commitments for the Marathon Group's capital expenditures for
property, plant and equipment totaled $284 million and $360
million, respectively.

THE MARATHON GROUP
Management's Discussion and Analysis

The Marathon Group includes Marathon Oil Company ("Marathon"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of USX Corporation ("USX"), which is engaged
in worldwide exploration, production, transportation and marketing of
crude oil and natural gas; and domestic refining, marketing and
transportation of petroleum products. Management's Discussion and
Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Marathon Group's
Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements.

Prior to October 2, 1992, the Marathon Group also included the
businesses of Delhi Gas Pipeline Corporation and certain other USX
subsidiaries engaged in the purchasing, gathering, processing,
transporting and marketing of natural gas which are now included in
the Delhi Group. The Marathon Group financial data for the periods
prior to October 2, 1992, include the combined historical financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the businesses of
the Delhi Group. Beginning October 2, 1992, the financial statements
of the Marathon Group do not include the financial position, results
of operations and cash flows for the businesses of the Delhi Group
except for the financial effects of the Retained Interest (see Note 3
to the Marathon Group Financial Statements).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME

SALES declined $820 million in 1993 from 1992, following a $1.2
billion decrease in 1992 from 1991. The 1993 decline primarily
reflected lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon volumes and prices, lower
average refined product prices and the absence of sales from the Delhi
Group. These decreases were partially offset by increased excise taxes
and higher refined product sales volumes, excluding matching buy/sell
transactions. The decrease in 1992 from 1991 was mainly due to lower
average refined product prices, reduced volumes and prices for crude
oil matching buy/sell transactions and lower worldwide liquid
hydrocarbon volumes. Matching buy/sell transactions and excise taxes
are included in both sales and operating costs, resulting in no effect
on operating income.

OPERATING INCOME decreased $135 million in 1993, following a $54
million decline in 1992 from 1991. Results in 1993 and 1991 were
adversely affected, while 1992 was favorably affected, by special
items (see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Operations).
Excluding the effects of these special items, operating income in 1993
increased $172 million from 1992, mainly due to increased average
refined product margins and increased domestic natural gas prices,
partially offset by lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices and
volumes. Operating income declined $384 million in 1992 from 1991,
excluding the special items, predominantly due to lower average
refined product margins, as well as reduced worldwide liquid
hydrocarbon prices and volumes and decreased international natural gas
prices.

OTHER INCOME was $46 million in 1993, compared with a loss of $7
million in 1992 and income of $30 million in 1991. In addition to the
absence of a $19 million impairment of an investment recorded in 1992,
other income in 1993 increased primarily due to gains from disposal of
assets totaling $34 million, which mainly reflected the sale of assets
of a convenience store wholesale distributor, two tug/barge units and
various domestic oil and gas production properties. Other income
decreased $37 million in 1992 from 1991 primarily reflecting the
investment impairment and lower gains from disposal of assets.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCOME was $22 million in 1993, 
compared with $210 million in 1992 and $18 million in 1991. The 1992 
amount included $177 million of interest income resulting from the 
settlement of a tax refund claim related to prior years' production 
taxes.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS were $292 million in 1993, $306
million in 1992 and $341 million in 1991. The decrease in 1993 from 
1992 mainly reflected higher capitalized interest for international
projects, predominantly offset by higher interest costs related to
increased levels of debt. The 1991 amount included a $26 million
favorable adjustment related to interest accrued for prior years'
production taxes. Excluding this item, the 1992 decrease from 1991
mainly reflected a decline in variable interest rates, higher
capitalized interest and lower average debt levels.

M-23
<PAGE> 72
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

THE CREDIT FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES in 1993 was $49 million, 
compared to provisions of $92 million in 1992 and $136 million in 
1991. The 1993 U.S. income tax credit included an incremental 
deferred tax benefit of $64 million resulting from USX's ability to 
elect to credit, rather than deduct, certain foreign income taxes 
for U. S. federal income tax purposes when paid in future years. The 
anticipated use of the U. S. foreign tax credit reflects the 
Marathon Group's improving international production profile including 
income which will be generated by the East Brae platform in the 
United Kingdom ("U.K.") sector of the North Sea. The 1993 U. S. 
income tax credit also included a $40 million charge associated with
an increase in the federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%,
reflecting remeasurement of deferred federal income tax liabilities
as of January 1, 1993.

THE TOTAL LOSS BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING
PRINCIPLES was $6 million in 1993, compared to income of $109 million
in 1992 and a loss of $71 million in 1991.

THE UNFAVORABLE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING 
PRINCIPLES totaled $23 million in 1993 and $331 million in 1992. The 
cumulative effect of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 112 - Employers' Accounting for Postemployment 
Benefits, determined as of January 1, 1993, decreased 1993 income by 
$17 million, net of the income tax effect. The cumulative effect of 
adopting Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No. 93-14 - Accounting 
for Multiple-Year Retrospectively Rated Insurance Contracts, 
determined as of January 1, 1993, decreased 1993 income by $6 
million, net of the income tax effect. The immediate recognition of 
the transition obligation resulting from the adoption of Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 - Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, measured as of January 
1, 1992, decreased 1992 income by $147 million, net of the income 
tax effect. The cumulative effect of adopting Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes, measured 
as of January 1, 1992, decreased 1992 net income by $184 million.

A NET LOSS of $29 million was recorded in 1993, compared to a 
net loss of $222 million in 1992 and a net loss of $71 million in 
1991.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

CURRENT ASSETS declined $336 million from year-end 1992. The 
decline was mainly due to lower inventories and receivables, 
partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents. The 
decrease in inventories was mainly due to a reduction in inventory 
values, which reflected a $241 million increase in the inventory 
market valuation reserve. This reserve reflects the extent to which 
the recorded cost of crude oil and refined product inventories 
exceeds net realizable value. Subsequent changes to the inventory 
market valuation reserve are dependent on changes in future crude oil
and refined product price levels and inventory turnover. The 
reduction in accounts receivable primarily resulted from lower 
selling prices of crude oil and refined products, decreased forward 
currency hedging activities and reduced receivables from partners in 
international joint venture activities. The decrease in receivables 
related to currency hedging and joint venture activities was largely 
offset by a related decrease in accounts payable.

CURRENT LIABILITIES declined $610 million in 1993. The 
reduction was primarily due to reduced accounts payable and long-term 
debt due within one year. The reduction in accounts payable was 
largely due to a decrease in trade payables caused mainly by lower 
crude oil purchase prices and volumes, decreased forward currency 
hedging activities and reduced trade payables for international 
joint venture activities. The decrease in payables related to 
currency hedging and joint venture activities was largely offset by 
a related decrease in accounts receivable.

Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE at December 31, 1993, 
was $4.3 billion. The $287 million increase from year-end 1992 was
primarily due to capital expenditures, dividend payments and an
increase in cash and cash equivalents from year-end 1992, partially
offset by cash provided from operating activities and disposal of
assets. The amount of total long-term debt, as well as the amount
shown as notes payable, principally represented the Marathon Group's
portion of USX debt attributed to all three groups. Virtually all of
the debt is a direct obligation of, or is guaranteed by, USX.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY of $3,110 million at year-end 1993 declined 
$225 million from year-end 1992 mainly reflecting dividends paid on 
USX-Marathon Group Common Stock ("Marathon Stock").

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS

THE MARATHON GROUP'S NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES
totaled $827 million in 1993, down 17% from 1992. Results in 1992
included $296 million associated with the refund of prior years'
production taxes. Excluding the impact of this item, net cash
provided from operating activities in 1993 improved $128 million
mainly due to the impact of improved average refined product margins
on operating results. Net cash provided from operating activities in
1992 declined $315 million from 1991, excluding the previously
mentioned tax refund, mainly due to the decrease in income.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES of $910 million in 1993 decreased $283 
million from 1992, following an increase of $233 million from 1991.
The decrease in 1993 mainly reflected decreased expenditures for
environmental projects and for development of the East Brae Field and
SAGE system in the U.K. and other international projects, partially
offset by increased exploration drilling and development projects in
the Gulf of Mexico and increased drilling activity for onshore
domestic natural gas projects. Contract commitments for capital
expenditures at year-end 1993 were $284 million, compared with $360
million at year-end 1992. Capital expenditures are expected to
decrease in 1994 by approximately $100 million mainly reflecting
decreased expenditures for development of the East Brae Field and
SAGE system.

CASH FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS was $174 million in 1993, a 
significant increase over $77 million in 1992 and $52 million in
1991. The 1993 proceeds primarily reflected the sale/leaseback of
interests in two LNG tankers and the sales of various domestic oil
and gas production properties, assets of a convenience store
wholesale distributor and two tug/barge units. No individually
significant sales transactions occurred in 1992 or 1991.

PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF USX-DELHI GROUP COMMON STOCK by 
USX were $5 million in 1993 and $122 million in 1992, net of cash
attributed to the Delhi Group.

FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS increased $261 million, compared with a 
decrease of $426 million in 1992, and an increase of $160 million in
1991. The amount by which the obligations changed in 1993 was
primarily a reflection of the Marathon Group's net cash flows from
operating activities, investment activities and dividends paid during
the period. These obligations consist of the Marathon Group's portion
of USX debt attributed to all three groups as well as debt and
production financing and other agreements that are specifically
attributed to the Marathon Group.

MARATHON STOCK ISSUED, net of repurchases, totaled $595 million 
in 1992 and $67 million in 1991. The 1992 amount mainly reflected the
sale of 25,000,000 shares of Marathon Stock to the public for net
proceeds of $541 million, which were reflected in their entirety in
the Marathon Group financial statements. The 1991 amount primarily
reflected stock issued to employee savings plans.

<PAGE> 74
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS decreased $139 million in 1993, after a $13 
million increase in 1992. The decline in 1993 was primarily due to a
decrease in the Marathon Stock dividend rate which was reduced in the
fourth quarter of 1992. The slight increase in 1992 reflected the
incremental dividends paid on Marathon Stock shares sold in January
1992 which were partially offset by the decrease in the dividend
rate. Dividends attributed to the Marathon Stock prior to September
10, 1991, were based on the relationship of the initial dividends of
the Marathon Stock and the USX-U. S. Steel Group Common Stock. The
annualized rate of dividends per share for the Marathon Stock based
on the most recently declared quarterly dividend is $.68.

In September 1993, Standard & Poor's Corp. ("S&P") lowered its 
ratings on USX's and Marathon's senior debt to below investment grade
(from BBB- to BB+) and on USX's subordinated debt, preferred stock
and commercial paper. S&P cited extremely aggressive financial
leverage, burdensome retiree medical liabilities and litigation
contingencies. In October 1993, Moody's Investors Services, Inc.
("Moody's") confirmed its Baa3 investment grade ratings on USX's and
Marathon's senior debt. Moody's also confirmed its ratings on USX's
subordinated debt and commercial paper, but lowered its ratings on
USX's preferred stock from ba1 to ba2. Moody's noted that the rating
confirmation on USX debt securities reflected confidence in the
expected performance of USX during the intermediate term, while the
downward revision of the preferred stock ratings incorporated a
narrow fixed charge coverage going forward. The downgrades by S&P and
the downgrade of ratings on preferred stock by Moody's could increase
USX's cost of capital. Any related increase in interest costs would
be reflected in the consolidated financial statements and the
financial statements of each group.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES

The Marathon Group has incurred and will continue to incur 
substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation
expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. In
recent years, these expenditures have increased primarily due to
required product reformulation and process changes in order to meet
Clean Air Act obligations, although ongoing compliance costs have
also been significant. To the extent these expenditures, as with all
costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of the Marathon
Group's products and services, operating results will be adversely
affected. The Marathon Group believes that substantially all of its
competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and
regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary
depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of
their operating facilities, their production processes and whether or
not they are engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine
transportation of crude oil.

The Marathon Group's environmental expenditures for 1993 and
1992 are discussed below and have been estimated based on American
Petroleum Institute ("API") survey guidelines. These guidelines are
subject to differing interpretations which could affect the
comparability of such data. Some environmental related expenditures,
while benefiting the environment, also enhance operating
efficiencies.

Total environmental expenditures for the Marathon Group in 1993 
were $253 million compared with $370 million in 1992. These amounts
consisted of capital expenditures of $123 million in 1993 and $240
million in 1992 and estimated compliance expenditures (including
operating and maintenance) of $130 million in both 1993 and 1992.
Compliance expenditures were broadly estimated based on API survey
guidelines and represented 1% of the Marathon Group's total operating
costs in both 1993 and 1992. The decline in environmental capital
expenditures from 1992 to 1993 primarily reflected lower expenditures
for the Marathon Group's multi-year capital projects for diesel fuel
desulfurization. By the end of 1993, these projects were
substantially completed.

M-26
<PAGE> 75
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

USX has been notified that it is a potentially responsible 
party ("PRP") at 14 waste sites related to the Marathon Group under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act ("CERCLA") as of December 31, 1993. In addition, there are 22
sites related to the Marathon Group where USX has received
information requests or other indications that USX may be a PRP under
CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available to
confirm the existence of liability or make any judgment as to the
amount thereof. There are also 52 additional sites, excluding retail
gasoline stations, related to the Marathon Group where state
governmental agencies or private parties are seeking remediation
under state environmental laws through discussions or litigation. At
many of these sites, USX is one of a number of parties involved and
the total cost of remediation, as well as USX's share thereof, is
frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and remedial
studies.

Total environmental expenditures included remediation related 
expenditures estimated at $38 million in 1993 and $35 million in
1992. Remediation spending was primarily related to retail gasoline
stations which incur ongoing clean-up costs for soil and groundwater
contamination associated with underground storage tanks and piping.
The Marathon Group accrues for environmental remediation activities
when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of
associated costs is reasonably determinable. As environmental
remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as
additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those
previously accrued may be required. See Note 26 to the Marathon Group
Financial Statements.

New or expanded requirements for environmental regulations, 
which could increase the Marathon Group's environmental costs, may
arise in the future. USX intends to comply with all legal
requirements regarding the environment, but since many of them are
not fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation)
and may be affected by future legislation, it is not possible to
accurately predict the ultimate cost of compliance, including
remediation costs which may be incurred and penalties which may be
imposed. However, based on presently available information, and
existing laws and regulations as currently implemented, the Marathon
Group does not anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures
will materially increase in 1994. The Marathon Group's capital
expenditures for environmental controls are expected to be
approximately $75 million in 1994. Predictions beyond 1994 can only
be broad-based estimates which have varied, and will continue to
vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory
requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements
and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. Based
upon currently identified projects, the Marathon Group anticipates
that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $60
million in 1995; however, actual expenditures may increase as
additional projects are identified or additional requirements
are imposed.

USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or 
threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments relating to
the Marathon Group involving a variety of matters, including laws and
regulations relating to the environment, certain of which are
discussed in Note 26 to the Marathon Group Financial Statements. The
ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in
the aggregate, be material to the Marathon Group financial
statements. However, management believes that USX will remain a
viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that
these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to the Marathon
Group. See USX Consolidated Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Cash Flows.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS

The Marathon Group had operating income of $169 million in 1993, 
compared with $304 million in 1992 and $358 million in 1991. Results
for 1993 and 1991 were adversely affected, while 1992 was favorably
affected, by special items. Results included a $241 million
unfavorable effect in 1993, a $62 million favorable effect in 1992
and a $260 million unfavorable effect in 1991 resulting from noncash
adjustments to the inventory market valuation reserve. The 1992
results also included a favorable impact of $119 million for the
settlement of a tax refund claim related to prior years' production
taxes, partially offset by a $115 million restructuring charge
related to the disposition of certain domestic exploration and
production properties. The 1991 results also included a $24 million
restructuring charge, partially offset by a favorable $20 million
adjustment of prior years' production tax accruals. Excluding the
effects of these special items, operating income was $410 million in
1993, $238 million in 1992 and $622 million in 1991. The increase in
1993 primarily reflected increased average refined product margins
and increased domestic natural gas prices, partially offset by lower
worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices and volumes. The decrease in 1992
predominantly reflected lower average refined product margins, as
well as reduced worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices and volumes and a
decrease in international natural gas prices.

Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

Upstream operating income decreased $92 million in 1993, 
following an $88 million decrease in 1992. Operating income in 1992
included a $20 million gain recognized as a result of a settlement of
a natural gas contract. Excluding this settlement, the decline in 1993
was mainly due to significant decreases in worldwide liquid
hydrocarbon prices and volumes and lower international natural gas
prices, partially offset by increased domestic natural gas prices. The
decline in 1992, excluding this contract settlement, was also
primarily caused by decreases in worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices
and volumes and lower international natural gas prices, partially 
offset by ongoing cost reduction efforts.

Domestic upstream operating income in 1993 declined $6 million 
from 1992, following a $19 million increase in 1992 from 1991.
Excluding the previously mentioned contract settlement, the 14%
increase in 1993 was primarily due to increased natural gas prices and
reduced dry well expenses, partially offset by reduced liquid
hydrocarbon prices and volumes. In addition, operating income in 1993
reflected ongoing cost reduction efforts and reduced depletion
expenses. The results in 1992, excluding the previously mentioned
contract settlement, remained level with 1991, as ongoing cost
reduction efforts and reduced exploration expenses were offset by
lower liquid hydrocarbon prices.

International upstream operating income declined $86 million in 
1993, following a $107 million decline in 1992. Natural gas prices
have declined 30% since 1991, primarily reflecting changes in contract
sales prices in Norway. The decrease in 1993 was primarily due to
lower liquid hyrdocarbon prices, reduced liftings primarily from the
U.K. sector of the North Sea as a result of natural production
declines, lower natural gas prices, and a $17 million charge for the
relinquishment of the Marathon Group's interest in the Arzanah Oil
Field, Abu Dhabi. The decrease was partially offset by reduced
pipeline and terminal expenses and reduced dry well expenses. The
decrease in 1992 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower
liquid hydrocarbon liftings and increased dry well expenses.

In December 1993, the East Brae Field in the U.K. North Sea was 
brought onstream. East Brae liquids production is expected to peak at
40,000 net barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 1994. Worldwide
liquid volumes are expected to increase approximately 15% in 1994,
reflecting a full year of East Brae production, which should continue
to contribute to increased volumes in 1995. Worldwide natural gas
volumes are expected to increase approximately 5% in 1994, reflecting
the start of Brae area gas sales in October 1994. The 1995 volumes are
expected to continue to increase reflecting a full year of Brae area
production.

In 1992, Marathon and its partners finalized and delivered a 
feasibility study to the Russian Government assessing the technical
and economic viability of developing fields offshore Sakhalin Island.
After positive review by the State Expertise Commission in 1993,
negotiations to sign a production sharing contract are currently being
held among the Russian Government and representatives of the
consortium.

Downstream operating income increased $279 million in 1993, 
after decreasing $294 million in 1992. The increase in 1993 was
primarily due to increased average refined product margins from
refining and wholesale marketing which nearly doubled since 1992 as a
result of decreased crude oil costs and lower maintenance costs for
refinery turnaround activities, partially offset by decreased average
refined product prices. Also contributing to the increase in operating
income were record margins in both refined products and convenience
store merchandise experienced by Emro Marketing Company, a Marathon
subsidiary. Downstream operating income in 1993 also included a $17
million charge for future environmental remediation. The decrease in
1992 was chiefly the result of lower average refined product margins
which were adversely impacted as declines in average refined product
sales prices exceeded decreases in raw material costs. Results in 1992
were also negatively affected by increased maintenance costs as a
result of planned refinery turnaround activities.

In 1993, the Marathon Group temporarily idled its 50,000 
barrels-per-day Indianapolis Refinery to enhance the efficiency of
downstream operations. Idling of the Indianapolis facility will have
no impact on the Marathon Group's supply of transportation fuels to
its various classes of trade in Indiana or the Midwest marketing area.
The costs related to the idling did not have a material effect on the
Marathon Group's 1993 operating results.

M-29
<PAGE> 78
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

Gas Gathering and Processing results decreased due to the 
exclusion of the businesses now in the Delhi Group.

Other Administrative expenses were $77 million in 1993, 
compared to $83 million in 1992 and $90 million in 1991. These costs
include the portion of the Marathon Group's administrative costs not 
allocated to the individual business components and the portion of USX
corporate general and administrative costs allocated to the Marathon 
Group. 

The outlook regarding prices and costs for the Marathon Group's 
principal products is largely dependent upon world market 
developments for crude oil and refined products. Market conditions 
in the petroleum industry are cyclical and subject to global 
economics and events such as the 1993 OPEC accord, winter oil and 
natural gas consumption and resumption of Iraqi oil exports.

U. S. Steel Group

Explanatory Note Regarding Financial Information

Although the financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group,
the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group separately report the
assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and
stockholders' equity of USX attributed to each such group,
such attribution does not affect legal title to such assets
and responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of USX-U.S.
Steel Group Common Stock, USX-Marathon Group Common Stock and
USX-Delhi Group Common Stock are holders of common stock of
USX and continue to be subject to all the risks associated
with an investment in USX and all of its businesses and
liabilities. Financial impacts arising from any of the U.S.
Steel Group, the Marathon Group or the Delhi Group which
affect the overall cost of USX's capital could affect the
results of operations and financial condition of all groups.
In addition, net losses of any group, as well as dividends or
distributions on any class of USX common stock or series of
Preferred Stock and repurchases of any class of USX common
stock or certain series of Preferred Stock, will reduce the
funds of USX legally available for payment of dividends on all
classes of USX common stock. Accordingly, the USX consolidated
financial information should be read in connection with the
U.S. Steel Group financial information.

Management's Report

The accompanying financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group
are the responsibility of and have been prepared by USX
Corporation (USX) in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. They necessarily include some amounts
that are based on best judgments and estimates. The U. S.
Steel Group financial information displayed in other sections
of this report is consistent with that in these financial
statements.
USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of
its financial records by careful selection of its managers, by
organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate
division of responsibility and by communications programs
aimed at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
throughout the organization.
USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal
accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance
that assets are safeguarded and that financial records are
reliable. Appropriate management monitors the system for
compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure
its effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto.
In addition, as part of their audit of the financial
statements, USX's independent accountants, who are elected by
the stockholders, review and test the internal accounting
controls selectively to establish a basis of reliance thereon
in determining the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to
be applied.
The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in
the area of financial reporting and internal accounting
control through its Audit Committee. This Committee, composed
solely of nonmanagement directors, regularly meets (jointly
and separately) with the independent accountants, management
and internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each
of its responsibilities relative to internal accounting
controls and the consolidated and group financial statements.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements
appearing on pages S-4 through S-20 present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the U. S. Steel
Group at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
statements are the responsibility of USX's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
As discussed in Note 26, page S-19, the U. S. Steel
Group is involved in certain contingencies, the outcome of
which cannot presently be determined.
As discussed in Note 2, page S-7, in 1993 USX adopted a
new accounting standard for postemployment benefits. As
discussed in Note 11, page S-13, and Note 12, page S-14, in
1992 USX adopted new accounting standards for postretirement
benefits other than pensions and for income taxes,
respectively.
The U. S. Steel Group is a business unit of USX
Corporation (as described in Note 1, page S-7); accordingly,
the financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group should be
read in connection with the consolidated financial statements
of USX Corporation and Subsidiary Companies.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

USX Corporation (USX) has three classes of common stock: USX --
U. S. Steel Group Common Stock (Steel Stock), USX -- Marathon
Group Common Stock (Marathon Stock) and USX -- Delhi Group
Common Stock (Delhi Stock), which are intended to reflect the
performance of the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and
the Delhi Group, respectively.
The financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group include
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for all businesses of USX other than the businesses, assets and
liabilities included in the Marathon Group or the Delhi Group,
and a portion of the corporate assets and liabilities and
related transactions which are not separately identified with
ongoing operating units of USX. The U. S. Steel Group, which
consists primarily of steel operations, includes one of the
largest domestic integrated steel producers and is primarily
engaged in the production and sale of a wide range of steel
mill products, coke and taconite pellets. The U. S. Steel Group
also includes the management of mineral resources, domestic
coal mining, and engineering and consulting services and
technology licensing. Other businesses that are part of the
U. S. Steel Group include real estate development and 
management, fencing products, leasing and financing activities,
and a majority interest in a titanium metal products company. 
The U. S. Steel Group financial statements are prepared using 
the amounts included in the USX consolidated financial 
statements.
Although the financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group,
the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group separately report the
assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and
stockholders' equity of USX attributed to each such group, such
attribution does not affect legal title to such assets and
responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of Steel Stock,
Marathon Stock and Delhi Stock are holders of common stock of
USX and continue to be subject to all the risks associated with
an investment in USX and all of its businesses and liabilities.
Financial impacts arising from any of the U. S. Steel Group,
the Marathon Group or the Delhi Group which affect the overall
cost of USX's capital could affect the results of operations
and financial condition of all groups. In addition, net losses
of any group, as well as dividends or distributions on any
class of USX common stock or series of Preferred Stock and
repurchases of any class of USX common stock or certain series
of Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally
available for payment of dividends on all classes of common
stock. Accordingly, the USX consolidated financial information
should be read in connection with the U. S. Steel Group
financial information.

2. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION - These financial
statements include the accounts of the U. S. Steel Group. The
U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group
financial statements, taken together, comprise all of the
accounts included in the USX consolidated financial statements.
Investments in other entities in which the U. S. Steel
Group has significant influence in management and control are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are
carried in the investment account at the U. S. Steel Group's
share of net assets plus advances. The proportionate share of
income from equity investments is included in other income.
Investments in marketable equity securities are carried at
lower of cost or market and investments in other companies are
carried at cost, with income recognized when dividends are
received.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - The following accounting standard
was adopted by USX during 1993:

Postemployment benefits - Effective January 1, 1993, USX
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits"
(SFAS No. 112). SFAS No. 112 requires employers to
recognize the obligation to provide postemployment benefits
on an accrual basis if certain conditions are met. The 
U. S. Steel Group is affected primarily by disability-
related claims covering indemnity and medical payments. The
obligation for these claims is measured using actuarial
techniques and assumptions including appropriate discount
rates. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle determined as of January 1, 1993, reduced net
income $69 million, net of $40 million income tax effect.
The effect of the change in accounting principle reduced
1993 operating income by $21 million.

S-7
<PAGE> 86
USX has not adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan" (SFAS No. 114). SFAS No. 114 requires impairment of loans
based on either the sum of discounted cash flows or the fair
value of underlying collateral. USX expects to adopt SFAS No.
114 in the first quarter of 1995. Based on preliminary
estimates, USX expects the unfavorable effect of adopting SFAS
No. 114 for the U. S. Steel Group will be less than $2 million.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents includes
cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid debt instruments
with maturities generally of three months or less.

INVENTORIES -- Inventories are carried at lower of cost or
market. Cost of inventories is determined primarily under the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

HEDGING TRANSACTIONS -- Commodity swaps are used to hedge
exposure to price fluctuations relevant to the purchase of
natural gas. Such transactions are accounted for as part of the
commodity being hedged. Forward contracts are used to hedge
currency risks, and the accounting is based on the requirements
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Depreciation is generally
computed using a modified straight-line method based upon
estimated lives of assets and production levels. In 1992, the
U. S. Steel Group revised the modification factors used in the
depreciation of steel producing assets accounted for by the
modified straight-line method to reflect that raw steel
production capability is entirely continuous cast. The revised
modification factors range from a minimum of 85% at a
production level below 81% of capability, to a maximum of 105%
for a 100% production level. No modification is made at the 95%
production level, considered the normal long-range level.
Depletion of mineral properties is based on rates which are
expected to amortize cost over the estimated tonnage of
minerals to be removed.
When an entire plant, major facility or facilities
depreciated on an individual basis are sold or otherwise
disposed of, any gain or loss is reflected in income. Proceeds
from disposal of other facilities depreciated on a group basis
are credited to the depreciation reserve with no immediate
effect on income.

INSURANCE -- The U. S. Steel Group is insured for catastrophic
casualty and certain property and business interruption
exposures, as well as those risks required to be insured by law
or contract. Costs resulting from noninsured losses are charged
against income upon occurrence.

RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain reclassifications of prior years'
data have been made to conform to 1993 classifications.

3. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES

FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES -- As a matter of policy, USX manages most
financial activities on a centralized, consolidated basis. Such
financial activities include the investment of surplus cash;
the issuance, repayment and repurchase of short-term and
long-term debt; the issuance, repurchase and redemption of
preferred stock; and the issuance and repurchase of common
stock. Transactions related primarily to invested cash,
short-term and long-term debt (including convertible debt),
related net interest and other financial costs, and preferred
stock and related dividends are attributed to the U. S. Steel
Group, the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group based upon the
cash flows of each group for the periods presented and the
initial capital structure of each group. Most financing
transactions are attributed to and reflected in the financial
statements of all three groups. See Note 6, page S-9, for the
U. S. Steel Group's portion of USX's financial activities
attributed to all three groups. However, certain transactions
such as leases, production payment financings, financial
activities of consolidated entities which are less than wholly
owned by USX and transactions related to securities convertible
solely into any one class of common stock are or will be
specifically attributed to and reflected in their entirety in
the financial statements of the group to which they relate.

CORPORATE GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- Corporate general
and administrative costs are allocated to the U. S. Steel
Group, the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group based upon
utilization or other methods management believes to be
reasonable and which consider certain measures of business
activities, such as employment, investments and sales. The
costs allocated to the U. S. Steel Group were $33 million in
both 1993 and 1992, and $45 million in 1991, and primarily
consist of employment costs including pension effects,
professional services, facilities and other related costs
associated with corporate activities.

COMMON STOCK TRANSACTIONS -- All financial statement impacts of
purchases and issuances of Steel Stock after the change of USX
common stock into Marathon Stock and the distribution of Steel
Stock on May 6, 1991, are reflected in their entirety in the 
U. S. Steel Group financial statements. Financial statement
impacts of treasury stock transactions occurring before May 7,
1991, have been attributed to the two groups in relationship to
their respective common equity. The initial dividend on the
Steel

S-8
<PAGE> 87
Stock was paid on September 10, 1991. Dividends paid by USX
prior to September 10, 1991, were attributed to the U. S.
Steel Group and the Marathon Group based upon the relationship
of the initial dividends on the Steel Stock and Marathon Stock.

INCOME TAXES -- All members of the USX affiliated group are
included in the consolidated United States federal income tax
return filed by USX. Accordingly, the provision for federal
income taxes and the related payments or refunds of tax are
determined on a consolidated basis. The consolidated provision
and the related tax payments or refunds have been reflected in
the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group
financial statements in accordance with USX's tax allocation
policy. In general, such policy provides that the consolidated
tax provision and related tax payments or refunds are allocated
among the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and the Delhi
Group, for group financial statement purposes, based
principally upon the financial income, taxable income, credits,
preferences and other amounts directly related to the
respective groups.
For tax provision and settlement purposes, tax benefits
resulting from attributes (principally net operating losses),
which cannot be utilized by one of the three groups on a
separate return basis but which can be utilized on a
consolidated basis in that year or in a carryback year, are
allocated to the group that generated the attributes. However,
if such tax benefits cannot be utilized on a consolidated basis
in that year or in a carryback year, the prior years'
allocation of such consolidated tax effects is adjusted in a
subsequent year to the extent necessary to allocate the tax
benefits to the group that would have realized the tax benefits
on a separate return basis.
The allocated group amounts of taxes payable or refundable
are not necessarily comparable to those that would have
resulted if the groups had filed separate tax returns; however,
such allocation should not result in any of the three groups
paying more income taxes over time than it would if it filed
separate tax returns, and in certain situations, could result
in any of the three groups paying less.

4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

The 1993 restructuring action involving the planned closure of
a Pennsylvania coal mine resulted in a $42 million charge to
operating income, primarily related to the writedown of
property, plant and equipment, contract termination, and mine
closure cost. A $10 million restructuring charge for the
completion of the 1991 restructuring plan related to steel
operations reduced operating income in 1992. The 1991
restructuring actions resulted in a $402 million charge to
operating income, primarily related to write-downs of property,
plant and equipment and employee costs related to the permanent
closing of certain steel facilities.

5. B&LE LITIGATION CHARGES

Pretax income (loss) in 1993 included a $506 million charge
related to the adverse decision in the Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore
Antitrust Litigation against a former USX subsidiary, the
Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad (B&LE) (Note 26, page S-19).
Charges of $342 million were included in operating costs and
$164 million included in interest and other financial costs.
The effect on 1993 net income (loss) was $325 million
unfavorable ($5.04 per share of Steel Stock). At December 31,
1993, accounts payable included $376 million for this
litigation.

6. FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES ATTRIBUTED TO ALL THREE GROUPS

As described in Note 3, page S-8, the U. S. Steel Group's
portion of USX's financial activities attributed to all groups
based on their respective cash flows (which excludes amounts
specifically attributed to any of the groups, Note 7, page
S-10) is as follows:

10. PENSIONS

The U. S. Steel Group has noncontributory defined benefit
plans covering substantially all employees. Benefits under
these plans are based upon years of service and final average
pensionable earnings, or a minimum benefit based upon years of
service, whichever is greater. In addition, contributory
pension benefits, which cover participating salaried
employees, are based upon years of service and career
earnings. The funding policy for defined benefit plans
provides that payments to the pension trusts shall be equal to
the minimum funding requirements of ERISA plus such additional
amounts as may be approved from time to time. Certain of these
plans provide benefits to USX corporate employees, and the
related costs or credits for such employees are allocated to
all three groups (Note 3, page S-8).
The U. S. Steel Group also participates in multiemployer
plans, most of which are defined benefit plans associated with
coal operations.

PENSION COST (CREDIT) -- The defined benefit cost for major
plans was determined assuming an expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets of 10% for 1993 and 11% for 1992 and
1991. The total pension credit is primarily included in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

11. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The U. S. Steel Group has defined benefit retiree health and
life insurance plans covering most employees upon their
retirement. Health benefits are provided, for the most part,
through comprehensive hospital, surgical and major medical
benefit provisions subject to various cost sharing features.
Life insurance benefits are provided to nonunion retiree
beneficiaries primarily based on employees' annual base salary
at retirement. For union retirees, benefits are provided for
the most part based on fixed amounts negotiated in labor
contracts with the appropriate unions. Except for certain life
insurance benefits paid from reserves held by insurance
carriers, benefits have not been prefunded. In 1994, the U. S.
Steel Group agreed to establish a Voluntary Employee
Beneficiary Association (VEBA) Trust to prefund health care
and life insurance benefits for retirees, who are covered
under the USWA union agreement. Minimum contributions, in the
form of USX Corporation stock or cash, are expected to be $25
million in 1994 and $10 million per year thereafter.
In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS No. 106), which requires
accrual accounting for all postretirement benefits other than
pensions. USX elected to recognize immediately the transition
obligation determined as of January 1, 1992, which represents
the excess accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
(APBO) for current and future retirees over the fair value of
plan assets and recorded postretirement benefit cost accruals.
The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle
for the U. S. Steel Group reduced net income $1,159 million,
consisting of the transition obligation of $1,837 million, net
of $678 million income tax effect.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST -- Postretirement benefit cost for
defined benefit plans for 1993 and 1992 was determined
assuming a discount rate of 7% and 8%, respectively, and an
expected return on plan assets of 10% for each year presented
below:

<TABLE>

Total defined benefit plans 203 184
Multiemployer plans(a) 9 12 
------- -------
Total periodic postretirement benefit cost $ 212 $ 196
...................................................................................................
</TABLE>

(a) In 1993, a new multi-employer benefit plan created by the
Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 replaced
the previous plan provided under the collective bargaining
agreement with the United Mine Workers of America. The 
U. S. Steel Group is required to make payments to the plan
based on assigned beneficiaries receiving benefits, and
such payments are expected to increase to approximately
$15 million to $25 million in 1994 and subsequent years.
The present value of this unrecognized obligation is
broadly estimated to be $220 million, including the
effects of future medical inflation, and this amount 
could increase if additional beneficiaries are assigned.

Prior to 1992, the cost of providing health care benefits
to retired employees was recognized as an expense primarily as
claims were paid, and the cost of life insurance benefits for
retirees was generally accrued during their working years.
These costs totaled $144 million for 1991.

FUNDS' STATUS -- The following table sets forth the plans'
funded status and the amounts reported in the U. S. Steel
Group's balance sheet:

Reconciliation of funds' status to reported amounts:

Unamortized prior service cost 5 16 
------- ------- 
Accrued liability included in balance sheet $(2,181) $(2,110)
................................................................................................... 
</TABLE>

The assumed discount rate used to measure the APBO was
6.5% and 7% at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
respectively. The assumed rate of future increases in
compensation levels was 3% for both years. The weighted
average health care cost trend rate in 1994 is approximately
8%, gradually declining to an ultimate rate in 1997 of
approximately 6%. A one percentage point increase in the
assumed health care cost trend rates for each future year
would have increased the aggregate of the service and interest
cost components of the 1993 net periodic postretirement
benefit cost by $28 million and would have increased the APBO
as of December 31, 1993, by $326 million.

Settlements -- Other income disclosed in Note 9, page S-11,
included a settlement gain of $24 million resulting from the
sale of the Cumberland coal mine.

12. INCOME TAXES

Income tax provisions and related assets and liabilities 
attributed to the U.S. Steel Group are determined in 
accordance with the USX group tax allocation policy 
(Note 3, page S-9).
In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No.
109), which requires an asset and liability approach in
accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are established to reflect
the future tax consequences of carryforwards and differences
between the tax bases and financial bases of assets and
liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle determined as of January 1, 1992, reduced net income
$176 million.

(a) Computed in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 11. The deferred tax benefit of $139 million
in 1991 was primarily the net result of the generation
of federal tax loss carryforwards and timing differences
related to restructuring charges and pension accruals.

In 1993, the cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle for postemployment benefits included a
deferred tax benefit of $40 million (Note 2, page S-7). In
1992, the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle for other postretirement benefits included a
deferred tax benefit of $678 million (Note 11, page S-13).

associated with a majority owned subsidiary which is not
included in USX's consolidated federal tax return of $26
million and $21 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, for which a full valuation allowance has
been provided at both dates.
(c) Valuation allowances have been established for certain
federal and state income tax assets. The valuation
allowances increased $31 million primarily for certain tax
credits and tax loss carryforwards which USX may not fully
utilize.

The consolidated tax returns of USX for the years 1988
through 1991 are under various stages of audit and
administrative review by the IRS. USX believes it has made
adequate provision for income taxes and interest which may
become payable for years not yet settled.

19. SALES OF RECEIVABLES

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - The U. S. Steel Group has entered into
an agreement to sell certain accounts receivable subject to
limited recourse. Payments are collected from the sold
accounts receivable; the collections are reinvested in new
accounts receivable for the buyers; and a yield based on
defined short-term market rates is transferred to the buyers.
Collections on sold accounts receivable will be forwarded to
the buyers at the end of the agreement in 1994, in the event
of earlier contract termination or if a sufficient quantity of
eligible accounts receivable is not available to reinvest in
for the buyers. The balance of sold accounts receivable
averaged $333 million, $310 million and $350 million for the
years 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. At December 31, 1993,
the balance of sold accounts receivable that had not been
collected was $340 million. Buyers have collection rights to
recover payments from an amount of outstanding receivables
equal to 120% of the outstanding receivables purchased on a
nonrecourse basis; such overcollateralization cannot exceed
$70 million. The U. S. Steel Group does not generally require
collateral for accounts receivable, but significantly reduces
credit risk through credit extension and collection policies,
which include analyzing the financial condition of potential
customers, establishing credit limits, monitoring payments and
aggressively pursuing delinquent accounts. In the event of a
change in control of USX, as defined in the agreement, the 
U. S. Steel Group may be required to forward payments collected
on sold accounts receivable to the buyers.

S-16
<PAGE> 95
LOANS RECEIVABLE -- Prior to 1993, USX Credit, a division of
USX, sold certain of its loans receivable subject to limited
recourse. USX Credit continues to collect payments from the
loans and transfer to the buyers principal collected plus
yield based on defined short-term market rates. In 1993, 1992
and 1991, USX Credit net sales (repurchases) of loans
receivable totaled $(50) million, $(24) million and $85
million, respectively. At December 31, 1993, the balance of
sold loans receivable subject to recourse was $205 million.
USX Credit is not actively seeking new loans at this time. USX
Credit is subject to market risk through fluctuations in
short-term market rates on sold loans which pay fixed interest
rates. USX Credit significantly reduces credit risk through a
credit policy, which requires that loans be secured by the
real property or equipment financed, often with additional
security such as letters of credit, personal guarantees and
committed long-term financing takeouts. Also, USX Credit
diversifies its portfolio as to types and terms of loans,
borrowers, loan sizes, sources of business and types and
locations of collateral. As of December 31, 1993, and December
31, 1992, USX Credit had outstanding loan commitments of $29
million and $32 million, respectively. In the event of a
change in control of USX, as defined in the agreement, the 
U. S. Steel Group may be required to provide cash collateral in
the amount of the uncollected loans receivable to assure
compliance with the limited recourse provisions

Estimated credit losses under the limited recourse
provisions for both accounts receivable and loans receivable
are recognized when the receivables are sold consistent with
bad debt experience. Recognized liabilities for future
recourse obligations of sold receivables were $3 million and
$1 million at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
respectively.

see Note 19, page U-21 to the USX consolidated financial
statements.
(b) The initial dividend on the Steel Stock was paid on
September 10, 1991. Dividends paid by USX prior to that
date were attributed to the U. S. Steel Group and the
Marathon Group based upon the relationship of the initial
dividends on the Steel Stock and Marathon Stock.

21. DIVIDENDS

In accordance with the USX Certificate of Incorporation,
dividends on the Steel Stock, Marathon Stock and Delhi Stock
are limited to the legally available funds of USX. Net losses
of the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group or the Delhi
Group, as well as dividends or distributions on any class of
USX common stock or series of Preferred Stock and repurchases
of any class of USX common stock or certain series of
Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally
available for payment of dividends on all classes of USX
common stock. Subject to this limitation, the Board of
Directors intends to declare and pay dividends on the Steel
Stock based on the financial condition and results of
operations of the U. S. Steel Group, although it has no
obligation under Delaware Law to do so. In making its dividend
decisions with respect to Steel Stock, the Board of Directors
considers, among other things, the long-term earnings and cash
flow capabilities of the U. S. Steel Group as well as the
dividend policies of similar publicly traded steel companies.
Dividends on the Steel Stock are further limited to the
Available Steel Dividend Amount. At December 31, 1993, the
Available Steel Dividend Amount was at least $1.849 billion.
The Available Steel Dividend Amount will be increased or
decreased, as appropriate, to reflect U. S. Steel Group net
income, dividends, repurchases or issuances with respect to
the Steel Stock and preferred stock attributed to the U. S.
Steel Group and certain other items.

22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

The method of calculating net income (loss) per share for the
Steel Stock, Marathon Stock and Delhi Stock reflects the USX
Board of Directors' intent that the separately reported
earnings and surplus of the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon
Group and the Delhi Group, as determined consistent with the
USX Certificate of Incorporation, are available for payment of
dividends to the respective classes of stock, although legally
available funds and liquidation preferences of these classes
of stock do not necessarily correspond with these amounts.
For purposes of computing net income (loss) per share of
Steel Stock for periods prior to May 7, 1991, the numbers of
shares of Steel Stock are assumed to be one-fifth of the total
corresponding numbers of shares of USX common stock.
Primary net income (loss) per share is calculated by
adjusting net income (loss) for dividend requirements of
preferred stock and is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents,
provided they are not antidilutive. Common stock equivalents
result from assumed exercise of stock options and surrender of
stock appreciation rights associated with stock options, where
applicable.
Fully diluted net income (loss) per share assumes
conversion of convertible securities for the applicable
periods outstanding and assumes exercise of stock options and
surrender of stock appreciation rights, provided, in each
case, the effect is not antidilutive.

23. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Exchange adjustments resulting from foreign currency
transactions generally are recognized in income, whereas
adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements
are reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
For 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, the aggregate foreign
currency transaction losses included in determining net income
were $4 million, $2 million and $2 million. An analysis of
changes in cumulative foreign currency translation
adjustments follows:

(a) The difference between carrying value and fair value
principally represented the subordinated note related to
the earlier sale of a majority interest in Transtar, Inc.
(Transtar) which was carried at no value due to the highly

full in 1993 resulting in other income of $70 million and
interest income of $37 million (Note 9, page S-11).

25. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

Fair value of financial instruments classified as current
assets or liabilities approximate carrying value due to the
short-term maturity of the instruments. Fair value of
long-term receivables and other investments was based on
discounted cash flows or other specific instrument analysis.
Fair value of long-term debt instruments was based on market
prices where available or current borrowing rates available
for financings with similar terms and maturities.
The U. S. Steel Group's unrecognized financial instruments
consist of receivables sold subject to limited recourse,
commitments to extend credit, financial guarantees, and
commodity swaps. It is not practicable to estimate the fair
value of these forms of financial instrument obligations. For
details relating to sales of receivables and commitments to
extend credit see Note 19, page S-16. For details relating to
financial guarantees see Note 26, page S-20. The contract
value of open natural gas commodity swaps, as of December 31,
1993 and December 31, 1992 totaled $51 million and $13
million, respectively. The swap arrangements extend for no
longer than one year.

26. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
relating to the U. S. Steel Group involving a variety of
matters, including laws and regulations relating to the
environment. Certain of these matters are discussed below. The
ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually
or in the aggregate, be material to the U. S. Steel Group
financial statements. However, management believes that USX
will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it
is possible that these contingencies could be resolved
unfavorably to the U. S. Steel Group.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS --
B&LE litigation; MDL-587

On January 24, 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a
petition for Writ of Certiorari by the B&LE in the Lower 
Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation (MDL-587). 
As a result, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Third Circuit affirming judgments of approximately $498
million, plus interest, relating to antitrust violations by 
the B&LE was permitted to stand. In addition, the Third Circuit
decision remanded the claims of two plaintiffs for retrial of
their damage awards. At trial these plaintiffs asserted claims
of approximately $8 million, but were awarded only nominal
damages by the jury. A new trial date has not been set. Any
damages awarded in a new trial may be more or less than 
$8 million and would be subject to trebling.
The B&LE was a wholly owned subsidiary of USX throughout the
period the conduct occurred. It is now a subsidiary of Transtar
in which USX has a 45% equity interest. These actions were
excluded liabilities in the sale of USX's transportation units
in 1988, and USX is obligated to reimburse Transtar for
judgments paid by the B&LE.

Following the Court of Appeals decision, USX, which had
previously accrued $90 million on a pretax basis for this
litigation, charged an additional amount of $619 million on a
pretax basis in the second quarter of 1993. In late 1993, USX
and LTV Steel Corp. ("LTV"), one of the plaintiffs in MDL-587,
agreed to settle all of LTV's claims in that action for $375
million. USX made a payment of $200 million on December 29,
1993, and is obligated to pay an additional $175 million not
later than February 28, 1994. Claims of three additional
plaintiffs were also settled in December 1993. 

These settlements resulted in a pretax credit of $127 million 
in the fourth quarter financial results of the U.S. Steel
Group. As a result of the denial of the Petition for Writ of 
Certiorari, judgments for the other MDL-587 plaintiffs 
(other than the two remanded for retrial), totaling 
approximately $210 million, including postjudgment interest, 
are due for payment in the first quarter of 1994.

B&LE litigation; Armco
In June 1990, following judgments entered on behalf of
steel company plaintiffs in MDL-587, Armco Steel filed federal
antitrust claims against the B&LE and other railroads in the
Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. B&LE
successfully challenged the actions for lack of jurisdiction
and venue, and the case was transferred to the Federal
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Other
defendant railroads settled with Armco, leaving B&LE as the
only remaining defendant. On April 7, 1993, B&LE's motion to
dismiss the federal antitrust claims on grounds of statute of
limitations was granted. Subsequently, Armco refiled its
claims under the Ohio Valentine Act. B&LE's motions for
summary judgment on time bar issues and for change of venue
are pending, and not yet fully briefed. No discovery has been
taken on the merits of Armco's claims, but if Armco survives
the present and possibly further pretrial motions and the case
proceeds to trial on the merits, Armco's claimed damages are
likely to be substantial. There is a dispute whether the Armco
case was an excluded liability in the sale of USX's
transportation units and whether USX is obligated to reimburse
Transtar for a judgment in this case.

S-19
<PAGE> 98
26. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

Energy Buyers litigation
On December 21, 1992, an arbitrator issued an award for
approximately $117 million, plus interest under Ohio law,
against USX in Energy Buyers Service Corporation v. USX, a
case originally filed in the District Court of Harris County,
Texas. Such amount was fully accrued as of December 31, 1992.
On December 15, 1993, USX agreed to settle all claims in the
case for $95 million and deferred payments of up to $9
million.

Pickering litigation
On November 3, 1992, the United States District Court for
the District of Utah Central Division issued a Memorandum
Opinion and Order in Pickering v. USX relating to pension and
compensation claims by approximately 1,900 employees of USX's
former Geneva (Utah) Works. Although the court dismissed a
number of the claims by the plaintiffs, it found that USX had
violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by
interfering with the accrual of pension benefits of certain
employees and amending a benefit plan to reduce the accrual of
future benefits without proper notice to plan participants.
Further proceedings were held to determine damages and,
pending the court's determinations, USX may appeal.
Plaintiffs' counsel has been reported as estimating
plaintiffs' anticipated recovery to be in excess of $100
million. USX believes actual damages will be substantially
less than plaintiffs' estimates.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS --
The U. S. Steel Group is subject to federal, state and
local laws and regulations relating to the environment. These
laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into
the environment and require responsible parties to undertake
remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may
be imposed for noncompliance. The U. S. Steel Group provides
for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to
remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is
reasonably determinable. Generally, the timing of these
accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or
the commitment to a formal plan of action. Accrued liabilities
for remediation and mine reclamation totaled $151 million and
$142 million at December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992,
respectively. It is not presently possible to estimate the
ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be
incurred or the penalties that may be imposed.
For a number of years, the U. S. Steel Group has made
substantial capital expenditures to bring existing facilities
into compliance with various laws relating to the environment.
In 1993 and 1992, such capital expenditures totaled $53
million and $52 million, respectively. The U. S. Steel Group
anticipates making additional such expenditures in the future;
however, the exact amounts and timing of such expenditures are
uncertain because of the continuing evolution of specific
regulatory requirements.

GUARANTEES --
Guarantees by USX of the liabilities of affiliated
entities of the U. S. Steel Group totaled $209 million at
December 31, 1993, and $242 million at December 31, 1992. In
the event that any defaults of guaranteed liabilities occur,
USX has access to its interest in the assets of the affiliates
to reduce U. S. Steel Group losses resulting from these
guarantees. As of December 31, 1993, the largest guarantee for
a single affiliate was $96 million.

COMMITMENTS --
At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, contract
commitments for the U. S. Steel Group's capital expenditures
for property, plant and equipment totaled $105 million and $63
million, respectively.
USX has entered into a 15-year take-or-pay arrangement
which requires the U. S. Steel Group to accept pulverized coal
each month or pay a minimum monthly charge. In 1993, charges
for deliveries of pulverized coal which began in 1993 totaled
$14 million. In the future, the U. S. Steel Group will be
obligated to make minimum payments of approximately $16
million per year. If USX elects to terminate the contract
early, a maximum termination payment of $126 million, which
declines over the duration of the agreement, may be required.
The U. S. Steel Group is a party to a transportation
agreement with Transtar for Great Lakes shipments of raw
materials required by the U. S. Steel Group. The agreement
cannot be canceled until 1999 and requires the U. S. Steel
Group to pay, at a minimum, Transtar's annual fixed costs
related to the agreement, including lease/charter costs,
depreciation of owned vessels, dry dock fees and other
administrative costs. Total transportation costs under the
agreement were $68 million in 1993 and $66 million in 1992,
including fixed costs of $21 million in each year. The fixed
costs are expected to continue at approximately the same level
over the duration of the agreement.

27. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On February 2, 1994, USX sold 5,000,000 shares of Steel Stock
to the public for net proceeds of $201 million, which will be
reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial
statements.

THE U. S. STEEL GROUP
Management's Discussion and Analysis

The U. S. Steel Group includes U.S. Steel, which is
primarily engaged in the production and sale of a wide range of
steel mill products, coke and taconite pellets. The U. S. Steel
Group also includes the management of mineral resources,
domestic coal mining, engineering and consulting services and
technology licensing (together with U. S. Steel, the "Steel and
Related Businesses"). Other businesses that are part of the 
U.S. Steel Group include real estate development and management,
fencing products, leasing and financing activities and a
majority interest in a titanium metal products company.
Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in
conjunction with the U. S. Steel Group's Financial Statements
and Notes to Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME

THE U. S. STEEL GROUP'S SALES increased by $693 million in
1993 from 1992 following an increase of $55 million in 1992
from 1991. The increase in 1993 primarily reflected an increase
in steel shipment volumes of approximately 1.1 million tons,
higher average steel prices and increased commercial shipments
of taconite pellets and coke. The increase in 1992 relative to
1991 was primarily due to significantly higher commercial
shipments of coke, improvements in steel shipment volumes from
ongoing operations and an improved shipment mix, partially
offset by the absence of sales of structural products due to
the closure of South (IL) Works early in 1992.

THE U. S. STEEL GROUP REPORTED AN OPERATING LOSS of $149
million in 1993 compared with an operating loss of $241 million
in 1992 and an operating loss of $617 million in 1991. The 1993
operating loss included a $342 million charge as a result of
the adverse decision in the Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust
Litigation against the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad ("B&LE
litigation") (which also resulted in $164 million of interest
costs) (see Note 5 to the U. S. Steel Group Financial
Statements), and restructuring charges of $42 million related
to the planned shutdown of the Maple Creek coal mine and
preparation plant. The 1992 operating loss included a charge of
$10 million for completion of the portion of the 1991
restructuring plan related to steel facilities. Excluding these
charges, operating results in 1993 improved by $466 million
over 1992 primarily due to higher steel shipment volumes and
prices, improved operating efficiencies and lower accruals for
environmental and legal contingencies. In addition, 1993
results benefitted from a $39 million favorable effect from the
utilization of funds from previously established insurance
reserves to pay for certain employee insurance benefits, lower
provisions for loan losses by USX Credit and the absence of a
1992 unfavorable effect of $28 million resulting from market
valuation provisions for foreclosed real estate assets. These
were partially offset by higher hourly steel labor costs,
unfavorable effects associated with pension and other employee
benefits, lower results from coal operations and a $21 million
increase in operating costs related to the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 -
Employers' Accounting for Post Employment Benefits ("SFAS No.
112").

The operating loss in 1991 included $402 million of
restructuring charges primarily related to the shutdown of
certain steel facilities. Excluding the effect of this item and
the 1992 special item previously discussed, operating results
decreased by $16 million from 1991 to 1992. The decrease in
1992 was primarily due to higher charges for legal
contingencies, increased costs of $42 million related to the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106
- Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions ("SFAS No. 106"), higher depreciation charges,
increased provisions for loan losses by USX Credit and a $28
million unfavorable effect resulting from market valuation
provisions for foreclosed real estate assets. These were
partially offset by the favorable effects of savings from cost 
reduction programs, higher utilization of raw steel and raw 
material production capability and the absence of costs 
incurred in 1991 related to the lack of an early labor 
agreement with the United Steelworkers of America ("USWA").

S-23
<PAGE> 102
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

OTHER INCOME was $210 million in 1993 compared with $5
million in 1992 and $9 million in 1991. The increase in 1993
primarily resulted from higher gains from the disposal of
assets, including the sale of the Cumberland coal mine, the
realization of a $70 million deferred gain resulting from the
collection of a subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of
Transtar, Inc. ("Transtar") (which also resulted in $37 million
of interest income) and the sale of an investment in an
insurance company. The decline in 1992 relative to 1991
primarily resulted from the nonrecurrence of 1991's favorable
minority interest effect related to RMI Titanium Company
("RMI"), partially offset by reduced losses from equity
affiliates.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCOME was $59 million in
1993. The 1993 amount included $37 million of interest income
resulting from collection of the Transtar note. Excluding this
item, interest and other financial income was $22 million in
1993, compared with $18 million in 1992 and $20 million in
1991.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS were $330 million in
1993. The 1993 amount included $164 million of interest expense
related to the adverse decision in the B&LE litigation.
Excluding the effect of this item, interest and other financial
costs were $166 million in 1993, compared to $176 million in
1992 and $168 million in 1991. The changes over the three-year
period primarily reflected differences in average debt levels.

THE CREDIT FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES in 1993 was $41
million, compared with credits of $123 million in 1992 and $249
million in 1991. The U. S. income tax provision for 1993
included a $15 million favorable effect associated with an
increase in the federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%,
reflecting remeasurement of deferred federal income tax assets
as of January 1, 1993. This benefit was offset by adjustments
for prior years' Internal Revenue Service examinations.

THE U. S. STEEL GROUP GENERATED A LOSS BEFORE CUMULATIVE
EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES of $169 million in
1993, compared with a loss of $271 million in 1992 and a loss
of $507 million in 1991.

THE UNFAVORABLE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING
PRINCIPLES totaled $69 million in 1993 and $1,335 million in
1992. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 112,
determined as of January 1, 1993, decreased 1993 income of the
U. S. Steel Group by $69 million, net of the income tax effect.
The immediate recognition of the transition obligation
resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 106, measured as of
January 1, 1992, decreased the U. S. Steel Group's 1992 income
by $1,159 million, net of the income tax effect. The cumulative
effect of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes ("SFAS No. 109"),
measured as of January 1, 1992, decreased 1992 net income by
$176 million. The adoption of SFAS No. 109 had no material
effect on the U. S. Steel Group's 1992 income tax expense.

THE U. S. STEEL GROUP RECORDED A NET LOSS of $238 million
in 1993, compared with a net loss of $1,606 million in 1992 and
a net loss of $507 million in 1991.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

CURRENT ASSETS at year-end 1993 increased $254 million
from year-end 1992 primarily due to increases in receivables
and deferred income tax benefits. The increase in receivables
was primarily due to an increase in trade receivables as a
result of higher steel shipment activity. The increase in
deferred income tax benefits primarily reflected an increase in
accruals related to the B&LE litigation. The U. S. Steel Group
financial statements reflect current and deferred tax
assets and liabilities that relate to tax attributes utilized
and recognized on a consolidated basis and attributed in
accordance with the USX Corporation ("USX") group tax
allocation policy (see Note 3 to the U. S. Steel Group
Financial Statements).

S-24
<PAGE> 103
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (LESS DEPRECIATION)
decreased $156 million from 1992. The decrease was primarily
due to depreciation, the sale of the Cumberland coal mine and
the writedown of Maple Creek coal mine assets in connection
with the planned closure which, in total, exceeded capital
expenditures.

PREPAID PENSION ASSETS increased $223 million from
year-end 1992 mainly as a result of pension credits which
primarily reflected the investment performance of defined
benefit plan assets.

CURRENT LIABILITIES increased $358 million over year-end
1992 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable,
partially offset by a reduction in long-term debt due within
one year. The increase in accounts payable in 1993 mainly
reflected an increase in accruals related to the B&LE
litigation and higher trade payables.

TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE at December 31,
1993 was $1,551 million. The $723 million decrease from
year-end 1992 primarily reflected cash generated from issuance
of 6.50% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("6.50%
Convertible Preferred") and USX-U. S. Steel Group Common Stock
("Steel Stock"), disposal of assets and operating activities,
partially offset by capital expenditures, dividend payments and
an increase in cash and cash equivalents. The amount of total
long-term debt, as well as the amount shown as notes payable,
principally represented the U. S. Steel Group's portion of USX
debt attributed to all three groups. Virtually all of the debt
is a direct obligation of, or is guaranteed by, USX.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS liabilities increased $309 million
compared with year-end 1992 mainly due to increases in workers'
compensation liabilities (including the effects of the adoption
of SFAS No. 112), retiree medical liabilities and pension
liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in liabilities due
to asset sale transactions.

DEFERRED CREDITS AND OTHER LIABILITIES decreased $80
million in 1993 mainly as a result of transfers of certain
litigation accruals to current liabilities.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY of $617 million at year-end 1993
increased $370 million from the end of 1992 mainly reflecting
the issuance of additional preferred and common equity,
partially offset by the 1993 net loss and dividend payments.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows

THE U. S. STEEL GROUP'S NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING
ACTIVITIES in 1993 was $86 million compared with net cash used
in operating activities of $89 million in 1992. The 1993 period
was negatively affected by payments of $314 million related to
partial settlement of the B&LE litigation and settlement of the
Energy Buyers litigation. Excluding these payments, net cash
provided from operating activities improved by $489 million in
1993. The increase primarily reflected improved operations and
a $103 million favorable effect from the use of available funds
from previously established (now depleted) insurance reserves
to pay for certain active and retired employee insurance
benefits.

The U. S. Steel Group's net cash used in operating
activities in 1992 was $89 million compared to net cash
generated of $9 million in 1991. The results primarily
reflected unfavorable changes in working capital accounts
resulting mainly from a lower settlement from the Marathon
Group related to prior years' income taxes in accordance with
USX's group tax allocation policy, partially offset by
favorable effects due to changes in the amount of sold accounts
receivable.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES totaled $198 million in 1993 compared
with $298 million in 1992 and $432 million in 1991. The
year-to-year reductions over this period primarily reflected
the completion of U. S. Steel's continuous cast modernization
program, as the Gary (IN) Works caster was completed during
1991 and the Mon Valley (PA) Works caster was completed in
1992. In addition to spending for

S-25
<PAGE> 104
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

the continuous caster at Mon Valley Works, significant projects
in 1992 included modernization of the hot strip mill and the
electrogalvanizing line at Gary Works. Contract commitments for
capital expenditures at year-end 1993 were $105 million,
compared with $63 million at year-end 1992. Capital
expenditures in 1994 are expected to be approximately $260
million and will include continued expenditures for projects
begun in 1993 relative to environmental, hot-strip mill and
pickle line improvements at Gary Works and initial expenditures
for a blast furnace reline project at Mon Valley Works which is
planned for completion in 1995. Capital expenditures in 1995
and 1996 are currently expected to remain at about the same
level as in 1994.

CASH FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS totaled $291 million in
1993, compared with $39 million in 1992 and $26 million in
1991. The 1993 amount primarily reflected the realization of
proceeds from a subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of
Transtar and the sales of the Cumberland coal mine and
investments in an insurance company and a foreign manganese
mining affiliate.

FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS decreased by $730 million in 1993,
compared with an increase of $203 million in 1992 and an
increase of $502 million in 1991. The decrease in 1993
primarily reflected the use of proceeds from the issuance of
common and preferred stock attributed to the U. S. Steel Group,
asset sales and net cash flows from operating activities of the
U. S. Steel Group. These obligations consist of the U. S. Steel
Group's portion of USX debt attributed to all three groups as
well as debt and financing agreements specifically attributed
to the U. S. Steel Group.

PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED totaled $336 million in 1993. This
amount was due to the sale of 6,900,000 shares of 6.50%
Convertible Preferred ($50.00 liquidation preference per share)
to the public for net proceeds of $336 million which were
reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial
statements. The 6.50% Convertible Preferred is convertible at
any time into shares of Steel Stock at a conversion price of
$46.125 per share of Steel Stock.

STEEL STOCK ISSUED totaled $366 million in 1993. This
amount was mainly due to the sale of 10,000,000 shares of Steel
Stock to the public for net proceeds of $350 million, which
were reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group
financial statements. The increase in 1992 primarily reflected
the sale of 8,050,000 shares of Steel Stock to the public for
net proceeds of $198 million, which were reflected in their
entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial statements.

In February 1994, USX sold 5,000,000 shares of Steel Stock
to the public for net proceeds of $201 million, which will be
reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial
statements.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS increased in 1993 primarily as a result
of higher dividends due to the sale of additional shares of
Steel Stock and of the 6.50% Convertible Preferred mentioned
above. Dividends attributed to the Steel Stock prior to
September 10, 1991 were based upon the relationship of the
initial dividends of the Steel Stock and the USX-Marathon Group
Common Stock. The annualized rate of dividends per share for
the Steel Stock based on the most recently declared quarterly
dividend is $1.00.

In September 1993, Standard & Poor's Corp. ("S&P")
lowered its ratings on USX's and Marathon Oil Company's
("Marathon") senior debt to below investment grade (from BBB-
to BB+) and on USX's subordinated debt, preferred stock and
commercial paper. S&P cited extremely aggressive financial
leverage, burdensome retiree medical liabilities and litigation
contingencies. In October 1993, Moody's Investors Services,
Inc. ("Moody's") confirmed its Baa3 investment grade ratings on
USX's and Marathon's senior debt. Moody's also confirmed its
ratings on USX's subordinated debt and commercial paper, but
lowered its ratings on USX's preferred stock from ba1 to ba2.
Moody's noted that the rating confirmation on USX debt
securities reflected confidence in the expected performance of
USX during the intermediate term, while the downward revision
of the preferred stock ratings incorporated a narrow fixed
charge coverage going forward. The downgrades by S&P and the
downgrade of ratings on preferred stock by Moody's could
increase USX's cost of capital. Any related increase in
interest costs would be reflected in the consolidated financial
statements and the financial statements of each group.

S-26
<PAGE> 105
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

As a result of the settlement of LTV Steel Corp.'s ("LTV")
portion of the B&LE litigation, USX is obligated to pay an
additional $175 million to LTV in the first quarter of 1994. In
addition, approximately $210 million in judgments for other
plaintiffs in the B&LE litigation are due for payment in the
first quarter of 1994. See Note 26 to the U. S. Steel Group
Financial Statements.

USX anticipates that it will begin funding the U. S. Steel
Group's pension plan for approximately $100 million per year
commencing with the 1994 plan year. The funding for both the
1994 and 1995 plan years will impact cash flows in 1995.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES

The U. S. Steel Group has incurred and will continue to
incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and
remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and
regulations. In recent years, these expenditures have been
mainly for process changes in order to meet Clean Air Act
obligations, although ongoing compliance costs have also been
significant. To the extent these expenditures, as with all
costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of the U. S.
Steel Group's products and services, operating results will be
adversely affected. The U. S. Steel Group believes that all of
its domestic competitors are subject to similar environmental
laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each
competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including
the age and location of their operating facilities and their
production methods.

The U. S. Steel Group's environmental expenditures for
1993 and 1992 are discussed below and have been estimated based
on U. S. Department of Commerce ("USDC") survey guidelines.
These guidelines are subject to differing interpretations which
could affect the comparability of such data. Some environmental
related expenditures, while benefitting the environment, also
enhance operating efficiencies.

Total environmental expenditures for the U. S. Steel Group
in 1993 were $240 million compared with $220 million in 1992.
These amounts consisted of capital expenditures of $53 million
in 1993 and $52 million in 1992 and estimated compliance
expenditures (including operating and maintenance) of $187
million in 1993 and $168 million in 1992. Compliance
expenditures were broadly estimated based on USDC survey
guidelines and represented 3% of the U. S. Steel Group's total
operating costs in both 1993 and 1992.

USX has been notified that it is a potentially responsible
party ("PRP") at 41 waste sites related to the U. S. Steel
Group under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") as of December 31,
1993. In addition, there are 28 sites related to the U. S.
Steel Group where USX has received information requests or
other indications that USX may be a PRP under CERCLA but where
sufficient information is not presently available to confirm
the existence of liability or make any judgment as to the
amount thereof. There are also 10 additional sites related to
the U. S. Steel Group where state governmental agencies or
private parties are seeking remediation under state
environmental laws through discussions or litigation. At many
of these sites, USX is one of a number of parties involved and
the total cost of remediation, as well as USX's share thereof,
is frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and
remedial studies.

Total environmental expenditures included remediation
related expenditures estimated at $19 million in 1993 and $11
million in 1992. Remediation spending was mainly related to
dismantlement and restoration activities at former and present
operating locations. The U. S. Steel Group accrues for
environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to
remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is
reasonably determinable. As environmental remediation matters
proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation
obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously
accrued may be required. See Note 26 to the U. S. Steel Group
Financial Statements.

S-27
<PAGE> 106
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

New or expanded requirements for environmental
regulations, which could increase the U. S. Steel Group's
environmental costs, may arise in the future. USX intends to
comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment,
but since many of them are not fixed or presently determinable
(even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future
legislation, it is not possible to accurately predict the
ultimate cost of compliance, including remediation costs which
may be incurred and penalties which may be imposed. However,
based on presently available information, and existing laws and
regulations as currently implemented, the U. S. Steel Group
does not anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures
will materially increase in 1994. The U. S. Steel Group's
capital expenditures for environmental controls are expected to
be approximately $70 million in 1994, including the expected
completion of major air quality projects at Gary Works.
Predictions beyond 1994 can only be broad-based estimates which
have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing
evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible
imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability
of new technologies, among other matters. Based upon currently
identified projects, the U. S. Steel Group anticipates that
environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $25
million in 1995; however, actual expenditures may increase as
additional projects are identified or additional requirements
are imposed.

USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
relating to the U. S. Steel Group involving a variety of
matters, including laws and regulations relating to the
environment, certain of which are discussed in Note 26 to the
U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements. The ultimate resolution
of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate,
be material to the U. S. Steel Group financial statements.
However, management believes that USX will remain a viable and
competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these
contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to the U.S. Steel
Group. See USX Consolidated Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Cash Flows.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 -
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan ("SFAS No.
114") requires impairment of loans based on either the sum of
discounted cash flows or the fair value of underlying
collateral. USX expects to adopt SFAS No. 114 in the first
quarter of 1995. Based on preliminary estimates, USX believes
the unfavorable effect on the U. S. Steel Group of adopting
SFAS No. 114 will be less than $2 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS

The U. S. Steel Group reported an operating loss of $149
million in 1993 compared with operating losses of $241 million
in 1992 and $617 million in 1991. The operating loss for 1993
included a $342 million charge as a result of the adverse
decision in the B&LE litigation. The 1993, 1992, and 1991
operating losses included restructuring charges of $42 million,
$10 million, and $402 million, respectively, which are
discussed below.

*Certain reclassifications have been made to conform to 1993
classifications.

Steel and Related Businesses recorded operating income of
$123 million in 1993 compared with a loss of $140 million in
1992 and a loss of $235 million in 1991. The improvement in
1993 over 1992 was predominantly due to higher steel shipment
volumes and prices, improved operating efficiencies and lower
accruals for environmental and legal contingencies. In
addition, 1993 results benefitted from a $39 million favorable
effect from the utilization of funds from previously
established insurance reserves to pay for certain employee
insurance benefits. These positive factors were partially
offset by higher hourly steel labor costs, unfavorable effects
associated with pension and other employee benefits, lower
results from coal operations and a $21 million increase in
operating costs related to the adoption of SFAS No. 112.

The improvement in 1992 compared with 1991 was primarily
due to savings from cost reduction programs, higher utilization
of raw steel and raw material capability and the absence of
costs incurred in 1991 due to the lack of an early labor
settlement with the USWA. These were partially offset by an
increase in post retirement benefit costs in connection with
the adoption of SFAS No. 106, higher depreciation charges and
start-up costs for the Mon Valley Works continuous caster.

Average realized steel prices improved $8 per ton in 1993
after virtually no change in 1992. Steel shipments were just
under 10 million tons in 1993, an increase of 1.1 million tons
over 1992. Shipments in 1992 were basically flat with the 1991
level. U. S. Steel Group shipments comprised approximately 11%
of the domestic steel market in each of the three years.
Exports accounted for 4% of U. S. Steel Group shipments in
1993, compared with 7% in 1992 and 15% in 1991.

Raw steel production was 11.3 million tons in 1993,
compared with 10.4 million tons in 1992 and 10.5 million tons
in 1991. Raw steel produced was nearly 100% continuous cast in
1993, versus 83% in 1992 and 67% in 1991. U. S. Steel
completed its continuous cast modernization program in 1992
with the start-up of the Mon Valley Works continuous caster in
August 1992. Raw steel production averaged 96% of capability in
1993 compared with 86% of capability in 1992 and 70% of
capability in 1991.

Other Businesses recorded an operating loss of $29 million
in 1993, compared with operating losses of $96 million in 1992
and $30 million in 1991. The improvement in 1993 of $67 million
and the decrease in 1992 of $66 million primarily reflected a
$28 million charge in 1992 resulting from market valuation
provisions for foreclosed real estate assets and higher
provisions in 1992 for loan losses by USX Credit. Loan loss
provisions were $11 million in 1993, $42 million in 1992 and
$14 million in 1991. USX Credit is not actively making new loan
commitments. Excluding loan loss provisions, the balance of the
operating losses for Other Businesses during the three-year
period was largely due to the effect of depressed titanium
markets on RMI's results.

Other Administrative includes the portion of pension
credits, postretirement benefit costs and certain other
expenses principally attributable to former business units of
the U. S. Steel Group as well as USX corporate general and
administrative costs allocated to the U. S. Steel Group.
Operating income from Other Administrative was $141 million in
1993 compared to $5 million in 1992 and $50 million in 1991.
The 1993 increase resulted mainly from the absence of a charge
incurred in 1992 to cover the amount of the award in the Energy
Buyers litigation, and a credit in 1993 due to settlement

S-29
<PAGE> 108
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

of all claims in the case (see Note 26 to the U. S. Steel
Group Financial Statements). The decrease from 1991 to 1992
primarily reflected the 1992 charge related to the Energy
Buyers litigation, partially offset by a decrease in
postretirement benefit costs charged to Other Administrative in
connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 106.

The U. S. Steel Group's 1993 operating loss also included
restructuring charges of $42 million related to the planned
shutdown of the Maple Creek coal mine and preparation plant.
The 1992 loss included a charge of $10 million for completion
of the portion of the 1991 restructuring plan related to steel
facilities. The 1991 loss included $402 million of
restructuring charges primarily related to the closing of the
iron and steel producing, slab and hot strip mill and pipe mill
facilities at Fairless (PA) Works; all facilities at South
Works; RMI's sodium and sponge production facilities; a
previously idled plate mill in Baytown, Texas; and
miscellaneous other facilities.

The U. S. Steel Group's 1993 operating income was reduced
by a total of $21 million due to the adoption of SFAS No. 112.
Operating income in 1992 compared to 1991 was reduced by a
total of $42 million due to the adoption of SFAS No. 106.

The pension credits referred to in Other Administrative,
combined with pension costs for ongoing operating units of the
U. S. Steel Group, resulted in net pension credits (which are
primarily noncash) of $202 million, $231 million and $196
million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The decrease in
1993 from 1992 was primarily due to a lower assumed long-term
rate of return on plan assets. The increase in 1992 from 1991
primarily reflected recognition of the 1991 growth in plan
assets. In 1994, net pension credits are expected to decline by
approximately $85 million primarily due to a further reduction
in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets. See
Note 10 to the U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements.

The domestic steel industry has been adversely affected by
unfairly traded imports. Steel imports to the United States
accounted for an estimated 19% of the domestic steel market
during the first eleven months of 1993, and for an estimated
23% and 24% in October and November, respectively. Steel
imports to the United States accounted for an estimated 17 to
18% of the domestic steel market in 1992 and 1991. On March 31,
1992, Voluntary Restraint Agreements restricting the level of
steel imports to the United States expired, and in June 1992,
in conjunction with other domestic steel firms, USX filed a
number of antidumping and countervailing duty cases with the 
USDC and the International Trade Commission ("ITC") against 
unfairly traded imported carbon flat rolled steel. Beginning 
in late 1992, as a result of affirmative preliminary 
determinations by both the ITC and the USDC in the vast 
majority of cases, provisional duties were imposed on the 
imported steel products under investigation. On June 22, 1993, 
the USDC issued the final determinations of subsidization in 
the countervailing duty cases and final margins for sales 
at less than fair value in the antidumping cases.

On July 27, 1993, the ITC issued affirmative
determinations of material injury to the domestic steel
industry by reason of imports in cases representing an
estimated 51% of dollar value and 42% of the volume of all
flat-rolled carbon steel imports under investigation.
Affirmative determinations were found in cases relating to 37%
of such volume of cold-rolled steel, 92% of such volume of the
higher value-added corrosion resistant steel and 97% of such
volume of plate steel. Negative determinations were found in
all cases related to hot-rolled steel, the largest import
market.

In those cases where negative determinations were made by
the ITC, provisional duties imposed on imports covered by the
cases were removed and final remedial duties were not imposed.
While USX is unable to predict the effect these negative
determinations may have on the business or results of
operations of the U. S. Steel Group, they may result in
increasing levels of imported steel and may adversely affect
some product prices. As discussed above, steel imports to the
United States have increased in recent months.

S-30
<PAGE> 109
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

Although the affirmative determinations are helpful in
offsetting the harm to the U.S. steel industry caused by
subsidized and dumped imports, USX believes that certain of the
negative determinations were improper and, together with other
steel firms, has appealed such determinations to the U.S. Court
of International Trade and, in certain cases involving imports
from Canada, to a bi-national panel in accordance with the
Canadian Free Trade Agreement. Several of the affirmative
determinations similarly have been challenged in appeals filed
by foreign steel producers.

USX will file additional antidumping and countervailing
duty petitions if unfairly traded imports adversely impact, or
threaten to adversely impact, the results of the U. S. Steel
Group.

The U. S. Steel Group depreciates steel assets by
modifying straight-line depreciation based on the level of
production. Depreciation charges for 1993 were 100% of
straight-line depreciation based on production levels for the
year. Depreciation charges for 1992 and 1991 approximated 91%
and 89% of the amounts that would have been reported if
production levels had not been considered. In 1992, the U. S.
Steel Group revised the modification factors used in the
depreciation of steel assets to reflect that raw steel
production capability is entirely continuous cast (see Note 2
to the U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements).

OUTLOOK FOR 1994

Based on strong recent order levels and assuming a
continuing recovery of the U. S. economy, the U. S. Steel 
Group anticipates that steel demand will remain strong in
1994. The U. S. Steel Group believes that domestic industry
shipments will reach 89 to 90 million tons in 1994 as compared
to approximately 88 million tons in 1993. Price increases on
sheet products have been announced effective January 2 and July
3, 1994. Price increases on certain other products have also
been announced. Realization of these price increases will be
dependent upon steel demand and the level of imports. As
previously discussed, steel imports to the United States have
increased in recent months.

U. S. Steel entered into a new five and one-half year
contract with the USWA, effective February 1, 1994, covering
approximately 15,000 employees. The agreement will result in
higher labor and benefit costs for the U. S. Steel Group each
year throughout the term of the agreement. The agreement
includes a signing bonus of $1,000 per USWA represented
employee that will be paid in the first quarter of 1994, $500
of which represents the final bonus payable under the previous
contract. The agreement also provides for the establishment of
a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Trust to prefund
health care and life insurance benefits for retirees covered
under the agreement. Minimum contributions, in the form of USX
stock or cash, are expected to be $25 million in 1994 and 
$10 million per year thereafter. The funding of the trust 
will have no direct effect on income of the U. S. Steel
Group. Management believes that this agreement is competitive
with labor agreements reached by U. S. Steel's major domestic
integrated competitors and thus does not believe that U. S.
Steel's competitive position with regard to such other
competitors will be materially affected by its ratification.

Severe cold and extreme winter weather conditions
disrupted steel and raw materials operations and caused forced
utility curtailments at Gary Works, Mon Valley Works and
Fairless Works in January 1994. These events will have some
negative effects on operations in the first quarter of 1994.

Net pension credits for the U. S. Steel Group in 1994 are
expected to decline by approximately $85 million primarily due
to a lower assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets.

Delhi Group

Explanatory Note Regarding Financial Information

Although the financial statements of the Delhi Group, the Marathon Group and
the U. S. Steel Group separately report the assets, liabilities (including
contingent liabilities) and stockholders' equity of USX attributed to each such
group, such attribution does not affect legal title to such assets and
responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of USX-Delhi Group Common Stock,
USX-Marathon Group Common Stock and USX-U. S. Steel Group Common Stock are
holders of common stock of USX and continue to be subject to all the risks
associated with an investment in USX and all of its businesses and liabilities.
Financial impacts arising from any of the Delhi Group, the Marathonl Group or
the U. S. Steel Group which affect the overall cost of USX's capital could
affect the results of operations and financial condition of all groups. In
addition, net losses of any group, as well as dividends or distributions on any
class of USX common stock or series of Preferred Stock and repurchases of any
class of USX common stock or certain series of Preferred Stock, will reduce the
funds of USX legally available for payment of dividends on all classes of USX
common stock. Accordingly, the USX consolidated financial information should be
read in connection with the Delhi Group financial information.

Management's Report

The accompanying financial statements of the Delhi Group are the responsibility
of and have been prepared by USX Corporation (USX) in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. They necessarily include some amounts that are
based on best judgments and estimates. The Delhi Group financial information
displayed in other sections of this report is consistent with that in these
financial statements.
USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its financial
records by careful selection of its managers, by organizational arrangements
that provide an appropriate division of responsibility and by communications
programs aimed at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
throughout the organization.
USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal accounting
controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded
and that financial records are reliable. Appropriate management monitors the
system for compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure its
effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto. In addition, as part
of their audit of the financial statements, USX's independent accountants, who
are elected by the stockholders, review and test the internal accounting
controls selectively to establish a basis of reliance thereon in determining
the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be applied.
The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the area of
financial reporting and internal accounting control through its Audit
Committee. This Committee, composed solely of nonmanagement directors,
regularly meets (jointly and separately) with the independent accountants,
management and internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each of its
responsibilities relative to internal accounting controls and the consolidated
and group financial statements.

Report of Independent Accountants 

To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements appearing on pages D-4
through D-18 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Delhi Group at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of USX's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.
As discussed in Note 10, page D-12, in 1992 USX adopted a new accounting
standard for income taxes. 
The Delhi Group is a business unit of USX Corporation (as described in 
Note 1, page D-7); accordingly, the financial statements of the Delhi Group 
should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements of USX 
Corporation and Subsidiary Companies.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

On October 2, 1992, USX Corporation (USX) publicly sold
9,000,000 shares of a new class of common stock, USX --
Delhi Group Common Stock (Delhi Stock), which is
intended to reflect the performance of the Delhi Group.
As a result, USX has three classes of common stock, the
others being USX -- Marathon Group Common Stock
(Marathon Stock) and USX -- U. S. Steel Group Common
Stock (Steel Stock), which are intended to reflect the
performance of the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel
Group, respectively. The Delhi Group includes the
businesses of the Delhi Gas Pipeline Corporation (DGP)
and certain other subsidiaries of USX. The Delhi Group
is engaged in the purchasing, gathering, processing,
transporting and marketing of natural gas.
The financial data for the periods presented prior to
October 2, 1992, reflected the combined historical
financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the businesses of the Delhi Group which were
included in the financial statements of the Marathon
Group. Beginning October 2, 1992, the financial
statements of the Delhi Group include the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the
businesses of the Delhi Group; the effects of the
capital structure of the Delhi Group determined by the
Board of Directors in accordance with the USX
Certificate of Incorporation; and a portion of the
corporate assets and liabilities and related
transactions which are not separately identified with
ongoing operating units of USX. Pro forma data is
reported for the years 1992 and 1991 to reflect the
results of operations as if the capital structure of the
Delhi Group were in effect beginning January 1, 1991
(Note 23, page D-18). The Delhi Group financial
statements are prepared using the amounts included in
the USX consolidated financial statements.
The USX Board of Directors initially designated
14,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock as the total number of
shares of Delhi Stock which it deemed to represent 100%
of the common stockholders' equity value of USX
attributable to the Delhi Group. The Delhi Fraction is
the percentage interest in the Delhi Group represented
by the shares of Delhi Stock that are outstanding at any
particular time and, based on 9,282,870 outstanding
shares at December 31, 1993, is approximately 66%. The
Marathon Group financial statements reflect a percentage
interest in the Delhi Group of approximately 34%
(Retained Interest) at December 31, 1993. The Retained
Interest is subject to reduction as shares of Delhi
stock attributed to the Retained Interest are sold. (See
Note 3, page D-9, for a description of common stock
transactions.)
During 1993, 1992 and 1991 sales to one customer who
accounted for 10 percent or more of the Delhi Group's
total revenues totaled $76.4 million, $55.4 million and
$59.2 million, respectively. In addition, sales to
several customers having a common parent aggregated
$66.3 million, $63.2 million and $53.7 million during
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
Although the financial statements of the Delhi Group,
the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group separately
report the assets, liabilities (including contingent
liabilities) and stockholders' equity of USX attributed
to each such group, such attribution does not affect
legal title to such assets and responsibility for such
liabilities. Holders of Delhi Stock, Marathon Stock and
Steel Stock are holders of common stock of USX and
continue to be subject to all the risks associated with
an investment in USX and all of its businesses and
liabilities. Financial impacts arising from any of the
Delhi Group, the Marathon Group or the U. S. Steel Group
which affect the overall cost of USX's capital could
affect the results of operations and financial condition
of all groups. In addition, net losses of any group, as
well as dividends or distributions on any class of USX
common stock or series of Preferred Stock and
repurchases of any class of USX common stock or certain
series of Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX
legally available for payment of dividends on all
classes of USX common stock. Accordingly, the USX
consolidated financial information should be read in
connection with the Delhi Group financial information.

2. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION -- These financial
statements include the accounts of the businesses
comprising the Delhi Group. Beginning October 2, 1992,
the Delhi Group, the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel
Group financial statements, taken together, comprise all
of the accounts included in the USX consolidated
financial statements.
Investments in jointly owned gas processing plants 
are accounted for on a pro rata basis. 

D-7
<PAGE> 117
Investments in other entities in which the Delhi
Group has significant influence in management and
control are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting and are carried in the investment account at
the Delhi Group's share of net assets plus advances. The
proportionate share of income from equity investments is
included in other income.
Investments in marketable equity securities are 
carried at lower of cost or market.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents
includes cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid
debt instruments with maturities generally of three
months or less.

INVENTORIES -- Inventories are carried at lower of
average cost or market.

HEDGING TRANSACTIONS -- The Delhi Group enters into
futures contracts to hedge exposure to price
fluctuations relevant to the purchase or sale of natural
gas. Such transactions are accounted for as part of the
commodity being hedged.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Depreciation is
generally computed on a straight-line method based upon
estimated lives of assets.
When an entire pipeline system, plant, major facility
or facilities depreciated on an individual basis are
sold or otherwise disposed of, any gain or loss is
reflected in income. Proceeds from disposal of other
facilities depreciated on a group basis are credited to
the depreciation reserve with no immediate effect on
income.

INSURANCE -- The Delhi Group is insured for catastrophic
casualty and certain property exposures, as well as
those risks required to be insured by law or contract.
Costs resulting from noninsured losses are charged
against income upon occurrence.

3. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES

Beginning October 2, 1992, the following corporate
activities were reflected in the Delhi Group financial
statements.

FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES -- As a matter of policy, USX
manages most financial activities on a centralized,
consolidated basis. Such financial activities include
the investment of surplus cash; the issuance, repayment
and repurchase of short-term and long-term debt; the
issuance, repurchase and redemption of preferred stock;
and the issuance and repurchase of common stock. The
initial capital structure of the Delhi Group determined
by the Board of Directors pursuant to the USX
Certificate of Incorporation as of June 30, 1992,
reflects the Delhi Group's portion of USX's financial
activities attributed to each of the three groups.
Subsequent to June 30, 1992, transactions related
primarily to invested cash, short-term and long-term
debt (including convertible debt), related net interest
and other financial costs, and preferred stock and
related dividends are attributed to the Delhi Group, as
well as to the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group,
based upon the cash flows of each group for the periods
presented. Most financing transactions are attributed to
and reflected in the financial statements of all three
groups. See Note 4, page D-9, for the Delhi Group's
portion of USX's financial activities attributed to all
three groups. However, certain transactions such as
leases, production payment financings, financial
activities of consolidated entities which are less than
wholly owned by USX and transactions related to
securities convertible solely into any one class of
common stock are or will be specifically attributed to
and reflected in their entirety in the financial
statements of the group to which they relate.

CORPORATE GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- Corporate
general and administrative costs are allocated to the
Delhi Group, the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel
Group based upon utilization or other methods management
believes to be reasonable and which consider certain
measures of business activities, such as employment,
investments and sales. Such costs were also reflected in
the historical financial data of the businesses of the
Delhi Group. The costs allocated to the Delhi Group were
$1.4 million, $1.5 million and $2.4 million in 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively, and primarily consist of
employment costs including pension effects,
professional services, facilities and other related
costs associated with corporate activities.

D-8
<PAGE> 118
COMMON STOCK TRANSACTIONS -- The proceeds from issuances
of Delhi Stock representing shares attributable to the
Retained Interest will be reflected in the financial
statements of the Marathon Group (Note 1, page D-7).
All proceeds from issuances of additional shares of
Delhi Stock not deemed to represent the Retained
Interest will be reflected in their entirety in the
financial statements of the Delhi Group. When a dividend
or other distribution is paid or distributed in respect
to the outstanding Delhi Stock, or any amount paid to
repurchase shares of Delhi Stock generally, the Marathon
Group financial statements are credited, and the Delhi
Group financial statements are charged, with the
aggregate transaction amount times the quotient of the
Retained Interest divided by the Delhi Fraction.

INCOME TAXES -- All members of the USX affiliated group
are included in the consolidated United States federal
income tax return filed by USX. Accordingly, the
provision for federal income taxes and the related
payments or refunds of tax are determined on a
consolidated basis. The consolidated provision and the
related tax payments or refunds will be reflected in the
Delhi Group, the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel
Group financial statements in accordance with USX's tax
allocation policy. In general, such policy provides that
the consolidated tax provision and related tax payments
or refunds are allocated among the Delhi Group, the
Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group, for financial
statement purposes, based principally upon the financial
income, taxable income, credits, preferences and other
amounts directly related to the respective groups.
For tax provision and settlement purposes, tax
benefits resulting from attributes (principally net
operating losses), which cannot be utilized by one of
the three groups on a separate return basis but which
can be utilized on a consolidated basis in that year or
in a carryback year, are allocated to the group that
generated the attributes. However, if such tax benefits
cannot be utilized on a consolidated basis in that year
or in a carryback year, the prior years' allocation of
such consolidated tax effects is adjusted in a
subsequent year to the extent necessary to allocate the
tax benefits to the group that would have realized the
tax benefits on a separate return basis.
The allocated group amounts of taxes payable or
refundable are not necessarily comparable to those that
would have resulted if the groups had filed separate
returns; however, such allocation should not result in
any of the three groups paying more taxes over time than
it would if it filed separate tax returns and, in
certain situations, could result in any of the three
groups paying less.

4. FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES ATTRIBUTED TO ALL THREE GROUPS

As described in Note 3, page D-8, the Delhi Group's
portion of USX's financial activities attributed to all
groups based on their respective cash flows is as

8. INTERGROUP TRANSACTIONS

SALES AND PURCHASES -- Delhi Group sales to the Marathon Group
totaled $4.3 million, $4.3 million and $4.9 million in 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively. Delhi Group purchases from the
Marathon Group totaled $30.3 million, $31.2 million and $36.1
million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. These
transactions were conducted on an arm's-length basis. See Note
16, page D-14, for sales of Delhi Group receivables to the
Marathon Group.

PAYABLE TO THE U. S. STEEL GROUP -- These amounts represent
payables to the U. S. Steel Group for income taxes determined
in accordance with the tax allocation policy described in Note
3, page D-9. Tax settlements between the groups are generally
made in the year succeeding that in which such amounts are
accrued.
9. PENSIONS
The Delhi Group has a noncontributory defined benefit plans
covering all employees over 21 years of age who have one or
more years of continuous service. Benefits are based primarily
on years of service and compensation during the later years of
employment. The funding policy for the plan provides that
payments to the pension trust shall be equal to the minimum
funding requirements of ERISA plus such additional amounts as
may be approved from time to time. The plan also provides
benefits to certain employees of the Marathon Group which are
not part of the Delhi Group.

PENSION COST (CREDIT) -- The defined benefit cost was
determined assuming an expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets of 10% for 1993 and 11% for 1992 and 1991.

10. INCOME TAXES

Income tax provisions and related assets and liabilities 
attributed to the Delhi Group are determined in accordance 
with the USX group tax allocation policy (Note 3, page D-9).
In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No.
109), which requires an asset and liability approach in
accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income
tax assets and liabilities are established to reflect the
future tax consequences of carryforwards and differences
between the tax bases and financial bases of assets and
liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle determined as of January 1, 1992, increased net
income $17.9 million.

Opinion No. 11. The deferred tax benefit of $7.2 million

includes payments for the lease of a pipeline system owned by
an affiliate; payments to the lessor are based on the volume of
gas transported through the pipeline system less certain
operating expenses. Most long-term leases include renewal
options and, in certain leases, purchase options.

The Delhi Group leases the Shackelford gas gathering
system and an associated processing plant to a third party for
$.1 million per year. The leases continue until June 30, 1998,
and, if not terminated by either party, continue on a
year-to-year basis thereafter. The leased facilities had a net
book value of $4.1 million at December 31, 1993, which will be
fully depreciated by the end of the lease term.

16. SALES OF RECEIVABLES

Certain of the Delhi Group accounts receivables are sold in
combination with the Marathon Group receivables under a limited
recourse agreement. Payments are collected from the sold
accounts receivable; the collections are reinvested in new
accounts receivable for the buyers; and a yield, based on
short-term market rates, is transferred to the buyers.
Collections on sold accounts receivable will be forwarded to
the buyers at the end of the agreement in 1995, in the event of
earlier contract termination or if the Delhi Group does not
have a sufficient quantity of eligible accounts receivable to
reinvest in for the buyers. The balance of sold accounts
receivable averaged $69.1 million, $56.9 million and $55.4
million for the years 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. At
December 31, 1993, the balance of the Delhi Group's sold
accounts receivable that had not been collected was $73.6
million. A substantial portion of the Delhi Group's sales are
to local distribution companies and electric utilities. This
could impact the Delhi Group's overall exposure to credit risk
inasmuch as these customers could be affected by similar
economic or other conditions. The Delhi Group does not
generally require collateral for accounts receivable, but
significantly reduces credit risk through credit extension and
collection policies, which include analyzing the financial
condition of potential customers, establishing credit limits,
monitoring payments and aggressively pursuing delinquent
accounts. In the event of a change in control of USX, as
defined in the agreement, the Delhi Group may be required to
forward payments collected on sold Delhi Group accounts
receivable to the buyers.

federal income taxes with USX (Note 3, page D-9) and
allocation of corporate general and administrative costs
(Note 3, page D-8). Cash management reflected net
distributions to USX of $65.5 million and $141.9 million
in 1992, and 1991, respectively.

(b) Pursuant to the USX Certificate of Incorporation and the
capital structure of the Delhi Group determined by the
Board of Directors, the USX equity investment in the Delhi
Group was eliminated on October 2, 1992, in conjunction
with the attribution of the Delhi Group's portion of USX's
financial activities attributed to all groups (Note 3,
page D-8) and the USX common stockholders' equity value,
attributed to the 14,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock deemed
to represent 100% of the initial common stockholders'
equity in the Delhi Group.

18. DIVIDENDS

In accordance with the USX Certificate of Incorporation,
dividends on the Delhi Stock, Marathon Stock and Steel Stock
are limited to the legally available funds of USX. Net losses
of the Delhi Group, the Marathon Group or the U. S. Steel
Group, as well as dividends or distributions on any class of
USX common stock or series of Preferred Stock and repurchases
of any class of USX common stock or certain series of Preferred
Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally available for
payment of dividends on all classes of USX common stock.
Subject to this limitation, the Board of Directors intends to
declare and pay dividends on the Delhi Stock based on the
financial condition and results of operations of the Delhi
Group, although it has no obligation under Delaware Law to do
so. In making its dividend decisions with respect to Delhi
Stock, the Board of Directors considers among other things, the
long-term earnings and cash flow capabilities of the Delhi
Group as well as the dividend policies of similar publicly
traded companies.

Dividends on the Delhi Stock are further limited to the
Available Delhi Dividend Amount. At December 31, 1993, the
Available Delhi Dividend Amount was at least $125.2 million.
The Available Delhi Dividend Amount will be increased or
decreased, as appropriate, to reflect Delhi Net Income,
dividends, repurchases or issuances with respect to the Delhi
Stock and preferred stock attributed to the Delhi Group and
certain other items.

D-15
<PAGE> 125
19. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

The method of calculating net income (loss) per share for the
Delhi Stock, Marathon Stock and Steel Stock reflects the USX
Board of Director's intent that the separately reported
earnings and surplus of the Delhi Group, the Marathon Group and
the U. S. Steel Group, as determined consistent with the USX
Certificate of Incorporation, are available for payment of
dividends to the respective classes of stock, although legally
available funds and liquidation preferences of these classes of
stock do not necessarily correspond with these amounts.
Net income per share applicable to outstanding Delhi Stock
is presented for periods subsequent to the October 2, 1992,
initial issuance of Delhi Stock. (See Note 23, page D-18, for
pro forma income per common share.)
Primary net income per share is calculated by adjusting
net income for dividend requirements of preferred stock and
income applicable to the Retained Interest and is based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus
common stock equivalents, provided they are not antidilutive.
Common stock equivalents result from assumed exercise of stock
options and surrender of stock appreciation rights associated
with stock options, where applicable.
Fully diluted net income (loss) per share assumes exercise
of stock options and surrender of stock appreciation rights,
provided, in each case, the effect is not antidilutive.

20. STOCK PLANS AND STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN 

USX Stock Plans and Stockholder Rights Plan are discussed in
Note 20, page U-22, and Note 24, page U-24, respectively, to
the USX consolidated financial statements.

21. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein is not
necessarily representative of the amount that could be realized
or settled, nor does the fair value amount consider the tax
consequences of realization or settlement. As described in
Note 3, page D-8, the Delhi Group's specifically attributed
financial instruments and the Delhi Group's portion of USX's
financial instruments attributed to all groups are as follows:

.............................................................................................................
</TABLE>

Fair value of financial instruments classified as current
assets or liabilities approximate carrying value due to the
short-term maturity of the instruments. Fair value of long-term
receivables and other investments was based on discounted cash
flows or other specific instrument analysis. Fair value of
long-term debt instruments was based on market prices where
available or current borrowing rates available for financings
with similar terms and maturities.
The Delhi Group's unrecognized financial instruments
consist of accounts receivables sold subject to limited
recourse. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of
this form of financial instrument obligation. For details
relating to sales of receivables see Note 16, page D-14.

22. CONTINGENCIES

USX is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or
threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
relating to the Delhi Group involving a variety of matters,
including laws and regulations relating to the environment.
Certain of these matters are discussed below. The ultimate
resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the Delhi Group financial statements.
However, management believes that USX will remain a viable and
competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these
contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to the Delhi Group.

SWEPCO litigation --
On January 26, 1994, a settlement agreement was executed
between Delhi and Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO),
resolving litigation which began in 1991 related to a 15-year
natural gas purchase contract (original contract) which was due
to expire in April 1995. The settlement agreement provides that
SWEPCO pay Delhi the price under the original contract through
January 1994. This included the release of $2.9 million to
Delhi which was previously deposited by SWEPCO to the custody
of the court in 1993. Concurrent with execution of the
settlement agreement, Delhi executed a new four-year agreement
with SWEPCO enabling Delhi to supply increased volumes of gas
to two SWEPCO power plants in East Texas at market sensitive
prices and premiums commensurate with the level of service
provided. The agreement provides for swing service and does not
require any minimum gas purchase volumes.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS --
The Delhi Group is subject to federal, state and local
laws and regulations relating to the environment. These laws
generally provide for control of pollutants released into the
environment and require responsible parties to undertake
remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be
imposed for noncompliance. Expenditures for remediation and
penalties have not been material.
For a number of years, the Delhi Group has made capital
expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance with
various laws relating to the environment. In 1993 and 1992,
such capital expenditures totaled approximately $4.5 million
and $3.0 million, respectively. The Delhi Group anticipates
making additional such expenditures in the future; however, the
exact amounts and timing of such expenditures are uncertain
because of the continuing evolution of specific regulatory
requirements.

23. PRO FORMA INCOME PER COMMON SHARE (UNAUDITED)

Income per share data applicable to outstanding Delhi Stock is reported on a
pro forma basis for the years 1992 and 1991 to reflect the per share income as
if the capital structure of the Delhi Group was in effect beginning January 1,
1991. The capital structure of the Delhi Group as of June 30, 1992, was
determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to the USX Certificate of
Incorporation. Historical income before the cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle was adjusted for the attribution of certain corporate
activities (Note 3, page D-8). The pro forma data are not necessarily
indicative of the results that would have occurred if the capital structure of
the Delhi Group was in effect for the periods indicated.

</TABLE>

(a) The adjustment for net interest and other financial costs 
reflects the weighted average effects of all USX financial
activities assumed to be attributed to the Delhi Group for
the periods prior to October 2, 1992. The adjustment for 
the provision for estimated income taxes reflects the 
change in total income before taxes due to recognition of 
these adjustments. The adjustment to dividends on preferred
stock reflects the assumed effects of attributed preferred
stock. 

(b) Pro forma income applicable to Retained Interest represents
the pro forma income before the cumulative effect of the
change in accounting principle less dividends on preferred

THE DELHI GROUP
Management's Discussion and Analysis

The Delhi Group includes Delhi Gas Pipeline
Corporation ("DGP"), a wholly owned subsidiary of USX
Corporation ("USX"), and certain related companies which are
engaged in the purchasing, gathering, processing, transporting
and marketing of natural gas. Management's Discussion and
Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Delhi Group's
Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements. The
financial data presented for the periods prior to October 2,
1992, (with the exception of pro forma data) reflected the
combined historical financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the businesses of the Delhi Group.
Beginning October 2, 1992, the financial statements of the
Delhi Group include the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows for the businesses of the Delhi
Group and the effects of the capital structure of the Delhi
Group which includes a portion of the corporate assets and
liabilities and related transactions which are not separately
identified with the ongoing operations of USX.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME

The following table provides a summary of the Delhi 
Group's sales for each of the last three years:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
(millions) 1993 1992 1991 
....................................................................................................
<S> <C> <C> <C>
Gas Sales $447.9 $371.6 $346.4
Transportation 14.2 14.8 14.0

Total Systems 462.1 386.4 360.4
Gas Processing 72.6 70.4 61.1
Other .1 1.0 1.7
------ ------ ------
Total Sales $534.8 $457.8 $423.2
....................................................................................................
</TABLE>

TOTAL SALES in 1993 increased by 17% from 1992,
mainly due to increased revenues from premium services and
higher average natural gas sales prices. Total sales revenues
in 1992 increased by 8% from 1991 primarily due to higher
average natural gas sales prices, increased systems throughput
volumes and increased gas processing revenues.

OPERATING INCOME for the Delhi Group was $35.6
million in 1993, $32.6 million in 1992 and $31.0 million in
1991. Operating income in 1993 included favorable effects of
$1.8 million for the reversal of a prior-period accrual
related to a natural gas contract settlement, $0.8 million
related to gas imbalance settlements and a net $0.6 million
for a refund of prior years' taxes other than income taxes.
Operating income in 1992 included favorable effects totaling
$1.5 million relating to the settlement of various lawsuits
and third-party disputes. Excluding the effects of these
items, 1993 operating income improved by $1.3 million,
primarily as a result of higher gas sales margins and lower
operating and other expenses, partially offset by a 34%
decline in gas processing margins from the sale of natural gas
liquids ("NGLs"). Depreciation, depletion and amortization of
$36.3 million in 1993 declined from 1992 mainly due to certain
assets becoming fully depreciated during the prior year.

Operating income in 1991 included $8.0 million for
favorable settlements of certain contractual issues.
Excluding the effects of the settlements in 1992 and 1991,
operating income in 1992 improved by $8.1 million, primarily
due to increased NGLs volumes from gas processing, higher
natural gas systems throughput volumes and lower operating and
other expenses. These favorable items were partially offset by
lower unit margins for NGLs, reflecting lower NGLs prices and
higher feedstock costs. (See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Operations" below for a further discussion of
operating income.)

D-21

<PAGE> 131
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

OTHER INCOME of $5.2 million in 1993 included the
favorable pretax effect of a $0.9 million accrual reversal
recognizing the expiration of certain obligations related to a
prior asset acquisition, and a pretax gain of $2.9 million
from disposal of assets. The disposal of assets included
pretax gains of $0.8 million on the sale of nonstrategic gas
gathering systems in Colorado and $1.6 million on the sale of
the Delhi Group's interest in a natural gas transmission
partnership. The 1993 U.S. income tax provision included a
$2.9 million unfavorable tax effect associated with the sale
of the transmission partnership interest, which resulted in a
$1.3 million net loss on the transaction. Other loss in 1991
reflected an $18.7 million impairment of the Delhi Group's
interest in the previously mentioned transmission partnership.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS increased by $5.9
million in 1993 following a $4.0 million increase in 1992.
Interest and other financial costs of $10.5 million in 1993
included $7.7 million representing the Delhi Group's portion
of USX's financial activities attributable to all three groups
and $2.5 million related to the sale of the Delhi Group's
accounts receivables. Interest and other financial costs in
1992 included $2.3 million related to the sale of the Delhi
Group's accounts receivables, which began in December 1991,
and interest expense of $2.1 million representing the Delhi
Group's portion of USX's financial activities attributable to
all three groups for the period October 2, 1992, through
December 31, 1992.

THE PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES is based on
tax rates and amounts which recognize management's best
estimate of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
In addition to the previously mentioned $2.9 million
unfavorable tax effect associated with the sale of the Delhi
Group's interest in a natural gas transmission partnership,
the income tax provision for 1993 included a $4.1 million
charge associated with an increase in the federal income tax
rate from 34% to 35%, reflecting remeasurement of deferred
federal income tax liabilities as of January 1, 1993.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE
in 1992 reflected the $17.9 million favorable cumulative
noncash effect, measured as of January 1, 1992, of adopting
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109--Accounting
for Income Taxes ("SFAS No. 109"), which requires an asset and
liability approach for measuring deferred income taxes.

NET INCOME was $12.2 million in 1993, $36.5 million
in 1992 and $7.2 million in 1991. Excluding the cumulative
effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 109, net income decreased
by $6.4 million in 1993 following an increase of $11.4 million
in 1992 from 1991. Net income presented for 1991, and for the
portion of 1992 relating to the period prior to October 2,
1992, reflected the historical income for the businesses of
the Delhi Group. Net income for these periods does not reflect
interest costs and related income tax amounts of the Delhi
Group as it was capitalized in accordance with the USX
Certificate of Incorporation effective October 2, 1992.
However, pro forma income before the cumulative effect of the
change in accounting principle of $13.8 million in 1992 and
$1.0 million in 1991 are presented as if the capital structure
of the Delhi Group was in effect beginning January 1, 1991.
(See Note 23 to the Delhi Group Financial Statements.)

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

CURRENT ASSETS of $42.2 million at year-end 1993 were
$16.7 million higher than the year-end 1992 balance due
primarily to increases in receivables and in cash and cash
equivalents. The increase in receivables mainly reflected
increased natural gas sales in December 1993 as compared with
December 1992 and a delay in collection of amounts for gas
sold to Southwestern Electric Power Company ("SWEPCO"),
related to a natural gas contract dispute which was settled in
January 1994 (see Note 22 to the Delhi Group Financial
Statements, and Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Operations below). These items were partially offset by a
decline in NGLs sales in December 1993 as compared with
December 1992 and the sale of additional receivables of $3.5
million.

D-22

<PAGE> 132
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

CURRENT LIABILITIES were $102.4 million at year-end
1993, $7.3 million lower than at year-end 1992 due primarily
to lower accrued taxes reflecting higher estimated federal
income tax payments and a decline in the current portion of
USX's long-term debt attributed to the Delhi Group. These
items were partially offset by increased accounts payable
mainly resulting from higher gas purchase volumes and prices.

TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE at December
31, 1993 was $109.6 million. The $11.3 million increase from
year-end 1992 was primarily due to capital expenditures,
dividend payments and an increase in cash and cash equivalents
from year-end 1992, partially offset by cash provided from
operating activities and disposal of assets. The amount of
total long-term debt, as well as the amount shown as notes
payable, represented the Delhi Group's portion of USX debt
attributed to all three groups. Virtually all of the debt is a
direct obligation of, or is guaranteed by, USX.

DEFERRED CREDITS AND OTHER LIABILITIES declined to
$9.5 million at year-end 1993, primarily reflecting the
amortization of income from reservation fees related to
certain natural gas contracts and the previously mentioned
reversal of an accrual related to a prior asset acquisition.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY of $205.5 million at year-end
1993 increased $9.4 million from year-end 1992 mainly
reflecting the net income recorded during 1993, partially
offset by dividends paid.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS

NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES totaled
$33.2 million in 1993, down $42.6 million from 1992 primarily
reflecting the payment of income taxes (including settlements
with other groups) totaling $22.7 million in 1993 (of which
$8.5 million related to prior year federal taxes) versus $12.3
million in 1992, an increase in interest paid, a decline in
cash realized from the sale of receivables and the previously
mentioned delay in collection of receivables relating to a
natural gas contract dispute with SWEPCO. Cash provided from
operating activities in 1992 declined $40.4 million from 1991
due primarily to changes in cash realized from sold accounts
receivables.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES of $42.6 million in 1993
increased by 60% from 1992 following a 43% increase in 1992
from 1991. Expenditures were primarily for the expansion of
existing systems and the acquisition of pipeline systems
enabling the Delhi Group to connect additional new dedicated
natural gas reserves. Additions to the Delhi Group's dedicated
gas reserves totaled 382 billion cubic feet ("bcf"), 273 bcf
and 255 bcf in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Expenditures
in all three years included amounts for improvements and
upgrades to existing facilities. Expenditures in 1993 included
amounts for a multi-pipeline interconnection and compression
project in the Carthage area of East Texas, the acquisition
and connection of a 65-mile gas gathering system in West Texas
and the purchase, connection and upgrade of a 30 million cubic
feet per day cryogenic gas processing facility near existing
systems in South Texas.

Capital expenditures in 1994 are expected to exceed
1993 levels as the Delhi Group continues to pursue
opportunities to connect dedicated gas reserves by the
expansion or acquisition of gas gathering, processing and
transmission assets, including those made available as a
result of current industry conditions and regulatory
initiatives.

CASH GENERATED FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS in 1993 was
$4.2 million, an increase of $3.3 million from 1992 and $3.9
million from 1991. The increases primarily reflected proceeds
in 1993 from the sale of the Delhi Group's interest in a
natural gas transmission partnership and from the sale of
nonstrategic gas gathering systems in Colorado.

D-23

<PAGE> 133
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS increased $10.6 million in
1993, primarily reflecting the Delhi Group's net cash flows
from operating activities, investment activities and dividends
paid during the period. These obligations consist of the Delhi
Group's portion of USX debt attributed to all three groups.

TRANSACTIONS WITH USX THROUGH OCTOBER 2, 1992, which
impacted 1992 and 1991, reflected centrally managed cash
transactions prior to formation of the Delhi Group.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS of $1.9 million in 1993 included
the payment of four quarterly dividends compared with one
dividend payment in 1992, reflecting the formation of the
Delhi Group on October 2, 1992. The annualized rate of
dividends per share for the USX-Delhi Group Common Stock,
based on the most recently declared quarterly dividend, is
$.20.

In September 1993, Standard and Poor's Corporation 
("S&P")lowered its ratings on USX's and Marathon's senior debt 
to below investment grade (from BBB- to BB+) and on USX's 
subordinated debt, preferred stock and commercial paper. S&P
cited extremely aggressive financial leverage, burdensome
retiree medical liabilities and litigation contingencies. In
October 1993, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's")
confirmed its Baa3 investment grade ratings on USX's and
Marathon's senior debt. Moody's also confirmed its ratings
on USX's subordinated debt and commercial paper, but
lowered its ratings on USX's preferred stock from ba1 to
ba2. Moody's noted that the rating confirmation on USX debt
securities reflected confidence in the expected performance
of USX during the intermediate term, while the downward
revision of the preferred stock ratings incorporated a
narrow fixed charge coverage going forward. The downgrades
by S&P and the downgrade of ratings on preferred stock by
Moody's could increase USX's cost of capital. Any related
increase in interest costs would be reflected in the
consolidated financial statements and the financial
statements of each group.

USX anticipates that the Delhi Group will resume cash
funding of its pension plan in amounts approximating $0.1
million for the 1993 plan year and $1 million for the 1994
plan year, with the funding for both plan years impacting cash
flows in 1994.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES

The Delhi Group has incurred and will continue to
incur capital and operating and maintenance expenditures as a
result of environmental laws and regulations. To the extent
these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately
reflected in the prices of the Delhi Group's products and
services, operating results will be adversely affected. The
Delhi Group believes that substantially all of its competitors
are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations.
However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary
depending on a number of factors, including the age and
location of their operating facilities and their production
processes.

The Delhi Group's environmental expenditures for 1993
and 1992 are discussed below and have been estimated based on
American Petroleum Institute ("API") survey guidelines. These
guidelines are subject to differing interpretations which
could affect the comparability of such data. Some
environmental related expenditures, while benefiting the
environment, also enhance operating efficiencies.

The Delhi Group's total environmental expenditures in
1993 were $9.8 million compared with $7.9 million in 1992.
These amounts consisted of capital expenditures of $4.5
million in 1993 and $3.0 million in 1992 and estimated
compliance expenditures (including operating and maintenance)
of $5.3 million in 1993 and $4.9 million in 1992. Compliance
expenditures were broadly estimated based on API survey
guidelines and represented 1% of the Delhi Group's total
operating costs in both 1993 and 1992. Remediation related
expenditures were not material.

D-24

<PAGE> 134
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

New or expanded requirements for environmental
regulations, which could increase the Delhi Group's
environmental costs, may arise in the future. USX intends to
comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment,
but since many of them are not fixed or presently determinable
(even under existing legislation) and may be affected by
future legislation, it is not possible to accurately predict
the ultimate cost of compliance, including remediation costs
which may be incurred and penalties which may be imposed.
However, based on presently available information, and
existing laws and regulations as currently implemented,
management does not anticipate that environmental compliance
expenditures will materially increase in 1994. The Delhi
Group's capital expenditures for environmental controls are
expected to be approximately $5 million in 1994. Predictions
beyond 1994 can only be broad-based estimates which have
varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing
evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible
imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability
of new technologies, among other matters. Based upon currently
identified projects, the Delhi Group anticipates that
environmental capital expenditures in 1995 will remain at
about the same levels experienced in 1994; however, actual
expenditures may increase as additional projects are
identified or additional requirements are imposed.

USX is the subject of, or a party to, a number of
pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and
commitments relating to the Delhi Group involving a variety of
matters, including laws and regulations relating to the
environment, certain of which are discussed in Note 22 to the
Delhi Group Financial Statements. The ultimate resolution of
these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate,
be material to the Delhi Group financial statements. However,
management believes that USX will remain a viable and
competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these
contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to the Delhi
Group. (See USX Consolidated Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Cash Flows.)

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS

The Delhi Group's operating results are affected by
fluctuations in natural gas prices and demand levels in the
markets that it serves. Natural gas prices were volatile in
1993 causing disruption of the Delhi Group's short term
interruptible ("spot") market program and gas processing
business. In addition, NGLs prices, which tend to follow
fluctuations in crude oil prices, declined significantly in
the last half of 1993. The Delhi Group intends to remain
competitive in this market environment by maximizing gas sales
to higher margin customers and maximizing its total systems
throughput by supplementing higher margin sales with gas sales
to industrial end users, spot market sales and transportation
revenues.

The Delhi Group can also be affected by changes in
the regulatory environment governing its businesses and the
businesses of its competitors. In April 1992, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission issued Order No. 636, ("the
Order") which makes significant changes to the structure of
the services provided by interstate natural gas pipelines. The
changes are intended to ensure that interstate pipeline
companies provide transportation service that is equal in
quality for all gas supplies, whether the customer purchases
the gas from the pipeline or from another supplier. The Delhi
Group is primarily an intrastate gas gatherer (as opposed to
an interstate pipeline company) and does not face significant
transition costs as a result of the Order. The Delhi Group
believes that the Order will provide opportunities to offer
its merchant gas services to existing customers of interstate
pipelines who are seeking an alternative gas supply source.
However, as the Order is implemented, any additional Delhi
Group gas sales resulting from the Order will be subject to
negotiation with the individual customers. The Delhi Group
cannot accurately determine the financial effect of such
opportunities on future operating results.

The Delhi Group's four largest customers accounted
for 45% and 39% of its total gross margin and 18% and 14% of
its total systems throughput in 1993 and 1992, respectively.
In the event that one or more of the Delhi Group's largest
customers reduce volumes taken under an existing contract or
chooses not to renew such contract, the Delhi Group would be
adversely affected to the extent it is unable to find
alternative customers to buy gas at the same level of
profitability.

D-25

<PAGE> 135
Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

On January 26, 1994, a settlement agreement was
executed between DGP and SWEPCO, (one of the Delhi Group's
four largest customers) resolving litigation which began in
1991 related to a 15-year natural gas purchase contract
("original contract") which was due to expire in April 1995.
Sales under the original contract were at prices substantially
above spot prices and, as a result, this contract accounted
for more than 10% of Delhi's total gross margin in each of the
last three years. The settlement agreement provides that
SWEPCO will pay the Delhi Group the price under the original
contract through January 1994. Concurrent with the execution
of the settlement agreement, the Delhi Group executed a new
four-year agreement with SWEPCO enabling Delhi to supply
increased volumes of gas to two SWEPCO power plants in East
Texas at market sensitive prices and premiums commensurate
with the level of service provided. The agreement provides for
swing service and does not require any minimum gas purchase
volumes. The Delhi Group's operating income and cash flow
will be adversely affected by the amount of premiums lost
under the original contract for the period February 1, 1994,
through April 1, 1995. Broad estimates of the potential
premium losses are $18 million and $4 million in 1994 and
1995, respectively. SWEPCO has purchased gas under the new
agreement.

Operating income of $35.6 million in 1993 increased
by $3.0 million, or 9%, from 1992 following a $1.6 million, or
5%, increase in 1992 from 1991. The following is a discussion
of the Delhi Group's gross margin by principal service for
each of the last three years and an analysis of the reasons
for changes in such margins between years.

The gas sales margin and gas sales throughput for
each of the last three years were:

Excluding the effects of the contractual issues,
described under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Income
above, gas sales margin increased by 8% in 1993 and 7% in 1992
from the respective prior years. The improvement in 1993
mainly reflected increased sales to higher margin customers.
Margins on spot sales were affected by fluctuations in natural
gas prices throughout most of 1993 although overall average
prices increased in 1993 from the prior year. The successful
dedicated natural gas reserve addition programs in 1993 and
1992 contributed to the increases in both sales and
transportation volumes for those years by making more natural
gas available. Natural gas sales unit margins in 1992
benefitted from a favorable change in premium sales mix.
Average natural gas sales prices trended downward over most of
1991 and 1992, but stabilized in mid-1992 and increased during
the last several months of 1992 contributing to improved 1992
gas sales unit margins from the prior year. Gas sales margins
in 1994 will be affected by factors relating to the natural
gas contract settlement with SWEPCO described above.

The transportation margin and throughput for each of 
the last three years were:

Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

Transportation margins declined by 4% to $14.2
million in 1993, following a 6% increase in 1992 from 1991.
Average throughput volumes increased in 1993 and 1992 from the
respective prior year periods, while average transportation
rates trended downward over those periods. The rate decline in
1993 more than offset the favorable effect of the increase in
throughput volumes for that year. The changes in
transportation volumes and rates during the three-years
reflected a strategy of offering producers transportation rate
incentives in order to increase the Delhi Group's dedicated
natural gas reserve base and the supply of processable gas to
its plants. The aggregation of transportation and processing
services increased the Delhi Group's overall gross margin,
although the transportation rate was lower than the normal
rate charged for transportation as a separate service.

The gas processing margin, NGLs sales volume and 
NGLs sales price for each of the last three years were:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
1993 1992 1991
..............................................................................................................
<S> <C> <C> <C>
Gas processing margin (millions) $ 17.3 $ 26.1 $ 27.2
NGLs sales volume (millions of gallons) 282.0 261.4 214.7
NGLs sales price ($/Gallon) $ .26 $ .27 $ .28
..............................................................................................................
</TABLE>

The 34% decline in gas processing margins in 1993
resulted from higher average feedstock costs stemming from
increased average natural gas prices, primarily in the first
nine months of 1993, and lower NGLs prices which trended
downward with crude oil prices in the last half of 1993. NGLs
volumes for 1993 increased by 8% from the prior year as the
Delhi Group continued to add dedicated natural gas reserves,
with the associated gas processing rights, to its systems.
However, fourth quarter 1993 NGLs volumes declined by 17% from
the third quarter of 1993 as the Delhi Group chose not to
fully process some gas due to the decline in NGLs prices. The
Delhi Group will continue to monitor the economics of removing
NGLs from the gas stream for processing on an ongoing basis to
determine the appropriate level of each gas plant's operation.
The Delhi Group anticipates that margins for gas processing
will continue to be depressed in the first quarter of 1994.

The gas processing margin declined by 4% in 1992 from
1991 reflecting lower average NGLs sales prices and higher
feedstock costs. These factors were partially offset by a 22%
increase in NGLs sales volumes due in part to the previously
mentioned increase in systems throughput, which resulted in
increased availability of gas for processing.

Operating expenses of $28.0 million in 1993 declined
by $1.1 million from 1992 due mainly to cost control
procedures. Operating expenses of $29.1 million in 1992
declined by $1.9 million from 1991 primarily due to cost
control procedures implemented during the year and reduced
maintenance and repair costs.
