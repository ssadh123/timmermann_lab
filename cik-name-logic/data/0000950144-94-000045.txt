ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

Union Planters Corporation (the Corporation) has completed twelve
acquisitions through January 1, 1994, and has six probable acquisitions
pending. All of the acquisitions, except one, are individually insignificant
(do not exceed 10% of consolidated pre- tax earnings or total assets). With
the addition of the latest probable acquisitions, the Corporation's aggregate
insignificant acquisitions exceed 20% of the Corporation's total assets at
December 31, 1992. Accordingly, the Corporation is filing the December 31,
1992 audited financial statements and the most recent interim financial
statements for a substantial majority of the aggregate insignificant
acquisitions in accordance with Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X.

The following tables list the completed and probable acquisitions as of
January 1, 1994. Reference is made to the Corporation's 1992 Annual Report on
Form 10-K, September 30, 1993 Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K dated
September 27, 1993 and October 14, 1993 for additional information.

(a) The Corporation had previously acquired 17.93% of the common stock of
BOET ($3.4 million), and on January 1, 1993 purchased an additional
43.93% of the common stock of BOET in exchange for 331,741 shares of
the Corporation's Series E Preferred Stock ($11.1 million). Effective
May 3, 1993, the Corporation acquired the remaining outstanding common
stock of BOET for 317,045 shares of the Corporation's Series E
Preferred Stock ($10.8 million).

(b) The Corporation acquired Maryville, a mutual savings bank, which
pursuant to a conversion/acquisition converted to a federal stock
charter, all of the stock of which was acquired by the Corporation in
exchange for a capital contribution equalling approximately $14.1
million derived in part from the proceeds of an offering of the
Corporation's Common Stock made in connection with the
conversion/acquisition.

(c) The recording of the acquisition of Maryville using the purchase
method of accounting resulted in negative goodwill of approximately
$9.4 million, $8.1 million of which was deducted from noncurrent,
nonmonetary assets (premises and equipment, fair value adjustment of
loans, prepaid software and mortgage servicing rights). The remaining
negative goodwill of $1.3 million was recorded in other liabilities
and is being amortized over 7 years.

TENNESSEE BANCORP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 1993

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of Tennessee Bancorp, Inc. conform to
generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices in the
banking industry. The significant policies are summarized as follows:

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements present the accounts of
Tennessee Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Tennessee National
Bank. In the opinion of management, such financial statements reflect all
adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature and necessary to present a
fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. Certain financial
information which is normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but which is not
required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1992. The statements also present
the accounts of Tennessee National Bank's wholly owned subsidiary, Columbia
Service Corporation. Material intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations for the interim periods
presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to
be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1993.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and interest-bearing deposits with an
original maturity of three months or less.

INVESTMENTS

Investments are stated at cost, adjusted for discounts and premiums which are
amortized to interest income using the level-interest- yield method over the
life of the investment. Mortgage-backed securities, which are included in
investment securities, represent participating interests in pools of long-term
first mortgage loans originated and serviced by the issuers of the securities.
Mortgage-backed securities are carried at unpaid principal balances, adjusted
for unamortized premiums and unearned discounts. Premiums and discounts on
mortgage-backed securities are amortized using the level-interest-yield method
over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated
prepayments.

<PAGE> 6
TENNESSEE BANCORP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
SEPTEMBER 30, 1993

Investments are carried at amortized cost as it is management's intent and
ability to hold them for investment purposes.

Gains and losses on the sale of investments are recognized upon realization and
determined using the specific identification method.

LOANS RECEIVABLE

Loans receivable are stated at the amount of unpaid principal balances, less
unearned discounts, net deferred loan origination fees and allowance for loan
loss. Consumer loan discounts are recognized over the life of the loan using
methods which approximate the level-interest-yield method.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

The allowance for loan losses is established by charges to operations based on
management's evaluation of the assets, economic conditions and other factors
considered necessary to maintain the allowance at an adequate level.

Loans are charged to the allowance account in the period a loss actually occurs
or when a determination is made that a loss is likely to occur. Recoveries on
loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance account in the
period received. Throughout the year, management estimates the likely level of
future losses to determine whether the allowance for loan losses is adequate to
absorb reasonable anticipated losses. Such estimates involve significant
judgments made by management and actual losses could differ significantly. It
is the judgment of management that the allowance for loan losses reflected in
the consolidated balance sheet is adequate to absorb losses which may exist in
the current portfolio.

LOAN ORIGINATION AND COMMITMENT FEES

Loan origination fees and related direct costs are deferred and recognized as
an adjustment of yield on the interest method.

BANK PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets as follows: buildings, 31 years; furniture and
fixtures, three to ten years; and automobiles, two years.

REAL ESTATE OWNED

Real estate properties acquired through loan foreclosure, which are included in
other assets, are initially recorded at the lower of the related loan balance
(less any specific allowance for loss), or the value at the date of
foreclosure. Costs related to holding property are expensed as incurred.
Total real estate owned was $23,000 at September 30, 1993 and none outstanding
at December 31, 1992.

Valuations are periodically performed by management and the carrying value of
the property is adjusted as deemed necessary.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Deposit base intangibles identified in acquisition transactions are amortized
over the estimated remaining lives of the deposits. Total amortization expense
charged to operations amounts to $66,000 for the periods ending September 30,
1993 and 1992.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

shares outstanding during the period.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been restated to
conform to the current year presentation.

2. SUPPLEMENTARY CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Interest paid on deposits and other borrowings during the periods ending
September 30, 1993 and 1992 amounted to $2,549,000 and $3,480,000,
respectively. Income taxes paid during the period ending September 30, 1993
and 1992 amounted to $635,000 and $30,000, respectively.

3. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, the Bank makes various commitments to extend
credit which are credit risks that are not reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. Commitments to extend credit are agreements
to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition
established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates
or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of
these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

These commitments include various commitments to extend credit and letters of
credit. At September 30, 1993, commitments to extend credit of $1,754,000 and
letters of credit of $2,500 were outstanding. The Bank does not anticipate any
losses as a result of these commitments.

Additionally, the Bank had undistributed loan commitments of approximately
$1,207,000 at September 30, 1993.

4. INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Bank adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," (FAS 109). Adoption of FAS
109 was not material to the Bank's financial statements and had no effect on
the effective tax rate for the first three quarters of 1993.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and the liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) any
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets (liabilities)
at December 31, 1992, are comprised of the following:

Depreciation and amortization $ (27,078)
Reserve for loan losses (116,416)
Federal Home Loan Bank stock dividends (102,476)
Deferred loan fees 62,757 
----------

Net deferred tax liability $(183,213)
==========

No valuation allowance relative to deferred tax assets was required as of
December 31, 1992 or September 30, 1993. The above net

deferred tax liability is included in accrued interest and other liabilities on
the accompanying balance sheet.

5. PENDING MERGER

On September 30, 1993, the Registrant and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Tennessee National Bank (Bank) entered into a definitive agreement with Union
Planters Corporation providing for the merger of the Bank into Union Planters
National Bank. The process of obtaining regulatory and stockholder approval
has begun.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

FIRST NATIONAL BANCORP OF SHELBYVILLE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

September 30, 1993

========================================================================

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. The foregoing financial statements
are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, all adjustments,
including normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of
the consolidated financial statements have been included. The accounting
policies followed by First National Bancorp of Shelbyville, Inc. and its
subsidiaries for interim financial reporting are consistent with the accounting
policies followed for annual financial reporting, except as noted below. The
notes included herein should be read in conjunction with the notes to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1992.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
have been omitted in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Bancorp adopted Statement on Financial
Accounting Standards Number 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (FASB 109) which
superseded Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (APB 11) which is currently used by the Bancorp. Adoption of FASB 109
resulted in the Bancorp recording previously unrecognized tax benefits totaling
approximately $1,280,000 as of January 1, 1993. As of January 1, 1993, the
gross deferred tax asset was $1,446,000 comprised primarily of the allowance
for loan losses and the gross deferred tax liability was $155,000.

NOTE 2 - PROPOSED MERGER

The Bancorp executed a merger agreement in September 1993 with Union Planters
Corporation. Consummation of the merger is dependent upon the approval of the
shareholders and various regulatory agencies.

Note 9 - CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

A number of legal proceedings exist in which the Company and/or its
subsidiaries are either plaintiffs or defendants or both. Most of the lawsuits
where the Company is plaintiff involve loan foreclosure activities. The
Peoples Bank of Elk Valley is defendant in suits claiming misrepresentations
and errors arising out of execution of loans. No estimate of eventual outcome
is currently determinable. Management and outside legal counsel believe that
the Corporation has strong defenses against the claims and intends to
vigorously defend the suits. No provision has been made in the financial
statements for any adverse results as there is no material adverse effect
expected.

Stock Option Agreements

The Company's newly acquired subsidiary, First Citizens Bank, has two stock
option agreements with key employees. Under the agreements, 26,500 shares of
common stock of First Citizens Bank were reserved for issuance upon exercise of
the options. The agreements provide that the option price will be $7.00 per
share. Neither agreement has been exercised to date. The options expire July
30, 1997.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 1992

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of Clin-Ark Bankshares,
Inc. ("the Corporation") conform with generally accepted accounting
principles and practices within the banking industry. The policies
that materially affect financial position and the results of
operations are summarized as follows:

a. Basis of presentation - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Corporation, its wholly owned
subsidiary First National Bank of Clinton and its majority
owned subsidiary, First North Central Insurance, Inc. All
material intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

b. Investment securities - Investment securities are stated at
cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts computed on the interest method. Although the
quoted market values fluctuate, investment securities are held
for investment purposes and gains and losses are recognized in
the accounts upon realization or at such time that management
determines that a permanent decline in value exists. The
adjusted cost of the specific security is used to compute the
gain or loss on sales of investment securities.

c. Loans - Interest on loans is credited to income based upon the
principal amount outstanding.

d. Reserve for loan losses - For financial reporting purposes,
the reserve for loan losses is established through a provision
for loan losses charged to expense. Loans are charged against
the reserve for loan losses when management believes that the
collectibility of the principal is unlikely. The reserve is
an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb
possible losses on existing loans that may become
uncollectible, based on evaluations of the collectibility of
loans and prior loan loss experience. The evaluations take
into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and
volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality,
review of specific problem loans, and current economic
conditions that may affect the borrowers' ability to pay.
Accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management
believes, after considering economic and business conditions
and collection efforts, that the borrowers' financial
condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful.
For income tax purposes, loans are charged to expense when
management believes that the collectibility of the principal
is unlikely.

e. Premises and equipment - Premises and equipment are stated at
cost, less accumulated depreciation.

For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is
charged to operating expenses over the estimated useful lives
of the assets and is computed on the straight-line method. For

7
<PAGE> 10
CLIN-ARK BANKSHARES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 1992

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)

income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the
methods prescribed under the applicable tax laws.

f. Income taxes - The Corporation utilizes the liability method
of accounting for deferred income taxes. The liability method
provides for a deferred tax liability (benefit) on the balance
sheet for the temporary differences between financial
statement and tax return income at the tax rates which are in
effect at the date of the financial statements.

g. Real estate acquired through foreclosure - Real estate
acquired through foreclosure is reported at the lower of cost
or estimated realizable value. During 1992, the Corporation
acquired $125,000 of other real estate as a result of
foreclosing on past due loans. At December 31, 1992,
approximately $4,000 of other real estate is included in other
assets.

h. Cash and cash equivalents - For purposes of reporting cash
flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and
amounts due from banks.

i. Earnings per common share - Primary earnings per share are
computed based on the weighted average number of shares that
would be outstanding plus the shares that would be outstanding
assuming exercise of dilutive stock options which are
considered to be common stock equivalents. The number of
shares that would be issued from the exercise of stock options

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 -
Accounting for Income Taxes. This statement provides for, among other
things, the recognition of a deferred tax liability or asset for the
estimated tax effect attributable to temporary differences and
carryforwards. The valuation of deferred tax assets is reduced, if
necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to
be realized. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1992 although earlier application is allowed. As
of December 31, 1992, the Corporation has not implemented this
statement. Although the estimated benefit has not been quantified,
management believes that the adoption of this statement will have a
favorable impact on the Corporation's financial position.

8. Noncompensating Stock Option Agreements

On January 13, 1988, the Corporation granted a director and
officer of the Corporation an option to purchase 3,000 shares of the
Corporation's common stock at a purchase price of $25.00 per share.
The term of the option was for a period of five years from the date of
the grant. On March 26, 1990, an additional option was granted to the
director to purchase up to an additional 2,500 shares of common stock
at a purchase price of $45.00 per share. The term of this option was
also for a period of five years from the date of the grant.

As of December 31, 1992, neither of the above noted option
agreements had been exercised.

In January, 1993, the director exercised the option to
purchase 3,000 shares of the Corporations common stock at a purchase
price of $25.00 per share.

9. Commitments and Contingencies

The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with
off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the
financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to
fluctuation in interest rates. These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and interest
rate caps and floors written.

The Corporation's exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for
commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual
notional amount of those instruments. The Corporation has the same
credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as
it does for on-balance sheet instruments. For interest rate caps and
floors, the contract or notional amounts do not represent exposure to
credit loss.

Financial instruments, whose contract amount represents credit
risk, consist of commitments to extend credit of approximately
$1,650,000 at December 31, 1992.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a
customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established
in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or
other termination clauses and may require repayment of a fee. Since
these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total
commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. The Corporation evaluates each customer's credit
worthiness on a case- by-case basis. The amount of collateral
obtained, if deemed necessary by the Corporation upon extension of
credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterpart.
Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory,
property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial
properties.

9. Commitments and Contingencies (cont.)

The Corporation grants agribusiness, commercial, mortgage and
consumer loans to customers within its lending region. The
Corporation maintains a loan portfolio with a high concentration of
real estate mortgage loans.

10. Related Party Transactions

Directors, officers and employees were customers of, and had
other transactions with, the Corporation's subsidiaries in the
ordinary course of business. Loan transactions with directors,
officers and employees were made on substantially the same terms as
those prevailing, at the time made, for comparable loans to other
persons and did not involve more than normal risk of collectibility or
present other unfavorable features. Loans to these related parties
amounted to approximately $1,231,000 at December 31, 1992.

11. Employee Benefit Plan

The Corporation offers a profit sharing plan for all eligible
employees. Employer contributions are based upon amounts determined
at the sole discretion of the board of directors. Employees are not
required or permitted to make contributions under the plan. Expenses
relating to Corporation contributions to the plan were approximately
$33,500 during the year ended December 31, 1992.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER 30, 1993 AND 1992

1. Basis of Presentation

The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion
of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements reflect all
adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to
summarize fairly the financial position of Clin-Ark Bankshares, Inc.
("the Corporation") as of September 30, 1993 and the results of its
operations and changes in its cash flows for the nine months ended
September 30, 1993 and September 30, 1992. The accounting policies
followed by the Corporation for interim financial reporting are consistent
with the accounting policies followed for annual financial reporting,
except as noted below. These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the corporation's 1992 annual financial statements and
related notes included therein.

Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been omitted in accordance with the rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Effective March 31, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes
("FASB 109") which supercedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 96, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (FASB 96) which is currently used by
the Corporation. Adoption of FASB 109 resulted in the Corporation
recording previously unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately
$87,000. The previously unrecognized tax benefit of $87,000 was
attributable to cumulative differences which existed between reported book
and tax income. The realization of this benefit is dependent on the
Corporation having future taxable income. The disclosures required by
FASB 109 are substantially similar to those previously disclosed under
FASB 96.

2. Dividends

During the nine month period ended September 30, 1993,
dividends of $.72 per share per quarter were declared and paid for the
second and third quarters of 1993.

3. Pending Merger

In April, 1993, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved an
agreement to merge with another bank holding company whereby the two
parties intend to effectuate the merger of the Corporation with and into
the other bank holding company. The merger, which is to be accounted for
as a pooling of interests, is dependent upon the approval of the
stockholders of the Corporation and various regulatory agencies.

Bancshares, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 1992.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Liberty Bancshares,
Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period
ended December 31, 1992, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

LIBERTY BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Liberty Bancshares, Inc. was organized in July 1991, for
the purpose of becoming a holding company for Liberty
Federal Savings Bank (the "Bank") as part of the Bank's
conversion from a mutual to a stock institution. The
Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank. The
following is a description of the more significant
accounting policies that Liberty Bancshares, Inc. and
subsidiary (the "Company") follow in presenting their
consolidated financial statements.

(A) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
for 1992 and 1991 include the accounts of Liberty
Bancshares, Inc. and Liberty Federal Savings Bank,
its wholly-owned subsidiary. The accounts of the
Bank include Northwest Tennessee Service
Corporation, the Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary.
The consolidated financial statements for periods
prior to 1991 include only the accounts of the Bank
and its subsidiary, as the holding company was not
formed until 1991. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated in
consolidation.

(B) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents includes cash, interest-bearing deposits
in other banks, and federal funds sold. Generally
federal funds are sold for one-day periods and
certificates of deposit, included in
interest-bearing deposits in other banks, have
original maturities of three months or less at date
of purchase.

The Company clears items to and from other banks
with the Federal Reserve Bank and therefore the
Federal Reserve requires the Company to maintain an
average balance of $100,000 in an account at the
Federal Reserve Bank at December 31, 1992 and 1991.

(C) SECURITIES

Securities are classified as investment securities
or securities available for sale and primarily
consist of U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of
U.S. Government agencies and mortgage-backed
securities. Mortgage-backed securities are
comprised substantially of participating interests
in pools of long-term first mortgage loans
originated and serviced by the issuers of the
securities.

Management determines the appropriate classification
of securities at the time of purchase and
periodically reviews the classification of
securities within its portfolio to ensure the
appropriate classification. If management has the
intent and the Company has the ability at the time
of purchase to hold securities until maturity or on
a long-term basis, they are classified as
investments and carried at amortized historical
cost. Mortgage-backed securities held for
investment are carried at unpaid principal balances,
adjusted for unamortized premiums and unearned
discounts. Securities to be held for

(CONTINUED)
<PAGE> 10
LIBERTY BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991

indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held
to maturity or on a long-term basis are classified as
available for sale and carried at the lower of
aggregate cost or market. Securities held for
indefinite periods of time include securities that
management intends to use as part of its
asset/liability management strategy and that may be
sold in response to changes in interest rates,
resultant prepayment risk and other factors related to
interest rate and resultant prepayment risk changes.

Premiums and discounts are amortized using the
interest method over the remaining period to
contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated
prepayments. Gains and losses on the sale of
securities available for sale are determined using the
specific identification method and are included in
other operating income, including adjustments to lower
of aggregate cost or market.

(D) LOANS RECEIVABLE

Loans receivable are recorded at the unpaid principal
balance owed by borrowers less deferrals, unearned
interest, the allowance for loan losses and purchase
discounts. Discounts and premiums on first mortgage
loans are accreted to interest income using the
interest method over the remaining period to
contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated
prepayments. Unearned income on consumer loans is
recognized over the lives of the loans using methods
that approximate the interest method.

The allowance for loan losses is based upon analyses
of the loans receivable portfolio and is maintained at
a level considered adequate by management to provide
for probable loan losses. The analyses include
management's consideration of such factors as economic
conditions, loan portfolio characteristics, prior loan
loss experiences, and results of reviews of the
portfolio. The allowance is increased by provisions
charged against income and reduced by net charge-offs.
While management believes it has established the
allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and has taken into
account the views of its regulators and the current
economic environment, there can be no assurance that
in the future the Company's regulators or its economic
environment will not require further increases in the
allowance.

The Company establishes an allowance for uncollectible
interest income for any loan on which collection is
considered doubtful. For mortgage loans greater than
90 days past due, the Company establishes an allowance
for uncollectible interest for any loan in which the
total of the principal balance outstanding, and any
accrued interest related thereto, is greater than 90%
of the appraised value of the underlying collateral.
The recorded investment is then monitored and
additional allowances established as warranted.
Mortgage loans on multi-family and industrial
properties are generally placed on nonaccrual status
when the Company becomes aware that the borrower has
entered bankruptcy proceedings or when they are past
due 90 days as to either principal or interest or when
payment in full of principal or interest is not
expected. The allowance is established by a charge to
interest income equal to all interest previously
accrued. For all other loans, the Company generally
accrues interest on loans past due more than 90 days
without establishing an allowance for uncollectible
interest when management concludes such action is
warranted, such as in the event the loan is
exceptionally well collateralized or the borrower
establishes the temporary nature of the delinquency.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991

(E) LOANS AVAILABLE FOR SALE

Mortgage loans originated and available for sale are
carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated
market value. Market value is based on investor
commitments, or in the absence of such commitments, on
current investor yield requirements. Net unrealized
losses are recognized in a valuation allowance by
charges to earnings.

As part of this activity, the Company originates and
sells loans with servicing retained. Mortgage loans
serviced for others are not included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
amount of loans serviced for others is outlined in
note 3. The Company receives normal servicing fees
and servicing costs are charged to expense as
incurred.

(F) LOAN ORIGINATION AND COMMITMENT FEES AND RELATED COSTS

Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs
are deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized in
income using the interest method over the contractual
lives of the loans, adjusted for estimated prepayments
based on the Company's historical prepayment
experience. Commitment fees and costs relating to
commitments whose likelihood of exercise is remote are
recognized over the commitment period on a straight-
line basis. If the commitment is subsequently
exercised during the commitment period, the remaining
unamortized commitment fee at the time of exercise is
recognized over the life of the loan as an adjustment
of yield.

(G) REAL ESTATE OWNED

Real estate properties acquired through loan
foreclosure and loans in substance foreclosed are
initially recorded at the lower of the related loan
balance, less any specific allowance for loss, or
estimated fair value at the date of foreclosure.
Costs relating to development and improvement of
property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to
holding property are expensed. In substance
foreclosed properties are those properties where the
borrower retains title but has little or no remaining
equity in the property considering its fair value;
where repayment can only be expected to come from the
operation or sale of the property; and where the
borrower has effectively abandoned control of the
property or it is doubtful that the borrower will be
able to rebuild equity in the property. Property
acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure results when a
borrower voluntarily transfers title to the Company in
full settlement of the related debt in an attempt to
avoid foreclosure. Real estate acquired in settlement
of loans is carried at the lower of cost or fair
value.

Valuations are periodically performed by management
and an allowance for losses is established by a charge
to operations if the carrying value of a property
exceeds its estimated fair value.

(H) INCOME TAXES

Deferred income taxes are recognized for income and
expense items that are reported in different years for
financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes
using the tax rate applicable to the year of the
calculation.

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires a change from
the deferred method to the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized
for the tax consequences of "temporary differences" by
applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of
existing assets and liabilities. Under SFAS No. 109,
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date. The Company will adopt SFAS No.
109 in the first quarter of 1993. Upon adoption, the
principles of this statement may be applied
retroactively through restatement of previously issued
statements, or on a prospective basis through a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
It is estimated that adoption of SFAS No. 109 will
result in an incremental increase in the net deferred
tax asset of approximately $100,000 to $150,000,
subject to any valuation allowance, the precise amount
of which has not been determined. It is expected that
this amount will be reported separately as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year
ending December 31, 1993.

(I) PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Premises and equipment are carried at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. These
assets are depreciated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets for
assets acquired prior to January 1, 1981. Premises
and equipment acquired on or after January 1, 1981 are
depreciated using accelerated methods under the
guidelines of the Internal Revenue Service. The
difference between depreciation calculated using the
accelerated method and that under generally accepted
accounting principles is insignificant.

(J) PREMIUM ON DEPOSITS

Premium on deposits relates to the premium paid on an
acquisition of a branch from another financial
institution. This premium is being amortized to
expense over eight years, the estimated life of the
deposits acquired.

(K) ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES

Effective for 1992 SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires the
Company to disclose the estimated fair value of its
financial instruments. Estimates of the fair value of
financial instruments are presented within the notes
to the consolidated financial statements. Fair value
estimates are made at a point in time, based on
relevant market information and information about the
financial instrument. Accordingly, such estimates
involve uncertainties and matters of judgment and
therefore cannot be determined with precision. The
more significant assumptions used in preparing the
Company's fair value estimates are set forth below.

For cash and due from banks and Federal funds sold,
fair value is estimated to approximate the carrying
amount because they mature within 90 days or less and
do not present unanticipated credit concerns. For
securities, fair values are based on quoted market
prices or dealer quotes, if available; if a quoted
market price is not available, fair value is estimated
using quoted market prices for similar securities.
For most loans, fair value is estimated by discounting
estimated future cash flows using the current rates at
which similar loans would be made to borrowers with
similar credit risk and for similar remaining
maturities. For certain homogeneous categories of
loans, such as residential mortgages, fair value is
estimated using quoted market prices for securities
backed by similar loans, adjusted for differences in
loan characteristics.

Under SFAS No. 107, the fair value of deposits with no
stated maturity, such as demand deposits, NOW
accounts, money market accounts, and regular savings
accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand at
the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of
deposit and other fixed maturity time deposits is
estimated using the rates currently offered for
deposits of similar remaining maturities.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes
loans to directors and executive officers and their
related interests. Such loans were made on substantially
the same terms, including interest and collateral, as
those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions
with other borrowers and did not involve more than the
normal risk of collectibility or present other
unfavorable features. Loans to directors and executive
officers and their related interests are as follows:

Balance at December 31, 1991 $ 1,030,751

(4) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

The Company is a party to financial instruments with
off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business
to meet the financing needs of its customers and to
reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates. These financial instruments include commitments
to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and
financial guarantees. Those instruments involve, to
varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate
risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
consolidated balance sheets. The contract or notional
amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of
involvement the Company has in particular classes of
financial instruments.

The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to the financial
instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby
letters of credit and financial guarantees written is
represented by the contractual notional amount of those
instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies
in making these commitments and conditional obligations
as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.

Available home equity lines of credit were approximately
$2,536,000 at December 31, 1992 and $1,822,000 at
December 31, 1991, with the majority having terms of
fifteen years. At December 31, 1992, outstanding letters
of credit balances were $121,000. Commitments to
originate or purchase loans were $2,483,916 and
$1,170,801 at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
The commitments to originate loans at December 31, 1992,
were composed of variable rate loans of $868,993 and
fixed rate loans of $1,614,923. The fixed rate loans had
interest rates ranging from 7.00% to 8.50%. There were
commitments to sell loans at December 31, 1992 of
$1,334,243 and $53,500 at December 31, 1991.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a
customer as long as there is no violation of any
condition established in the contract. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
Since many of the commitments are expected to expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The Company evaluates each customer's credit worthiness 
on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral
obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension
of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of
the borrower. Collateral held varies but may include
property, plant, and equipment and income-producing
commercial properties.

(5) SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Substantially all of the Company's business activity is
with customers located within the state of Tennessee. A
majority of the loans are secured by residential or
commercial real estate or other personal property. The
loans are expected to be repaid from cash flow or
proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the
borrowers. The Company grants residential, consumer, and
commercial loans to customers throughout the state of
Tennessee.

</TABLE>
At December 31, 1990, the Company's participating
interest in a restructured loan totaling $2,701,530 was
in- substance foreclosed and was classified as real
estate owned. Gross interest income, which would have
been recorded under the original terms of the loan, was
approximately $347,000 for the year ended December 31,
1990. Gross interest income, which would have been
recorded under the restructured terms, was approximately
$243,000 for the same period. Interest included in
income during the year ended December 31, 1990, was
approximately $182,000.

During March 1991, the lenders began foreclosure
proceedings on the property securing the loan, but the
borrowers filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings which
stayed the foreclosure. On June 5, 1991, the borrowers
sold the underlying collateral to an independent party.
proceeds of the sale were used to repay the existing loan
with no loss to the Company. The Company and the other
participating lender made a new loan, which was at a
lesser amount than the previous loan, to the new owners
to finance the sale of the property. The proceeds from
the sale of the property paid substantially all of the
interest which would have been paid had the loan been
performing throughout the years ended December 31, 1991
and 1990.

(12) PENSION PLAN

A trusteed noncontributory pension plan is in effect with
the Financial Institutions Retirement Fund for
substantially all Company employees who have been
employed one year or more and have attained age 21.
There was no pension expense related to this plan during
the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990. All
contributions to the fund are commingled with other
employers' contributions and all assets of the fund are
invested on a pooled basis, without allocation to
individual employers or employees. The latest available
computation by an independent actuary indicates that the
value of the assets in the pension fund exceeds the
vested benefits.

(13) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

On December 17, 1991, Liberty Federal Savings Bank
converted from a mutual to a stock form of ownership and
was acquired by Liberty Bancshares, Inc. At the time of
the Bank's conversion, eligible deposit account holders
in the Bank were granted priority in the event of future
liquidation by the establishment of a liquidation account
equal to retained earnings as of December 31, 1990. In
the event of future liquidation, and only in such event,
an eligible deposit account holder who continues to
maintain his deposit account shall be entitled to receive
a distribution from the liquidation account, in the
proportionate amount of the then current adjusted balance
from deposit accounts then held before any liquidations
may be made with respect to capital stock.

The Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on or
repurchase any of its stock if the effect would be to
reduce retained earnings of the Bank below either the
amount of the liquidation account or capital
requirements of the OTS. Federal regulations adopted by
the OTS impose certain limitations on the payment of
dividends and other capital distributions, including
stock repurchases, by the Bank. OTS regulations utilize
a tiered approach which permits various levels of
distributions based primarily upon an institution's
capital level. Based upon current OTS regulations and
its capital structure at December 31, 1992, the Bank may
make, without prior OTS approval, capital distributions
during a year in an amount which is the greater of (i) up
to 100% of its net earnings to date during the year

plus an amount equal to one-half of the amount by which
its total capital-to-assets ratio exceeded its fully
phased-in capital-to-assets ratio at the beginning of the
year or, (ii) 75% of its net income over the most recent
four quarter period. Capital distributions by the Bank
are further subject to 30-day advance written notice to
the OTS.

(14) CONVERSION TO STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

The sale of 634,215 shares of $1.00 par value common
stock by the Company was consummated in 1991 pursuant to
a plan of conversion of the Bank from a
Federally-chartered mutual savings bank to a
Federally-chartered stock savings bank previously
approved by the members of the Bank. From the proceeds,
$634,215 was allocated to common stock and $5,076,846,
which is net of conversion costs of $631,088, was
allocated to additional paid-in capital.

Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 1991,
was based upon the number of shares issued at conversion
and the earnings for the period from the date of
conversion, December 17, 1991, to December 31, 1991.
Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 1992,
were based upon the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period, 634,215, and the earnings
for the year ended December 31, 1992.

The Company's charter authorizes 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock of the Company, of $1.00 par value. The
consideration for the issuance of the shares shall be
paid in full before their issuance and shall not be less
than the par value. The consideration for the shares,
other than cash, shall be determined by the Board of
Directors in accordance with the provisions of the
Tennessee Business Corporation Act. The preferred stock,
and any series of preferred stock, may be redeemable or
convertible. Prior to the issuance of any preferred
stock, and any series of preferred stock, as established
by the Board of Directors, the Company shall file the
articles of amendment to the Company charter with the
Tennessee Secretary of State establishing and designating
the series and fixing and determining the relative rights
and preferences thereof. The Company's charter expressly
vests in the Board of Directors of the Company the
authority to issue the preferred stock in one or more
series and to determine, to the extent permitted by law
prior to the issuance of the preferred stock (or any
series of the preferred stock), the relative rights,
limitations, and preferences of the preferred stock or
any such series.

The purposes for which the Board of Directors of the
Company might issue preferred stock include, among
others, acquisitions and capital formation. In addition,
the issuance of the shares of the preferred stock under
certain circumstances could discourage, or make more
difficult, an attempt to gain control of the Company.

The mere authorization of the preferred stock by itself
does not have any effect upon the rights of present
holders of the Company's common stock. Nevertheless,
future issuances of preferred stock, which the Board of
Directors of the Company could make without stockholder
approval, in all likelihood would impact upon the rights
of the holders of the Company's common stock. Holders of
shares of preferred stock generally are entitled to
receive specified dividends prior to payment of dividends
on shares of common stock and may have voting rights that
are separate from or in conjunction with holders of the
Company's common stock.

(15) EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

In conjunction with the conversion, the Company
established a stock option plan under which a total of
63,421 common shares were reserved for options. The
plan establishes the exercise price of the options at
least equal to the market value of the Company's common
stock on the date of grant. At December 31, 1992 and
1991, a total of 50,740 shares were granted under the
stock option plan. No options were exercised during the
years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991.

Also, in conjunction with converting to a stock ownership
form, the Company established an Employee Stock Ownership
Plan (ESOP), under which the Company will make annual
contributions to a trust for the benefit of eligible
employees. To be eligible, an employee must be 21 years
of age and have completed at least one year of service.
The contributions may be in the form of cash, other
property, or common shares. The plan is noncontributory
and there is no past service liability. The amount of
the annual contribution is at the discretion of the Board
of Directors of the Company. Initially, the ESOP
acquired 63,429 shares of common stock financed by
$634,290 in borrowings by the ESOP. The Board of
Directors intends to contribute to the Plan annually at
least an amount equal to the required principal and
interest payments related to the ESOP loan. The ESOP
loan is payable in quarterly principal and interest
installments beginning March 17, 1992, and maturing
December 17, 2001. Interest accrues at the base rate
charged by the lender. Dividends received on shares held
by the ESOP are used to service a portion of the
principal and interest payments on the borrowing. During
1992, dividends used for debt service totaled $19,029.
The Company contributed $181,272 in 1992 for additional
debt service. Benefit expense is recognized based on the
shares allocated method. This method requires that the
percentage of shares allocated for the period to total
shares purchased be applied to the original principal
balance to calculate the benefit expense which equaled
$63,429 in 1992. No contribution was made in 1991 as the
first loan payment was not due until March 17, 1992. The
principal balance of the ESOP loan was $468,438 and
$634,290 at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively. At
December 31, 1992 and 1991, the note is secured by 63,429
of shares acquired by the Trust. On January 6, 1993,
6,343 shares were released by the lender.

Future minimum principal payments of the Employee Stock 
Ownership Plan loan are as follows:

1993 $ 63,429
1994 63,429
1995 63,429
1996 63,429
1997 63,429
Thereafter 151,293
------------

$ 468,438
============

The estimated fair value of the ESOP loan approximates
the carrying value due to the interest rate being
variable at the lender's base rate which is the rate
estimated to be currently offered for comparable new
long-term debt.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Liberty Bancshares, Inc. (the "Company") and Liberty Federal Savings Bank, (the
"Bank") its wholly- owned subsidiary. The accounts of the Bank include
Northwest Tennessee Service Corporation, the Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary.
All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and therefore, do not include
all disclosures necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. However, all adjustments which are, in the opinion of
management, necessary for the fair presentation of the interim financial
statements have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal and
recurring nature. The results of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 1993 are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be
expected for the entire year ending December 31, 1993.

NOTE 2 - CONVERSION TO STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

The sale of 634,215 shares of $1.00 par value common stock by the Company was
consummated on December 17, 1991 pursuant to a plan of conversion of the Bank
from a Federally- chartered mutual savings bank to a Federally-chartered stock
savings bank previously approved by the members of the Bank. From the
proceeds, $634,215 was allocated to common stock and $5,076,846, which is net
of conversion costs of $631,088, was allocated to additional paid-in capital.

Earnings per share were computed based on 659,698 average common shares and
common share equivalents outstanding for the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 1993. Earnings per share for the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 1992 were computed based on 634,215 average common shares
outstanding.

NOTE 3 - EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

In conjunction with the conversion, the Company established a stock option plan
under which a total of 63,421 common shares are reserved for options. The plan
establishes the exercise price of the options at least equal to the market
value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. At September 30,
1993, options for 50,740 shares had been granted under the stock option plan.
No options had been exercised as of September 30, 1993.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Also, in conjunction with the conversion, the Bank established an Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), under which the Company will make annual
contributions to a trust for the benefit of eligible employees. The
contributions may be in the form of cash, other property, or common shares of
the Company. The amount of the annual contributions is at the discretion of
the Board of Directors of the Company. Initially, the ESOP acquired 63,429
shares of the Company's common stock financed by $634,290 in borrowings by the
ESOP. The loan is payable in quarterly principal and interest installments and
is scheduled to mature on December 17, 2001. Interest will accrue at the base
rate charged by the lender.

</TABLE>

During the first quarter of 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". SFAS No.
109 requires the Company to change its method of accounting for income taxes
from the deferred method to the asset and liability method. Under the asset
and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences of "temporary differences" by applying enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Under
SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

The Company elected to apply the statement on a prospective basis through a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The adoption of SFAS
No. 109 resulted in a favorable net effect on 1993 earnings of $127,150.
