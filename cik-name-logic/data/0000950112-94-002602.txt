News from VIACOM
VIACOM COMPLETES MERGER WITH BLOCKBUSTER
--Combined Company Has Capitalization of $26 Billion--

New York, New York, September 29, 1994 -- Viacom Inc. (AMEX: VIA
and VIAB) and Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation (NYSE: BV)
have completed their merger, it was announced today by Sumner M.
Redstone, Chairman of the Board, and Frank J. Biondi, Jr.,
President and Chief Executive Officer, of Viacom.

As previously announced, H. Wayne Huizenga, former Chairman of
the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Blockbuster, has been
named Vice Chairman of Viacom, as well as Chairman of a newly
formed unit of the Company, the Blockbuster Entertainment Group. 
Steven R. Berrard, formerly Vice Chairman, President and Chief
Operating Officer of Blockbuster, will serve as President and
Chief Executive Officer of the Blockbuster Entertainment Group.

The merger was approved by holders of Viacom Class A Common Stock
and stockholders of Blockbuster at Viacom's Special Meeting of
Stockholders held today in New York City and Blockbuster's
Special Meeting of Stockholders held today in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida. A total of 50,726,022 shares, or 95%, of the
outstanding Viacom Class A shares, approved the merger. A total
of 147,122,912 shares, or 57.7%, of the outstanding Blockbuster
shares, approved the merger.

In making the announcement, Mr. Redstone said, "With the
completion of Viacom's merger with Blockbuster, we have created a
single, incomparable, global media colossus. The new Viacom not
only controls many of the world's most valuable and recognizable
entertainment and publishing brands, but also has the
distribution, size and scope to drive these brands into every
region of the world. With pro forma combined capitalization of
$26 billion at June 30, 1994, Viacom is positioned to become the
fastest growing media company in the world."

Mr. Biondi said, "We are moving aggressively to consolidate
Viacom and Blockbuster, implement new cross-divisional projects
at our existing operations, and capitalize on new opportunities -
- just as we did immediately following our acquisition of
Paramount. In addition, one of our highest priorities will be to
continue with our financial restructuring program to reduce the
cost of our debt and enhance our financial flexibility, thereby
enabling us to reinvest in the continued expansion of our core
business."

Mr. Huizenga said, "The completion of this merger creates an
array of new opportunities for Blockbuster's businesses. Our
operations -- and the talented people behind them -- are now part
of one of the world's largest and most successful entertainment
companies. As members of the Viacom family, they will now have
the chance to expand in new directions and strengthen the
Blockbuster brand in the growing global entertainment
marketplace."

Mr. Berrard said, "Viacom and Blockbuster share remarkably
similar histories -- both are companies with entrepreneurial
spirit, creative management teams, a commitment to excellence and
exceptional financial track records. Today marks the beginning
of an exciting new era, one which we firmly believe will yield
even greater achievements."

As a result of the merger, each share of Blockbuster stock has
been converted into the right to receive 0.08 of a share of
Viacom Class A Common Stock, 0.60615 of a share of Viacom Class B
Common Stock, and one variable common right (VCR). Each VCR will
represent the right to receive up to an additional 0.13829 of a
share of Viacom Class B Stock, depending upon market prices of
Viacom Class B Common Stock during the period until September 29,
1995.

Viacom Inc. is one of the world's largest entertainment and
publishing companies and a leading force in nearly every segment
of the international media marketplace. The operations of Viacom
include Blockbuster Music; Blockbuster Video; MTV Networks;
Paramount Parks; Paramount Pictures; Paramount Television;
Showtime Networks Inc.; Simon & Schuster; Viacom Interactive
Media; cable systems serving 1.1 million customers; movie screens
in 11 countries; 14 radio stations; 12 television stations; and
majority interests in Spelling Entertainment Group and Discovery
Zone. National Amusements, Inc., a closely held corporation
which owns and operates more than 850 movie screens in the U.S.
and the U.K., is the parent company of Viacom Inc.

ARTICLE II

AMOUNT AND TERMS OF THE LOANS

2.1. The Loans. (a) The Loans. On the terms
--------- ---------
and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement,
each Bank severally agrees to make Loans to the Borrower
from time to time on any Business Day during the period from
the Initial Funding Date until the Commitment Termination
Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time
outstanding the amount set forth opposite such Bank's name
on Schedule II as its "Commitment" (as adjusted from time to
time by reason of assignments in accordance with the provi-
sions of Section 11.7 and as such amount may be reduced
pursuant to Section 2.3 such Bank's "Commitment"). Within
the limits of each Bank's Commitment, amounts borrowed under

-19-

<PAGE>

this Section 2.1(a) and prepaid pursuant to Section 2.5 may
be reborrowed under this Section 2.1(a).

(b) Evidence of Debt. (i) Each Bank shall
----------------
maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or
accounts evidencing the Indebtedness to such Bank resulting
from each Loan made by such Bank to the Borrower from time
to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Bank from time to time hereunder.

(ii) The Register maintained by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.7(g) shall
include a "Loan contract control account" for each Bank, in
which account shall be recorded (A) the date and amount of
each Borrowing hereunder, (B) the amount and type of each
Bank's Loan comprising such Borrowing and any Interest
Period applicable thereto, (C) the amount of any principal
or interest due and payable or to become due and payable
from the Borrower to each Bank with respect to each such
Loan hereunder and (D) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent from the Borrower with respect to such
Loans hereunder and each Bank's Ratable Portion thereof.

(iii) The entries made in the Register in respect
of the Loans shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

2.2. Making the Loans. (a) Each Borrowing shall
----------------
be made upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, given by the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent not later than (i) 9:30
A.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day of the pro-
posed Borrowing, in the event such Borrowing is to be
comprised of Base Rate Loans, and (ii) 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of
the proposed Borrowing, in the event such Borrowing is to be
comprised of Eurodollar Rate Loans.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give to each
Bank prompt notice (but in any event on the same day) of its
receipt of a Notice of Borrowing in respect of Loans and, if
Eurodollar Rate Loans are properly requested in such Notice
of Borrowing, upon its determination thereof, notice of the
applicable interest rate under Section 3.3(b). Each Bank
shall, before 11:00 A.M. (or in the case of a Borrowing
being made on the same day, before 12:00 noon) (New York
City time) on the date of the proposed Borrowing, make
available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office
to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in
Section 11.2, in immediately available funds, such Bank's
Ratable Portion of such proposed Borrowing. After the
Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon 

-20-

<PAGE>

fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article IV, the Administrative Agent will make such funds
available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's
aforesaid address.

(c) Each Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.2
shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000
or an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof.

(d) Each Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this
Section 2.2 shall be irrevocable and binding on the
Borrower. In the case of any proposed Borrowing comprised
of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Borrower shall indemnify each
Bank against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Bank
as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date
specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such proposed
Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article II,
including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of
the margin payable in accordance with Section 3.2 on the
amount of principal not borrowed as a result of such
failure), cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by such Bank to fund any Eurodollar Rate Loan to be
made by such Bank as part of such proposed Borrowing when
such Eurodollar Rate Loan, as a result of such failure, is
not made on such date.

(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any
proposed Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.2 that such
Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent
such Bank's Ratable Portion of such Borrowing, the Admin-
istrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such
Ratable Portion available to the Administrative Agent on the
date of such Borrowing in accordance with this Section 2.2
and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank
shall not have so made such Ratable Portion available to the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent has so
made available such amount, such Bank and the Borrower
severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of
the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to
the Loan comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of
such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay
to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such
amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan as part 

-21-

<PAGE>

of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. If the
Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent such
corresponding amount, such payment shall not relieve such
Bank of any obligation it may have to the Borrower
hereunder.

(f) The failure of any Bank to make the Loan to
be made by it as part of any Borrowing pursuant to this
Section 2.2 shall not relieve any other Bank of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date
of such Borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by
such other Bank on the date of any such Borrowing.

2.3. Termination/Reduction of the Loan
---------------------------------
Commitments. (a) Scheduled Reductions. The Commitment of
----------- --------------------
each Bank shall be automatically reduced on each date
specified in column (x) below (each such date, a "Scheduled
Commitment Reduction Date") by an amount equal to such
Bank's Ratable Portion of the amount specified in column (y)
below opposite such date:

(x) (y)

-------------------
the right, upon at least three Business Days' prior notice
to the Administrative Agent, to terminate in whole or
permanently reduce ratably in part the unused portions of
the respective Commitments of the Banks; provided, however,
-------- -------
that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount
of not less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$5,000,000 in excess thereof; and optional reductions may be
---
allocated against Scheduled Commitment Reduction Dates in
any manner requested by the Borrower.

(c) Payment of Commitment Fee. Simultaneously
-------------------------
with any termination or reduction of the Commitments 

-22-

<PAGE>

pursuant to this Section 2.3, the Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank Commitment
Fee, if any, on the amount of the Commitments so terminated
or reduced and owed to such Bank through the date of such
termination or reduction.

2.4. Repayment of the Loans. The Borrower shall
----------------------
repay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans
(together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon) in
full on the Commitment Termination Date.

2.5. Optional Prepayments of the Loans. The
---------------------------------
Borrower may, upon at least three Business Days' prior
notice (or at least one Business Day's prior notice in the
case of Base Rate Loans), to the Administrative Agent
stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of
the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower
shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans
comprising a part of the same Borrowing, in whole or ratably
in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such
prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided,
--------
however, that the Borrower shall indemnify the Banks pur-
-------
suant to Section 11.4(c) in the event that any prepayment of
any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made on a day other than
the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans; and
provided further, however, that each partial prepayment
-------- ------- -------
permitted under this Section 2.5 shall be in an aggregate
amount not less than $5,000,000 or integral multiples of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof.

2.6. Mandatory Prepayment. The Borrower shall
--------------------
prepay Loans to the extent necessary to ensure that the
aggregate amount of all Loans outstanding will not at any
time exceed the Loan Commitments of the Banks.

ARTICLE III

CONVERSION, INTEREST, PAYMENTS, FEES, ETC.

3.1. Conversion/Continuation Option. The
------------------------------
Borrower may elect (i) at any time to convert Base Rate
Loans or any portion thereof to Eurodollar Rate Loans or
(ii) at the end of any Interest Period with respect thereto,
to convert Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion thereof into
Base Rate Loans, or to continue such Eurodollar Rate Loans
or any portion thereof as Eurodollar Rate Loans for an
additional Interest Period; provided, however, that the
-------- -------
aggregate of the Eurodollar Rate Loans of the Borrower so
converted or so continued for each Interest Period must be
in the amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of 

-23-

<PAGE>

$5,000,000 in excess thereof. Each such election shall be
in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto (a "Notice of
Conversion or Continuation") and shall be made by giving the
Administrative Agent at least one Business Day's, in the
case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan, and three Business
Days', in the case of a conversion to or a continuation of a
Eurodollar Rate Loan, prior written notice thereof speci-
fying (A) the amount and type of conversion or continuation,
(B) in the case of a conversion to or a continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Interest Period therefor, and
(C) in the case of a conversion the date of conversion
(which date shall be a Business Day and, if a conversion
from a Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall also be the last day of
the Interest Period therefor). The Administrative Agent
shall promptly (but in any event on the same day) notify
each Bank of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion or
Continuation and of the contents thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no conversion in whole or in part of Base
Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans, and no continuation in
whole or in part of Eurodollar Rate Loans upon the expira-
tion of any Interest Period therefor, shall be permitted at
any time at which an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing. If, within the time period required
under the terms of this Section 3.1, the Administrative
Agent does not receive a Notice of Conversion or Con-
tinuation from the Borrower containing an election to
continue all or any portion of the Eurodollar Rate Loans for
an additional Interest Period or to convert all or any
portion of such Loans, then, upon the expiration of the
Interest Period therefor, such Loans or the portions thereof
for which an election to continue or convert has not been
made will be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans. 
Each Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be
irrevocable.

3.2. Interest. The Borrower shall pay interest
--------
on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan from the date
thereof until the principal amount thereof shall be paid in
full, at the following rates per annum:

(a) Base Rate Loans. For Base Rate Loans, at a
---------------
rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate in
effect from time to time, payable quarterly in arrears
on the last day of each September, December, March and
June, on the Commitment Termination Date and on the
date any Base Rate Loan is converted or paid in full.

(b) Eurodollar Rate Loans. For Eurodollar Rate
---------------------
Loans, at a rate per annum equal at all times during
the applicable Interest Period for each Eurodollar Rate
Loan to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for such

-24-

<PAGE>

Interest Period plus the Applicable Eurodollar Rate
Margin, payable in arrears (i) on the last day of such
Interest Period and (ii) if such Interest Period has a
duration of more than three months, on each day during
such Interest Period that occurs every three months
from the first day of such Interest Period.

(c) Default Rate of Interest. If any amount of
------------------------
principal of any Loan is not paid when due, whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, the
interest rate applicable to any such amount shall be
increased by 2.00% per annum, payable on demand, and if
any interest, fee or other amount payable hereunder is
not paid when due, such amount shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate in
effect from time to time plus 2% per annum payable on
demand.

3.3. Interest Rate Determination and Protection. 
------------------------------------------
(a) In the event that the Eurodollar Rate is not available
from the Telerate Page, the Eurodollar Rate for each
Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be deter-
mined by the Administrative Agent on the basis of applicable
rates furnished to and received by the Administrative Agent
from the Reference Banks two Business Days before such
Interest Period. Each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to
the Administrative Agent timely information for the purpose
of determining each Eurodollar Rate. If any of the Refer-
ence Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the
Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining any such
interest rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine such
interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished
by the other Reference Bank or Reference Banks.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give prompt
notice to the Borrower and the Banks of the applicable
interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent for
purposes of Section 3.2(a) or (b), and the applicable rate,
if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of
determining the applicable interest rate under Section
3.2(b).

(c) If, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans,
the Banks holding the majority in principal amount of such
Loans determine in good faith and notify the Administrative
Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period will
not adequately reflect the cost to such Banks of making such
Loans or funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar
Rate Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative
Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Banks,
whereupon

-25-

<PAGE>

(i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan will automatically,
on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
therefor, convert into a Base Rate Loan unless the
Banks holding the majority in principal amount of such
Loans notify the Administrative Agent that the circum-
stances causing such conversion no longer exist and the
Borrower delivers a timely Notice of Conversion or
Continuation with respect to such Loans; and

(ii) the obligations of the Banks to make
Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Loans into
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist.

3.4. Fees. (a) The Borrower will pay on the
----
last day of each Fiscal Quarter to each of the Banks
quarterly in arrears a fee (the "Commitment Fee") accruing
from the Effective Date until the Commitment Termination
Date, on such Bank's aggregate average daily unused
Commitment as in effect from time to time at the rate set
forth below opposite the Credit Rating applicable to the
Borrower on such date:

CREDIT RATING COMMITMENT FEE
------------- --------------

A-/A3 or better .1500%
BBB+/Baa1 .2000%
BBB/Baa2 .2250%
BBB-/Baa3 .2500%
BB+/Ba1 .3125%
BB/Ba2 .3750%
BB-/Ba3 or lower .5000%

; provided, however, that if the ratings assigned by S&P and
-------- -------
Moody's shall differ by one level, the Credit Rating shall
be the rating which is the higher level, or if they differ
by more than one level, the Credit Rating shall be the
rating that is one rating level immediately above the lower
of such ratings. Any change in the Credit Rating of the
Borrower shall be effective to adjust the Commitment Fee as
of the date such change is announced.

(b) The Borrower has agreed to pay to the Banks,
Managing Agents, Agents and Arrangers certain other fees
which are earned on the Effective Date and payable on the
Initial Funding Date or as separately agreed.

3.5. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either
---------------
(i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change
by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements 

-26-

<PAGE>

included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in, or
in the interpretation of, any law or regulation or (ii) the
compliance with any guideline or request from any central
bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having
the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost
(other than with respect to income, franchise or withholding
taxes or other taxes of a similar nature) to any Bank of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any
Eurodollar Rate Loans, then (A) such Bank shall, as soon as
such Bank becomes aware of such increased cost, but in any
event not later than 60 days after such increased cost was
incurred, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent a certificate stating (1) the actual amount of such
increased cost incurred by such Bank and (2) that it is such
Bank's customary practice, from and after the date of this
Agreement, to charge its borrowers for increased costs
incurred by it; (B) the Borrower shall, within 30 days after
its receipt of such certificate, at its sole option, either
(1) pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Bank amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for the
increased cost incurred by it as set forth in the cer-
tificate referred to above or (2) replace such Bank in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.10, provided
--------
that if the Borrower does not exercise the option specified
in clause (2) above within 30 days after receipt of the
certificate referred to above, then (x) such Bank shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a
second certificate stating the increased cost incurred by
such Bank and (y) the Borrower shall promptly upon receipt
of such second certificate pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Bank amounts sufficient to com-
pensate such Bank for such increased cost; and (C) such Bank
shall use its reasonable best efforts to designate another
of its then existing offices as its Applicable Lending
Office if the making of such designation would, without any
detrimental effect to such Bank, avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, future increased costs which are
probable of being incurred by such Bank. The amount of
increased costs payable by the Borrower to any Bank as
stated in any such certificate delivered to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 3.5(a) shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error. In determining any such
amount, such Bank may use reasonable averaging and
attribution methods. If the Borrower so notifies the
Administrative Agent within five Business Days after receipt
of any certificate delivered to the Borrower pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 3.5(a), the Borrower may either
(x) prepay in full all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Bank
then outstanding in accordance with Section 3.8 and,
additionally, reimburse such Bank for such increased cost in

-27-

<PAGE>

accordance with this Section 3.5(a) or (y) convert all
Eurodollar Rate Loans of all Banks then outstanding into
Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 3.1 and,
additionally, reimburse such Bank for such increased cost in
accordance with this Section 3.5(a).

(b) If any Bank shall be required under Regula-
tion D to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or
assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency Liabilities,
then (i) such Bank shall, within 60 days after the end of
any Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loan
during which such Bank was so required to maintain such
reserves, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent a certificate stating (A) that such Bank was required
to maintain reserves and as a result such Bank incurred
additional costs in connection with making Eurodollar Rate
Loans, (B) in reasonable detail, such Bank's computations of
the amount of additional interest payable by the Borrower
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.5(b)(ii) and
(C) that it is such Bank's customary practice, from and
after the date of this Agreement, to charge its borrowers
for reserves so maintained by it, and (ii) the Borrower
shall, promptly upon receipt of any such certificate, pay to
the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Bank,
additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each
Eurodollar Rate Loan of such Bank outstanding during the
Interest Period with respect to which the above-referenced
certificate was delivered to the Borrower, at a rate per
annum equal to the difference obtained by subtracting
(x) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period from
(y) the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar Rate by a
percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve
Percentage of such Bank for such Interest Period. The
amount of interest payable by the Borrower to any Bank as
stated in any certificate delivered to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 3.5(b) shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

(c) The payments required under Sections 3.5(a)
and (b) are in addition to any other payments and
indemnities required under this Agreement.

3.6. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other
----------
provision of this Agreement, if the introduction of or any
change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation,
in each case after the date hereof, shall make it unlawful,
or any central bank or other Governmental Authority shall
assert that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its Eurodollar
Lending Office to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or to continue
to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, then, on notice 

-28-

<PAGE>

thereof and demand therefor by such Bank to the Borrower
through the Administrative Agent, (i) the obligation of such
Bank to make or to continue Eurodollar Rate Loans and to
convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
suspended until such Bank through the Administrative Agent
shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing
such suspension no longer exist and (ii) the Borrower shall
forthwith prepay in full all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such
Bank then outstanding, together with interest accrued
thereon, unless the Borrower, within five Business Days of
such notice and demand, converts all Eurodollar Rate Loans
of all Banks then outstanding into Base Rate Loans in
accordance with the notice periods of Section 3.1; provided,
--------
however, that before making any such demand, each Bank
-------
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to designate
another of its then existing offices as its Applicable
Lending Office if the making of such a designation would,
without any detrimental effect to such Bank, cause the
making of Eurodollar Rate Loans to not be subject to this
Section 3.6.

3.7. Capital Adequacy. If any Bank shall, at any
----------------
time, reasonably determine that (a) the adoption (i) after
the date of this Agreement, of any capital adequacy guide-
lines or (ii) at any time, of any other applicable law,
government rule, regulation or order regarding capital
adequacy of banks or bank holding companies, (b) any change
in (i) any of the foregoing or (ii) the interpretation or
administration of any of the foregoing by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency or (c) com-
pliance with any policy, guideline, directive or request
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force
of law and whether or not failure to comply therewith would
be unlawful) of any Governmental Authority, central bank or
comparable agency, would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on the capital of such Bank to a level below
that which such Bank could have achieved but for such
adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
the policies of such Bank with respect to capital adequacy
in effect immediately before such adoption, change or
compliance) and (x) such reduction is as a consequence of
the Commitment of, or the making, converting or continuing
of any Loans by, such Bank hereunder and (y) such reduction
is reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material, then
(1) such Bank shall deliver to the Borrower and the Admin-
istrative Agent a certificate stating the reduction in the
rate of return such Bank will in the future suffer as a
result of its Commitment or the making, converting or
continuing any Loans by it to the Borrower hereunder and
(2) the Borrower shall, within 30 days after its receipt of
such certificate, at its sole option, either (A) pay to the 

-29-

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank from time
to time as specified by such Bank such amount as shall be
sufficient to compensate such Bank for such reduced return,
or (B) replace such Bank in accordance with the provisions
of Section 3.10; provided, however, that if the Borrower
-------- -------
does not exercise the option specified in clause (B) above
within 30 days after receipt of the certificate referred to
above, then (1) such Bank shall deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent a second certificate stating the
reduction in the rate of return of such Bank and (2) the
Borrower shall promptly pay, as specified by such Bank, to
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank
amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for the reduction
in its rate of return. The amount stated in any certificate
delivered to the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 3.7 shall be conclusive and binding for all pur-
poses, absent manifest error. In determining any such
amount, such Bank may use reasonable averaging and
attribution methods. The payments required under this
Section 3.7 are in addition to any other payments and
indemnities required hereunder.

3.8. Payments and Computations. (a) The
-------------------------
Borrower shall make each payment payable by it hereunder not
later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when
due, in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent at its address
referred to in Section 11.2 in immediately available funds
without set-off or counterclaim. The Administrative Agent
will promptly thereafter (but in any event on the same day)
cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment
of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts
payable pursuant to Section 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7) to the Banks
for the account of their respective Applicable Lending
Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other
amount payable to any Bank to such Bank for the account of
its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Payment
received by the Administrative Agent after 11:00 A.M.
(New York City time) shall be deemed to be received on the
next Business Day; provided, however, that the Admin-
-------- -------
istrative Agent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
invest any amounts so received by the Administrative Agent
in overnight investments satisfactory to the Borrower, and
any earnings on any such investments shall be for the
Borrower's account and may be credited against any interest
payable hereunder during such period.

(b) All computations of the Commitment Fee or of
interest based on the rate of interest specified in clause
(a) of the definition of Base Rate and of fees shall be made
by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or

-30-

<PAGE>

366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of
interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds
Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis
of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of
days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest and fees are
payable. All computations of the Commitment Fee shall be
based on the aggregate average daily unused Commitment of
each Bank. Each determination by the Administrative Agent
of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(c) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day,
and such extension of time shall in such case be included in
the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case
may be.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which
any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower
will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Admin-
istrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause
to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount
equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the
extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment
in full to the Administrative Agent, each Bank shall repay
to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for
each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

3.9. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank shall
-------------------------
obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through
the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on
account of the Loan made by it (other than pursuant to
Section 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7) in excess of its Ratable Portion of
payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Banks,
such Bank shall forthwith purchase from the other Banks such
participations in the Loans made by them as shall be neces-
sary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess
payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that
-------- -------
if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each
Bank shall be rescinded and each such Bank shall repay to
the purchasing Bank the purchase price to the extent of such
recovery together with an amount equal to such Bank's 

-31-

<PAGE>

ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount
of such Bank's required repayment to (ii) the total amount
so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or
other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in
respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower
agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from
another Bank pursuant to this Section 3.9 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of
payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

3.10. Replacement Banks. Upon the election of
-----------------
the Borrower to replace any Bank pursuant to the provisions
of Section 3.5(a)(B)(2) or 3.7(2)(B), the Borrower shall
provide to the Administrative Agent a notice setting forth
the replacement Bank or Banks, and the Bank being so
replaced shall take all actions as may be necessary to
transfer to such replacement Bank or Banks all of the rights
and obligations of such Bank hereunder and such replacement
Bank or Banks shall pay to the Bank being so replaced the
amount outstanding of the Loan made by such Bank hereunder
(with appropriate provisions for other amounts due to the
Bank being replaced), all as though such replacement Bank or
Banks were an assignee or assignees of such Bank to which
such Bank were making an assignment in accordance with the
provisions of Section 11.7.

otherwise relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidi-
aries which will affect a taxable year of the Borrower or a

----------
best knowledge of the Borrower threatened, actions,
investigations or proceedings against or affecting the

adverse decision that could have a Material Adverse Effect
or result in a Material Credit Agreement Change.

5.6. Margin Regulations. The Borrower is not
------------------
engaged in the business of extending credit for the purpose

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No Plan which is a Single-Employer Plan had
an accumulated funding deficiency, whether or not waived, as
of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of such Plan
ended prior to the date hereof. Neither the Borrower nor

Plan which is a Single-Employer Plan pursuant to Sec-
tion 401(a)(29) of the Code or Section 307 of ERISA, or
(B) subject to a Lien in favor of such a Plan under Section

(c) Each Plan of the Borrower, each of its
Subsidiaries and each of its ERISA Affiliates is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code, except where the failure
to comply would not result in any Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred a tax liability under Section 4975
of the Code or a penalty under Section 502(i) of ERISA in

5.8. No Defaults. Neither the Borrower nor any
-----------
of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or default under or with
respect to any instrument, document or agreement binding

result in the creation of a Lien on any Property of the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries.

5.9. Investment Company Act. The Borrower is not
----------------------
an "investment company" or an "affiliated person" of, or
"promoter" or "principal underwriter" for, an "investment
company", as such terms are defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The making of the Loans by
the Banks, the application of the proceeds and repayment
thereof by the Borrower and the consummation of the trans-
actions contemplated by this Agreement will not violate any
provision of such act or any rule, regulation or order
issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.

5.10. Insurance. All policies of insurance of
---------
any kind or nature owned by the Borrower and its Sub-
sidiaries are maintained with financially sound and
reputable insurers. The Borrower currently maintains
insurance with respect to its Properties and business and
causes its Subsidiaries to maintain insurance with respect
to their Properties and business against loss or damage of
the kinds customarily insured against by corporations
engaged in the same or similar business and similarly
situated, of such types and in such amounts as are
customarily carried under similar circumstances by such
other corporations including, without limitation, workers'
compensation insurance.

5.11. Environmental Protection. (a) There are
------------------------
no known conditions or circumstances associated with the
currently or previously owned or leased properties or
operations of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or tenants
which may give rise to any Environmental Liabilities and
Costs which would have a Material Adverse Effect; and

(b) No Environmental Lien has attached to any
Property of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which
would have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.12. Title and Liens. Each of the Borrower and
---------------
each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to 

-38-

<PAGE>

its real properties and owns or leases under Capitalized
Leases all its other material Properties, in each case, as
shown on its most recent balance sheet, and none of such
Properties is subject to any Lien except as permitted under
this Agreement.

5.13. Trademarks, Copyrights, Etc. The Borrower
----------------------------
and each of its Subsidiaries own or have the rights to such
trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, licenses
or rights in any thereof, as in the aggregate are adequate
in the reasonable judgment of the Borrower for the conduct
of the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as now
conducted.

5.14. FCC Licenses, Franchises. The Borrower and
------------------------
its Subsidiaries have all the FCC Licenses necessary for the
conduct of their respective businesses as now being
conducted. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries are in
substantial compliance with the Federal Communications Act
of 1934, as amended, and with the rules and regulations
thereunder except for such non-compliance which would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor has any knowledge
of, any investigation, notice of violation, order or
complaint issued by or before the FCC, in which there is a
reasonable probability of an adverse decision which is
reasonably probable to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
operation and maintenance of the towers and any antenna
systems relating to each of the broadcast Properties owned
by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or used in connection
with the transmission of signals therefrom do not violate
any Requirement of Law except for such non-compliance which
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and
its Subsidiaries have all the Franchises necessary for the
conduct of their businesses as now being conducted and are
in substantial compliance with the requirements of such
Franchises, except for such non-compliance which would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and its
Subsidiaries have no reason to believe that any FCC License
or any Franchise of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will
not be renewed in the ordinary course except for such
nonrenewal which would not have a Material Adverse Effect. 

5.15. Disclosure. All written information
----------
relating to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and
Blockbuster and its Subsidiaries which has been delivered to
the Banks in connection with the Loan Documents prior to the
Initial Funding Date was complete and correct in all
material respects, taken as a whole. Any financial
projections and other information regarding anticipated
future plans or developments contained therein was based 

-39-

<PAGE>

upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by the
Borrower to be reasonable at the time made, it being
recognized by the Banks that such projections and other
information regarding future events are not to be viewed as
facts and that actual results or developments during the
period or periods covered may differ from the delivered
projections and other prospective information.

the Borrower, any Bank or the Administrative Agent, at such
other address as shall be designated by such party in a
written notice to the other parties and, as to each other
party, at such other address as shall be designated by such
party in a written notice to the Borrower and the Adminis-

when mailed, telegraphed, telexed, telecopied, cabled or
delivered, be effective when deposited in the mails,
delivered to the telegraph company, confirmed by telex
answerback, telecopied with confirmation of receipt,
delivered to the cable company or delivered by hand to the
addressee or its agent, respectively, except that notices
and communications to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Article II or X shall not be effective until received by the
Administrative Agent.

11.3. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the
-------------------
part of any Bank, the Managing Agents or any Facility Agent
to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. 
The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

11.4. Costs; Expenses; Indemnities. (a) The
----------------------------
Borrower agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification and amendment of this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the other documents
to be delivered hereunder or thereunder, including, without
limitation, the specified reasonable fees and out-of-pocket
expenses of one counsel to the Managing Agents and the
Facility Agents and the Arrangers with respect thereto and
with respect to advising the Managing Agents, the Facility
Agents and the Arrangers as to their rights and responsi-
bilities under this Agreement, and all costs and expenses of
the Managing Agents, the Facility Agents and the Banks
(including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
expenses) in connection with the enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the other
documents to be delivered hereunder and thereunder.

(b) The Borrower agrees to defend, indemnify and
hold harmless each of the Managing Agents, the Facility
Agents, the Arrangers and the Banks and their respective
affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
attorneys, agents, employees, successors and assigns (each,
an "Indemnified Person") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, claims, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including,
without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel of the
Managing Agents, the Facility Agents, the Arrangers or the
Banks) which may be incurred by or asserted or awarded
against any Indemnified Person, in each case arising in any 

-57-

<PAGE>

manner of or in connection with or by reason of this Agree-
ment, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments or any
undertakings in connection therewith, or the proposed or
actual application of the proceeds of the Loans (all of the
foregoing collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities") and
will reimburse each Indemnified Person on a current basis
for all expenses (including counsel fees as they are
incurred by such party) in connection with investigating,
preparing or defending any such action, claim or suit,
whether or not in connection with pending or threatened
litigation irrespective of whether such Indemnified Person
is designated a party thereto; provided that the Borrower
--------
shall not have any liability hereunder to any Indemnified
Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities which are
determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction to have arisen primarily from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person; and provided further, that if the Borrower has
-------- -------
determined in good faith that such Indemnified Liabilities
were primarily the result of such Indemnified Person's gross
negligence or willful misconduct, it shall not be obligated
to pay such Indemnified Liabilities until a court of
competent jurisdiction has determined whether such
Indemnified Person acted with gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If for any reason the foregoing indemnification
is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient to
hold an Indemnified Person harmless, then the Borrower shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Person as a result of any Indemnified Liability in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the rela-
tive benefits received by the Borrower and each Managing
Agent, each Facility Agent, each Arranger and each Bank, but
also the relative fault of the Borrower and each Managing
Agent, each Facility Agent, each Arranger and each Bank, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
foregoing indemnity shall be in addition to any rights that
any Indemnified Person may have at common law or otherwise,
including, but not limited to, any right to contribution.

(c) If any Bank receives any payment of principal
of, or is subject to a conversion of, any Eurodollar Rate
Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period
relating to such Loan, as a result of any payment or
conversion made by the Borrower or acceleration of the
maturity of the amounts due under this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1 or for any other reason, the Borrower shall,
upon demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Bank any amounts required to compensate
such Bank for any additional losses, costs or expenses which
it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or 

-58-

<PAGE>

conversion, including, without limitation, any loss
(excluding loss of the margin payable in accordance with
Section 3.2 on the amount of principal so paid, or any
loss), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation
or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such
Bank to fund or maintain such Loan. The foregoing obliga-
tions of the Borrower contained in paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c) of this Section 11.4, and the obligations of the Bor-
rower contained in Sections 3.5(b) and 3.7, shall survive
the payment of the Loans.

11.5. Right of Set-Off. Upon (i) the occurrence
----------------
and during the continuance of any Event of Default and
(ii) the making of the request or the granting of the
consent specified by Section 9.1 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare all amounts under this
Agreement due and payable pursuant to the provisions of
Section 9.1 or the automatic acceleration of such amounts
pursuant to the proviso to that Section, each Bank is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time
owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the account of
the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the
Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement
irrespective of whether or not such Bank shall have made any
demand under this Agreement and although such obligations
may be unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the
Borrower after any such set-off and application made by such
Bank; provided, however, that the failure to give such
-------- -------
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of each Bank under this Sec-
tion 11.5 are in addition to any other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, any other rights of set-off)
which such Bank may have.

11.6. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall
--------------
become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Borrower, each of the Managing Agents, each of the Facility
Agents and each of the Arrangers and when the Managing
Agents shall have been notified by each of the Banks that
such Bank has executed it and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each of the
Managing Agents, each of the Facility Agents, each of the
Arrangers and each of the Banks and their respective
successors and assigns, except that (i) the Borrower shall
have no right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest
herein without the prior written consent of the Banks and
(ii) no Bank may sell, transfer, assign, pledge or grant
participations in any of its Loans or any of its rights or 

-59-

<PAGE>

obligations hereunder except in accordance with Section 11.7
or as expressly required hereunder.

11.7. Assignments and Participations; Additional
------------------------------------------
Banks. (a) Any Bank may, at any time, by notice
-----
substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto (each, a
"Notice of Assignment and Acceptance") delivered to the
Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording,
together with a recording fee in the amount of $3,000,
assign all or any part of its rights and obligations and
delegate its duties under this Agreement (A) to any other
Bank or any affiliate of any Bank which actually controls,
is controlled by, or is under common control with such Bank
or to any Federal Reserve Bank (in either case without
limitation as to amount), or (B) with the prior consent of
the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld),
to any other Person (but if in part, in a minimum amount of
$25,000,000 or, if less, the balance of such Bank's Commit-
ment; provided, however, that each assigning Bank must
-------- -------
assign an identical percentage of a Loan and its related
Commitment.

(b) Any Bank may at any time sell or grant
participations in its Commitment, or the obligations owing
to or from any Person existing under this Agreement;
provided, however, that (i) as between such Bank and the
-------- -------
Borrower, the existence of such participations shall not
give rise to any direct rights or obligations between the
Borrower and the participants; (ii) such Bank shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations; (iii) the Borrower, the
Managing Agents, the Facility Agents and the other Banks
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in
connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under
this Agreement; and (iv) no such sale or grant of a
participation shall, without the consent of the Borrower,
require the Borrower to file a registration statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission or apply to qualify
the Commitments or the Loans under the securities laws of
any state.

(c) If an assignment is made by any Bank in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) above, upon
acceptance and recording by the Administrative Agent, and
approval by the Borrower, where applicable, of each Notice
of Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the assignee thereunder
shall become a party to this Agreement and the Borrower
shall release and discharge the assigning Bank from its
duties, liabilities or obligations under this Agreement to
the extent the same are so assigned and delegated by such
Bank, provided that no such consent, release or discharge 
--------

-60-

<PAGE>

shall have effect until the Borrower shall have received a
fully executed copy of the Notice of Assignment and
Acceptance relating to such assignment and (ii) Schedule II
shall be deemed amended to give effect to such assignment. 
The Borrower agrees that each such disposition will give
rise to a direct obligation of the Borrower to any such
assignee.

(d) The Borrower authorizes each Bank to disclose
to any prospective assignee or participant and any assignee
or participant any and all financial information in such
Bank's possession concerning the Borrower and this
Agreement; provided, however, that, prior to any such
-------- -------
disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee
or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality
of any confidential information relating to the Borrower
received by it from such Bank in accordance with
Section 11.10.

(e) Any Bank which sells or grants participations
in any Loans or its Commitment may not grant to the
participants the right to vote other than on amendments,
consents, waivers, modifications or other actions which
change the principal amount of, postpone the scheduled
maturity of, or decrease the interest rates applicable to,
any Loans under, or increase the amount of, such Commitment
(except with respect to participating Affiliates actually
controlled by, controlling or under common control with,
such Bank); provided, however, that as between the Bank and
-------- -------
the Borrower, only the Bank shall be entitled to cast such
votes.

(f) No participant in any Bank's rights or
obligations shall be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 3.5 or 3.7 than such Bank would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the rights participated,
and no participation shall be sold or granted to any Person
as to which the events specified in Section 3.6 have
occurred on or before the date of participation.

(g) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at
its address referred to in Section 11.2 a copy of each
Notice of Assignment and Acceptance received by it and a
register, containing the terms of each Notice of Assignment
and Acceptance, for the recordation of the names and
addresses of each Bank and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Loans owing to, each Bank from time to time
(the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error, and the Borrower, the Banks, the Facility Agents and
the Managing Agents may treat each Person whose name is 

-61-

<PAGE>

recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all pur-
poses of this Agreement. The Register shall be available
for inspection by the Borrower, any Bank, any Facility Agent
or any Managing Agent at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.

GUARANTEE, dated as of September 29, 1994, made by

- - - - - - - - - -

WHEREAS, the Documentation Agent, the
Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent (collectively
the "Facility Agents"), the Managing Agents, the Agents and
the Banks have entered into a credit agreement dated as of
September 29, 1994 (said agreement, as it may hereafter be
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time, being the "Credit Agreement", and the terms defined
therein and not otherwise defined herein being used herein
as therein defined) with Viacom Inc., a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Delaware (the "Borrower"); and

WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the
Initial Funding Date under the Credit Agreement that the
Guarantor shall have executed and delivered this Guarantee;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises
and in order to induce the Banks to make the loans under the
Credit Agreement, the Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

SECTION 1. Guarantee. The Guarantor hereby
---------
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual
payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by accelera-
tion or otherwise, of all obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement, whether for
borrowed money, interest, fees or any other amounts due
thereunder or otherwise (the "Obligations") and any and all
expenses (including counsel fees and expenses) reasonably
incurred by any Bank, Facility Agent, Managing Agent or
Agent in enforcing any rights under this Guarantee.

<PAGE>

SECTION 2. Guarantee Absolute. The Guarantor
------------------
guarantees that the Obligations will be paid strictly in
accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, regard-
less of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in
effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or
the rights of any Bank, Facility Agent, Managing Agent or
Agent with respect thereto. The liability of the Guarantor
under this Guarantee shall be absolute and unconditional
irrespective of:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability
of the Credit Agreement or any other agreement or
instrument relating thereto;

(ii) any change in the time, manner or
place of payment of, or in any other term of, all
or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment
or waiver of or any consent to departure from the
Credit Agreement;

(iii) any exchange, release or non-
perfection of any collateral, or any release or
amendment or waiver of or consent to departure
from any other guaranty, for all or any of the
Obligations; or

(iv) any other circumstance which might
otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a
discharge of, the Borrower, or a guarantor.

SECTION 3. Waiver. The Guarantor hereby waives
------
all notices with respect to any of the Obligations and this
Guarantee and any requirement that any Bank, Facility Agent,
Managing Agent or Agent protect, secure, perfect or insure
any security interests or lien on any property subject
thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the
Borrower, or any other person or entity or any collateral.

SECTION 4. Subrogation. (a) The Guarantor shall
-----------
not exercise any rights which it may have acquired by way of
subrogation under this Guarantee, by any payment made
hereunder or otherwise nor shall the Guarantor seek any
reimbursement from Borrower in respect of payments made by
the Guarantor hereunder, unless and until all of the
Obligations shall have been paid to the Banks and
discharged, in full, and if any payment shall be made to the
Guarantor on account of such subrogation or reimbursement
rights at any time when the Obligations shall not have been
paid and discharged, in full, each and every amount so paid
shall forthwith be paid to the Banks to be credited and

2

<PAGE>

applied against the Obligations, whether matured or
unmatured.

(b) If, pursuant to applicable law, the
Guarantor, by payment or otherwise, becomes subrogated to
all or any of the rights of the Banks under any of the Loan
Documents, the rights of the Banks to which the Guarantor
shall be subrogated shall be accepted by the Guarantor "as
is" and without any representation or warranty of any kind
by the Banks, express or implied, with respect to the
legality, value, validity or enforceability of any of such
rights, or the existence, availability, value,
merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of any
collateral and shall be without recourse to the Banks.

SECTION 5. Representations and Warranties. The
------------------------------
Guarantor hereby represents and warrants as follows:

(a) It is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by
the Guarantor of this Guarantee are within the Guarantor's
corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, do not contravene the Guarantor's charter
or by-laws, any law or any contractual restriction binding
on or affecting and material to the Guarantor, and do not
result in or require the creation of any Lien upon or with
respect to any of its properties.

(c) No authorization or approval or other action
by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental
authority or regulatory body is required for the due
execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of this
Guarantee.

(d) This Guarantee is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the
Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except where such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or
limiting creditor's rights generally or equitable principles
relating to enforceability.

(e) There is no pending or threatened action or
proceeding affecting the Guarantor before any court,
governmental agency or arbitrator, in which, individually or
in the aggregate, there is a reasonable probability of an
adverse decision which could have a Material Adverse Effect
or result in a Material Credit Agreement Change.

respectively, be effective when deposited in the mails or

SECTION 7. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on
-------------------
the part of any Bank, Facility Agent, Managing Agent or
Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative
and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

SECTION 8. Right of Set-off. Upon the occurrence
----------------
and during the continuance of any Event of Default (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) and, except in the case of
one of the events referred in clause (f) of Section 9.1 of
the Credit Agreement, the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 9.1 of the
Credit Agreement to authorize the Administrative Agent to
declare all amounts under the Credit Agreement due and
payable pursuant to the provisions of said Section 9.1, each
Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other indebted-
ness at any time owing by such Bank to or for the credit or
the account of the Guarantor against any and all of the
obligations of the Guarantor now or hereafter existing under
this Guarantee, irrespective of whether or not such Bank
shall have made any demand under this Guarantee and although
such obligations may be contingent and unmatured. Each Bank
agrees promptly to notify the Guarantor after any such set-
off and application made by such Bank; provided, however,
-------- -------
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of

and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) which such Bank may have.

SECTION 9. Continuing Guarantee; Transfer of
---------------------------------
Interest. This Guarantee is a continuing guaranty and shall
--------
(i) remain in full force and effect until indefeasible
payment in full of the Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guarantee, (ii) be binding upon the
Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and (iii) inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by any Bank, Facility
Agent, Managing Agent or Agent, and their respective
successors, transferees, and assigns. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing clause (iii), any Bank may
assign or otherwise transfer all or any part of its rights
and obligations under the Credit Agreement in accordance
therewith, and such other person or entity shall thereupon
become vested with all the rights in respect thereof granted
to such Bank herein or otherwise, subject, however, to the
provisions of Article XI of the Credit Agreement.

SECTION 10. Reinstatement. This Guarantee shall
-------------
remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective
should any petition be filed by or against any Loan Party
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) for liquidation or
reorganization, should any Loan Party become insolvent or
make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a
receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant
part of any Loan Party's assets, and shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and
performance of this Obligations, or any part thereof, is,
pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount,
or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee of 
the Obligations, whether as a "voidable preference",
"fraudulent conveyance", or otherwise, all as though such
payment or performance had not been made. In the event that
any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced,
restored, or returned, the Obligations shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced
only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced,
restored or returned.

SECTION 11. Limitation of Obligation. The
------------------------
liability of the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall not
exceed the greater of (i) 95% of the Adjusted Net Assets (as
defined below) of the Guarantor on the date of delivery
hereof and (ii) 95% of the Adjusted Net Assets (as defined
below) of the Guarantor on the date of any payment
hereunder; provided, that nothing in this Section 11 shall
--------
be construed to limit the liability of the Guarantor under

5

<PAGE>

any other Loan Document to which it is a party. "Adjusted
--------
Net Assets" of any Guarantor at any date means the lesser of
----------
(x) the amount by which the fair value of the property of
such Guarantor (including, without limitation, rights of
subrogation, contribution, and similar rights) exceeds the
total amount of liabilities, including, without limitation,
contingent liabilities, but excluding liabilities under this
Guarantee, of the Guarantor at such date and (y) the amount
by which the present fair salable value of the assets of the
Guarantor (including, without limitation, rights of
subrogation, contribution, and similar rights) at such date
exceeds the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liability of the Guarantor on its debts, excluding debt in
respect of this Guarantee, as they become absolute and
matured.

SECTION 12. GOVERNING LAW. THIS GUARANTEE SHALL
-------------
BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PROVISIONS
THEREOF RELATING TO CONFLICT OF LAWS.

SECTION 13. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE GUARANTOR
--------------------
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS OR REMEDIES
HEREUNDER, UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR UNDER THE OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENTS RELATIVE TO EACH OF THE FOREGOING.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this
Guarantee to be duly executed and delivered by its officer
thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above
written.

Documents, the rights of the Banks to which the Guarantor
shall be subrogated shall be accepted by the Guarantor "as
is" and without any representation or warranty of any kind
by the Banks, express or implied, with respect to the
