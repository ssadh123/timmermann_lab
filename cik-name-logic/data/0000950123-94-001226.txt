FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PAINEWEBBER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

-Net Earnings of $0.12 Per Share Before Non-Recurring Mutual Fund Charge-
-Fully Diluted Loss Per Share of $0.35-

NEW YORK, July 22, 1994 -- Paine Webber Group Inc. today reported results for
the second quarter of 1994.

For the quarter:

o Net earnings before a previously announced charge for the
Short-Term U.S. Government Income Fund were $9.1 million or $0.12 per
fully diluted share.

o Net loss, including the one-time charge, was $25.1 million or
$0.35 per fully diluted share, compared to net earnings of $59.3
million or $0.69 per fully diluted share a year ago.

o Net results in the quarter include a non-recurring after-tax
charge of approximately $34 million related to the Short-Term U.S.
Government Income Fund.

o Revenues, including net interest, decreased 15.7% to $579.0 million
from the prior year quarter of $686.5 million. 

For the six-month period:

o Net earnings, excluding the one-time charge, were $64.8 million
or $0.83 on a fully diluted per share basis. Net earnings, including
the charge, were $30.6 million or $0.41 per fully diluted share versus
$130.2 million or $1.53 for the first six months of 1993.

lower than the $1,383.2 million reported in the first six months of
1993.

Donald B. Marron, PaineWebber's chairman and chief executive officer,
said: "While this was a difficult quarter as our results were burdened by both
the non-recurring mutual fund charge and reduced activity amongst our
institutional and retail customers, we are pleased that virtually all our
businesses generated positive operating results. To meet the challenges of this
significantly changed environment, we have adjusted inventory levels,
implemented a program to reduce discretionary spending and continued our
strategic investments in recruiting producers and in technology."

Mr. Marron added, "In spite of the difficulty of this period, we
believe our key strategies continue to serve us well. We have a strong, liquid
balance sheet, a solid recurring fee base, and a diversified group of
businesses."

Discussing the details of the quarter, Mr. Marron noted the following:

o Retail Sales and Marketing's profitability and
success in gathering client assets continued
despite a 14% decrease in revenues from the first
quarter of 1994. Assets under control rose 8% from
a year ago to $138.5 billion as of June 30, 1994.
In addition, the number of investment executives
totaled 5,500 at the end of the quarter, 300 more
than last year.

o Institutional Sales and Trading's equity sales
revenues were strong though lower than last year.
Fixed income results were affected by the
difficult market environment, particularly in the
mortgage business.

o Investment Banking was profitable, although
revenues declined 39% from a year ago due to lower
levels of corporate and municipal offerings. In
the current quarter, the firm managed or co-
managed:

o 206 municipal offerings raising
$10.0 billion 
o 21 equity offerings raising $2.6 billion
o 14 corporate debt offerings raising $2.3 billion

o PaineWebber's assets under management were $36.3
billion at the end of the quarter, a 3% decrease
from last year.

PaineWebber also announced today that it has made a firm bid, subject
to regulatory review, to purchase two structured floating rate securities from
the PaineWebber Short-Term U.S. Government Income Fund, a mutual fund managed
by its investment subsidiary, Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management Inc. This bid
to purchase these securities is for an aggregate price of approximately $180
million, their current value as reflected by the Fund.

Although these securities are U.S. government agency or AAA-rated and have
attractive cash flows, due to the recent reduction in the size of the Fund,
these securities now constitute an increased percentage of total assets. This
transaction will permit the Fund to maintain an appropriate mix of investments
based on the Fund's investment objectives and current size.

PaineWebber and Mitchell Hutchins also announced that Pacific Investment
Management Company ("PIMCO") has agreed to act as a consultant to Mitchell
Hutchins in connection with the Fund's portfolio. Founded in 1971, PIMCO is one
of the largest specialty fixed income fund managers, with assets under
management exceeding $50 billion, including $23.5 billion in mortgage-backed
securities. Mitchell Hutchins will promptly seek board and shareholder approval
to retain PIMCO as sub-advisor to Mitchell Hutchins in managing the Fund.

Paine Webber Group Inc., together with its subsidiaries PaineWebber
Incorporated and PaineWebber International, serves the international investment
and capital needs of a worldwide client base. The firm employs approximately
14,700 people in 283 offices worldwide. Total capital was $3.5 billion at June
30, 1994 and book value per share was $16.56. PaineWebber's total equity was
$1.2 billion.
