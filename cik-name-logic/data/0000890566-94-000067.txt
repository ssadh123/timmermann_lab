COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION
6 1/2% SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 1999

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes, bonds or
other evidences of indebtedness of the Issuer (hereinafter called the
'Securities') of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued
under and pursuant to an indenture dated as of March 1, 1994 (herein called the
'Indenture'), duly executed and delivered by the Issuer to NationsBank of Texas,
National Association, Trustee (herein called the 'Trustee'), to which Indenture
and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a
description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer and the holders of the
Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different
series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at
different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject
to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different
sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any) and may otherwise vary as provided
in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series designated as the 6 1/2% Senior
Notes Due March 15, 1999 of the Issuer, limited in aggregate principal amount to
$150,000,000.

In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred
and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such
declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and
subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee,
with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding (as defined in the
Indenture) of all series to be affected (voting as one class), evidenced as
provided in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of
the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the
rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the final maturity of any
Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate (or alter
the method of computation) of interest thereon or extend the time for payment
thereof, or reduce (or alter the method of computation of) any amount payable on
redemption or repayment thereof or extend the time for redemption or payment
thereof, or make the principal thereof or interest thereon (including any amount
in respect of original issue discount) payable in any coin or currency other
than that provided in the Securities and Coupons or in accordance with the terms
thereof, or reduce the amount that would be due and payable upon an acceleration
of the maturity of any Security or impair or affect the right of any
Securityholder to institute suit for the payment thereof or, if the Securities
provide therefor, any right of repayment at the option of the Securityholder, in
each case without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or
(ii) modify any of the provisions of Section 8.2 of the Indenture, except to
increase the percentage of Securities, the consent of the Holders of which is
required for any such supplemental indenture or waiver, without the consent of
the Holder of each Security affected. It is also provided in the Indenture that,
with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities
of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such
Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding
of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events
of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the
Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the
Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default
and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a
default (a) in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest
on any of the Securities or (b) in respect of a covenant or provision of the
Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder
of each Security affected. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note
(unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding
upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any
Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of
whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.

Initially, the Trustee (through its agent, NationsBank of Georgia, N.A., 715
Peachtree Street, 7th Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30308-1297) will act as Paying
Agent, Registrar and as the agent where notices and demands to or upon the
Company in respect of the Notes may be served. The Company may appoint and
change any Paying Agent, Registrar or agent for notices without notice, other
than notice to the Trustee. The Company or one of its subsidiaries may act as
Paying Agent, Registrar or agent for notices.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the
Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute
and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this
Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or
currency herein prescribed.

The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations
of $1000 and any integral multiple thereof at the office or agency of the Issuer
in the City of Atlanta, State of Georgia, and in the manner and subject to the
limitations provided in the Indenture, but without the payment of any service
charge, notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of
other authorized denominations.

Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office
or agency of the Issuer in the City of Atlanta, State of Georgia, a new Note or
Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will
be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations
provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other
governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.

The Issuer, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Issuer or the
Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of
this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any
notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving
payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and premium, if any, and
subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all other
purposes, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any authorized agent of the
Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity.

No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the
Issuer in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or
because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had
against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such of the
Issuer or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or
any successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional
provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released
by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
