SECTION 10.4. LIMITS OF INDEMNIFICATION. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the respective obligations of a party to indemnify
pursuant to this Article X shall be subject to the following limitations:

(A) MINIMUM. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section

only if and to the extent the aggregate indemnifiable Damages exceed
Ninety Thousand Dollars ($90,000), plus in the case of Seller and
Seller's Shareholders, "Excess

30
<PAGE> 38
Reserves;" provided, that once such threshold amount is reached it shall
not be applied again and, provided further, that any qualification as to
"materiality" or "knowledge" shall be disregarded in determining the
indemnifiable amounts and the extent to which the threshold amount has

(B) MAXIMUM. Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 10,
the maximum aggregate indemnification obligations of any party shall be
determined as follows: (i) with respect to the representations and
warranties as to (v) title of the Acquired Assets, (w) taxes, (x)

the event the Arbitrator determines that a party has acted fraudulently,
the maximum indemnification obligation shall be Six Million Dollars

(ii) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (02/28/94) = 100X
(iii) Uncollected Accounts Receivable (12/31/94) = 60X

inventory obsolescence reserve prior to adjustment as of February 28, 1994)

all representations, warranties, covenants, and indemnities related to
Hazardous Material or Environmental Law; (b) the Statutory Period plus thirty
(30) days for all representations, warranties, covenants, and indemnities
related to taxes, and (c) twenty-four (24) months for all other causes of
action; provided, however, that no

31
<PAGE> 39
representation or warranty shall be considered hereby to be repeated as of any
date subsequent to the Closing Date. "Statutory Period" shall mean the
limitation of time within which an action must be begun pursuant to applicable

party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to
specific performance of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.7. OTHER REMEDIES. Subject to the specific limitation
herein, nothing contained in this Article X shall be in lieu of, or constitute
a waiver of, any remedies at law or in equity that either party may otherwise
have against the other party or a shareholder or any present or former officer
or director of such other party.

SECTION 10.8. SATISFACTION OF AWARDS. In the event of a Dispute
resulting in an award in Purchaser's favor pursuant to Section 10.10, and the
entire award is not paid to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of its demand,
Purchaser shall first set-off such award against, or deduct from, any amounts
due to Seller and Seller's Shareholders pursuant to Section 9.13 or Schedule
2.5. Any awards in excess of amounts due pursuant to Section 9.13 or Schedule
2.5 shall next be satisfied from the Escrow Fund. No other set-off or
deduction shall be permitted including set-off against Assumed Liabilities, the
Employment Agreements or other obligations assumed by the Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements.

SECTION 10.9. DEFENSE OF CLAIMS. If any Claim is made by a third person
against a party hereto based on any action, proceeding or claim, the existence
of which would entitle such party to indemnification hereunder, such claiming
party shall with reasonable promptness give to the other party written notice
of the Claim, describing the nature of the claim to the extent known to the
claiming party, and request the other party to defend the same. The other
party shall have the right to compromise, defend or settle such Liability at
its expense, and shall give written notice to the claiming party of the
commencement of such defense with reasonable promptness after receipt of the
written notice of the Claim from the claiming party. Failure to receive notice
from the claiming party shall not relieve the other party of any Liability
which it might otherwise have to the claiming party under this Article X,
unless the other party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The claiming
party, its subsidiaries, successors and assigns shall be entitled to
participate with the other party in such defense, but shall not be entitled in
any way to release, waive, settle, modify or pay such Claim without the consent
of the other party if the other party has assumed such defense. In the event
the other party has assumed said defense and has employed counsel with respect
thereto, the claiming party shall also be entitled to employ counsel at its
expense. In the event the other party does not accept the defense of the
matter as provided above, the claiming party shall have the full right to
defend against such Liability, at the other party's expense, and shall be
entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such claimed Liability in its sole
discretion. In the event the other party shall assume the defense, the other
party and the claiming party, and their subsidiaries, successors and assigns,
shall cooperate

32
<PAGE> 40
in the defense of such action and the records of each shall be available to the
other with respect to such defense.

SECTION 10.10. ARBITRATION. The parties shall endeavor to resolve all
disputes by agreement and to that end shall each provide the other with
sufficient descriptions and information regarding its position to permit
informed assessments and decisions. Any disagreement, Claim, demand,
controversy, or dispute (collectively "Dispute") in any way arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and its performance or alleged breach, whether
involving questions of law or fact or both and regardless of the nature thereof
or the remedy therefor, which is not settled by agreement of the parties shall
be resolved as follows

(a) the party alleging a Dispute shall by notice to the other
party or parties, refer the Dispute to arbitration by a single
arbitrator, if one can be agreed upon;

(b) if with five (5) business days of the party alleging a Dispute
giving notice to the other party or parties, a single arbitrator cannot
be agreed upon, then each party shall select an arbitrator and such
arbitrators shall select a third from lists provided by the parties;

(c) the arbitration shall be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, or in
such other location as the parties may agree;

(d) the arbitrator(s) shall, in the final award, order the losing
party to pay all of the charges for such arbitration and all of the
prevailing party's costs of arbitration including without limitation
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, and expert witness fees and
disbursements;

(e) the decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and judgment
thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction;

(f) the arbitration proceedings and the decision of the
arbitrator(s) shall be completed with due diligence so as to avoid
unwarranted delays in resolution, and the arbitrator shall be jointly
instructed to complete the arbitration within twenty (20) business days
after commencement of the proceedings;

(g) other than in an action for entry of judgment on an
arbitration award, the existence of an arbitration proceeding commenced
pursuant to this Section shall be sufficient ground to stay any suit,
action, or proceeding instituted in any court or before an administrative
tribunal with respect to any such Dispute pending arbitration of such
Dispute and the arbitration award in connection with such Dispute shall
be a complete defense to any suit, action, or proceeding instituted in
any court or before an administrative tribunal with respect to such
Dispute; and

33
<PAGE> 41
(h) the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then
