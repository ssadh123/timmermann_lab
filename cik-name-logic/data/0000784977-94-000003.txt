REGULATORY MATTERS

On March 21, 1994 the Oregon Public Utility Commission (PUC) Staff filed a
motion with the PUC Hearings Officers to bifurcate Portland General Electric
Company's (PGE) November 8, 1993 rate request to separate issues related to the
Trojan Nuclear Plant (Trojan) and cost of capital from non-Trojan issues. PGE
is the principal subsidiary of Portland General Corporation (Portland General). 
See Portland General's and PGE's report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1993 for background information regarding the rate request.

Citing a need to retain an expert to review certain aspects of the rate request
relating to Trojan, the PUC Staff moved to separately consider issues relating
to Trojan, including decommissioning, operating expenses, taxes, return of
capital invested in the plant and return on the undepreciated investment. The
motion also asks that cost of capital evidence be heard with the Trojan issues
in order to allow consideration of the most current capital market information.
The motion amends the schedule to delay consideration of these issues until
August 1994. The other issues in the rate request will continue to be
addressed as originally scheduled.

PGE expects the motion to be acted upon in April 1994. PGE expects the PUC to
issue a single order addressing all rate case matters, including Trojan and
cost of capital issues, in late 1994.

Management continues to believe that the PUC will grant future revenues to
cover all, or substantially all, of Trojan costs with an appropriate return. 
However, management cannot predict, with certainty, the ultimate outcome of
this public process.
