ARTICLE I

CONSOLIDATION

1.1 The Consolidation. The Consolidation shall take
place upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the
California Financial Code, the California Corporations Code, the
Bank Merger Act, the National Bank Act and a plan of
consolidation substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached
hereto (the "Plan of Consolidation"), pursuant to which, at the
Effective Time:

(i) MergerSub shall be consolidated with Bank
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. { 215 under Bank's national banking
association charter and the separate corporate existence of
each of MergerSub and Bank shall thereupon cease; 

(ii) each share of stock of MergerSub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Consolidation and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into one share of
common stock of the resulting consolidated association (the
"Consolidated Association"); 

(iii) subject to Sections 1.3 and 1.4 hereof, each
share of Bank Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Consolidation and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive from Buyer, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such share, the consideration specified in
Section 1.2 hereof (the "Consolidation Consideration");
provided, however, that each share of Bank Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held in
the treasury of Bank shall be cancelled and no payment shall
be made or other consideration delivered in respect thereof;
and

(iv) the directors of MergerSub at the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Consolidated Association
and the officers of MergerSub at the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Consolidated Association, in each case
until their respective successors are duly elected and have
qualified.

<PAGE>
1.2 Consolidation Consideration. Subject to
Sections 1.3 and 1.4 hereof, as of the Effective Time, each share
of Bank Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares held in the treasury of
Bank) shall, by virtue of the Consolidation and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the following (the
"Consolidation Consideration"): 

(a) cash (the "Cash Amount") in the amount of the
quotient of (i) $3,930,000 less the amount of any Excess
Expenses, divided by (ii) the total number of shares of Bank
Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time (the
"Outstanding Shares"); 

(b) an additional amount in cash (the "Mark-to-
Market Amount") equal to the quotient of (i) the Net Unrealized
Gains, if any, as of the end of the month immediately preceding
the Closing Date in the portfolio of investment securities owned
by Bank on such date, determined in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Schedule 1.2(b) hereto, divided by
(ii) the Outstanding Shares; 

(c) that fraction of a share of the common stock,
no par value per share, of Buyer (the "Buyer Common Stock")
(calculated to the nearest ten thousandth) as shall equal the
quotient of (i) $2,500,000 divided by (ii) the product of the
Book Value per Share multiplied by the Outstanding Shares; and 

(d) a contingent cash payment (the "Contingent
Payment") in the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Contingent
Payment Right") representing the right to receive an additional
payment in cash of an amount equal to the quotient of (i) 50% of
the Unutilized Closing Reserve determined in accordance with
Schedule 1.2(d) hereto up to a maximum of $1,000,000, divided by
(ii) the Outstanding Shares, together with interest thereon,
compounded annually, at the annual rate of four percent (4%) in
excess of the average weekly interest rate from time to time
prevailing for one-year Treasury bills, such interest to accrue
from the Initial Computation Date to but excluding the payment
date. The Contingent Payment shall be payable on the terms and
conditions and at the time set forth in Schedule 1.2(d).

1.3 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock shall be issued in the Consolidation. If any holder
of Bank Common Stock would otherwise be entitled

<PAGE>
to receive a fractional share pursuant to the terms of
Section 1.2(c) above, such holder shall receive, in lieu thereof,
a cash adjustment for such fraction in an amount equal to the
product determined by multiplying such fraction by the Book Value
per Share.

1.4 Dissenters. Each stockholder of Bank (the
"Stockholders") that is entitled to dissenters' rights pursuant
to the National Bank Act on the date of the meeting of
Stockholders held pursuant to Section 5.8 hereof (the "Bank
Stockholders' Meeting") and that continues to be so entitled
under the National Bank Act is referred to herein as a
"Dissenter". Each outstanding share of Bank Common Stock that is
held by a Dissenter (a "Dissenting Share") shall be converted
into the rights provided by the National Bank Act for Dissenters.

1.5 Letter of Transmittal. Certificates representing
Bank Common Stock shall be delivered in exchange for the
Consolidation Consideration as follows: Buyer shall prepare a
form (the "Form of Transmittal Letter") pursuant to which each
Stockholder shall transmit the certificate or certificates
representing such Stockholder's Bank Common Stock to Buyer in
exchange for such Stockholder's pro rata share of the
Consolidation Consideration. Buyer shall mail such Form of
Transmittal Letter to the Stockholders as promptly as practicable
on or about, but no later than two (2) business days after, the
Effective Time.

1.6 Surrender of Bank Stock Certificates.

(a) Buyer shall select an agent reasonably
acceptable to Bank and Seller (the "Exchange and Paying Agent")
to effect the exchange of Bank Common Stock for the Consolidation
Consideration. On or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange and Paying
Agent, in trust for the benefit of the Stockholders, (i) cash in
the aggregate amount equal to the product of (A) the sum of the
Cash Amount plus the Mark-to-Market Amount, multiplied by (B) the
Outstanding Shares, and (ii) stock certificates representing the
requisite number of shares of Buyer Common Stock and other
certificates representing the Contingent Payment Right. Until
surrender to the Exchange and Paying Agent, together with a
properly completed and executed Form of Transmittal Letter, each
certificate evidencing Bank Common Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares) shall, on and after the Effective Time, be deemed for all
corporate purposes to represent and evidence only the right to
receive a pro rata portion of the Consolidation Consideration. 
Subject to the provisions of 

<PAGE>
this paragraph concerning lost or stolen certificates, until any
such certificate evidencing Bank Common Stock shall have been so
surrendered, the holder of such Bank Common Stock shall not have
any right to receive such holder's pro rata portion of the
Consolidation Consideration. The payment of the Consolidation
Consideration shall be made by the Exchange and Paying Agent to
any holder of Bank Common Stock who validly delivers at least
300,000 shares of Bank Common Stock in the Consolidation,
together with the Form of Transmittal Letter, duly executed, and
such holder's certificate or certificates representing such
holder's Bank Common Stock, on or after the Effective Time, by
wire transfer of the cash portion of the Consolidation
Consideration to such holder within two business days after the
later of the Effective Time or the date of such delivery, and by
transmittal of the other portion of the Consolidation
Consideration by overnight courier, insured, within two business
days after the later of the Effective Time or the date of such
delivery. The Exchange and Paying Agent shall be authorized to
issue the appropriate portion of the Consolidation Consideration
for any Bank Common Stock certificate which has been lost, stolen
or destroyed upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to
the Exchange and Paying Agent and Buyer of ownership of the Bank
Common Stock represented thereby, and after indemnification
reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange and Paying Agent and
Buyer. After the Effective Time, no holder of a certificate
evidencing shares of Bank Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive any dividends or other distributions otherwise payable to
holders of record of Buyer Common Stock on any date subsequent to
the Effective Time, unless such holder is entitled to receive
Buyer Common Stock and in such event unless such holder shall
have surrendered such holder's certificates evidencing shares of
Bank Common Stock in exchange for a pro rata portion of the
Consolidation Consideration, provided that such surrender shall
not deprive such holder of any dividends or distributions to
which such holder is entitled as a record holder of Buyer Common
Stock as of a date prior to such surrender. Upon surrender of
such certificates, there shall be paid to the holder so
surrendering such certificates the amount, without interest, of
any cash dividends and any other distributions which theretofore
and subsequent to the Effective Time had been distributed on the
whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock into which such Bank
Common Stock was converted at the Effective Time. All expenses
of the Exchange and Paying Agent will be paid directly by Buyer. 

(b) If any check for cash, any certificate for
Buyer Common Stock or any Contingent Payment Right, is to be
issued hereunder in a name other than that in which

<PAGE>
the certificate(s) for Bank Common Stock surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange
that the person requesting such exchange shall establish the
right to receive such shares or cash and shall pay to the
Exchange and Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of such check or such certificates in a
name other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange and Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

1.7 Closing Date. The closing (the "Closing") of the
Consolidation shall take place on the date to which Buyer, Bank
and Seller may agree (the "Closing Date"); provided, however,
that in the absence of an agreement by the parties to the
contrary, such Closing Date shall be the last Business Day of the
week following the week in which the last of the Regulatory
Approvals set forth in Article VI have been obtained, provided
the other conditions to Closing are satisfied or waived on or
prior to such date.

1.8 Procedure. Buyer, MergerSub and Bank shall
(i) prepare, execute and acknowledge the Plan of Consolidation in
accordance with 12 U.S.C. { 215, (ii) file the Plan of
Consolidation and/or such other documents with the FDIC and the
California Superintendent of Banks (the "Superintendent") for
approval and (iii) upon receipt of such approvals, file the Plan
of Consolidation and/or such other documents with the OCC in such
manner that the Consolidation becomes effective on the Closing
Date. The date and time on which the Consolidation becomes
effective on the Closing Date is herein referred to as the
"Effective Time." Buyer, MergerSub and Bank shall take all such
other and further actions as may be required by Applicable Law to
make the Consolidation effective on the Closing Date. If at any
time Buyer shall be advised that any further assignment or
assurances in law or any other actions are reasonably necessary
or desirable to vest the title of any property or rights of Bank
in the Consolidated Association after the Effective Time, upon
the reasonable request of Buyer, Bank shall take all such action
as may be necessary or desirable to vest title in such property
or rights in the Consolidated Association after the Effective
Time.

1.9 Representative. On the Closing Date, the
Stockholders shall, by virtue of their approval of this Agreement
and the Consolidation by the requisite vote of such Stockholders
be deemed, for themselves and their heirs, representatives,
successors and assigns, to have constituted and appointed,
effective from and after the Effective Time, Seller as their
agent and attorney-in-fact (the

<PAGE>
"Representative") to take all action required or permitted herein
with respect to the interests and rights of the Stockholders in
ascertaining the amount of the Unutilized Closing Reserve for
purposes of Section 1.2(d) hereof. Seller shall remain the
Representative of the Stockholders for purposes of determining
the amount of the Unutilized Closing Reserve notwithstanding any
transfer by Seller of any of the shares of Buyer Common Stock
acquired by Seller in the Consolidation. In the event that
(a) Seller disposes of its entire Contingent Payment Right,
(b) Seller is adjudicated a bankrupt, (c) Seller files, or there
is filed against Seller, a petition for an arrangement or
reorganization under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, (d) Seller
makes any assignment for the benefit of its creditors or (e) a
receiver or trustee is appointed for Seller or any substantial
part of its business or assets (including, without limitation,
Sunwest Bank), then three Stockholders (consisting of John F.
McGrath, Jack M. Kimmel, and Stanley J. Nielsen) who shall act by
majority vote, shall succeed Seller as Representative (it being
understood that if any of such three then shall be unable to
serve or refuse to serve, the remaining of such three shall
select a successor or, if all three such Stockholders then are
unable or unwilling to serve, then holders of a majority in
interest of the Contingent Payment Rights shall select a
successor). The Representative shall not be liable for any good
faith error or judgment on its part or for any action done or
omitted in good faith by it in connection with its duties as the
Representative hereunder, except for gross negligence or willful
misconduct. All fees and expenses incurred by the Representative
in performing its duties hereunder (including legal fees and
expenses related thereto) shall be severally borne by the holders
of the Contingent Payment Rights in proportion to the percentage
of the Contingent Payment payable to each such holder and shall
reduce the amount of the Contingent Payment otherwise payable to
all such holders. In taking any action whatsoever with respect
to the determination of the Unutilized Closing Reserve, the
Representative shall be protected in relying upon any notice,
paper or other document reasonably believed by it to be genuine,
or upon any evidence reasonably deemed by it to be sufficient. 
The Representative may consult with counsel in connection with
its duties hereunder and shall be fully protected in any act
taken, suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance
with the advice of counsel.

(c) any increase in the compensation or benefits
payable or to become payable by Bank to any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents except in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice (provided, however,
that nothing herein shall prohibit Bank from funding any Plans or
making any payments to beneficiaries under such Plans in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, and
in compliance with the terms of such Plans); 

(d) any amendment or termination of any agreement

prudent banking practice.

3.9 Compliance with Applicable Laws. The business of
Bank is not being conducted in conflict with or violation of, nor
has it been conducted in conflict with or violation of, any
Applicable Law or Governmental Authorization, except for any such
conflicts or violations which, individually or in the aggregate,
cannot reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect

used by Bank are or were in compliance with all Applicable Laws
and Governmental Authorizations as in effect at the relevant
time, except for any instances of noncompliance which,
individually or in the aggregate, cannot reasonably be expected

regulatory examinations conducted in the ordinary course, no
investigation or review by any Governmental Authority concerning
any such possible conflicts or violations is pending, nor to

regulatory examinations. Bank is not (i) a party to any written
agreement, stipulation, conditional approval or memorandum of
understanding with any Governmental Authority or (ii) except as

Bank, and, to Seller's and Bank's knowledge, of the other party

conservatorship or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
of insured depositary institutions generally and the availability
of equitable remedies), and is in full force and effect; Bank has
duly performed in all material respects all of its obligations
thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have
accrued; there are no material breaches, violations or defaults
by Bank, or to Seller's and Bank's knowledge, by the other party

(b) Each lease of Bank Real Property is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Bank, and, to Seller's and Bank's
knowledge, the other parties thereto enforceable in accordance

similar laws affecting the rights of creditors of insured
depository institutions generally and the availability of
equitable remedies), and is in full force and effect; there are
no existing material defaults by Bank or, to Seller's and Bank's

district assessments, easements, covenants, restrictions and
other matters of record or otherwise which do not individually or
in the aggregate

<PAGE>
materially adversely affect the use and enjoyment of the relevant
Bank Real Property.

(d) To Seller's and Bank's knowledge, none of the
buildings and structures located on any Bank Real Property, nor
any appurtenances thereto or equipment thereon, nor the operation
or maintenance thereof, violates in any manner any restrictive
covenants or encroaches on any property owned by others, nor does
any building or structure of third parties encroach upon any Bank
Real Property. To Seller's and Bank's knowledge, no condemnation
proceeding is pending or threatened that would preclude or impair
the use of any Bank Real Property for the uses for which it is
currently being used.

(e) To Seller's and Bank's knowledge, all
buildings used in the business of Bank are in all material
respects adequately maintained and are free from defects which
could materially interfere with the current or future use of such
facilities.

3.13 Personal Property. Bank has good title to, or a

encumbrances except (a) statutory liens for amounts not yet
delinquent or which are being contested in good faith through
proper proceedings, and (b) such other liens, charges,
encumbrances and imperfections of title as do not individually or
in the aggregate materially adversely affect the use and
enjoyment of the relevant Bank Personalty. Subject to ordinary
wear and tear, the Bank Personalty is in good operating condition
and repair and is adequate for the uses to which it is being put.

3.14 Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.14,
there are no suits, claims, actions, investigations or

Seller's or Bank's knowledge, threatened (as used in this
Agreement, the term "threatened" shall include matters that are
to the knowledge of Seller or Bank under consideration or
investigation whether or not any formal demand has been made)
against or otherwise involving, directly or indirectly, Seller or
Bank or any of their respective properties or assets or any
judgment, decree, order or injunction against Seller or Bank
that, in either case, individually or in the aggregate, can
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank,
and, to Seller's and Bank's knowledge, there are no existing
facts

<PAGE>
or circumstances that are sufficient to provide a basis for any
of the foregoing.

each Plan identified in such Schedule and its related trust, if
any, are qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and
Section 501(a) of the Code and have been determined by the
Internal Revenue Service to qualify. Such determination does not
take into account those provisions of the Code that now apply to
such Plan but which are not yet required to have been implemented
by way of amendments to the Plan document by reason of
Section 1140 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, as amended. Nothing
has occurred since the date of the determination letter to cause

any fiduciary has any knowledge of any facts which could
give rise to any such action or claim.

required under Section 302(e) of ERISA or Section 412(m) of the

there are no negotiations, demands or proposals which are pending
or have been made which concern matters now covered, or that
would be covered, by the type of agreements listed in
Schedule 3.17(a).

(m) All expenses and Liabilities relating to all
of the Plans described in Schedule 3.17(a) have been and will on

delivered to Seller or Bank by Buyer pursuant hereto, and no

contemplated hereby, contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to

After the date hereof through the Closing Date, each party to
this Agreement shall notify the other party promptly both orally
and in writing (i) after becoming aware of the occurrence of, or
the impending or threatened occurrence of, any event that would
constitute a breach on its part of any obligation under this
Agreement or the occurrence of any event that would cause any
representation or warranty made by it herein to be false or
misleading in any material respect if such representation and
warranty were restated at such time, (ii) upon the occurrence of,
or the discovery of, any event that could reasonably be expected
to cause it to be unable to satisfy a condition to the other
party's obligation to proceed with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) of any matter hereafter arising that if
existing or occurring at or prior to the date of this Agreement
would have been required to be set forth or described in a
Schedule hereto or as an exception to a representation or
warranty made herein. From time to time but not later than two
business days prior to the Closing Date, the parties may
supplement or amend the Schedules hereto in writing to disclose
any event which occurs after the date hereof and prior to the

supplemented or amended if the event otherwise permitted to be
disclosed has had or might reasonably be expected to have, in the
judgment of the party or parties to whom the representations and
warranties pertaining to such matter were made, a material
adverse significance with respect to such party or parties. If
the Closing occurs and any of the parties had theretofore sought
to supplement or amend the Schedules in accordance with the
foregoing sentence and such supplementation or amendment was not
permitted by virtue of the proviso to such sentence, then, as of
and after the Closing Date, the Schedule(s) shall nevertheless be
deemed to be so amended or supplemented.

5.12 No Shopping.

(a) Bank and Seller shall not, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, employee or agent or otherwise,
(i) solicit, initiate, or encourage any Acquisition Proposal, or,
(ii) subject to the requirements

<PAGE>
imposed by any Governmental Authority, participate in any
negotiation in respect of or cooperate with (including, without
limitation, by way of furnishing any nonpublic information
concerning the business, properties or assets of Bank or any
access to such properties or assets) any Acquisition Proposal,
unless Bank or Seller, as applicable, shall have received a
written opinion of its outside counsel stating that such action
should be taken in order for its Board of Directors to fulfill
its fiduciary duties and then only for a period of ten (10)
business days, at which point Bank, or Seller, as applicable,
must either (A) terminate the negotiations and/or cooperation
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or (B) having made the
appropriate findings in accordance with Section 7.1(e) hereof,
notify Buyer, in accordance with Section 7.1(e), of its receipt
of a Superior Offer. Seller and Bank shall notify Buyer promptly
by telephone, and thereafter promptly confirm such notification
in writing, if any such information is requested from, or any
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal is received by, Seller, Bank or any Subsidiary and shall
provide Buyer with a reasonably detailed description of the
contents thereof, including without limitation, the identity of
the other persons or entities involved.

(b) Unless Bank or Seller, as applicable, shall
exercise its right to terminate this Agreement

<PAGE>
pursuant to Section 7.1(e) hereof, no Acquisition Proposal shall
be accepted, approved, adopted or recommended by the Board of
Directors of Bank, Seller or any Subsidiary thereof, or presented
by Bank or any Subsidiary, or by their respective Boards of
Directors or managements, to the Stockholders for vote or
approval by written consent, and no such meeting of Stockholders
shall be called or noticed for purposes of taking Stockholder
action with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Unless Bank shall exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) hereof, the
Board of Directors of Bank shall not rescind the approval of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
Bank shall not withdraw its recommendation to the Stockholders to
vote their shares of Bank Common Stock in favor of the
Consolidation and, unless Seller shall exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) hereof, the
Board of Directors of Seller shall not rescind the approval of
this Agreement or of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Unless Bank or Seller, as applicable, shall
exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(e) hereof, or except as otherwise required by any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with respect to a
party, Bank and Seller shall not, and cause their respective
Subsidiaries not to, prepare or assist in the preparation of or
file or assist in the filing of any notice or application to any
Governmental Authority pertaining to or seeking approval of any
change in control incident to or which would result from any
Acquisition Proposal.

5.13 No Inconsistent Actions. None of the parties
hereto will voluntarily take any action if, to the knowledge of
such party after due inquiry, the effect of such action would be
to cause any of its representations and warranties herein to be
inaccurate in any material respect at the Closing or at any time
prior to the Closing as if such representation and warranty were
restated at such time (except to the extent such representations
and warranties speak as of a specific date, in which case they
shall be deemed to have been restated when required hereunder but
only as of such specific date).

5.14 Taxes; Consent. Seller shall prepare and timely
file all Returns and amendments thereto required to be filed by
the Group on or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall have a
reasonable opportunity to review all Group income tax Returns and
amendments thereto filed during such period and all other Returns
required to be filed by Bank during such period prior to filing. 
Seller and each member of the Group shall pay and discharge all
Taxes, assessments and governmental charges upon or against it or
any of its properties or assets, and all liabilities at any time
existing, before the same shall become delinquent and before
penalties accrue thereon, except to the extent and as long as: 
(a) the same are being contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings pursued diligently and in such a manner as not to
cause any material adverse effect upon the condition (financial
or otherwise) or operations of Bank; and (b) the Group shall have
set aside on its books reserves (segregated to the extent
required by sound accounting practice) in the amount of the
demanded principal imposition (together with interest and
penalties relating thereto, if any).

5.15 Post-Closing Tax Matters.

(a) For purposes of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-76(b), the Consolidation shall be deemed to occur
immediately prior to the opening of business on the Closing Date. 
The tax effects of all Closing Date transactions of the Bank
shall be reported on the

<PAGE>
consolidated income tax return of the affiliated group that
includes Buyer rather than that of Seller. Buyer and Seller
mutually agree that their respective income tax Returns will be
filed in accordance with the agreement in the foregoing two
sentences, and that their permanent books and records will also
reflect such treatment. 

(b) Seller shall pay all Taxes that may be due
after the Closing Date that are allocable to the period ending on
the day prior to the Closing Date. In order appropriately to
apportion any of these Taxes relating to a period that includes
(but that would not, but for this section, close on) the Closing
Date, the parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, elect with the relevant taxing authorities to
treat for all purposes the day prior to the Closing Date as the
last day of a taxable period of Bank, and such period shall be
treated as a "Short Period" and a "Pre-Closing Period" for
purposes of this Agreement. In any case where applicable law
does not permit Bank to treat the day prior to the Closing Date
as the last day of a Short Period, then for purposes of this
Agreement, the portion of such Taxes that is attributable to the
operations of Bank for such Interim Period (as defined below)
shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are not based on income or
gross receipts, the total amount of such Taxes for the period in
question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Interim Period, and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in the entire period in
question, and (ii) in the case of Taxes that are based on income
or gross receipts, the Taxes that would be due with respect to
the Interim Period, if such Interim Period were a Short Period. 
"Interim Period" means with respect to any Taxes imposed on Bank
on a periodic basis for which the day prior to the Closing Date
is not the last day of a Short period, the period of time
beginning on the first day of the actual taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the day prior to the Closing Date

5.21 Seller's Covenants Regarding the Shares. 

(a) Seller hereby covenants with Buyer that,
subject to Seller's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(e): 

(i) Seller shall vote the Shares, all
additional shares of Bank Common Stock of which it is the
beneficial owner ("Additional Shares"), and any New Shares (as
hereinafter defined), and it shall cause any holder of record of

(A) in favor of approval and adoption of

contemplated hereby; and

similar proposal and against any action or agreement that
would result in a breach in any material respect of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other covenant or
agreement of Bank or Seller hereunder.

(ii) Seller shall not, and shall not permit
any entity under Seller's control to deposit any of its Shares,
Additional Shares, or any New Shares in a voting trust or subject
any of its Shares, Additional Shares, or New Shares to any
arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting of such
Shares, Additional Shares or New Shares, other than agreements
entered into with Buyer or MergerSub.

(iii) Seller shall not, and shall not permit
any entity under its control to (A) solicit proxies

<PAGE>
or become a "participant" in any "solicitation" (as such terms
are defined in Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act) in
opposition to or in competition with the consummation of the
Consolidation, (B) except as otherwise permitted in
Section 5.12(a)(ii), otherwise encourage or assist any party in
taking or planning any action that would compete with, restrain
or otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely
consummation of the Consolidation in accordance with the terms
hereof, (C) initiate a Stockholder's vote or action by consent of
Stockholders in opposition or in competition with the
consummation of the Consolidation or (D) become a member of a

purpose of opposing or competing with the consummation of the
Consolidation.

(iv) Seller agrees not to transfer, sell,
offer or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Shares, any
Additional Shares, or any New Shares, except where as a condition
to such transfer the transferee of such Shares, Additional Shares
or New Shares agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement as if such transferee were a party hereto.

(v) Seller agrees that it shall not purchase
or otherwise acquire beneficial ownership of any shares of Bank
Common Stock after the execution of this Agreement ("New
Shares"), including shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of
options, nor will it acquire the right to vote or share in the
voting of any shares of Bank Common Stock other than the Shares
or any New Shares, unless it delivers to Buyer immediately prior

Seller fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed by
this Section on it, that every such obligation is material and
that, in the event of any such failure, the other party will not
have an adequate remedy at law or damages, and, accordingly, the
parties hereto agree that injunctive relief or other equitable
remedy, in addition to remedies at law or damages, is the
appropriate remedy for any such failure.

shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless after the Effective

damages or liabilities arising by reason of the fact that he or
she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of Bank to
the full extent then permitted under Applicable Law and by Bank's
Articles of Association and Bylaws as in effect as of the
Effective Time. In the event that any claim or claims are
asserted or made with respect to such persons within such five-
year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such
claim or claims shall continue until the final disposition of any
and all such claims. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer, to the full extent then permitted under
Applicable Law, shall periodically advance expenses incurred with
respect to the foregoing to the full extent then permitted under
Applicable Law, provided that the person to whom the expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification. Buyer's obligations under this Section 5.24
shall not be altered by, and shall remain in full force and
effect following, the consummation of the Mergers. If Buyer or
any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or
merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of Buyer
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.24.

representatives.

immediately prior to the Closing Date who become employees of
Buyer as of the Closing Date ("Transferred Employees") shall be
entitled to participate in all employee benefit plans and
arrangements maintained by Buyer for the benefit of its employees
in accordance with the terms thereof. For purposes of
determining each such Transferred Employee's eligibility and
vesting under such employee benefit plans and arrangements, Buyer
shall recognize such Transferred Employee's service with Bank or
Seller beginning on the date such Transferred Employee commenced
employment with Bank or Seller. Buyer further covenants and
agrees that any pre-existing condition, limitation or exclusion
in its health plans shall not apply to Transferred Employees or
their covered dependents who are covered under similar Bank or
Seller health plans on the Closing Date and who change coverage
to Buyer's health plans at the time such Transferred Employees
are first given the option to enroll in Buyer's health plans.

5.26 Disposition of Bank's Employee Benefit Plans. Bank
or Seller shall take any actions necessary or reasonably
requested by Buyer to cause, on or before the Closing Date, the
termination of all of the employee benefit plans maintained by
Bank and the termination of Bank's participation in employee
benefit plans maintained by Seller, including Seller's 401(k)
Plan, which cover Bank's employees; provided, however, that all
Transferred Employees who are participants of Seller's 401(k)
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date shall cease
participation in such Plan as of the Closing Date but shall not
receive distribution of their benefits from such Plan until the
earliest to occur of their termination of employment with Buyer,
death, disability, retirement or the termination of Buyer's
401(k) plan. Seller shall maintain responsibility for the
administration of the Transferred Employees' accounts under
Seller's 401(k) Plan until Seller has distributed all benefits
under such Plan to the Transferred Employees as provided herein,
and Buyer shall have no responsibility or liability therefor.

before the Closing Date, and (4) attributable to any discharge of
indebtedness that may result from any capital contributions by
Seller (or an affiliate of Seller) to Bank of any intercompany
indebtedness owed to Seller (or an affiliate of Seller) by Bank,
except to the extent provision or reserve in respect thereof is
made in the Financial Statements or the Interim Financial
Statements.

subject to Sections 8.4, 8.5 and 9.1 hereof, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold Seller, and its successors, assigns, officers,

(a) any untruth, inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement as of the Closing Date
or in any agreement or document delivered by Buyer as of the
Closing Date in connection herewith; and (b) the non-performance
by Buyer of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement
that is required to be performed after the Closing Date.

8.3 Third Party Claims. The obligations of the
indemnifying persons hereunder with respect to claims resulting
from the assertion of any liability by third parties shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions: 

(a) The indemnified persons shall promptly give
written notice to the indemnifying person of any assertion of
liability by a third party which might give rise to a claim by
the indemnified persons against the indemnifying person based on
the indemnity agreements contained herein, stating the nature and
basis of said assertion and the amount thereof, to the extent
known. No 

<PAGE>
indemnification provided for herein shall be available to any
indemnified person who shall fail to give such notice, if the
indemnifying person was unaware of the assertion of liability to
which such notice would have related and was prejudiced by the
failure to give the notice, but the omission so to notify such
indemnifying person shall not relieve such indemnifying person
from any liability it may otherwise have to the indemnified
person in connection therewith.

(b) Except as provided in Sections 8.3(c) and (e),
in the event any action, suit or proceeding is brought against
the indemnified persons with respect to which the indemnifying
person may have liability under any indemnity agreement contained
herein, the action, suit or proceeding shall, upon the written
agreement of the indemnifying person that it is obligated to
indemnify under the indemnity agreement contained herein, be
defended (including all proceedings on appeal or review which
counsel for the defendant shall deem appropriate) by the
indemnifying person. The indemnified person shall have the right
to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
indemnified persons unless (i) the employment of such counsel
shall have been authorized by the indemnifying person in
connection with the defense of such action, suit or proceeding,
(ii) the indemnifying person shall not have agreed, promptly
after the notice to it provided in subsection (a) above, that it
is obligated to indemnify under any indemnity agreement contained
herein or (iii) such indemnified persons shall have reasonably
concluded that such action, suit or proceeding involves to a
significant extent matters beyond the scope of any applicable
indemnity agreement contained herein, or that there may be
defenses available to it (or them) that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying person, in any
of which events the indemnifying person shall not have the right
to direct the defense of such action, suit or proceeding on
behalf of the indemnified persons and that portion of such fees
and expenses reasonably related to matters covered by the
indemnity agreements contained herein shall be borne by the
indemnifying person, provided, however, that the indemnifying
party shall not be required to pay for more than one firm of
counsel to represent the indemnified parties in any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding. The indemnified and indemnifying
persons shall be kept fully informed of such action, suit or
proceeding at all stages thereof whether or not they are so
represented. The indemnifying and indemnified person shall make
available to the other persons and their attorneys and
accountants all books and records of the indemnifying person
relating to

<PAGE>
such proceedings or litigation and the parties hereto agree to
render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably
require of each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of any such action, suit or proceeding. The parties
agree to cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in full the
confidentiality of all confidential business records and the
attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection
therewith, each party agrees that (a) it will use its reasonable
efforts, in any action, suit or proceeding in which it is assumed
or participated in the defense, to avoid production of
confidential business records and (b) all communications between
any party hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in
the defense of any action, suit or proceeding shall, to the
extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable
attorney-client or work-product privilege.

(c) In the case of any audit, examination or other
proceeding ("Proceeding") with respect to Taxes for which Seller
is or may be liable pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall
promptly inform Seller, and Buyer shall execute or cause to be
executed powers of attorney or other documents necessary to
enable Seller to take all actions desired by Seller with respect
to such Proceeding to the extent such Proceeding may affect the
amount of Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to this
Agreement. Seller shall have the right to control any such
Proceedings, and, if there is a reasonable basis therefor, to
initiate any claim for refund, file any amended return or take
any other action which it deems appropriate with respect to such
Taxes. If reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller shall provide to
Buyer an opinion in form and content reasonably acceptable to
Buyer from counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer that there is a
reasonable basis (as such term is defined for purposes of section
6662 of the Code) for the position that Seller is taking with
respect to such action, and Buyer need not and Seller shall not
take such action until such opinion is delivered to Buyer. Any
Proceeding with respect to Taxes for a period which includes but
does not end on the day prior to the Closing Date shall be
controlled jointly by Seller and Buyer. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Section 8.3(c) to the contrary, Seller shall
not have the right to control any Proceeding, to initiate any
claim for refund, to file any amended return or to take any other
action if, as a result of such Proceeding, claim for refund,
amended return or other action, the Taxes payable by Buyer or
Bank for a taxable period for which Seller is not obligated to
indemnify Buyer or Bank would be likely to be materially
increased.

<PAGE>

(d) Except as set forth in Section 8.3(e) below,
the indemnifying person shall not make any settlement of any
claims without the written consent of the indemnified persons,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld unless the
indemnified persons shall have reasonably concluded that the
claim or settlement thereof involves to a significant extent
matters beyond the scope of any applicable indemnity agreement
contained herein.

(e) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Section 8.3, Buyer shall have the right to conduct the defense of
the Enterprise Litigation with counsel selected by Buyer and
reasonably acceptable to Seller, but shall not have the right to
make any settlement of the Enterprise Litigation without the
prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

8.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, no indemnifying person shall have any liability
under this Article VIII:

(i) For any Losses or other liabilities to
the extent covered by the proceeds of any insurance carried
by the indemnified person;

(ii) Subject to the provisions of paragraph
(b) below, until the aggregate amount of the Losses for
which such indemnifying person would otherwise be liable
under this Article VIII shall exceed $100,000, in which case
the indemnifying person's obligation shall apply only to
Losses that exceed $100,000. 

(b) The limitation imposed by paragraph (a)(ii)
above shall not apply to Seller's indemnity obligation under
Section 8.1(a) hereof, and the amount of any verdict, judgment or
settlement reached in connection therewith that is not subject to
indemnification because it is at or below the $250,000 threshold
set forth in Section 8.1(a) shall reduce the $100,000 threshold
set forth in paragraph (a)(ii) above as it applies to Losses for
which Seller is the indemnifying person.

(c) No indemnified person shall be entitled to
make a claim against any indemnifying person pursuant to this
Article VIII unless a notice of such claim shall have been given
in accordance with Sections 8.3(a) and 9.2 hereof prior to the
applicable Termination Date.

<PAGE>

8.5 Maximum Liability. The maximum liability of the
indemnifying person for Losses and other liabilities under this
Article VIII and any expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending or asserting any claim, action, suit or
proceeding incident to any matter indemnified against hereunder,
shall not exceed $2,500,000. 

8.6 Right of Set-Off. Buyer shall have the right to
set-off against any amounts payable by Buyer to Seller under
Section 1.2(d) hereof (or to Seller's assignees) the amount of
any Losses and other liabilities incurred by Buyer for which
Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Sections 8.1(a)
or 8.1(b)(iii) hereof.

9.3 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. This
Agreement and the legal relations between the parties shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of California without taking into account provisions
regarding choice of law.

9.4 Entire Agreement. All exhibits and schedules
referred to in this Agreement are integral parts hereof, and

<PAGE>
this Agreement, together with such exhibits and schedules, 
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the matters herein and therein and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings between the parties with
respect thereto.

9.5 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be
amended except upon the written consent of (a) each party hereto
prior to the Effective Time and (b) Buyer and Seller after the
Effective Time, except that if such amendment relates to the
Contingent Payment Right, such amendment shall require the
consent of Buyer and the Representative. By an instrument in
writing, Buyer may waive compliance by Seller, Bank or the
Representative, and Seller and Bank, acting jointly, may waive
compliance by Buyer, with any term or provision of this
Agreement, other than of any obligations of Bank relating to the
Contingent Payment Right, which shall require the waiver of the
Representative acting alone, that such other party was or is
obligated to comply with or perform; provided, however, that such
waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect
to, any other or subsequent failure. No failure to exercise and
no delay in exercising any right, remedy or power hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy or power provided herein or by law or in equity. 
The waiver by any party of the time for performance of any act or
condition hereunder does not constitute a waiver of the act or
condition itself. Any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement may be waived, amended or modified in whole or in part
at any time before or after the approval of the Agreement by the
Shareholders or the Stockholders, to the extent authorized by
Applicable Law, by a writing signed by (i) Buyer, Seller and Bank
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) Buyer and Seller after the
Effective Time, except that if such waiver, amendment or
modification relates to the Contingent Payment Right, such
waiver, amendment or modification shall require the consent of
Buyer and the Representative. Unless required by Applicable Law,
no such waiver, amendment or modification effected after
Shareholder or Stockholder approval shall require further
Shareholder or Stockholder approval.

9.6 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof to any Person, place or circumstance,
shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
unenforceable or void, the remainder of this Agreement and such
provisions as applied to other Persons, places and circumstances
shall remain in

<PAGE>
full force and effect, subject to Sections 7.2 and 9.1 hereof,
only if, after excluding the portion deemed to be unenforceable,
the remaining terms shall provide for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in substantially the same manner
as originally set forth at the later of the date this Agreement
was executed or last amended.

9.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

9.8 Interpretation of Agreement. The article, section
and other headings used in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not constitute a part hereof or affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

9.9 Expenses and Liquidated Damages.

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) below,
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Mergers) will be paid by the
party incurring such costs and expenses, except that (i) all
costs and expenses of the parties relating to the printing,
shipping and distribution of the Offering Circular/Joint Proxy
Statement up to $20,000 shall be borne two-thirds by Buyer and
one-third by Bank, and thereafter shall be borne exclusively by
Buyer and (ii) the filing fees associated with the pursuit of the
Regulatory Approvals shall be borne one-half by Buyer, on the one
hand, and one-half by Bank, on the other hand.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) or (iii) or (d)(i) hereof, the
terminating party or parties, or in the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(e), Buyer, shall be entitled
to reimbursement from the other party or parties for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by
such party or parties in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the printing, shipping and
distribution of the Offering Circular/Joint Proxy Statement and
the pursuit of the Regulatory Approvals (such fees and expenses
to include all reasonable legal, consulting and accounting fees,
disbursements and expenses) provided that any reimbursement to
which Buyer shall be entitled hereunder shall be paid by Bank.

<PAGE>

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1(e) hereof, the parties agree that it
would be impracticable or extremely difficult to fix the actual
damages resulting therefrom, and, therefore, the parties agree
that Bank shall pay to Buyer, in addition to the reimbursement
amounts pursuant to paragraph (b) above, as liquidated damages
and not as a penalty, concurrently with such termination, the sum
of $250,000 in respect thereof. The parties hereby further agree
that such amount represents a reasonable endeavor on their parts
to estimate a fair compensation for the foreseeable damages that
might be suffered as a result thereof. Buyer hereby agrees that
its sole remedy therefor shall be the liquidated damages and
reimbursement amounts provided for herein.

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Sections 7.1(b) or (d) hereof because of Buyer's
failure to obtain the financing described in Section 5.22 (except
if such failure results from any prohibition or other material
impediment to such financing imposed on Buyer by any Governmental
Authority, other than as a result of Buyer's failure to comply
with Applicable Law), Seller and Bank shall be entitled to
reimbursement from Buyer for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs,
fees and expenses incurred by Seller and Bank in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the printing,
shipping and distribution of the Offering Circular/Joint Proxy
Statement and the pursuit of the Regulatory Approvals (such fees
and expenses to include all reasonable legal, consulting and
accounting fees, disbursements and expenses) subject to a cap of
$125,000. In addition, the parties agree that it would be
impracticable or extremely difficult to fix the actual damages
resulting therefrom, and, therefore, the parties agree that Buyer
shall pay to Bank, in addition to the reimbursement amounts
above, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, concurrently
with such termination, the sum of $250,000 in respect thereof. 
The parties hereby further agree that such amount represents a
reasonable endeavor on their parts to estimate a fair
compensation for the foreseeable damages that might be suffered
as a result thereof. Seller hereby agrees that its sole remedy
therefor shall be the reimbursement amounts provided for above,
and Bank hereby agrees that its sole remedy therefor shall be the
liquidated damages and reimbursement amounts provided for herein.

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 9.9 are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, such party would not enter into this
Agreement.

<PAGE>

(f) For purposes of this Section 9.9, the terms
"costs, fees and expenses" do not include damages that may
otherwise be recoverable by any party as a result of the breach
of this Agreement by any other party.

(g) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d)
above, the rights and remedies provided in this Section 9.9 are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights and remedies provided
by Applicable Law.

9.10 Dispute Resolution. In the event of a dispute
relating to this Agreement or the interpretation hereof or in the
event any of the parties to this Agreement brings an action or
suit against any other party by reason of the breach of any
covenant, agreement, representation, warranty or other provision
hereof, or any breach of any duty or obligation created hereunder
by such other party, the parties hereby agree to submit the
dispute to binding arbitration under the rules and procedures of
the American Arbitration Association and that, as determined by
the arbitrator (or any court which may thereupon or thereafter
have jurisdiction), the prevailing party shall be entitled to
have and recover from the losing party or parties all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred or sustained by such prevailing party
in connection with such arbitration (or any judicial proceeding),
including, without limitation, legal fees and court costs
(whether or not taxable as such).

9.11 Publicity. The parties hereto will consult with
each other with regard to the terms and substance of any and all
press releases, announcements or other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties
agree further that none of them will release any such press
release, announcement or other public statement without the prior
approval of the other parties, unless such release is required by
law (including the securities laws) and the parties cannot reach
agreement upon a mutually acceptable form of release, in which
event the party releasing the information, announcement or public
statement shall not be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement. 
The parties agree further that such approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, and they pledge to make a good faith
effort to reach agreement expeditiously on the terms of any such
press release, announcement or other public statement.

9.12 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided,
however, that, except by operation of law and as

<PAGE>
otherwise expressly provided herein, neither party may assign any
of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party.

9.13 Third Parties. Each party intends that this
Agreement shall not benefit or create any right or cause of

SCHEDULE 1.2(d)

Determination of Unutilized Closing Reserve

1.1 General. For purposes of computing the aggregate
amount of the payment payable by Buyer pursuant to the Contingent
Payment Right delivered to the Stockholders pursuant to
Section 1.2(d) of the Agreement, the Unutilized Closing Reserve
shall mean $3,038,000 less the sum of (a) the amount of any Net
Charge-Offs plus (b) the amount of any Residual Reserve, in each
case, as of the applicable Computation Date, determined in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

1.2 Calculation and Procedure.

(a) Buyer shall calculate the Unutilized Closing
Reserve as of the Initial Computation Date
(or other Computation Date) and, within ten
(10) business days after the Initial
Computation Date (or other Computation Date),
shall deliver to the Representative a
certificate setting forth in such detail as
may reasonably be requested by the
Representative such calculation, including,
but not limited to, (i) a list of all Bank
Loans reflected on the books and records of
Buyer as of the Computation Date, (ii) the
Recorded Book Value of all Bank Loans as of
December 31, 1993 (which shall be the amounts
reflected on Schedule 9.15 to the Agreement),
(iii) the Recorded Book Value of all Bank
Loans as of the Computation Date, (iv) a
statement as to whether any Bank Loan was
renewed since the six-month anniversary of
the Closing Date and, if so, the
classification assigned by Buyer to such Bank
Loan at the time of such renewal (which
classification shall be assigned in
accordance and consistent with Buyer's
policies for assigning classifications to the
remainder of its loan portfolio and real
estate owned), (v) the classification and
reserve, if any, assigned to each such Bank
Loan as of the Computation Date (which
classification and reserve shall be assigned
in accordance and consistent with Buyer's
policies for assigning classifications and
reserves to the remainder of its loan
portfolio and real estate owned), (vi) the
amount of the Net Charge-Offs (including

<PAGE>
Write-Downs, Net Proceeds and Recoveries) with respect to each
Bank Loan from December 31, 1993 to the Computation Date and the
aggregate amount of such Net Charge-Offs during such period, and
(vii) the Residual Reserve for the Bank Loans on an individual
and aggregate basis as of such Computation Date.

(b) The Representative shall have a period of
30 business days after receipt of Buyer's
analysis to review the analysis and Buyer's
calculation of the Unutilized Closing
Reserve. During such period, the
Representative and its accountants and other
agents shall have full access to the loan
files and other papers of Buyer relating to
the Bank Loans and other loans and real
estate owned of Buyer or used in connection
with Buyer's preparation of the analysis and
its calculation of the Unutilized Closing
Reserve. If the Representative shall not
have objected, in writing, within such 30-
business day period, to the amount of Buyer's
proposed Unutilized Closing Reserve, which
objection shall identify the basis of the
objection and any adjustments to the
Unutilized Closing Reserve initially proposed
by Buyer, then Buyer's calculation of the
Unutilized Closing Reserve shall be final and
binding and such Unutilized Closing Reserve
shall be the Unutilized Closing Reserve for
purposes of Section 1.2(d) of the Agreement. 
If, however, the Representative shall deliver
such written objection to Buyer within such
30-business day period, Buyer shall notify
the Representative of its approval or
disapproval of the Representative's proposed
adjustments to Buyer's calculation of the
Unutilized Closing Reserve, any disapproval
to be contained in a written objection
delivered to the Representative within
15 business days of Buyer's receipt of the
Representative's written objection. If Buyer
shall fail to notify the Representative in
writing within such 15-business day period of
its approval or disapproval of such proposed
adjustments, the Representative's proposed
adjustments shall be made and Buyer's
proposed Unutilized Closing Reserve as so
adjusted shall be final and binding upon all
parties and shall be the Unutilized Closing
Reserve for purposes of the Agreement.

<PAGE>

(c) If Buyer shall notify the Representative in
writing of its disapproval of such proposed
adjustments within the 15-business day period
set forth in paragraph (b) above, the parties
shall defer calculation of the Unutilized
Closing Reserve until the fourth anniversary
of the Closing Date, at which time the
parties shall employ the same procedure used
on the Initial Computation Date to calculate
the Unutilized Closing Reserve as of such
later Computation Date. If Buyer again
notifies the Representative in writing of its
disapproval of the Representative's proposed
adjustments to Buyer's calculation of the
Unutilized Closing Reserve within the
applicable period, the parties shall defer
calculation of the Unutilized Closing Reserve
until the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date and shall employ the same procedure used
on the Initial Computation Date to calculate
the Unutilized Closing Reserve as of such
later Computation Date.

(d) If Buyer again notifies the Representative in
writing of its disapproval of the
Representative's proposed adjustments to
Buyer's calculation of the Unutilized Closing
Reserve within the applicable period, the
dispute shall be settled by arbitration in
accordance with the then prevailing
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association and judgment upon the
award rendered in the arbitration shall be
final and binding upon all parties and may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. 
The fees and expenses of the arbitrators
shall be borne equally by Buyer and the
holders of the Contingent Payment Right and,
in the case of such holders, shall be offset
against the amount payable to such holders
under the Contingent Payment Right.

(e) Within ten business days after the date the
Utilized Closing Reserve is finally
determined pursuant to the provisions hereof,
Buyer shall deposit with the Exchange and
Paying Agent funds equal to the Contingent
Payment for payment to the holders of the
Contingent Payment Right as of a specified
payment date (the "Record Holders"). In
addition, to the 

<PAGE>
extent Buyer receives any Additional Recoveries with respect to
Bank Loans within the one-year period following the last
Computation Date resorted to by the parties, Buyer shall, within
ten business days after the expiration of such one-year period,
deposit with the Exchange and Paying Agent for payment to the
Record Holders an amount of funds equal to (i) the amount of the
Contingent Payment that would have been payable as of the
expiration of such one-year period, after taking into account
such Additional Recoveries, less (ii) the Contingent Payment
actually paid to the Record Holders pursuant to the terms hereof
provided that no interest shall accrue on the amount of the
Additional Recoveries.

following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them:

(a) "Additional Recoveries" shall mean the sum of
(i) for any Bank Loans (including real estate
owned) that are disposed of after the Last

Loan as "Special Mention," "Substandard,"

with interest thereon, compounded annually, at the annual rate of
four percent (4%) in excess of the average weekly interest rate
from time to time prevailing for one-year Treasury bills, such

Reserve shall be final and binding and such Unutilized Closing
Reserve shall be the Unutilized Closing Reserve for purposes of
Section 1.2(d) of the Agreement. If, however, the Representative
shall deliver such written objection to Buyer within such 30-
business day period, Buyer shall notify the Representative of its
approval or disapproval of the Representative's proposed
adjustments to Buyer's calculation of the Unutilized Closing
Reserve, any disapproval to be contained in a written objection
delivered to the Representative within 15 business days of
Buyer's receipt of the Representative's written objection. If
Buyer shall fail to notify the Representative in writing within
such 15-business day period of its approval or disapproval of
such proposed adjustments, the Representative's proposed
adjustments shall be made and Buyer's proposed Unutilized Closing
Reserve as so adjusted shall be final and binding upon all
parties and shall be the Unutilized Closing Reserve for purposes
of the Agreement.

(c) If Buyer shall notify the Representative in
writing of its disapproval of such proposed
adjustments within the 15-business day period set
forth in paragraph (b) above, the parties shall
defer calculation of the Unutilized Closing
Reserve until the fourth anniversary of the
Closing Date, at which time the parties shall
employ the same procedure used on the Initial
Computation Date to calculate the Unutilized
Closing Reserve as of such later Computation Date. 
If Buyer again notifies the Representative in
writing of its disapproval of the Representative's
proposed adjustments to Buyer's calculation of the
Unutilized Closing Reserve within the applicable
period, the parties shall defer calculation of the
Unutilized Closing Reserve until the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date and shall employ
the same procedure used on the Initial Computation
Date to calculate the Unutilized Closing Reserve
as of such later Computation Date.

(d) If Buyer again notifies the Representative in
writing of its disapproval of the

<PAGE>
Representative's proposed adjustments to Buyer's calculation of
the Unutilized Closing Reserve within the applicable period, the
dispute shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the
then prevailing Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association and judgment upon the award rendered in
the arbitration shall be final and binding upon all parties and
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The fees and
expenses of the arbitrators shall be borne equally by Buyer and
the holders of the Contingent Payment Right and, in the case of
such holders, shall be offset against the amount payable to such

pursuant to the provisions hereof, Buyer shall
deposit with the Exchange and Paying Agent funds

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

THIS SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is
entered into as of June 22, 1994, between West Coast Bancorp (the
"Shareholder"), Business & Professional Bank, a California state-
chartered bank ("State Bank"), and such other persons or entities
that may in the future become parties hereto pursuant to the
terms hereof. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in that certain Plan and
Agreement of Consolidation and Merger (the "Plan") dated June 22,
1994 by and among State Bank, Shareholder and Sacramento First
National Bank, a national banking association and an
approximately 94%-owned subsidiary of Shareholder ("National
Bank").

WHEREAS, Shareholder, State Bank and National Bank are
parties to the Plan, which provides for the acquisition by State
Bank of National Bank by means of the consolidation of a newly-
formed subsidiary of State Bank with National Bank and the merger
of the resulting consolidated association with and into State
Bank (the "Acquisition");

WHEREAS, a portion of the consideration payable to the
shareholders of National Bank, including Shareholder, in the
Acquisition consists of shares of the common stock, no par value
per share, of State Bank (the "State Bank Common Stock");

WHEREAS, the acquisition by Shareholder of the Shares
requires the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (the "FRB")
pursuant to Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act and the
California Superintendent of Banking (the "Superintendent")
pursuant to Sections 700 et seq. of the California Financial
Code;

WHEREAS, the acquisition by Shareholder of 25% or more
of the issued and outstanding shares of State Bank Common Stock
or the possession by Shareholder of a controlling influence over
the management or policies of State Bank would require further
such approvals from the FRB and the Superintendent, would
potentially subject State Bank to regulation as a subsidiary of
Shareholder and would have certain other undesirable effects;

WHEREAS, Shareholder has represented to State Bank that
it is not Shareholder's intention or desire to acquire

<PAGE>
25% or more of the issued and outstanding State Bank Common Stock
or otherwise exercise a controlling influence over the management
or policies of State Bank, and it is not State Bank's intention
or desire that Shareholder so acquire such number of shares of
State Bank Common Stock or such influence; 

WHEREAS, in light of the foregoing the parties wish to
set forth certain agreements pertaining to Shareholder's
ownership and certain other entities' ownership of State Bank
Common Stock; 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
recitals and as an essential condition and inducement to State

good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and
adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

and warrant to each other as follows: (i) it has full corporate
power and authority to make, enter into and carry out the terms

legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against it in

bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization,
conservatorship or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
of bank holding companies and insured depository institutions
generally and the availability of equitable remedies.

2. Acquisitions of Voting Securities. Shareholder shall
not, and shall not permit any corporation or other entity
controlled by Shareholder (collectively, the "Shareholder Group")

such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of any
securities of any class of capital stock of State Bank which are
then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(regardless of any contractual restriction regarding voting)
("Voting Securities") (except by way of the Consolidation, or
stock dividends or other distributions or offerings made
available to holders of Voting Securities generally) if the
effect of such acquisition would be to increase the aggregate
voting power in the election of directors of all Voting
Securities then beneficially owned by all members of the
Shareholder Group to 25% or more of the combined voting power of
all Voting Securities then outstanding; provided that the
Shareholder Group may acquire Voting Securities without

<PAGE>
regard to the foregoing limitation if any of the following events
shall occur: (a) a tender or exchange offer is made by any
person or 13D Group (as hereinafter defined) (other than an
affiliate of, or any person acting in concert with, any member of
the Shareholder Group) to acquire Voting Securities which, if
added to the Voting Securities (if any) already owned by such
person or 13D Group, would represent 25% or more of the total
combined voting power of all Voting Securities then outstanding,
or (b) it is publicly disclosed or Shareholder otherwise learns
that Voting Securities representing 25% or more of the total
combined voting power of all Voting Securities then outstanding
have been acquired subsequent to the date hereof, or are proposed
(in a public announcement or filing) to be acquired subsequent to
such date by any person or 13D Group (other than an affiliate of,
or any person acting in concert with, any member of the
Shareholder Group); as used herein, the term "13D Group" shall
mean any group of persons formed for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, voting or disposing of Voting Securities which would be
required under Section 335.405(b) of the regulations promulgated
under the FDIA to file a statement on Form F-11 with the FDIC.

3. Agreement to Vote. Shareholder shall take all such
action as may be required so that all Voting Securities owned by
any member of the Shareholder Group are voted at every meeting of
the shareholders of State Bank and at every adjournment thereof,
and by written consent without a meeting, as follows: (a) with
respect to that number of such Voting Securities that represents
up to 5.0% of the total combined voting power of all Voting
Securities then outstanding, in such manner as it or they, as
applicable, see fit and (b) with respect to the remainder of such
Voting Securities, in the same proportion as the votes cast by
all other holders of Voting Securities who are not members of the
Shareholder Group.

4. No Voting Trusts. Shareholder shall not, and shall not
permit any member of the Shareholder Group to, deposit any Voting
Securities in a voting trust or subject any Voting Securities to
any arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting of such
Voting Securities, other than agreements entered into with State
Bank.

5. No Proxy Solicitations, Etc. Shareholder shall not,
and shall not permit any member of the Shareholder Group to,

(as such terms are defined in Regulation 14A under the Exchange
Act) in opposition to or competition with the recommendation of
the majority of the directors of State Bank with respect to any
matter; (b) join a partnership,

<PAGE>
limited partnership, syndicate or other 13D Group (other than the

or disposing of Voting Securities; (c) initiate or propose any
shareholder proposals for submission to a vote of shareholders
with respect to State Bank or propose any person for election to

communication with any customer or supplier of State Bank
regarding matters relating to State Bank with a view towards
interfering with or otherwise adversely affecting the

supplier; (e) otherwise seek to control the management or
policies of State Bank, including, without limitation, taking any

directors, representatives, employees, attorneys, advisors,

any material respect any restrictions contained in these
Sections 2 through 6 hereof (or to waive, amend or modify this
clause (i)), if such request must be or is disclosed by the
Shareholder Group to any third party or in any filing with the
FDIC or any other regulatory authority or if State Bank might
reasonably be required to publicly disclose such request.

6. Transfers.

(a) Shareholder shall not, and shall not permit any
member of the Shareholder Group to, directly or indirectly,
offer, sell, pledge, encumber, dispose of, or otherwise transfer
(a "Transfer") any Voting Securities, except 

(i) in accordance with the provisions of
Section 7 hereof; 

(ii) in "brokers' transactions" (as defined in
Section 4(4) of and Rule 144 under the Securities Act)
provided that no more than 50,000 shares may be transferred
in such transactions during the twelve-month period
following the Closing Date; 

(iii) additional blocks of Voting Securities may be
Transferred with the prior written consent of

<PAGE>
State Bank, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and

(iv) in connection with any merger, consolidation,
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction
involving State Bank; 

provided, however, that with respect to a proposed Transfer
pursuant to clause (iii) above, no such Transfer may be made to
any person or entity if, as a result of such Transfer, such
person or entity, together with such person's or entity's
affiliates and associates, would beneficially own Voting
Securities representing more than 5% of the total voting power of
all then outstanding Voting Securities unless the transferee
agrees in writing on behalf of itself and all corporations and
other entities under its control to be bound by the terms of
Sections 2 through 6 of this Agreement as if such transferee, and
the corporations and other entities controlled by such
transferee, were the Shareholder and the members of the
Shareholder Group, referred to therein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Voting Securities may be Transferred to another member
of the Shareholder Group provided such member agrees in writing
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Should any member of
the Shareholder Group that beneficially owns Voting Securities
cease to be a member of the Shareholder Group, such Voting
Securities shall be immediately transferred to a corporation or
entity that is a member of the Shareholder Group.

(b) Any Transfer of Voting Securities in violation of
this Agreement shall be void and State Bank shall be entitled to

offering of securities of State Bank; 

(3) After State Bank has effected one such
offering pursuant to this paragraph (b); 

(4) If State Bank shall furnish to such
Holders a certificate signed by the President of State
Bank stating that in the good faith

<PAGE>
judgment of the Board of Directors it would be seriously
detrimental to State Bank or its shareholders for an underwritten
public offering to be effected in the near future, then State
Bank's obligation to use its best efforts to effect such offering
shall be deferred for a period not to exceed 120 days from the
date of receipt of written request from the Holders; or 

(5) If State Bank is unable to obtain the
commitment of an underwriter reasonably satisfactory to
State Bank and Holders to firmly underwrite the
offering.

Subject to the foregoing, State Bank will use its
reasonable efforts to prepare an offering circular covering the
Subject Securities so requested to be offered for sale and obtain
the consent of the California Superintendent of Banking and all
other necessary governmental authorities to such sale within 90
days after receipt of the request or requests of the Holders.

(ii) The offering circular prepared pursuant to a
request of the Holders may include securities of State Bank
being sold for the account of State Bank.

(iii) The right of any Holder to participate in the
offering pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be conditioned
on such Holder's participation in such underwriting and the
inclusion of such Holder's Subject Securities in the
underwriting to the extent provided herein.

(iv) State Bank shall (together with all Holders
proposing to distribute their securities through such
underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected
for such underwriting in the manner set forth above. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (b),
if the underwriter advises State Bank in writing that
marketing factors require a limitation of the total number
of shares to be underwritten, then State Bank shall so
advise all Holders of Subject Securities which would
otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of
shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be
allocated fifty percent (50%) to State Bank, or such lesser
percent as is represented by the number of shares State Bank
desires be underwritten, and the remainder among all Holders
thereof in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the
respective amounts of Subject Securities held by such
Holders. No Subject Securities excluded from the

<PAGE>
underwriting by reason of the underwriter's marketing limitation
shall be included in such underwriting. If any Holder
disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, he may elect to
withdraw therefrom by written notice to State Bank, the
underwriter and the Holders. The Subject Securities so withdrawn
shall also be withdrawn from the offering; provided, however,
that, if by the withdrawal of such Subject Securities a greater
number of Subject Securities held by other Holders may be
included in such underwriting (up to the maximum of any
limitation imposed by the underwriters), then State Bank shall
offer to all Holders who have included Subject Securities in the
underwriting the right to include additional shares in the same
proportion used in determining the underwriter limitation in this
subparagraph (b)(iv).

(c) State Bank Offering.

(i) If at any time, or from time to time,
beginning one year after the date hereof, State Bank shall
determine to conduct a public offering of any State Bank
Common Stock involving sales to thirty-five or more
investors for its own account (other than in a merger or
other reorganization or in connection with any employee
benefit plan), State Bank will:

(A) promptly give to each Holder written
notice thereof (which shall include a list of the
jurisdictions in which State Bank intends to attempt to
sell such securities); and 

(B) subject to paragraph (iii) below, use
its best efforts to include in such offering all the
Subject Securities specified in any written request or
requests by any Holder or Holders received by State
Bank within twenty (20) business days after such
written notice is given on the same terms and
conditions as the State Bank Common Stock, if any,
otherwise being sold in such offering.

(ii) The right of any Holder to participate in any
underwritten public offering pursuant to this paragraph (c)
shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in the
underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder's Subject
Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided
herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their
securities through such underwriting (together with State
Bank and the other holders distributing their securities
through such underwriting) shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the 

<PAGE>
underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by
State Bank.

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph (c), if the underwriter determines that marketing
factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be
underwritten, the underwriter may limit the amount of
securities to be included in the underwriting by the
Holders. State Bank shall so advise all Holders of Subject
Securities which would otherwise be underwritten pursuant
hereto, and the number of Subject Securities that may be
included in the underwriting shall be reduced and allocated
among all of the Holders, in proportion, as nearly as
practicable, to the amounts of Subject Securities held by
such Holders; provided, however, that the number of Subject
Securities to be included in such underwriting shall not be
reduced below twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number
of securities included in such offering. If in any public
offering under this paragraph (c) that is not underwritten
it will not, in the opinion of State Bank, be feasible to
include all Subject Securities requested to be included in
such offering, the number of Subject Securities that may be
included in the offering shall be reduced and allocated in
the manner described in the preceding sentence subject to
the 25% floor set forth therein. State Bank shall advise
all Holders of Subject Securities which would otherwise be
sold pursuant hereto of any such limitations, and the number
of shares of Subject Securities that may be included in the
offering. If any Holder disapproves of the terms of any
such offering, he may elect to withdraw therefrom by written
notice to State Bank and, if applicable, the underwriter. 
If, however, as a result of the withdrawal of such Subject
Securities a greater number of Subject Securities held by
other Holders may be included in such offering (up to the
maximum of any limitation imposed by State Bank or the
underwriters, as applicable), then State Bank shall offer to
all Holders who have included Subject Securities in the
offering the right to include additional shares in the same
proportion used in determining the limitation in this
subparagraph (iii).

(d) Expenses of Offering. All expenses incurred in
connection with any offering pursuant to this Section 7,
including without limitation, all regulatory filing fees,
printing expenses, escrow fees, fees and disbursements of counsel
for State Bank, underwriters' fees, discounts and commissions,
accounting fees and expenses, and expenses of any special audits
incidental to or required by such offering, shall be borne by
State Bank and the selling Holders in proportion to the number of
securities being sold by them in the offering; provided that
State Bank shall not

<PAGE>
be required to pay for any expenses of any underwritten offering
begun pursuant to paragraph (b) hereof if the request therefor is
subsequently withdrawn, unless the Holders agree to forfeit their
rights pursuant to that paragraph (b); provided further that the
Holders may withdraw a request under paragraph (b) hereof if at
the time of such withdrawal the Holders have learned of a
material adverse change in the condition, business or prospects
of State Bank which differs from the information known to the
Holders at the time of their request, in which event the Holders
shall not be required to pay any of the expenses of the offering
and shall retain all rights to require State Bank to conduct an
underwritten public offering of Subject Securities pursuant to
paragraph (b) hereof.

(e) Procedures. If and whenever State Bank is
required by the provisions of this Section 7 to use its
reasonable efforts to effect a public offering of any of the
Subject Securities, State Bank will, as expeditiously as
possible:

(i) Prepare and file with the Superintendent an
offering circular with respect to such securities and use
its reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the
Superintendent and any other governmental or regulatory
authority to conduct the offering described therein.

(ii) Prepare and file with the Superintendent such
amendments and supplements to such offering circular as may
be necessary.

(iii) Furnish to each Holder and underwriter, if
any, participating in the offering such number of offering
circulars and such other documents as such Holder and
underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate
the public sale or other disposition of the Subject
Securities being sold by such Holder and underwriter.

(iv) If applicable, enter into and perform its
obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and
customary form, with the managing underwriter of such
offering, and each Holder participating in such underwriting
shall also enter into and perform its obligations under such
an agreement.

(v) Notify each Holder and underwriter, if any,
of Subject Securities covered by such offering circular at
any time when the offering circular is being circulated of
the happening of any event as a result of which the offering
circular, as then in effect, includes an untrue

<PAGE>
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then
existing.

(vi) Furnish, at the request of any Holder
requesting an underwritten public offering of Subject
Securities pursuant to this Section 7, on the date that such
Subject Securities are delivered to the underwriters for
sale pursuant to this Section 7, (i) an opinion, dated such
date, of the counsel representing State Bank for the
purposes of such offering, in form and substance as is
customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public
offering, addressed to the underwriters and to the Holders
requesting a public offering of Subject Securities and
(ii) a letter dated such date, from the independent
certified public accountants of State Bank, in form and
substance as is customarily given by independent certified
public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public
offering, addressed to the underwriters and to the Holders
requesting a public offering of Subject Securities.

(f) Indemnification.

(i) State Bank agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Holder of Subject Securities whose Subject
Securities are included in a public offering pursuant
hereto, each of such Holder's partners, officers and
directors, each underwriter of any of the Subject Securities
included in such offering, and each person, if any, who
controls any such Holder or underwriter within the meaning
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Holder-Underwriters"), as
follows:

(A) against any and all loss, liability,
claim (joint or several), damage and expense whatsoever
arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the offering
circular (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or
alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, unless such
untrue statement or omission or such alleged untrue
statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in
strict conformity with written information furnished to
State Bank by any Holder-Underwriter expressly for use
in such offering circular (or any amendment thereto);

<PAGE>

(B) against any and all loss, liability,
claim, damage and expense whatsoever to the extent of
the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any
litigation, commenced or threatened, or of any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or
omission or any such alleged untrue statement or
omission, if such settlement is effected with the
written consent of State Bank; and 

(C) against any and all legal or other
expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any
litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or
omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or
omission, to the extent that any such expense is not
paid under clause (i) or (ii) above, which expenses
under this clause (iii) shall be paid by State Bank as
incurred; 

provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement is
subject to the condition that, insofar as it relates to any such
untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged
omission made in the offering circular but eliminated or remedied
in an amended offering circular delivered to such Holder-
Underwriter, such indemnity agreement shall not inure to the
benefit of any underwriter, or any Holder, if a copy of such
amended offering circular was made available to such underwriter
or such Holder and was not furnished to the person or entity
asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the
time the sale to such person or entity was consummated.

In no case shall State Bank be liable under this
indemnity agreement with respect to any loss, liability, claim,
damage or expense with respect to any claim made against any
Holder-Underwriter unless State Bank shall be notified in writing
of the nature of the claim within a reasonable time after the
assertion thereof, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such
action, but failure to so notify State Bank shall not relieve
State Bank from any liability which it may have otherwise than on
account of this indemnity agreement. In case of any such notice,
State Bank shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the
defense, or if it so elects within a reasonable time after
receipt of such notice, to assume the defense of any suit brought
to enforce any such claim; but if it so elects to assume the
defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it
and approved by the Holder-Underwriter or Holder-Underwriters and
other defendant or defendants, if any, in any suit so brought,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event
that State Bank elects

<PAGE>
to assume the defense of any such suit and retain such counsel,
the Holder-Underwriter or Holder-Underwriters and other defendant
or defendants, which may be represented without conflict by one
counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel,
with the fees and expenses to be paid by State Bank, but only if
representation of such Holder-Underwriter and other defendant or
defendants would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interest between such indemnified party and any other
party represented by such counsel in such proceeding.

(ii) Each Holder severally agrees that it will
indemnify and hold harmless State Bank, each officer and
director of State Bank, each person, if any, who controls
State Bank within the meaning of the Securities Act, each
underwriter of Subject Securities included in any offering
pursuant to this Section 7, each person, if any, who
controls such underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act, each other Holder, each of such other
Holder's partners, officers and directors, and each person
controlling such other holder within the meaning of the
Securities Act against any and all loss, liability, claim,
damage and expense, up to the amount of the gross proceeds
actually received from the offering by such Holder, to the
extent described in clauses (i)(A) through (i)(C),
inclusive, of this paragraph (f), but only with respect to
statements or omissions, or alleged statements or omissions
made in such offering circular (or any amendment thereto) in
reliance upon and in strict conformity with written
information furnished to State Bank by such Holder expressly
for use in such offering circular (or any amendment
thereto). In case any action shall be brought against State
Bank or any person so indemnified pursuant to the provisions
of this subparagraph (ii) and in respect of which indemnity
may be sought against any Holder, the Holders from whom
indemnity is sought shall have the rights and duties given
to State Bank, and State Bank and the other persons so
indemnified shall have the rights and duties given to the
persons entitled to indemnification by the provisions of
subparagraph (i) of this paragraph (f).

(g) Information by Holder. The Holder or Holders of
Subject Securities included in any offering shall furnish to
State Bank such information regarding such Holder or Holders, and
the distribution proposed by such Holder or Holders, as State
Bank may reasonably request in writing.

(h) Transfer of Rights. The rights granted by State
Bank under paragraphs (b) and (c) hereof may be assigned, in
whole or in part, in writing by any Holder of Subject Securities
or shares convertible into Subject

<PAGE>
Securities to a transferee or assignee of Subject Securities
representing more than 5% of the total combined voting power of
all Voting Securities then outstanding; provided, that such
Transfer is effected in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement; and provided further, that State Bank is given written
notice by such Holder at the time of or within a reasonable time
after said Transfer, stating the name and address of said
transferee or assignee and identifying the securities with
respect to which such rights are being assigned.

(i) "Market Stand-off" Agreement. Shareholder and
each other member of the Shareholder Group, and each other Holder
of Subject Securities to which the rights under this Section 7
have been assigned, shall, so long as any such person owns more
than 5% of the outstanding Voting Securities of State Bank if
requested by State Bank and an underwriter of State Bank Common
Stock or other securities of State Bank, agree not Transfer any
securities of State Bank held by them during the one hundred
eighty (180) day period from the date of the underwriting
agreement; provided that all Holders holding more than five
percent of the outstanding State Bank Common Stock and all
officers, directors, and employees of State Bank enter into
similar agreements. Such agreement shall be in writing in the
form satisfactory to State Bank and such underwriter. State Bank
may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the
securities subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of
said one hundred eighty (180) day period.

8. Covenants of Shareholder Group in Absence of 
Regulatory Approval. In addition to rather than in lieu of any
of the other agreements of the parties contained herein,
Shareholder, for itself and for each member of the Shareholder
Group, hereby agrees that, without obtaining the prior written
approval of the FRB and the Superintendent if appropriate,
neither Shareholder nor any member of the Shareholder Group will: 
(a) exercise or attempt to exercise a controlling influence over
the management or policies of State Bank; (b) have or seek to
have any employees or representatives serve as an officer, agent
or employee of State Bank; (c) take any action causing State Bank
to become a subsidiary of Shareholder or any member of the
Shareholder Group; (d) acquire or retain any Voting Securities
that would cause the combined interest of Shareholder, each
member of the Shareholder Group and each of their respective
officers, directors, and affiliates, to equal or exceed 25% of
the then outstanding Voting Securities of State Bank; (e) propose
a director or slate of directors in opposition to a nominee or
slate of nominees proposed by the management or board of
directors of State Bank; (f) attempt to

<PAGE>
influence the dividend policies or practices of State Bank;
(g) solicit or participate in soliciting proxies with respect to
any matter presented to the shareholders of State Bank;
(h) attempt to influence the loan and credit decisions or
policies of State Bank, the pricing of services, any personnel
decisions, the location of any offices, branching, the hours of
operation, or similar activities of State Bank; (i) dispose or
threaten to dispose of any Voting Securities in any matter as a
condition of specific action or inaction by State Bank; (j) enter
into any other banking or non-banking transactions with State
Bank, except that deposit accounts may be established and
maintained with State Bank provided that the aggregate balances
of all such accounts do not exceed $500,000 and that the accounts
are maintained on substantially the same terms as those
prevailing for comparable accounts of persons unaffiliated with
State Bank; or (k) seek or accept representation on the Board of
Directors of State Bank.

9. Specific Performance. Each party hereto acknowledges
that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to the
other party if a party hereto fails to comply with any of the
obligations imposed by this Agreement, that every such obligation
is material and that, in the event of any such failure, the other
party will not have an adequate remedy at law or damages, and
accordingly, each party hereto agrees that injunctive relief or
other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or
damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure.

10. Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided
herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns and shall not be assignable without the written
consent of all the other parties hereto.

11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior
arrangements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived,
except expressly by an instrument in writing signed by all the
parties hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by any party
shall be deemed a waiver by any such party nor shall any such
waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by
such party.

12. Effectiveness and Termination. This Agreement shall
become effective upon the date of consummation of the

<PAGE>
Consolidation and, except as otherwise provided herein, shall
terminate as to every member of the Shareholder Group on the date
the Shareholder Group owns of record and beneficially Voting
Securities representing 5% or less of the total combined voting
power of all Voting Securities then outstanding, and as to each
other shareholder party hereto, on the date such shareholder owns
of record and beneficially Voting Securities representing 5% or
less of the total combined voting power of all Voting Securities
then outstanding.

13. Miscellaneous.

(a) This Agreement shall be deemed a contract made
under, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with
the laws of, the State of California without regard to the
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

(b) Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the
remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

(c) This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

(d) All Section headings herein are for convenience of
reference only and are not part of this Agreement and no
construction or reference shall be derived therefrom.

FORM OF OPINION OF MANATT, PHELPS & PHILLIPS

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the
opinion that:

(a) Seller is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
California, and is a registered bank holding company pursuant to
12 U.S.C. section 1841 et seq.

(b) Seller has the corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver the Documents and to perform its obligations
thereunder.

(c) Bank is a national banking association, duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under 12 U.S.C.
section 21 et seq. Bank's deposit accounts are insured by the
Bank Insurance Fund of the FDIC to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law.

(d) Bank has the corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver the Documents and to perform its obligations
thereunder.

(e) The Documents have been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by Seller and Bank, as applicable, and constitute
the valid and binding obligations of Seller and Bank, as
applicable, enforceable against each of them in accordance with
their respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, conservatorship or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors of bank holding
companies or insured depository institutions generally and by the
availability of equitable remedies.

(f) The execution, delivery and performance of the
Documents by Seller and Bank will not (i) violate any provision
of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Seller or the
Articles of Association or Bylaws of Bank, or (ii) except as set
forth in the opinion, violate or result in the breach of any
term, condition or provision of, or constitute a default under
(upon the giving of notice, the lapse of time or otherwise), or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration with respect to, or result in the creation of any
lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of Seller
or Bank pursuant to, or otherwise require the consent of any
Person under, any material agreement known to us to which Seller
or Bank is a party.

<PAGE>

(g) All registrations with, consents and approvals of,
notices to, and other actions by, any Governmental Authority

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the execution and

Consolidation Agreement.

2. At any meeting of Bank shareholders or at any

terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement shall be

Employer, Employee (during his employment with Employer) shall not
(i) accept any other employment; or (ii) engage, directly or
indirectly, in any other business, commercial, or professional
activity (whether or not pursued for pecuniary advantage) that is
or may be competitive with Employer, that might create a conflict
of interest with Employer, or that otherwise might interfere with
Employee's duties or the business of Employer, or any affiliate
of Employer.

4.Compensation and Benefits.

(a)Compensation. Employer shall pay Employee a salary at the 
rate of One Hundred Thirty Five Thousand Dollars ($135,000) per year, in
accordance with Employer's regularly established policies. The
Board of Directors of Employer may, in its sole discretion,
direct that Employee also be paid an annual bonus by Employer.

(b)Benefits. Employee shall be entitled to receive Employer's 
standard group medical insurance, life insurance, vacation (four weeks per
year), and sick pay (one day per month) in accordance with

5.Termination of Employment.

(a)By Employer or Employee Not For Cause. At any time, Employer
or Employee may terminate Employee's employment for any reason,
without Cause, as defined below, by providing written notice to
the other party ("Termination Notice"). Such termination shall
become effective six (6) months after the date of the Termination
Notice. For the six-month period subsequent to the date of the
Termination Notice ("Leave Period"), Employer shall place
Employee on a leave of absence with full base salary, and
Employer shall continue to provide Employee the group medical and
life insurance benefits in effect as of the date of the
Termination Notice. All other benefits specified under section 4
of this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of the
Termination Notice. Employer may dismiss Employee without Cause
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in or arising
from any statements, policies, or practices of Employer relating
to the employment, discipline, or termination of its employees. 
For the six (6) month period after the conclusion of the Leave
Period ("Severance Period"), Employer shall (i) provide Employee
monthly severance payments, less deductions required by law, at
Employee's then monthly salary rate in effect as of the date of
the Termination Notice, and (ii) pay the premiums for Employee's
life insurance benefits and COBRA medical coverage. At the
conclusion of the Severance Period, all obligations of Employer
under this Agreement shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Employee is employed by another employer at any time during
the Severance Period, then Employer shall be obligated to pay
Employee monthly severance payments only to the extent that
Employee's monthly salary payments with the subsequent employer
are less than the monthly salary payments that would otherwise
have been due to Employee under this Section 5.1(a).

(b)By Employer for Cause. At any time, and without prior notice,
Employer may terminate Employee for Cause (as defined below). In
such event, Employer shall pay Employee all compensation then due
and owing through the date of termination; thereafter, all of
Employer's obligations under

<PAGE>
this Agreement shall cease. "Cause" shall include, but not be
limited to, willful neglect of assigned duties and
responsibilities, criminal misconduct, wilful and material breach
of this Agreement, disapproval of Employee's appointment as an
officer or director by any applicable regulatory agency, an order
for Employee's removal as an officer or director by any
applicable regulatory agency, death, and, to the extent permitted
by law, unavailability for work due to extended disability as
defined in Employer's existing Employee Handbook. Employer may
dismiss Employee with Cause notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in or arising from any statements, policies,
or practices of Employer relating to the employment, discipline,
or termination of its employees. At Employer's option and in its
sole discretion, Employer may elect to make the termination of
Employee under this section 5(b) effective as of any date up to
six (6) months after the date on which written notice of such
termination and election is given Employee. In such event,
Employee shall be placed on leave and provided the compensation
and benefits as specified in section 5(a) for the Leave Period. 
At the conclusion of such Leave Period, all obligations of
Employer under this Agreement shall cease.

(c)Termination Obligations. Employee agrees that all property,
including, without limitation, all equipment, tangible
Proprietary Information (as defined below), documents, records,
notes, contracts, and computer-generated materials furnished to
or prepared by Employee incident to his employment belongs to
Employer and shall be returned promptly to Employer upon notice
of termination of Employee's employment. Employee's obligations
under this subsection shall survive the termination of his
employment and the expiration of this Agreement.

(d)Noncompetition. In the event that (i) Employer or Employee 
terminates Employee's employment pursuant to section 5(a), above, or
(ii) Employer terminates Employee's employment pursuant to
section 5(b), above, and elects to place Employee on paid leave
as provided therein, then Employee agrees not to accept
employment with a Competing Entity, as defined below, during the
Leave Period. A Competing Entity is any financial institution
that competes directly against the Bank in the geographical area
comprised of Sacramento and Yolo counties and the cities of
Roseville and Dixon. Should Employee accept employment with a
Competing Entity during the Leave Period, Employer shall be
relieved of any obligation to provide compensation or benefits to
Employee during the Leave Period of the Severance Period, without
prejudice to its right to enforce the noncompetition provisions
of this section 5(d).

<PAGE>

6.Proprietary Information. "Proprietary Information" is all information
and any idea pertaining in any manner to the business of Employer
(or any Employer affiliate), its employees, customers,
consultants, or business associates, which was produced by any
employee of Employer in the course of his or her employment or
otherwise produced or acquired by or on behalf of Employer. 
Proprietary Information shall include, without limitation, trade
secrets, product ideas, inventions, processes, formulas, data,
know-how, software and other computer programs, copyrightable
material, marketing plans, strategies, sales, financial reports,
forecasts, and customer lists. All Proprietary Information not
generally known outside of Employer's organization, and all
Proprietary Information so known only through improper means,
shall be deemed "Confidential Information." During his
employment by Employer, Employee shall use Proprietary
Information, and shall disclose Confidential Information, only
for the benefit of Employer and as is necessary to perform his
job responsibilities under this Agreement. Following
termination, Employee shall not use any Proprietary Information
and shall not disclose any Confidential Information, except with
the express written consent of Employer. By way of illustration
and not in limitation of the foregoing, following termination,
Employee shall not use any Confidential Information to solicit
Employer's employees or customers or to compete against Employer. 
Employee's obligations under this Section shall survive for a
period of six months after the date of any Termination Notice
given pursuant to Section 5(a) above, if applicable, or for a
period of six months after the date of the termination of
Employee's employment pursuant to Section 5(b).

7. Arbitration.

(a)Arbitrable Claims. All disputes between Employee (and his 
attorneys, 
successors, and assigns) and Employer (and its affiliates,
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors,
attorneys, and assigns) of any kind whatsoever, including,
without limitation, all disputes relating in any manner to the
employment or termination of Employee, and all disputes arising
under this Agreement, ("Arbitrable Claims") shall be resolved by
arbitration. All persons and entities specified in the preceding
sentence (other than Employer and Employee) shall be considered
third-party beneficiaries of the rights and obligations created
by this Section on Arbitration. Arbitrable Claims shall include,
but are not limited to, contract (express or implied) and tort
claims of all kinds, as well as all claims based on any federal,
state, or local

<PAGE>
law, statute, or regulation, excepting only claims under
applicable workers' compensation law and unemployment insurance
claims. Arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties
and shall be the exclusive remedy for all Arbitrable Claims. THE
PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
REGARD TO ARBITRABLE CLAIMS.

(b)Procedure. Arbitration of Arbitrable Claims shall be in 
accordance with the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA Employment Rules"), except as
provided otherwise in this Agreement. In any arbitration, the
burden of proof shall be allocated as provided by applicable law. 
Either party may bring an action in court to compel arbitration
under this Agreement and to enforce an arbitration award. 
Otherwise, neither party shall initiate or prosecute any lawsuit
or administrative action in any way related to any Arbitrable
Claim. All arbitration hearings under this Agreement shall be
conducted in Sacramento, California. The Federal Arbitration Act
shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this
Section 7. The losing party, as identified by the arbitrator,
shall pay the fees of the arbitrator and the reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the other party in connection with the
dispute and the arbitration.

(c)Confidentiality. All proceedings and all documents prepared in
connection with any Arbitrable Claim shall be confidential and,
unless otherwise required by law, the subject matter thereof
shall not be disclosed to any person other than the parties to
the proceedings, their counsel, witnesses and experts, the
arbitrator, and, if involved, the court and court staff.

Employee and Employer set forth in this Section on Arbitration shall survive
the termination of Employee's employment and the expiration of
this Agreement.

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

THIS SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is
entered into as of June 22, 1994, between West Coast Bancorp (the
"Shareholder"), Business & Professional Bank, a California state-
chartered bank ("State Bank"), and such other persons or entities
that may in the future become parties hereto pursuant to the
terms hereof. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in that certain Plan and
Agreement of Consolidation and Merger (the "Plan") dated June 22,
1994 by and among State Bank, Shareholder and Sacramento First
National Bank, a national banking association and an
approximately 94%-owned subsidiary of Shareholder ("National
Bank").

WHEREAS, Shareholder, State Bank and National Bank are
parties to the Plan, which provides for the acquisition by State
Bank of National Bank by means of the consolidation of a newly-
formed subsidiary of State Bank with National Bank and the merger
of the resulting consolidated association with and into State
Bank (the "Acquisition");

WHEREAS, a portion of the consideration payable to the
shareholders of National Bank, including Shareholder, in the
Acquisition consists of shares of the common stock, no par value
per share, of State Bank (the "State Bank Common Stock");

WHEREAS, the acquisition by Shareholder of the Shares
requires the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (the "FRB")
pursuant to Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act and the
California Superintendent of Banking (the "Superintendent")
pursuant to Sections 700 et seq. of the California Financial
Code;

WHEREAS, the acquisition by Shareholder of 25% or more
of the issued and outstanding shares of State Bank Common Stock
or the possession by Shareholder of a controlling influence over
the

<PAGE>
management or policies of State Bank would require further such
approvals from the FRB and the Superintendent, would potentially
subject State Bank to regulation as a subsidiary of Shareholder
and would have certain other undesirable effects;

WHEREAS, Shareholder has represented to State Bank that
it is not Shareholder's intention or desire to acquire 25% or
more of the issued and outstanding State Bank Common Stock or
otherwise exercise a controlling influence over the management or
policies of State Bank, and it is not State Bank's intention or
desire that Shareholder so acquire such number of shares of State
Bank Common Stock or such influence; 

WHEREAS, in light of the foregoing the parties wish to
set forth certain agreements pertaining to Shareholder's
ownership and certain other entities' ownership of State Bank
Common Stock; 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
recitals and as an essential condition and inducement to State
Bank's and Shareholder's execution of the Plan, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and
adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

1. Representations. Shareholder and State Bank represent
and warrant to each other as follows: (i) it has full corporate
power and authority to make, enter into and carry out the terms
of this Agreement; and (ii) this Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its
legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization,
conservatorship or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
of bank holding companies and insured depository institutions
generally and the availability of equitable remedies.

2. Acquisitions of Voting Securities. Shareholder shall
not, and shall not permit any corporation or other entity
controlled by Shareholder (collectively, the "Shareholder Group")
to, directly or indirectly, acquire "beneficial ownership" (as
such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of any
securities of any class of capital stock of State Bank which are
then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(regardless of any contractual restriction regarding voting)
("Voting Securities") (except by way of the Consolidation, or
stock dividends or other distributions or offerings made
available to holders of Voting Securities generally) if the
effect of such acquisition would be to increase the aggregate
voting power in the election of directors of all Voting
Securities then beneficially owned by all members of the
Shareholder Group to 25% or more of the combined voting power of
all Voting Securities then outstanding; provided that the
Shareholder Group may acquire Voting Securities without regard to
the foregoing limitation if any of the following events shall
occur: (a) a tender or exchange offer is made

<PAGE>
by any person or 13D Group (as hereinafter defined) (other than
an affiliate of, or any person acting in concert with, any member
of the Shareholder Group) to acquire Voting Securities which, if
added to the Voting Securities (if any) already owned by such
person or 13D Group, would represent 25% or more of the total
combined voting power of all Voting Securities then outstanding,
or (b) it is publicly disclosed or Shareholder otherwise learns
that Voting Securities representing 25% or more of the total
combined voting power of all Voting Securities then outstanding
have been acquired subsequent to the date hereof, or are proposed
(in a public announcement or filing) to be acquired subsequent to
such date by any person or 13D Group (other than an affiliate of,
or any person acting in concert with, any member of the
Shareholder Group); as used herein, the term "13D Group" shall
mean any group of persons formed for the purpose of acquiring,

<PAGE>
holding, voting or disposing of Voting Securities which would be
required under Section 335.405(b) of the regulations promulgated
under the FDIA to file a statement on Form F-11 with the FDIC.

3. Agreement to Vote. Shareholder shall take all such
action as may be required so that all Voting Securities owned by
any member of the Shareholder Group are voted at every meeting of
the shareholders of State Bank and at every adjournment thereof,
and by written consent without a meeting, as follows: (a) with
respect to that number of such Voting Securities that represents
up to 5.0% of the total combined voting power of all Voting
Securities then outstanding, in such manner as it or they, as
applicable, see fit and (b) with respect to the remainder of such
Voting Securities, in the same proportion as the votes cast by
all other holders of Voting Securities who are not members of the
Shareholder Group.

4. No Voting Trusts. Shareholder shall not, and shall not
permit any member of the Shareholder Group to, deposit any Voting
Securities in a voting trust or subject any Voting Securities to
any arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting of such
Voting Securities, other than agreements entered into with State
Bank.

5. No Proxy Solicitations, Etc. Shareholder shall not,
and shall not permit any member of the Shareholder Group to,
(a) solicit proxies or become a "participant" in a "solicitation"
(as such terms are defined in Regulation 14A under the Exchange
Act) in opposition to or competition with the recommendation of
the majority of the directors of State Bank with respect to any
matter; (b) join a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or
other 13D Group (other than the Shareholder Group) for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of Voting
Securities; (c) initiate or propose any shareholder proposals for
submission to a vote of shareholders with respect to State Bank
or propose any person for election to the Board of Directors of
State Bank; (d) initiate any communication with any customer or
supplier of State Bank regarding matters relating to State Bank
with a view towards interfering with or otherwise adversely
affecting the relationship between State Bank and any such
customer or supplier; (e) otherwise seek to control the
management or policies of State Bank, including, without
limitation, taking any action to seek to obtain representation on
the Board of Directors of State Bank; (f) disclose to any third
party or make any filing with the FDIC or any other regulatory
authority disclosing any intention, plan or arrangement
inconsistent with the foregoing; (g) enter into any discussions,
negotiations, arrangements or understandings with any third party
with respect to any of the foregoing; or (h) request State Bank
(or any of its officers, directors, representatives, employees,
attorneys, advisors, agents, affiliates or associates) to waive,
amend or modify in any material respect any restrictions
contained in these Sections 2 through 6 hereof (or to waive,
amend or modify this clause (i)), if such request must be or is
disclosed by the Shareholder Group to any third party or in any
filing with the FDIC or any other regulatory authority or if
State Bank might reasonably be required to publicly disclose such
request.

6. Transfers.

(a) Shareholder shall not, and shall not permit any
member of the Shareholder Group to, directly or indirectly,
offer, sell, pledge, encumber, dispose of, or otherwise transfer
(a "Transfer") any Voting Securities, except 

(i) in accordance with the provisions of
Section 7 hereof; 

(ii) in "brokers' transactions" (as defined in
Section 4(4) of and Rule 144 under the Securities Act)
provided that no more than 50,000 shares may be transferred
in such transactions during the twelve-month period
following the Closing Date; 

(iii) additional blocks of Voting Securities may be
Transferred with the prior written consent of State Bank,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and

<PAGE>

(iv) in connection with any merger, consolidation,
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction
involving State Bank; 

provided, however, that with respect to a proposed Transfer
pursuant to clause (iii) above, no such Transfer may be made to
any person or entity if, as a result of such Transfer, such
person or entity, together with such person's or entity's
affiliates and associates, would beneficially own Voting
Securities representing more than 5% of the total voting power of
all then outstanding Voting Securities unless the transferee
agrees in writing on behalf of itself and all corporations and
other entities under its control to be bound by the terms of
Sections 2 through 6 of this Agreement as if such transferee, and
the corporations and other entities controlled by such
transferee, were the Shareholder and the members of the
Shareholder Group, referred to therein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Voting Securities may be Transferred to another member
of the Shareholder Group provided such member agrees in writing
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Should any member of
the Shareholder Group that beneficially owns Voting Securities
cease to be a member of the Shareholder Group, such Voting
Securities shall be immediately transferred to a corporation or
entity that is a member of the Shareholder Group.

(b) Any Transfer of Voting Securities in violation of
this Agreement shall be void and State Bank shall be entitled to
instruct its transfer agent not to record any such Transfer on
the books of State Bank.

7. Rights with Respect to Public Offerings. 

(a) Definitions. As used in this Section 7:

(i) The term "Subject Securities" means (A) the
Shares, and (B) any shares of State Bank Common Stock issued
as (or issuable upon the conversion or exercise of any
warrant, right or other security which is issued as) a
dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in
exchange for or in replacement of, such Shares, excluding in
all cases, however, any Subject Securities sold by a person
in a transaction in which the rights under this Section 7
are not assigned or sold to or through a broker or dealer or
underwriter in a public distribution or a public securities
transaction; and

(ii) The term "Holder" means Shareholder and any
subsequent holder of Subject Securities to whom the

<PAGE>
rights set forth in this Section 7 have been transferred pursuant
to paragraph (h) hereof;

(b) Requested Underwriting.

(i) In case State Bank shall receive from
Holders, at any time after one year after the date hereof, a
written request that State Bank effect an underwritten
public offering of Subject Securities the aggregate gross
proceeds of which are reasonably expected to exceed
$1,000,000 (the "Offering Amount"), State Bank will:

(A) give written notice of the proposed
underwritten public offering to all other Holders within
seven (7) days after receipt thereof; and 

(B) use its diligent reasonable efforts to engage
an underwriter reasonably satisfactory to State Bank and
Holders and take such other steps to effect an underwritten
public offering of all or such portion of such Holders'
Subject Securities representing the Offering Amount as are
specified in such request, together with all or such portion
of the Subject Securities of any Holder or Holders joining
in such request as are specified in a written request
received by State Bank within thirty (30) days after such
written notice is given; provided, that State Bank shall not
be obligated to take any action to engage such underwriter
and effect any such underwritten public offering pursuant to
this paragraph (b):

(1) In any particular jurisdiction in which
State Bank would be required to execute a general
consent to service of process, to register as a dealer,
or to cause any officer or employee of State Bank to
register as a salesman in effecting such offering; 

(2) Within six (6) months immediately
following the consummation of an underwritten public
offering of securities of State Bank; 

(3) After State Bank has effected one such
offering pursuant to this paragraph (b); 

(4) If State Bank shall furnish to such
Holders a certificate signed by the President of State
Bank stating that in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors it would be seriously detrimental to
State Bank or its

<PAGE>
shareholders for an underwritten public offering to be effected
in the near future, then State Bank's obligation to use its best
efforts to effect such offering shall be deferred for a period
not to exceed 120 days from the date of receipt of written
request from the Holders; or 

(5) If State Bank is unable to obtain the
commitment of an underwriter reasonably satisfactory to
State Bank and Holders to firmly underwrite the
offering.

Subject to the foregoing, State Bank will use its
reasonable efforts to prepare an offering circular covering the
Subject Securities so requested to be offered for sale and obtain
the consent of the California Superintendent of Banking and all
other necessary governmental authorities to such sale within 90
days after receipt of the request or requests of the Holders.

(ii) The offering circular prepared pursuant to a
request of the Holders may include securities of State Bank
being sold for the account of State Bank.

(iii) The right of any Holder to participate in the
offering pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be conditioned
on such Holder's participation in such underwriting and the
inclusion of such Holder's Subject Securities in the
underwriting to the extent provided herein.

(iv) State Bank shall (together with all Holders
proposing to distribute their securities through such
underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected
for such underwriting in the manner set forth above. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (b),
if the underwriter advises State Bank in writing that
marketing factors require a limitation of the total number
of shares to be underwritten, then State Bank shall so
advise all Holders of Subject Securities which would
otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of
shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be
allocated fifty percent (50%) to State Bank, or such lesser
percent as is represented by the number of shares State Bank
desires be underwritten, and the remainder among all Holders
thereof in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the
respective amounts of Subject Securities held by such
Holders. No Subject Securities excluded from the
underwriting by reason of the underwriter's marketing
limitation shall be included in such underwriting. If any

<PAGE>
Holder disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, he may elect
to withdraw therefrom by written notice to State Bank, the
underwriter and the Holders. The Subject Securities so withdrawn
shall also be withdrawn from the offering; provided, however,
that, if by the withdrawal of such Subject Securities a greater
number of Subject Securities held by other Holders may be
included in such underwriting (up to the maximum of any
limitation imposed by the underwriters), then State Bank shall
offer to all Holders who have included Subject Securities in the
underwriting the right to include additional shares in the same
proportion used in determining the underwriter limitation in this
subparagraph (b)(iv).

(c) State Bank Offering.

(i) If at any time, or from time to time,
beginning one year after the date hereof, State Bank shall
determine to conduct a public offering of any State Bank
Common Stock involving sales to thirty-five or more
investors for its own account (other than in a merger or
other reorganization or in connection with any employee
benefit plan), State Bank will:

(A) promptly give to each Holder written
notice thereof (which shall include a list of the
jurisdictions in which State Bank intends to attempt to
sell such securities); and 

(B) subject to paragraph (iii) below, use
its best efforts to include in such offering all the
Subject Securities specified in any written request or
requests by any Holder or Holders received by State
Bank within twenty (20) business days after such
written notice is given on the same terms and
conditions as the State Bank Common Stock, if any,
otherwise being sold in such offering.

(ii) The right of any Holder to participate in any
underwritten public offering pursuant to this paragraph (c)
shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in the
underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder's Subject
Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided
herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their
securities through such underwriting (together with State
Bank and the other holders distributing their securities
through such underwriting) shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the underwriter or
underwriters selected for such underwriting by State Bank.

<PAGE>

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph (c), if the underwriter determines that marketing
factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be
underwritten, the underwriter may limit the amount of
securities to be included in the underwriting by the
Holders. State Bank shall so advise all Holders of Subject
Securities which would otherwise be underwritten pursuant
hereto, and the number of Subject Securities that may be
included in the underwriting shall be reduced and allocated
among all of the Holders, in proportion, as nearly as
practicable, to the amounts of Subject Securities held by
such Holders; provided, however, that the number of Subject
Securities to be included in such underwriting shall not be
reduced below twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number
of securities included in such offering. If in any public
offering under this paragraph (c) that is not underwritten
it will not, in the opinion of State Bank, be feasible to
include all Subject Securities requested to be included in
such offering, the number of Subject Securities that may be
included in the offering shall be reduced and allocated in
the manner described in the preceding sentence subject to
the 25% floor set forth therein. State Bank shall advise
all Holders of Subject Securities which would otherwise be
sold pursuant hereto of any such limitations, and the number
of shares of Subject Securities that may be included in the
offering. If any Holder disapproves of the terms of any
such offering, he may elect to withdraw therefrom by written
notice to State Bank and, if applicable, the underwriter. 
If, however, as a result of the withdrawal of such Subject
Securities a greater number of Subject Securities held by
other Holders may be included in such offering (up to the
maximum of any limitation imposed by State Bank or the
underwriters, as applicable), then State Bank shall offer to
all Holders who have included Subject Securities in the
offering the right to include additional shares in the same
proportion used in determining the limitation in this
subparagraph (iii).

(d) Expenses of Offering. All expenses incurred in
connection with any offering pursuant to this Section 7,
including without limitation, all regulatory filing fees,
printing expenses, escrow fees, fees and disbursements of counsel
for State Bank, underwriters' fees, discounts and commissions,
accounting fees and expenses, and expenses of any special audits
incidental to or required by such offering, shall be borne by
State Bank and the selling Holders in proportion to the number of
securities being sold by them in the offering; provided that
State Bank shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any
underwritten offering begun pursuant to paragraph (b) hereof if
the request therefor is subsequently withdrawn, unless the

<PAGE>
Holders agree to forfeit their rights pursuant to that
paragraph (b); provided further that the Holders may withdraw a
request under paragraph (b) hereof if at the time of such
withdrawal the Holders have learned of a material adverse change
in the condition, business or prospects of State Bank which
differs from the information known to the Holders at the time of
their request, in which event the Holders shall not be required
to pay any of the expenses of the offering and shall retain all
rights to require State Bank to conduct an underwritten public
offering of Subject Securities pursuant to paragraph (b) hereof.

(e) Procedures. If and whenever State Bank is
required by the provisions of this Section 7 to use its
reasonable efforts to effect a public offering of any of the
Subject Securities, State Bank will, as expeditiously as
possible:

(i) Prepare and file with the Superintendent an
offering circular with respect to such securities and use
its reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the
Superintendent and any other governmental or regulatory
authority to conduct the offering described therein.

(ii) Prepare and file with the Superintendent such
amendments and supplements to such offering circular as may
be necessary.

(iii) Furnish to each Holder and underwriter, if
any, participating in the offering such number of offering
circulars and such other documents as such Holder and
underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate
the public sale or other disposition of the Subject
Securities being sold by such Holder and underwriter.

(iv) If applicable, enter into and perform its
obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and
customary form, with the managing underwriter of such
offering, and each Holder participating in such underwriting
shall also enter into and perform its obligations under such
an agreement.

(v) Notify each Holder and underwriter, if any,
of Subject Securities covered by such offering circular at
any time when the offering circular is being circulated of
the happening of any event as a result of which the offering
circular, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the

<PAGE>
statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances then existing.

(vi) Furnish, at the request of any Holder
requesting an underwritten public offering of Subject
Securities pursuant to this Section 7, on the date that such
Subject Securities are delivered to the underwriters for
sale pursuant to this Section 7, (i) an opinion, dated such
date, of the counsel representing State Bank for the
purposes of such offering, in form and substance as is
customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public
offering, addressed to the underwriters and to the Holders
requesting a public offering of Subject Securities and
(ii) a letter dated such date, from the independent
certified public accountants of State Bank, in form and
substance as is customarily given by independent certified
public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public
offering, addressed to the underwriters and to the Holders
requesting a public offering of Subject Securities.

(f) Indemnification.

(i) State Bank agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Holder of Subject Securities whose Subject
Securities are included in a public offering pursuant
hereto, each of such Holder's partners, officers and
directors, each underwriter of any of the Subject Securities
included in such offering, and each person, if any, who
controls any such Holder or underwriter within the meaning
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Holder-Underwriters"), as
follows:

(A) against any and all loss, liability,
claim (joint or several), damage and expense whatsoever
arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the offering
circular (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or
alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, unless such
untrue statement or omission or such alleged untrue
statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in
strict conformity with written information furnished to
State Bank by any Holder-Underwriter expressly for use
in such offering circular (or any amendment thereto); 

(B) against any and all loss, liability,
claim, damage and expense whatsoever to the extent of
the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any

<PAGE>
litigation, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever
based upon any such untrue statement or omission or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is
effected with the written consent of State Bank; and 

(C) against any and all legal or other
expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any
litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or
omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or
omission, to the extent that any such expense is not
paid under clause (i) or (ii) above, which expenses
under this clause (iii) shall be paid by State Bank as
incurred; 

provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement is
subject to the condition that, insofar as it relates to any such
untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged
omission made in the offering circular but eliminated or remedied
in an amended offering circular delivered to such Holder-
Underwriter, such indemnity agreement shall not inure to the
benefit of any underwriter, or any Holder, if a copy of such
amended offering circular was made available to such underwriter
or such Holder and was not furnished to the person or entity
asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the
time the sale to such person or entity was consummated.

In no case shall State Bank be liable under this
indemnity agreement with respect to any loss, liability, claim,
damage or expense with respect to any claim made against any
Holder-Underwriter unless State Bank shall be notified in writing
of the nature of the claim within a reasonable time after the
assertion thereof, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such
action, but failure to so notify State Bank shall not relieve
State Bank from any liability which it may have otherwise than on
account of this indemnity agreement. In case of any such notice,
State Bank shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the
defense, or if it so elects within a reasonable time after
receipt of such notice, to assume the defense of any suit brought
to enforce any such claim; but if it so elects to assume the
defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it
and approved by the Holder-Underwriter or Holder-Underwriters and
other defendant or defendants, if any, in any suit so brought,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event
that State Bank elects to assume the defense of any such suit and
retain such counsel, the Holder-Underwriter or Holder-
Underwriters and other defendant or defendants, which may be
represented

<PAGE>
without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain
one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by
State Bank, but only if representation of such Holder-Underwriter
and other defendant or defendants would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interest between such indemnified
party and any other party represented by such counsel in such
proceeding.

(ii) Each Holder severally agrees that it will
indemnify and hold harmless State Bank, each officer and
director of State Bank, each person, if any, who controls
State Bank within the meaning of the Securities Act, each
underwriter of Subject Securities included in any offering
pursuant to this Section 7, each person, if any, who
controls such underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act, each other Holder, each of such other
Holder's partners, officers and directors, and each person
controlling such other holder within the meaning of the
Securities Act against any and all loss, liability, claim,
damage and expense, up to the amount of the gross proceeds
actually received from the offering by such Holder, to the
extent described in clauses (i)(A) through (i)(C),
inclusive, of this paragraph (f), but only with respect to
statements or omissions, or alleged statements or omissions
made in such offering circular (or any amendment thereto) in
reliance upon and in strict conformity with written
information furnished to State Bank by such Holder expressly
for use in such offering circular (or any amendment
thereto). In case any action shall be brought against State
Bank or any person so indemnified pursuant to the provisions
of this subparagraph (ii) and in respect of which indemnity
may be sought against any Holder, the Holders from whom
indemnity is sought shall have the rights and duties given
to State Bank, and State Bank and the other persons so
indemnified shall have the rights and duties given to the
persons entitled to indemnification by the provisions of
subparagraph (i) of this paragraph (f).

(g) Information by Holder. The Holder or Holders of
Subject Securities included in any offering shall furnish to
State Bank such information regarding such Holder or Holders, and
the distribution proposed by such Holder or Holders, as State
Bank may reasonably request in writing.

(h) Transfer of Rights. The rights granted by State
Bank under paragraphs (b) and (c) hereof may be assigned, in
whole or in part, in writing by any Holder of Subject Securities
or shares convertible into Subject Securities to a transferee or
assignee of Subject Securities representing more than 5% of the
total combined voting power of all Voting Securities then
outstanding; provided, that

<PAGE>
such Transfer is effected in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement; and provided further, that State Bank is given
written notice by such Holder at the time of or within a
reasonable time after said Transfer, stating the name and address
of said transferee or assignee and identifying the securities
with respect to which such rights are being assigned.

(i) "Market Stand-off" Agreement. Shareholder and
each other member of the Shareholder Group, and each other Holder
of Subject Securities to which the rights under this Section 7
have been assigned, shall, so long as any such person owns more
than 5% of the outstanding Voting Securities of State Bank if
requested by State Bank and an underwriter of State Bank Common
Stock or other securities of State Bank, agree not Transfer any
securities of State Bank held by them during the one hundred
eighty (180) day period from the date of the underwriting
agreement; provided that all Holders holding more than five
percent of the outstanding State Bank Common Stock and all
officers, directors, and employees of State Bank enter into
similar agreements. Such agreement shall be in writing in the
form satisfactory to State Bank and such underwriter. State Bank
may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the
securities subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of
said one hundred eighty (180) day period.

8. Covenants of Shareholder Group in Absence of 
Regulatory Approval. In addition to rather than in lieu of any
of the other agreements of the parties contained herein,
Shareholder, for itself and for each member of the Shareholder
Group, hereby agrees that, without obtaining the prior written
approval of the FRB and the Superintendent if appropriate,
neither Shareholder nor any member of the Shareholder Group will: 
(a) exercise or attempt to exercise a controlling influence over
the management or policies of State Bank; (b) have or seek to
have any employees or representatives serve as an officer, agent
or employee of State Bank; (c) take any action causing State Bank
to become a subsidiary of Shareholder or any member of the
Shareholder Group; (d) acquire or retain any Voting Securities
that would cause the combined interest of Shareholder, each
member of the Shareholder Group and each of their respective
officers, directors, and affiliates, to equal or exceed 25% of
the then outstanding Voting Securities of State Bank; (e) propose
a director or slate of directors in opposition to a nominee or
slate of nominees proposed by the management or board of
directors of State Bank; (f) attempt to influence the dividend
policies or practices of State Bank; (g) solicit or participate

policies of State Bank, the pricing of services, any personnel
decisions, the location of any offices, branching, the hours of
operation, or similar activities of State Bank; (i) dispose or
threaten to dispose of any Voting Securities in any matter as a
condition of specific action or inaction by State Bank; (j) enter
into any other banking or non-banking transactions with State
Bank, except that deposit accounts may be established and
maintained with State Bank provided that the aggregate balances
of all such accounts do not exceed $500,000 and that the accounts
are maintained on substantially the same terms as those
prevailing for comparable accounts of persons unaffiliated with
State Bank; or (k) seek or accept representation on the Board of
Directors of State Bank.

9. Specific Performance. Each party hereto acknowledges
that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to the
other party if a party hereto fails to comply with any of the
obligations imposed by this Agreement, that every such obligation
is material and that, in the event of any such failure, the other
party will not have an adequate remedy at law or damages, and
accordingly, each party hereto agrees that injunctive relief or
other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or
damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure.

10. Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided
herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns and shall not be assignable without the written
consent of all the other parties hereto.

agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived,
except expressly by an instrument in writing signed by all the
parties hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by any party
shall be deemed a waiver by any such party nor shall any such
waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by
such party.

12. Effectiveness and Termination. This Agreement shall
become effective upon the date of consummation of the
Consolidation and, except as otherwise provided herein, shall
terminate as to every member of the Shareholder Group on the date
the Shareholder Group owns of record and

<PAGE>
beneficially Voting Securities representing 5% or less of the
total combined voting power of all Voting Securities then
outstanding, and as to each other shareholder party hereto, on
the date such shareholder owns of record and beneficially Voting
Securities representing 5% or less of the total combined voting
power of all Voting Securities then outstanding.

13. Miscellaneous.

under, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with
the laws of, the State of California without regard to the
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

(b) Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the
remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 22, 1994

WEST COAST BANCORP ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT FOR BUSINESS &
PROFESSIONAL BANK TO ACQUIRE SACRAMENTO FIRST NATIONAL BANK

NEWPORT BEACH, CA, June 22, 1994 -- John Joseph, Chairman of the
Board of West Coast Bancorp, announced the signing of a
definitive agreement among Business & Professional Bank,
Sacramento First National Bank and West Coast Bancorp providing
for the acquisition of its majority owned subsidiary, Sacramento
First National Bank, by Business & Professional Bank. On
consummation of the transaction, the outstanding shares of common
stock of Sacramento First National Bank will be exchanged for
consideration of a combination of approximately $4.0 million in
cash, $2.5 million of common stock of Business & Professional
Bank and up to $1.0 million of a contingent cash payment. The
common stock consideration will be based on Business &
Professional Bank's book value per common share as of the end of
the month prior to consummation of the transaction.

Completion of the transaction is subject to among other things,
the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals from the state and
federal agencies as well as the approval of the shareholders of
both Business & Professional Bank and Sacramento First National
Bank. West Coast Bancorp, the 94% shareholder of Sacramento
<PAGE>

First National Bank, has agreed to vote its shares in favor of
the transaction.

It is expected that the transaction will close during the fourth
quarter of 1994. After completion of the transaction, West Coast
Bancorp will have one operating subsidiary, Sunwest Bank
headquartered in Tustin, California. West Coast Bancorp intends
to contribute a significant portion of the cash proceeds it
receives upon consummation of the transaction as additional
capital to Sunwest Bank. Sunwest Bank is currently operating
under regulatory orders, which require it to increase its capital
levels.

At March 31, 1994, Sacramento First National Bank had $120
million in total assets and $8.8 million in stockholders' equity. 
Originally organized in 1983 as a business oriented commercial
bank by founding President John McGrath, Sacramento First
National Bank subsequently acquired Sacramento Valley Bank, N.A.,
by merger in December of 1985. It presently has three banking
offices located in the Sacramento area.

As of March 31, 1994, Business & Professional Bank had total
assets of $121 million. Operating as a wholesale business bank,
it presently maintains three full service banking offices located
in Sacramento, Davis and Woodland. As the name implies, Business
& Professional Bank specializes in a niche market comprised of
professional and general business clients.
