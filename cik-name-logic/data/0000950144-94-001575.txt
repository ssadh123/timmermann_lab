ITEM 2.

On August 12, 1994, JCJ, Inc. ("JCJ"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The
Actava Group Inc. (the "Company"), sold its interest in Qualex Inc. ("Qualex")
to Eastman Kodak Company ("Kodak"), and both JCJ and the Company entered into a
covenant not to compete and a release in favor of Kodak in exchange for
payments in cash and notes totaling $150 million. Qualex is a wholesale
photofinishing company created in 1988 through a merger of the Company's and
Kodak's photofinishing operations. Qualex had been jointly owned by the
Company or an affiliate and Kodak since its formation.

JCJ sold to Kodak its 50% ownership interest in Qualex in exchange for a
total purchase price of $136 million. The purchase price consisted of a $36
million cash payment on August 12, 1994 and a $100 million note, payable in two
installments of $50 million each, without interest, on February 13, 1995 and
August 11, 1995. In the second quarter of 1994, the Company provided for an
anticipated loss of $37.9 million on the sale of its interest in Qualex.
Because the principal amount due under the note does not bear interest, the
Company discounted the value of the note to $92.8 million for financial
reporting purposes and will record imputed interest income of $7.2 million over
the term of the note.

In addition, in exchange for a cash payment on August 12, 1994 of $10
million, both JCJ and the Company entered into a covenant-not-to-compete with
Kodak, under which both JCJ and the Company have agreed not to engage in
certain activities for a period which ends on August 12, 1999. Both JCJ and
the Company also executed a release in favor of Kodak with regard to certain
items arising under the Shareholders' Agreement dated as of December 7, 1987, 
as amended, between the Company and Kodak in exchange for a $4 million cash 
payment on August 12, 1994. The consideration for the Company's interest in 
Qualex and the covenant-not-to-compete and release were determined by arm's 
length negotiation.

There was no material relationship, other than the joint ownership of Qualex
and related matters, between Kodak and the Company or any of its affiliates,
any director or officer of the Company or any associate of such director or
officer.
<PAGE> 3
ITEM 5. Other Events

On June 8, 1993, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired
substantially all the assets of Diversified Products Corporation ("DP") for a
net purchase price consisting of $11.6 million in cash, the issuance of
1,090,909 shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Acquisition Shares")
valued at $12 million, and the assumption or payment of certain liabilities
including trade payables and a revolving credit facility. The Company also
entered into an agreement providing the holder of the Acquisition Shares (the
"Holder") with the right to receive additional payments depending upon the
value of the Acquisition Shares over a period of not longer than one year from
the purchase date. The agreement gives the Holder the right under certain
circumstances to require the Company to purchase the Acquisition Shares at a
price equal to $11.00 per share. The repurchase of the Acquisition Shares will
not increase the cost recorded by Actava for DP, but will affect the manner in
which the total purchase price is recorded by Actava. The right of the Holder
to receive additional payments of cash became exercisable after June 8, 1994
and would have expired if not exercised on or before August 7, 1994. On August
3, 1994, the Holder agreed to extend the exercise date to February 7, 1995 in
exchange for the payment by Actava of a $435,000 fee and an irrevocable letter
of credit in the amount of $12.0 million which is available and payable to the
Holder on February 17, 1995 upon demand and tender of the Acquisition Shares.
On August 17, 1994, an amendment to the Shareholder Rights Agreement dated June
8, 1993 between the Company and Westinghouse Electric Corporation was executed
to confirm the August 3, 1994 agreement. A copy of the amendment is herewith
filed as an exhibit.

(without charge) as they may reasonably request in
connection with any indemnification or defense provided for
herein, including, without limitation, providing such
information, documents and records and

PROMISSORY NOTE

$100,000,000.00 August 12, 1994

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY, a New
Jersey corporation (the "Company"), hereby promises to pay to the order of JCJ,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Payee"), the principal sum of One Hundred
Million Dollars ($100,000,000.00). The principal amount hereunder shall be
paid by the Company in two installments of Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000.00) each, with the first such installment to be due and payable on
February 13, 1995, and with the final installment to be due and payable on
August 11, 1995.

No interest shall be due or payable on the principal amount of this
Note unless payments of principal are not paid when due. Overdue principal
shall bear interest, payable on demand, at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per
annum.

All payments of principal or interest shall be made in lawful money of
the United States of America and in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account designated by the Payee at the time of execution and
delivery of this Note or to such other account as the Payee or other holder of
this Note may designate by written notice to the Company at least ten (10) days
prior to the date on which any payment is due.

The indebtedness evidenced by this Note may be prepaid, either in
whole or in part, at any time without penalty.

Upon default in the payment of any installment of principal on this
Note, then the Payee or other holder of this Note may declare the unpaid
principal balance hereunder to be immediately due and payable, anything
hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding. The Company acknowledges that
time is of the essence.

If this Note is not paid when due, whether at maturity or by
acceleration, the Company promises to pay all costs of collection, including
but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees, whether or not suit is filed.

The Company waives presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of
dishonor and any and all other notices or demands in connection with the
delivery, acceptance, performance, default or enforcement of this Note. The
Company agrees that no delay on the part of the Payee or other holder of this
Note in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude the later
exercise of that right or any other right.

Nothing contained in this Note shall be deemed to establish or require
the payment of a rate of interest in excess of the maximum rate permitted by
law. In the event that the rate of

<PAGE> 30
interest required to be paid under this Note exceeds the maximum rate permitted
by law, the rate of interest required to be paid hereunder shall be
automatically reduced to the maximum rate permitted by law.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the duly authorized officers of the Company have
hereunto set their hands under the corporate seal of the Company as of the day
and year first above written.

This Agreement is entered into as of the 12th day of August, 1994, by and among
Eastman Kodak Company, a New Jersey corporation ("Buyer"), The Actava Group
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Actava"), and JCJ, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Actava ("JCJ").

WHEREAS, Buyer has purchased from JCJ all of its interest in Qualex Inc. (the

and

WHEREAS, it is essential to Buyer and the Company that Actava and JCJ refrain
from involvement in businesses that compete with the Company.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

1. Covenant Not to Compete.

(a) For the benefit of Buyer and the Company, Actava and JCJ shall
not, separately or jointly with a third party or directly or indirectly, for a
period of five years from the date hereof: (i) engage in activities or
businesses anywhere in the world which are in competition with the current
business of the Company and its subsidiaries, including without limitation,
rendering of wholesale or retail photofinishing services and wholesale and
retail sale and distribution of photographic equipment and supplies; (ii)
solicit any customer or prospective customer of the Company or its subsidiaries
to purchase any goods or services currently sold by the Company or its
subsidiaries from anyone other than the Company or its subsidiaries; (iii)
assist any person in any way to do, or attempt to do, anything prohibited by
(i) or (ii) above; (iv) solicit or recruit any employee of the Company or its

(b) In the event that the duration or geographical limit of any
restriction contained herein is determined to be unenforceable by any competent
authority in any enforcement proceeding, it is the intention of the parties
that the restrictive covenants set forth herein shall not thereby be terminated
but shall be deemed amended to the extent required to render it valid and
enforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the operation hereof

shall be entitled to an injunction restraining the breach thereof and may
pursue any of their available remedies for such actual or threatened breach,
including the recovery of monetary damages. If, in any judicial proceeding, a
court shall refuse to enforce any of such covenants, any such unenforceable

enforcement to the extent practicable; otherwise, any such covenant shall be
deemed eliminated from this Agreement for the purposes of such proceeding to
the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced.

Re: Amendment ("Amendment") of June 8, 1993 Shareholder Rights
Agreement between The Actava Group Inc. (formerly Fuqua
Industries) and Westinghouse Electric Corporation
("Shareholder Agreement")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The purpose of this Amendment is to confirm that in consideration of
the agreement of the Westinghouse Executive Pension Trust Fund ("Fund") to
defer for a limited time exercising the put right to sell to The Actava Group
Inc. ("Company") all of the 1,090,909 shares of Company common stock (the
"Shares") acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation ("WEC") pursuant to the
April 30, 1993 Asset Purchase Agreement, within ten days of the execution of
this Amendment, the Company shall pay to the Fund a fee in the amount of
$435,000 (the "Fee"), and shall deliver to the Fund an irrevocable letter of
credit in favor of Mellon Bank, N.A., as Trustee ("Trustee") of the Fund, as
beneficiary, in the amount of $12,000,000, payable at any time ("Letter of
Credit").

The parties hereby agree to delete Section 6(e) of the Shareholder
Agreement, and to delete Sections 6(b) and 6(c) thereof, and to substitute the
following provisions in lieu of such latter two Sections.

b) Notice. Each WEC Holder may exercise the Put Right with respect to all
of the Shares by delivery of notice (the "Notice of Exercise") to the Company
on or before February 7, 1995. The Notice of Exercise shall bind all WEC
Holders to sell to the Company (and shall bind the Company to purchase) all of
the Shares.

Amendment of Shareholder Agreement

(c) Closing. The closing of any sale of the Shares pursuant to the
Notice of Exercise of the Put Right automatically shall occur on February 17,
1995. At such closing, (i) each WEC Holder selling the Shares shall deliver to
the bank issuing the Letter of Credit certificates representing all the Shares,
endorsed to the Company or accompanied by duly-executed stock powers
transferring all the Shares to the Company, and appropriate certification that
the selling WEC Holder has good, valid, and unencumbered title to all the
Shares, and has transferred such free and clear title to the Company; and (ii)
the WEC Holder shall immediately receive $12,000,000 upon draft or demand by
the Trustee to the bank issuing the Letter of Credit.

In addition to the foregoing, notwithstanding any other provision of
the Shareholder Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby agree to the
following terms.

1. From the date hereof through February 6, 1995, the Company shall have the
right but not the obligation ("Call Right") to require the Fund or any other
WEC Holder to sell to the Company all of the Shares then owned by the Fund or
any other WEC Holder. The call purchase price ("Call Purchase Price") shall
equal the greater of (a) $11.00 per Share or (b) that amount offered to the
Fund or any other WEC Holder pursuant to a bonafide written offer to purchase
the Shares received by the Fund or any other WEC Holder from an unrelated third
party with the financial ability to purchase the Shares. In the event the Fund
or any other WEC Holder does not provide the Company with a copy of such
bonafide written offer within five (5) days of the date of the notice of
exercise hereunder, the Call Purchase Price shall equal the greater of (a)
$11.00 per Share or (b) ninety percent (90%) of the average trading price for
the Shares on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten (10) days prior to the
date on which the Company exercises its Call Right. The Company may exercise
its Call Right by delivery of notice to the Fund or any other WEC Holder no
later than February 6, 1995. The notice shall bind the Fund or such WEC Holder
to sell to the Company (and shall bind the Company to purchase) all of the
Shares. The closing of any sale of the Shares pursuant to the Call Right shall
occur on such date and at such place as shall be agreed upon by the Company and
the Fund or any other WEC Holder; provided, however, that such closing shall
occur within ten (10) days of the date of the

notice, or the next business day thereafter. Such closing shall occur in
accordance with the terms, conditions and procedures set forth in Section 6(c)
(i) and (ii) of the Shareholder Agreement, as amended; the Fund or any other
WEC Holder selling the Shares shall immediately receive from the Company that
amount, if any, by which the Call Purchase Price exceeds $12,000,000; and the
Fund or any other WEC Holder shall refund to the Company a prorated portion of
the Fee which shall be an amount equal to the product of (a) the Fee; and (b) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from the date on which
the closing occurs to February 17, 1995, and the denominator of which is the
number of days from the date hereof to February 17, 1995. If such closing is
to occur before February 17, 1995, the Company shall, on or before the date of
such closing, deliver to the bank issuing the Letter of Credit the Company's
written consent to the drawing by the Trustee of the $12,000,000 under the
Letter of Credit on the date of such closing.

2. The Trustee shall only draw upon the Letter of Credit in connection with
the exercise of the Put Right or the Call Right.

3. For purposes of this Amendment, the Shares shall be deemed to be
represented by share certificates numbers NSD100053 through NSD100063,
inclusive, together with the certificates representing any other securities
hereafter issued with respect to the Shares by way of exchange,
reclassification, dividend or distribution. On or before any closing pursuant
to this Amendment, the Company shall furnish written certification to the bank
issuing the Letter of Credit either identifying any such additional or
different certificates issued and delivered by the Company to WEC or any WEC
Holder, or confirming that no such additional or different certificates have
been issued, as the case may be.

This Amendment is the final and entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Amendment. Except as specifically
modified by this Amendment, the Shareholder Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect, and shall not operate as a waiver of either party's rights
thereunder. To confirm your acceptance of this Amendment, please execute the
enclosed counterpart original and return it to the undersigned.
