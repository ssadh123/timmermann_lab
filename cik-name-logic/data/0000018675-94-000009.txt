AMENDMENT NO. 1 to

CURRENT REPORT

Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): January 13,

CENTRAL MAINE POWER COMPANY
(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)

The Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 13,
1994 is hereby amended as follows:

1. Item 4, "Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant"
is amended to read as follows:

"Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

On January 19, 1994, on recommendation of the Company's Audit
Committee, which had requested proposals from major accounting
firms consistent with its policy of periodically reviewing
accounting services, the Board of Directors of the Company
engaged Coopers & Lybrand as the Company's principal accountant
to audit the Company's 1994 financial statements.

During 1991, the Company was investigating a possible change in
the accounting treatment associated with deferred investment tax
credits. After discussion with the predecessor auditors, Arthur
Andersen & Co., who disagreed with the proposed accounting, and
with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Company abandoned any plans to make such
a proposed change.

In compliance with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K, a letter
from Arthur Andersen & Co., the Company's predecessor auditors,
is filed as an exhibit hereto. Arthur Andersen & Co. is
currently in the process of auditing the Company's 1993 financial
statements, but was not engaged to audit the Company's 1994
financial statements. The reports of Arthur Andersen & Co. on
the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 1991 and 1992 contained no adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

In connection with the 1991 disagreement between the Company and
Arthur Andersen & Co. referred to in the second paragraph of this
Item (which was resolved as set forth therein), the subject
matter of the disagreement was discussed with the Audit Committee
of the Company by Arthur Andersen & Co. The Company has
authorized Arthur Andersen & Co. to respond fully to any
inquiries by Coopers & Lybrand concerning the subject matter of
such disagreement."

During such period neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf
consulted Coopers & Lybrand regarding any matter described in
Item 304(a)(2) of Regulation S-K.

2. The following item is hereby added:

"Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information
and Exhibits.

(16) Letter re Change in Certifying Accountant

16.1 Letter from Arthur Andersen & Co. dated
February 3, 1994."

3. The phrase "Item 6 through 8. Not applicable."
appearing immediately before the section entitled "Signature" is
hereby amended to read "Item 6 and Item 8. Not applicable."

SIGNATURE

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this amendment to be
signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly
authorized.
