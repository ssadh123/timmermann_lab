Item_5.__OTHER_EVENTS

Reference is made to the discussion under "Westinghouse Lawsuit" in Part I, 

Item 3 of the Duquesne Light Company ("Duquesne") Form 10-K Annual Report for 

the year ended December 31, 1993 and the discussion under "Westinghouse

Lawsuit" in Note 6 of the Duquesne Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports for the

quarters ended March 31, 1994, June 30, 1994 and September 30, 1994,

relating to plans for replacement of the steam generators at Beaver Valley

Units 1 and 2.

Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Duquesne Light Company, Ohio 

Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company and Toledo Edison Company ("The 

CAPCO Companies") joined in Beaver Valley steam generator litigation against 

Westinghouse Electric Company. A jury trial began September 12, 1994 in

Federal District Court in Western Pennsylvania. This was the first steam

generator case to be tried before a jury, although twelve additional lawsuits

have been brought against Westinghouse by other utility companies around the

country for similar problems with Westinghouse steam generators. On October

24, 1994, the Court dismissed four of the five claims against Westinghouse,

leaving only the fraud claim. On December 6, 1994, the jury rendered a

verdict in favor of Westinghouse on the fraud count. The CAPCO Companies,

owners of the Beaver Valley Plant, intend to appeal the decision to the U.S.

Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Duquesne cannot predict the outcome

of this matter; however, Duquesne does not believe that resolution will have

a materially adverse effect on Duquesne's financial position or results of

operations.

Based on existing knowledge of the condition of the steam generators, 

limited repair options and other companies' experiences with Westinghouse steam 

generators, replacement of the Unit 1 steam generator lower assemblies could 

occur as early as 1997. Based on other companies' experiences with replacing 

steam generators at similar units, replacement cost is estimated to be 

approximately $125 million. Duquesne's interest in Unit 1 is 47.5 percent. In 

Unit 2 Duquesne's interest is 13.74 percent.

Reference is also made to the discussion under "Employees" in the Outlook 

section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 

Results of Operations in Item 2 of the Duquesne Form 10-Q for the quarter ended 

September 30, 1994. On November 29, 1994, the International Brotherhood of 

Electrical Workers ratified a contract with Duquesne Light Company effective 

October 1, 1994, with a term expiring September 30, 1998.
