Item 5. Other Events.
On April 14, 1994, Loctite Corporation, a 
Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), entered into 
(i) a Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement"), dated 
as of April 14, 1984, between the Corporation and The 
First National Bank of Boston, as Rights Agent (the 
"Rights Agent"), and (ii) an agreement (the "Henkel 
Agreement"), dated as of April 14, 1994, Henkel 
Corporation, Henkel KGaA and HC Investments, Inc. 
(collectively, Henkel).
A. Rights Agreement.
On April 14, 1994, the Board of Directors of 
the Corporation declared a dividend distribution of one 
right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of Common 
Stock, $.01 par value per share (the "Common Shares"), 
of the Corporation. The dividend is payable to the 
stockholders of record on April 25, 1994 (the "Record 
Date") and with respect to Common Shares issued 
thereafter until the Distribution Date (as defined 
below), and, in certain circumstances, with respect to 
Common Shares issued after the Distribution Date. 
Except as set forth below, each Right, when it becomes 
exercisable, entitles the registered holder to purchase 
from the Corporation one Common Share at a price of 
$175.00 per Common Share (the "Purchase Price"), 
subject to adjustment. The description and terms of 
the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement.
Initially, the Rights will be attached to all 
certificates representing Common Shares then 
outstanding, and no separate Right Certificates (as 
hereinafter defined) will be distributed. The Rights 
will separate from the Common Shares upon the earlier 
to occur of (i) the date of a public announcement that 
a person or "group" (other than a Grandfathered 
Stockholder (as hereinafter defined) has acquired 
beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding 
Common Shares (except pursuant to a Permitted Offer, as 
hereinafter defined); or (ii) 10 days (or such later 
date as the Board may determine) following the 
commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer the 
consummation of which would result in a person or group 
becoming an Acquiring Person (as hereinafter defined) 
(the earlier of such dates being called the 
"Distribution Date"). A person or group whose 
acquisition of Common Shares causes a Distribution Date 
pursuant to clause (i) above is an "Acquiring Person." 
The date that a person or group becomes an Acquiring 
Person is the "Shares Acquisition Date."
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Acquiring 
Person does not include the following persons 
("Grandfathered Stockholders"): (i) Henkel 
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("HenkelCo"), (ii) 
Mr. Robert H. Krieble, Ms. Nancy B. Krieble, 
Mr. Frederick B. Krieble, Ms. Collette C. Krieble, 
Mr. James P. Fusscas, Ms. Helen K. Fusscas, Mr. Martin 
Wolman, Management I, Limited and Management II, 
Limited as a "group" (as such term is defined or used 
under Rule 13d-5(b) promulgated pursuant to 
<PAGE>
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as amended) (collectively as such group, the "Krieble 
Family Group") and (iii) any Permitted Transferee (as 
hereinafter defined); provided, however, that, except 
under limited circumstances, (a) Henkel will cease to 
be a Grandfathered Stockholder at any time after the 
date of the Rights Agreement that Henkel beneficially 
owns a percentage of outstanding Common Shares in 
excess of the Henkel Percentage (as hereinafter 
defined) then in effect (other than as a result of a 
Permitted Offer), (b) the Krieble Family Group will 
cease to be a Grandfathered Stockholder at the time 
after the date of the Rights Agreement any member of 
the Krieble Family Group beneficially owns any 
additional Common Shares (other than as a result of a 
stock dividend, a stock split, a grant by the 
Corporation pursuant to a directors benefit plan 
established by the Corporation of Common Shares or 
options to purchase Common Shares (and the exercise 
thereof) or a Permitted Offer) and (c) any Permitted 
Transferee will cease to be a Grandfathered Stockholder 
at the time such Permitted Transferee beneficially owns 
any additional Common Shares (other than as a result of 
a stock dividend, a stock split or a Permitted Offer). 
Initially, the "Henkel Percentage" is 35% of the 
outstanding Common Shares and thereafter is subject to 
adjustment as follows: (1) in the event of any 
transfer of Common Shares by Henkel to any person 
(other than by means of a transfer of Common Shares 
pursuant to a registered public offering or a broker's 
transaction under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended, and that satisfies certain other 
conditions to ensure a wide distribution of those 
Common Shares (each such transfer, a "Distribution 
Transaction")), the Henkel Percentage will be reduced 
by the percentage of outstanding Common Shares so 
transferred; (2) in the event of transfers aggregating 
more than 10% of the outstanding Common Shares by 
Henkel by means of Distribution Transactions, the 
Henkel Percentage will be reduced by the aggregate 
percentage of outstanding Common Shares so transferred 
in excess of 10% of the outstanding Common Shares; and 
(3) in the event that the Corporation acquires any 
Common Shares, the Henkel Percentage immediately 
following such acquisition will equal the greater of 
the Henkel Percentage immediately prior to such 
acquisition and the percentage of the outstanding 
Common Shares beneficially owned by Henkel immediately 
following such acquisition.
A "Permitted Transfer" is any transfer of 
Common Shares from Henkel, the Krieble Family Group as 
a whole, or any Permitted Transferee to any person that 
(i) has not been declared an Adverse Person (as 
hereinafter defined) by a majority of those directors 
of the Corporation who are neither officers or 
employees of the Corporation nor a designee or 
representative of the proposed transferor (the 
"Unaffiliated Directors"), (ii) does not beneficially 
own, after giving effect to the transfer, in the case 
of a transfer from the Krieble Family Group or any 
Permitted Transferee, any Common Shares other than the 
Common Shares so transferred to such transferee or in 
the case of a transfer from Henkel, a percentage of the 
then outstanding Common Shares in excess of the lesser 
of (a) the Henkel Percentage in effect immediately 
prior to such proposed transfer and (b) the sum of 0.3% 
of the then outstanding Common Shares and the 
percentage of the 
<PAGE>
then outstanding Common Shares so 
transferred to such transferee, (iii) at least 30 days 
prior to the consummation of such proposed transfer, 
executes and delivers to the Corporation an agreement 
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 attached to 
the Rights Agreement and (iv) immediately prior to the 
consummation of such transfer, executes and delivers to 
the Corporation an executive officer's certificate 
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 attached to 
the Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement provides 
that any proposed Permitted Transferee will be deemed 
to be an "Adverse Person" if it is declared to be an 
Adverse Person by a majority of the Unaffiliated 
Directors after having determined in its business 
judgment that beneficial ownership by such proposed 
Permitted Transferee of 10% or more of the outstanding 
Common Shares would be reasonably likely to materially 
adversely affect the Corporation or its stockholders.
The Rights Agreement provides that, until the 
Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred with 
and only with the Common Shares. Until the 
Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration 
of the Rights), new Common Share certificates issued 
after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuance of 
Common Shares will contain a notation incorporating the 
Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution 
Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the 
Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates 
for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date 
will also constitute the transfer of the Rights 
associated with the Common Shares represented by such 
certificate. As soon as practicable following the 
Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the 
Rights (the "Right Certificates") will be mailed to 
holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close 
of business on the Distribution Date (and to each 
initial record holder of certain Common Shares issued 
after the Distribution Date), and these separate Right 
Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
The Rights are not exercisable until the 
Distribution Date and will expire at the close of 
business on April 14, 2004, unless earlier redeemed by 
the Corporation as described below.
In the event that any person becomes an 
Acquiring Person (except pursuant to a tender or 
exchange offer which is for all outstanding Common 
Shares and (i) which is at a price and on terms which a 
majority of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter 
defined) and a majority of the entire Board determines 
to be adequate and in the best interests of the 
Corporation, its stockholders and its other relevant 
constituencies, other than such person making such 
offer, or (ii) which remains open for a period of at 
least 60 days after the tender or exchange offer has 
commenced and the consummation of which results in the 
person on whose basis the tender or exchange offer is 
made becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of 
the outstanding Common Shares (a "Permitted Offer")), 
each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right 
(the "Flip-In Right") to receive upon exercise the 
number of Common Shares (or, in certain circumstances, 
other securities of the Corporation) having a value 
(immediately prior to this triggering event) 
<PAGE>
equal to two times the Purchase Price of the Right. In lieu of 
the Flip-In Right described above, the Board, at its 
option, may exchange each Right for one Common Share, 
provided that at no time has any person been the 
beneficial owner of 50% or more of the outstanding 
Common Shares. Such an exchange must be authorized by 
(a) a majority of the Disinterested Directors and (b) a 
majority of all of the directors of the Board. A 
"Disinterested Director" means any director of the 
Corporation who is neither an officer or employee of 
the Corporation nor any designee or representative of 
any person attempting to effect a business combination 
or similar transaction with the Corporation. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence 
of a person becoming an Acquiring Person, all Rights 
that are, or (under certain circumstances specified in 
the Rights Agreement) were, beneficially owned by any 
Acquiring Person will be null and void.
In the event that at any time following the 
Shares Acquisition Date, (i) the Corporation is 
acquired in a merger or other business combination 
transaction in which the holders of all of the 
outstanding Common Shares immediately prior to the 
consummation of the transaction are not the holders of 
all of the surviving corporation's voting power, or 
(ii) more than 50% of the Corporation's assets or 
earning power is sold or transferred, in either case 
with or to (a) an Acquiring Person or any affiliate or 
associate or any other person in which such Acquiring 
Person, affiliate or associate has an interest or any 
person acting on behalf of or in concert with such 
Acquiring Person, affiliate or associate, or, (b) any 
other person (but only if in any such transaction 
referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, all holders of 
Common Shares are not treated alike), then each holder 
of a Right (except Rights which previously have been 
voided as set forth above) will have the right (the 
"Flip-Over Right") to receive, upon exercise, common 
shares of the acquiring Corporation having a value 
equal to two times the Purchase Price of the Right. 
The holder of a Right will continue to have the Flip-
Over Right whether or not such holder exercises or 
surrenders the Flip-In Right.
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of 
Common Shares or other securities issuable, upon 
exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from 
time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a 
stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or 
reclassification of, the Common Shares, (ii) upon the 
grant to holders of the Common Shares of certain rights 
or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares 
at a price, or securities convertible into Common 
Shares with a conversion price, less than the then 
current market price of the Common Shares or (iii) upon 
the distribution to holders of the Common Shares of 
evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular 
quarterly cash dividends) or of subscription rights or 
warrants (other than those referred to above).
The number of outstanding Rights and the 
number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of each 
Right are also subject to adjustment in the event of a 
stock 
<PAGE>
split of the Common Shares or a stock dividend on 
the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or 
subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the 
Common Shares occurring, in any such case, prior to the 
Distribution Date.
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the 
Purchase Price will be required until cumulative 
adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in 
such Purchase Price. Fractional Common Shares will not 
be required to be issued by the Corporation, and in 
lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based 
on the market price of the Common Shares on the last 
trading day prior to the date of exercise.
At any time prior to the earlier to occur of 
(i) a person becoming an Acquiring Person or (ii) the 
expiration of the Rights, the Corporation may redeem 
the Rights at a price of $.01 per Right (the 
"Redemption Price"), which redemption will be effective 
upon approval of (a) a majority of the Disinterested 
Directors and (b) a majority of all of the directors of 
the Corporation. Additionally, following the Shares 
Acquisition Date, the then outstanding Rights may be 
redeemed at the Redemption Price (if approved by (1) a 
majority of the Disinterested Directors and (2) a 
majority of all of the directors of the Corporation), 
if this redemption is in connection with a merger or 
other business combination transaction or series of 
transactions involving the Corporation in which all 
holders of Common Shares are treated alike but not 
involving an Acquiring Person or its affiliates or 
associates.
Prior to the Distribution Date, all of the 
provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by 
approval of (i) a majority of the Disinterested 
Directors and (ii) a majority of all of the directors 
of the Corporation. After the Distribution Date, the 
provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended upon 
approval of (a) a majority of the Disinterested 
Directors and (b) a majority of all of the directors of 
the Corporation in order to cure any ambiguity, defect 
or inconsistency, or to make changes which do not 
adversely affect the interests of holders of Rights 
(excluding the interests of any Acquiring Person).
The Rights may not be redeemed, exchanged or 
amended unless there is at least one Disinterested 
Director at the time of such redemption, exchange or 
amendment.
Until a Right is exercised, the holder 
thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder 
of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the 
right to vote or to receive dividends. While the 
distribution of the Rights will not be taxable to 
stockholders of the Corporation, stockholders may, 
depending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable 
income should the Rights become exercisable or upon the 
occurrence of certain events thereafter.

things, for the termination of the agreement, dated

RIGHTS AGREEMENT

RIGHTS AGREEMENT, dated as of April 14, 
1994 (the "Agreement"), between Loctite 
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the 
"Corporation"), and The First National Bank of 
Boston, a national banking association (the 
"Rights Agent").

The Board of Directors of the Corporation 
has authorized and declared a dividend of one right 
(a "Right") for each Common Share (as hereinafter 
defined) of the Corporation outstanding at the 
close of business on April 25, 1994 (the 
"Record Date"), each Right representing the right 
to purchase one Common Share, upon the terms and 
subject to the conditions herein set forth, and has 
further authorized and directed the issuance of one 
Right with respect to each Common Share that shall 
become outstanding between the Record Date and the 
earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption 
Date or the Final Expiration Date (as such terms 
are hereinafter defined); provided, however, that 
Rights may be issued with respect to Common Shares 
that shall become outstanding after the 
Distribution Date and prior to the earlier of the 
Redemption Date and the Final Expiration Date in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 22 of 
this Agreement.

Accordingly, in consideration of the 
premises and the mutual agreements herein set 
forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:

Section 1. Certain Definitions. For 
purposes of this Agreement, the following terms 
have the meanings indicated:

(a) "Acquiring Person" shall mean 
any Person who or which, together with all 
Affiliates and Associates of such Person, shall be 
the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the then 
outstanding Common Shares (other than as a result 
of a Permitted Offer (as hereinafter defined)) or 
was such a Beneficial Owner at any time after the 
date hereof, whether or not such person continues 
to be the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the 
then outstanding Common Shares. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, (A) the term "Acquiring Person" 
shall not include (i) the Corporation, (ii) any 
Subsidiary of the Corporation, (iii) any employee 
benefit plan of the Corporation or of any 
Subsidiary of the Corporation, (iv) any Person or 
entity organized, appointed or established by the 
Corporation for or pursuant to the terms of any 
such plan, or (v) any Grandfathered Stockholder and 
(B) no Person (including, without limitation, any 
Grandfathered Stockholder) shall become an 
<PAGE>
"Acquiring Person" (and no Grandfathered 
Stockholder shall cease to be a Grandfathered 
Stockholder):

(i) as a result of the 
acquisition of Common Shares by the 
Corporation which, by reducing the number of 
Common Shares outstanding, increases the 
proportional number of shares beneficially 
owned by such Person together with all 
Affiliates and Associates of such Person; 
provided that if (1) a Person (including, 
without limitation, any Grandfathered 
Stockholder) would become an Acquiring Person 
(but for the operation of this subclause (i)) 
as a result of the acquisition of Common 
Shares by the Corporation, and (2) after such 
share acquisition by the Corporation, such 
Person, or an Affiliate or Associate of such 
Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of any 
additional Common Shares, then such Person 
shall be deemed an Acquiring Person; or 

(ii) if (1) within five 
Business Days after such Person would 
otherwise have become an Acquiring Person (but 
for the operation of this subclause (ii)), 
such Person notifies the Board of Directors 
that such Person did so inadvertently, and 
(2) within two Business Days after such 
notification, such Person divests itself of a 
sufficient number of Common Shares so that 
such Person is the Beneficial Owner of such 
number of Common Shares that such Person no 
longer would be an Acquiring Person.

(b) "Act" shall mean the Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended and as in effect on the 
date of this Agreement.

(c) "Adverse Person" shall mean any 
Person declared to be an Adverse Person by a 
majority of the Unaffiliated Directors of the Board 
of Directors of the Corporation after having 
determined in its business judgment that beneficial 
ownership by such Person of 10% or more of the 
outstanding Common Shares would be reasonably 
likely to materially adversely affect the 
Corporation or its stockholders. In the event that 
in reliance upon the representations and warranties 
of any Person set forth in the Transferee Agreement 
for such Person, the Transfer Certificate for such 
Person and any other instrument or document 
delivered to Loctite by such Person, the 
Unaffiliated Directors determined that such Person 
was not an Adverse Person, the Unaffiliated 
Directors may at any time thereafter declare such 
Person to be an Adverse Person as of the date of 
such declaration if the Unaffiliated Directors 
should at any time determine that any 
representation and warranty made by such Person in 
its Transferee Agreement, its Transferee 
Certificate or any such other document or 
instrument delivered to Loctite 
<PAGE>
by such Person was 
incorrect at the time that it was made, and upon 
such declaration by the Unaffiliated Directors, 
such Person shall no longer be deemed to be a 
Permitted Transferee for any purpose under this 
Agreement (including, without limitation, the 
definition of Grandfathered Stockholder).

(d) "Affiliate" shall have the 
meaning ascribed to such term in Rule 12b-2 of the 
General Rules and Regulations under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and in effect on 
the date of this Agreement (the "Exchange Act").

(e) "Associate" shall have the 
meaning ascribed to such term in Rule 12b-2 of the 
General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange 
Act; provided, however, that notwithstanding 
anything herein to the contrary, no Person shall be 
deemed an Associate of Henkel for any purpose 
hereof or at any time hereunder.

(f) A Person shall be deemed the 
"Beneficial Owner" of and shall be deemed to 
"beneficially own" any securities:

(i) which such Person or any of 
such Person's Affiliates or Associates 
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly;

(ii) which such Person or any 
of such Person's Affiliates or Associates has 
(A) the right to acquire (whether such right 
is exercisable immediately or only after the 
passage of time) pursuant to any agreement, 
arrangement or understanding, or upon the 
exercise of conversion rights, exchange 
rights, rights (other than the Rights), 
warrants or options, or otherwise; provided, 
however, that a Person shall not be deemed the 
Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, 
securities tendered pursuant to a tender or 
exchange offer made by or on behalf of such 
Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or 
Associates until such tendered securities are 
accepted for purchase or exchange; or (B) the 
right to vote pursuant to any agreement, 
arrangement or understanding; provided, 
however, that a Person shall not be deemed the 
Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, 
any security if the agreement, arrangement or 
understanding to vote such security (1) arises 
solely from a revocable proxy or consent given 
to such Person in response to a public proxy 
or consent solicitation made pursuant to, and 
in accordance with, the applicable rules and 
regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act 
and (2) is not also then reportable on 
Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any 
comparable or successor report); or
<PAGE>
(iii) which are beneficially 
owned, directly or indirectly, by any other 
Person (or any Affiliate or Associate thereof) 
with which such Person (or any of such 
Person's Affiliates or Associates) has any 
agreement, arrangement or understanding (other 
than an agreement by Henkel to Transfer to a 
proposed Permitted Transferee those Common 
Shares subject to such proposed Permitted 
Transfer and customary agreements with and 
between underwriters and selling group members 
with respect to a bona fide public offering of 
securities) relating to the acquisition, 
holding, voting (except to the extent 
contemplated by the proviso to Section 
l(f)(ii)(B)) or disposing of any securities of 
the Corporation.

Notwithstanding anything in this 
definition of Beneficial Ownership to the contrary, 
(A) Henkel shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner 
of, or to beneficially own, any Common Shares held 
by any member of the Krieble Family Group as a 
result of the right of first refusal over such 
Common Shares held by Henkel until and to the 
extent that Henkel has exercised its right of first 
refusal and purchased such Common Shares; (B) the 
phrase "then outstanding", when used with reference 
to a Person's Beneficial Ownership of securities of 
the Corporation, shall mean the number of such 
securities then issued and outstanding together 
with the number of such securities not then 
actually issued and outstanding which such Person 
would be deemed to own beneficially hereunder; and 
(C) the Corporation shall not be deemed the 
Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, any 
Common Shares held by any member of the Krieble 
Family Group as a result of the right of first 
refusal over such Common Shares that may from time 
to time be held by the Corporation and such Common 
Shares shall be deemed issued and outstanding for 
all purposes hereunder, in each case, until and to 
the extent that the Corporation has exercised its 
right of first refusal and purchased such Common

any Person (other than the Corporation, any

offer prior to the occurrence of a Distribution

Certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit B

(b) As promptly as practicable 
following the Record Date, the Corporation will 
send a copy of a Summary of Rights to Purchase 
Common Shares, in substantially the form of 
Exhibit C hereto (the "Summary of Rights"), by 
first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record

respect to certificates for Common Shares 
outstanding as of the Record Date, until the 
Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by 
such certificates registered in the names of the 
holders thereof together with a copy of the Summary 
of Rights attached thereto. Until the Distribution 
Date (or the earlier of the Redemption Date or the 
Final Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer 
of any certificate for Common Shares outstanding on 
the Record Date, with or without a copy of the 
Summary of Rights attached thereto, shall also 
constitute the transfer of the Rights associated 
with such Common Shares.

(c) Certificates for Common Shares 
which become outstanding (including, without 
limitation, reacquired Common Shares referred to in 
the last sentence of this paragraph (c)) after the 
Record Date but prior to the earliest of the 
Distribution Date, and the Redemption Date or the 
Final Expiration Date shall be deemed also to be 
certificates for Rights, and shall bear the 
following legend:

This certificate also evidences and 
entitles the holder hereof to certain 
rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement 
between Loctite Corporation and The First 
National Bank of Boston, dated as of April 
14, 1994 (the "Rights Agreement"), the 
terms of which are hereby incorporated 
herein by reference and a copy of which is 
on file at the principal executive offices 
of Loctite Corporation. Under certain 
circumstances, as set forth in the Rights 
Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced 
by separate certificates and will no 
longer be evidenced by this certificate. 
Loctite Corporation will mail to the 
holder of this certificate a copy of the 
Rights Agreement without charge after 
receipt of a written request therefor. 
Under certain circumstances set forth in the Rights 
<PAGE>
Agreement, Rights issued to, or 
held by, any Person who is, was or becomes 
an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or 
Associate thereof (as defined in the 
Rights Agreement) and certain related 
persons, whether currently held by or on 
behalf of such Person or by any subsequent 
holder, may become null and void.

With respect to such certificates containing the 
foregoing legend, until the Distribution Date, the 
Rights associated with the Common Shares 
represented by such certificates shall be evidenced 
by such certificates alone, and the surrender for 
transfer of any such certificate shall also 
constitute the transfer of the Rights associated 
with the Common Shares represented thereby. In the 
event that the Corporation purchases or acquires 
any Common Shares after the Record Date but prior 
to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated 
with such Common Shares shall be deemed canceled 
and retired so that the Corporation shall not be 
entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the 
Common Shares which are no longer outstanding.

Section 4. Form of Right Certificate. 
(a) The Right Certificates (and the forms of 
election to purchase and of assignment to be 
printed on the reverse thereof) shall be 
substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B 
hereto and may have such marks of identification or 
designation and such legends, summaries or 
endorsements printed thereon as the Corporation may 
deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with 
the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be 
required to comply with any applicable law or with 
any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or 
with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange 
on which the Rights may from time to time be 
listed, or to conform to usage. Subject to the 
provisions of Section 11 and Section 22 hereof, the 
Right Certificates shall entitle the holders 
thereof to purchase such number of Common Shares as 
shall be set forth therein at the price per Common 
Share set forth therein (the "Purchase Price"), but 
the amount and type of securities purchasable upon 
the exercise of each Right and the Purchase Price 
thereof shall be subject to adjustment as provided 
herein.

(b) Any Right Certificate issued 
pursuant to Section 3(a) or Section 22 hereof that 
represents Rights which are null and void pursuant 
to Section 7(e) of this Agreement and any Right 
Certificate issued pursuant to Section 6 or Section 
11 hereof upon transfer, exchange, replacement or 
adjustment of any other Right Certificate referred 
to in this sentence, shall contain (to the extent 
feasible) the following legend:
<PAGE>
The Rights represented by this Right 
Certificate are or were beneficially owned 
by a Person who was or became an Acquiring 
Person or an Affiliate or Associate of an 
Acquiring Person (as such terms are 
defined in the Rights Agreement). 
Accordingly, this Right Certificate and 
the Rights represented hereby are null and 
void.

Provisions of Section 7(e) of this Rights Agreement 
shall be operative whether or not the foregoing 
legend is contained on any such Right Certificate.

Section 5. 
Countersignature and Registration. The Right 
Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the 
Corporation by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief 
Executive Officer, its President, any of its Vice 
Presidents, or its Treasurer, either manually or by 
facsimile signature, shall have affixed thereto the 
Corporation's seal or a facsimile thereof, and 
shall be attested by the Secretary or an Assistant 
Secretary of the Corporation, either manually or by 
facsimile signature. The Right Certificates shall 
be countersigned by the Rights Agent and shall not 
be valid for any purpose unless so countersigned. 
In case any officer of the Corporation who shall 
have signed any of the Right Certificates shall 
cease to be such officer of the Corporation before 
countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance 
and delivery by the Corporation, such Right 
Certificates may nevertheless be countersigned by 
the Rights Agent and issued and delivered by the 
Corporation with the same force and effect as 
though the person who signed such Right 
Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of 
the Corporation; and any Right Certificate may be 
signed on behalf of the Corporation by any person 
who, at the actual date of the execution of such 
Right Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the 
Corporation to sign such Right Certificate, 
although at the date of the execution of this 
Rights Agreement any such person was not such an 
officer.

Following the Distribution Date, the 
Rights Agent will keep or cause to be kept, at its 
office designated as the appropriate place for 
surrender of such Right Certificate or transfer, 
books for registration and transfer of the Right 
Certificates issued hereunder. Such books shall 
show the names and addresses of the respective 
holders of the Right Certificates, the number of 
Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right 
Certificates and the certificate number and the 
date of each of the Right Certificates.

Section 6. Transfer, Split-
Up, Combination and 
Exchange of Right Certificates; Mutilated, Destroye
d, Lost or Stolen Right Certificate. Subject to 
the provisions of Section 4(b), Section 7(e) and 
Section 14 hereof, at any time after the 
<PAGE>
close of business on the Distribution Date, and at or prior 
to the close of business on the earlier of the 
Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date, any 
Right Certificate or Right Certificates may be 
transferred, split up, combined or exchanged for 
another Right Certificate or Right Certificates, 
entitling the registered holder to purchase a like 
number of Common Shares as the Right Certificate or 
Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such 
holder (or former holder in the case of a transfer) 
to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to 
transfer, split up, combine or exchange any Right 
Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such 
request in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, 
and shall surrender the Right Certificate or Right 
Certificates to be transferred, split up, combined 
or exchanged at the office of the Rights Agent 
designated for such purpose. Neither the Rights 
Agent nor the Corporation shall be obligated to 
take any action whatsoever with respect to the 
transfer of any such surrendered Right Certificate 
until the registered holder shall have completed 
and signed the certificate contained in the form of 
assignment on the reverse side of such Right 
Certificate and shall have provided such additional 
evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner 
(or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or 
Associates thereof as the Corporation shall 
reasonably request. Thereupon the Rights Agent 
shall, subject to Section 4(b), Section 7(e) and 
Section 14 hereof, countersign and deliver to the 
Person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or 
Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so 
requested. The Corporation may require payment of 
a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental 
charge that may be imposed in connection with any 
transfer, split up, combination or exchange of 
Right Certificates.

Upon receipt by the Corporation and the 
Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to 
them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation 
of a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft 
or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably 
satisfactory to them, and, at the Corporation's 
request, reimbursement to the Corporation and the 
Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental 
thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and 
cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, 
the Corporation will make and deliver a new Right 
Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for 
countersignature and delivery to the registered 
holder in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, 
stolen, destroyed or mutilated.

Section 7. 
Exercise of Rights; Purchase Price; 
Expiration Date of Rights. (a) Subject to Section 
7(e) hereof, the registered holder of any Right 
Certificate may exercise the Rights evidenced 
thereby (except as otherwise provided herein) in 
whole or in part at any time after the Distribution 
Date upon surrender of the Right Certificate, with 
<PAGE>
the form of election to purchase and the 
certificate on the reverse side thereof duly 
executed, to the Rights Agent at the principal 
office or offices of the Rights Agent designated 
for such purpose, together with payment of the 
aggregate Purchase Price for the total number of 
Common Shares (or other securities, as the case may 
be) as to which such surrendered Rights are 
exercised, at or prior to the earliest of (i) the 
close of business on April 14, 2004 (the "Final 
Expiration Date"), (ii) the time at which the 
Rights are redeemed as provided in Section 23 
hereof (the "Redemption Date") or (iii) the 
consummation of a transaction contemplated by 
Section 13(d) hereof.

(b) The Purchase Price for each 
Common Share pursuant to the exercise of a Right 
shall initially be $175.00, shall be subject to 
adjustment from time to time as provided in 
Sections 11 and 13(a) hereof and shall be payable 
in accordance with paragraph (c) below.

(c) Upon receipt of a Right 
Certificate representing exercisable Rights, with 
the form of election to purchase and the 
certificate duly executed, accompanied by payment 
of the Purchase Price for the Common Shares (or 
other securities, as the case may be) to be 
purchased and an amount equal to any applicable 
transfer tax required to be paid by the holder of 
such Right Certificate in accordance with Section 6 
hereof by certified check, cashier's check or money 
order payable to the order of the Corporation, the 
Rights Agent shall thereupon promptly (i) (A) 
requisition from any transfer agent of the Common 
Shares certificates for the number of Common Shares 
to be purchased and the Corporation hereby 
irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent to comply 
with all such requests, or (B) if the Corporation, 
in its sole discretion, shall have elected to 
deposit the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of 
the Rights hereunder into a depositary, requisition 
from the depositary agent depositary receipts 
representing such number of Common Shares as are to 
be purchased (in which case certificates for the 
Common Shares represented by such receipts shall be 
deposited by the transfer agent with the depositary 
agent) and the Corporation will direct the 
depositary agent to comply with such requests, (ii) 
when appropriate, requisition from the Corporation 
the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of issuance 
of fractional shares in accordance with Section 14 
hereof, (iii) after receipt of such certificates or 
depositary receipts, cause the same to be delivered 
to or upon the order of the registered holder of 
such Right Certificate, registered in such name or 
names as may be designated by such holder, and (iv) 
when appropriate, after receipt thereof, deliver 
such cash to or upon the order of the registered 
holder of such Right Certificate. In the event 
that the Corporation is obligated to issue other 
securities of the Corporation pursuant to Section 
11(a) hereof, the Corporation will make all 
arrangements 
<PAGE>
necessary so that such other 
securities are available for distribution by the 
Rights Agent, if and when appropriate.

In addition, in the case of an exercise of 
the Rights by a holder pursuant to Section 
11(a)(ii), the Rights Agent shall return such Right 
Certificate to the registered holder thereof after 
imprinting, stamping or otherwise indicating 
thereon that the rights represented by such Right 
Certificate no longer include the rights provided 
by Section 11(a)(ii) of the Rights Agreement and if 
less than all the Rights represented by such Right 
Certificate were so exercised, the Rights Agent 
shall indicate on the Right Certificate the number 
of Rights represented thereby which continue to 
include the rights provided by Section 11(a)(ii).

(d) In case the registered holder of 
any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all 
the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right 
Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the 
Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the 
Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right 
Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, 
subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof, or 
the Rights Agent shall place an appropriate 
notation on the Right Certificate with respect to 
those Rights exercised.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, from and after the first 
occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, any Rights 
beneficially owned by (i) an Acquiring Person or an 
Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person, (ii) 
a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of any 
Affiliate or Associate thereof) who becomes a 
transferee after the Acquiring Person becomes such, 
or (iii) a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of 
any Affiliate or Associate thereof) who becomes a 
transferee prior to or concurrently with the 
Acquiring Person becoming such and receives such 
Rights pursuant to either (A) a transfer (whether 
or not for consideration) from the Acquiring Person 
to holders of equity interests in such Acquiring 
Person or to any Person with whom the Acquiring 
Person has a continuing agreement, arrangement or 
understanding regarding the transferred Rights or 
(B) a transfer which the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation has determined is part of a plan, 
arrangement or understanding which has as a primary 
purpose or effect the avoidance of this 
Section 7(e), shall become null and void without 
any further action and no holder of such Rights 
shall have any rights whatsoever with respect to 
such Rights, whether under any provision of this 
Agreement or otherwise. The Corporation shall use 
all reasonable efforts to insure that the 
provisions of this Section 7(e) and Section 4(b) 
hereof are complied with, but shall have no 
liability to any holder of Right Certificates or 
other Person as a result of its failure to make any 
<PAGE>
determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person 
or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees 
hereunder.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent 
nor the Corporation shall be obligated to undertake 
any action with respect to a registered holder upon 
the occurrence of any purported exercise as set 
forth in this Section 7 unless such registered 
holder shall have (i) completed and signed the 
certificate contained in the form of election to 
purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Right 
Certificate surrendered for such exercise, and 
(ii) provided such additional evidence of the 
identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former 
Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates 
thereof as the Corporation shall reasonably 
request.

Section 8. 
Cancellation and Destruction of Right Certificates. 
All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose 
of exercise, transfer, split up, combination or 
exchange shall, if surrendered to the Corporation 
or to any of its agents, be delivered to the Rights 
Agent for cancellation or in canceled form, or, if 
surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be canceled 
by it, and no Right Certificates shall be issued in 
lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any 
of the provisions of this Rights Agreement. The 
Corporation shall deliver to the Rights Agent for 
cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent 
shall so cancel and retire, any other Right 
Certificate purchased or acquired by the 
Corporation otherwise than upon the exercise 
thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all 
canceled Right Certificates to the Corporation, or 
shall, at the written request of the Corporation, 
destroy such canceled Right Certificates, and in 
such case shall deliver a certificate of 
destruction thereof to the Corporation.

Section 9. 
Reservation and Availability of Common Shares. The 
Corporation covenants and agrees that at all times 
prior to the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) 
Event it will cause to be reserved and kept 
available out of its authorized and unissued Common 
Shares, or any authorized and issued Common Shares 
held in its treasury, the number of Common Shares 
that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in 
full of all outstanding Rights and, after the 
occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, shall, to 
the extent reasonably practicable, so reserve and 
keep available a sufficient number of Common Shares 
(and/or other securities) which may be required to 
permit the exercise in full of the Rights pursuant 
to this Agreement.

So long as the Common Shares (or other 
securities, as the case may be) issuable upon the 
exercise of the Rights may be listed on any 
national securities exchange, the Corporation 
<PAGE>
shall use its best efforts to cause, from and after such 
time as the Rights become exercisable, all shares 
reserved for such issuance to be listed on such 
exchange upon official notice of issuance upon such 
exercise.

The Corporation covenants and agrees that 
it will take all such action as may be necessary to 
ensure that all Common Shares (or other securities, 
as the case may be) delivered upon exercise of 
Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the 
certificates for such shares or other securities 
(subject to payment of the Purchase Price), be duly 
and validly authorized and issued and fully paid 
and non-assessable shares or securities.

The Corporation further covenants and 
agrees that it will pay when due and payable any 
and all U.S. federal and state transfer taxes and 
charges which may be payable in respect of the 
issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or 
of any Common Shares (or other securities, as the 
case may be) upon the exercise of Rights. The 
Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay 
any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of 
any transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a 
person other than, or the issuance or delivery of 
certificates or depositary receipts for the Common 
Shares (or other securities, as the case may be) in 
a name other than that of, the registered holder of 
the Right Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered 
for exercise, or to issue or to deliver any 
certificates or depositary receipts for Common 
Shares (or other securities, as the case may be) 
upon the exercise of any Rights, until any such tax 
shall have been paid (any such tax being payable by 
the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of 
surrender) or until it has been established to the 
Corporation's reasonable satisfaction that no such 
tax is due.

The Corporation shall use its best efforts 
to (i) file, as soon as practicable following the 
Shares Acquisition Date (or, if required by law, at 
such earlier time following the Distribution Date 
as so required), a registration statement under the 
Act, with respect to the securities purchasable 
upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, 
(ii) cause such registration statement to become 
effective as soon as practicable after such filing, 
and (iii) cause such registration statement to 
remain effective (with a prospectus at all times 
meeting the requirements of the Act and the rules 
and regulations thereunder) until the date of the 
expiration of the rights provided by Section 
11(a)(ii). The Corporation will also take such 
action as may be appropriate under the blue sky 
laws of the various states.

Section 10. Common Shares Record Date. 
Each person in whose name any certificate for 
Common Shares (or other 
<PAGE>
securities, as the case may 
be) is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for 
all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of 
record of the Common Shares (or other securities, 
as the case may be) represented thereby on, and 
such certificate shall be dated, the date upon 
which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights 
was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase 
Price (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made; 
provided, however, that, if the date of such 
surrender and payment is a date upon which the 
Common Shares (or other securities, as the case may 
be) transfer books of the Corporation are closed, 
such person shall be deemed to have become the 
record holder of such shares on, and such 
certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding 
Business Day on which the Common Shares (or other 
securities, as the case may be) transfer books of 
the Corporation are open.

Section 11. 
Adjustment of Purchase Price, Number and 
Kind of Shares or Number of Rights. The Purchase 
Price, the number and kind of shares covered by 
each Right and the number of Rights outstanding are 
subject to adjustment from time to time as provided 
in this Section 11.

(a)(i) In the event the Corporation 
shall at any time after the date of this Agreement 
(A) declare a dividend on the Common Shares payable 
in Common Shares, (B) subdivide the outstanding 
Common Shares, (C) combine the outstanding Common 
Shares into a smaller number of Common Shares or 
(D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a 
reclassification of the Common Shares (including 
any such reclassification in connection with a 
consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is 
the continuing or surviving corporation), except as 
otherwise provided in this Section 11(a) and 
Section 7(e) hereof, the Purchase Price in effect 
at the time of the record date for such dividend or 
of the effective date of such subdivision, 
combination or reclassification, and the number and 
kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such 
date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the 
holder of any Right exercised after such time shall 
be entitled to receive the aggregate number and 
kind of shares of capital stock which, if such 
Right had been exercised immediately prior to such 
date and at a time when the Common Shares transfer 
books of the Corporation were open, such holder 
would have owned upon such exercise and been 
entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, 
subdivision, combination or reclassification; 
provided, however, that in no event shall the 
consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one 
Right be less than the aggregate par value of the 
shares of capital stock of the Corporation issuable 
upon exercise of one Right. If an event occurs 
which would require an adjustment under both 
Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii), the 
adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) 
shall be in addition to, and shall 
<PAGE>
be made prior to, any adjustment required pursuant to 
Section 11(a)(ii).

(ii) In the event any Person, 
alone or together with its Affiliates and 
Associates, shall become an Acquiring Person, then 
proper provision shall be made so that each holder 
of a Right (except as provided below and in Section 
7(e) hereof) shall, for a period of 60 days after 
the later of the occurrence of any such event or 
the effective date of an appropriate registration 
statement under the Act pursuant to Section 9 
hereof, have a right to receive, upon exercise 
thereof at a price equal to the then current 
Purchase Price, in accordance with the terms of 
this Agreement, such number of Common Shares as 
shall equal the result obtained by (x) multiplying 
the then current Purchase Price by the then number 
of Common Shares for which a Right was exercisable 
immediately prior to the first occurrence of a 
Section 11(a)(ii) Event, and dividing that product 
by (y) 50% of the then current per share market 
price of the Corporation's Common Shares 
(determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on 
the date of such first occurrence (such number of 
shares being referred to as the 
"Adjustment Shares"); provided, however, that if 
the transaction that would otherwise give rise to 
the foregoing adjustment is also subject to the 
provisions of Section 13 hereof, then only the 
provisions of Section 13 hereof shall apply and no 
adjustment shall be made pursuant to this 
Section 11(a)(ii).

(iii) In the event that there 
shall not be sufficient treasury shares or 
authorized but unissued (and unreserved) Common 
Shares to permit the exercise in full of the Rights 
in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) 
and the Rights become so exercisable, 
notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Agreement, to the extent necessary and permitted by 
applicable law, each Right shall thereafter 
represent the right to receive, upon exercise 
thereof at the then current Purchase Price in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (x) a 
number of (or fractions of) Common Shares (up to 
the maximum number of Common Shares which may 
permissibly be issued) and (y) a number of (or 
fractions of) other equity securities of the 
Corporation (or, in the discretion of the Board of 
Directors of the Corporation, debt) which the Board 
of Directors of the Corporation has determined to 
have the same aggregate current market value 
(determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) and (ii) 
hereof, to the extent applicable) as one Common 
Share (such number of (or fractions of) Common 
Shares (or other equity securities or debt of the 
Corporation) being referred to as a "capital stock 
equivalent"), equal in the aggregate to the number 
of Adjustment Shares; provided, however, if 
sufficient Common Shares and/or capital stock 
equivalents are unavailable, then the Corporation 
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable 
<PAGE>
law, take all such action as may be necessary to 
authorize additional Common Shares or capital stock 
equivalents for issuance upon exercise of the 
Rights, including the calling of a meeting of 
stockholders; and provided, further, that if the 
Corporation is unable to cause sufficient Common 
Shares and/or capital stock equivalents to be 
available for issuance upon exercise in full of the 
Rights, then each Right shall thereafter represent 
the right to receive the Adjusted Number of Shares 
upon exercise at the Adjusted Purchase Price (as 
such terms are hereinafter defined). As used 
herein, the term "Adjusted Number of Shares" shall 
be equal to that number of (or fractions of) Common 
Shares (and/or capital stock equivalents) equal to 
the product of (x) the number of Adjustment Shares 
and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the 
number of Common Shares (and/or capital stock 
equivalents) available for issuance upon exercise 
of the Rights and the denominator of which is the 
aggregate number of Adjustment Shares otherwise 
issuable upon exercise in full of all Rights 
(assuming there were a sufficient number of Common 
Shares available) (such fraction being referred to 
as the "Proration Factor"). The 
"Adjusted Purchase Price" shall mean the product of 
the Purchase Price and the Proration Factor. The 
Board of Directors of the Corporation may, but 
shall not be required to, establish procedures to 
allocate the right to receive Common Shares and 
capital stock equivalents upon exercise of the 
Rights among holders of Rights.

(b) In case the Corporation shall 
fix a record date for the issuance of rights (other 
than the Rights), options or warrants to all 
holders of Common Shares entitling them (for a 
period expiring within 45 calendar days after such 
record date) to subscribe for or purchase Common 
Shares (or shares having the same rights and 
privileges as the Common Shares 
("equivalent common shares")) or securities 
convertible into Common Shares or equivalent common 
shares at a price per Common Share or equivalent 
common share (or having a conversion price per 
share, if a security convertible into Common Shares 
or equivalent common shares) less than the then 
current per share market price of the Common Shares 
(as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on 
such record date, the Purchase Price to be in 
effect after such record date shall be determined 
by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect 
immediately prior to such record date by a 
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the 
number of Common Shares outstanding on such record 
date plus the number of Common Shares which the 
aggregate offering price of the total number of 
Common Shares and/or equivalent common shares so to 
be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion 
price of the convertible securities so to be 
offered) would purchase at such current per share 
market price, and the denominator of which shall be 
the number of Common Shares outstanding on such 
record date plus the number of additional Common 
Shares and/or 
<PAGE>
equivalent common shares to be 
offered for subscription or purchase (or into which 
the convertible securities so to be offered are 
initially convertible); provided, however, that in 
no event shall the consideration to be paid upon 
the exercise of one Right be less than the 
aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock 
of the Corporation issuable upon exercise of one 
Right. In case such subscription price may be paid 
in a consideration part or all of which shall be in 
a form other than cash, the value of such 
consideration shall be determined in good faith by 
the Board of Directors of the Corporation, whose 
determination shall be described in a statement 
filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on 
the Rights Agent. Common Shares owned by or held 
for the account of the Corporation shall not be 
deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such 
computation. Such adjustment shall be made 
successively whenever such a record date is fixed; 
and in the event that such rights, options or 
warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price 
shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which 
would then be in effect if such record date had not 
been fixed.

(c) In case the Corporation shall 
fix a record date for the making of a distribution 
to all holders of the Common Shares (including any 
such distribution made in connection with a 
consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is 
the continuing or surviving corporation) of 
evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a 
regular quarterly cash dividend or a dividend 
payable in Common Shares) or subscription rights or 
warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 
11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect 
after such record date shall be determined by 
multiplying the Purchase Price in effect 
immediately prior to such record date by a 
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then 
current per share market price (as determined 
pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) of the Common 
Shares on such record date, less the fair market 
value (as determined in good faith by the Board of 
Directors of the Corporation, whose determination 
shall be described in a statement filed with the 
Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights 
Agent) of the portion of the assets or evidences of 
indebtedness so to be distributed or of such 
subscription rights or warrants applicable to one 
Common Share and the denominator of which shall be 
such current per share market price of the Common 
Shares; provided, however, that in no event shall 
the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of 
one Right be less than the aggregate par value of 
the shares of capital stock of the Corporation to 
be issued upon exercise of one Right. Such 
adjustments shall be made successively whenever 
such a record date is fixed; and in the event that 
such distribution is not so made, the Purchase 
Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase 
Price which would then be in effect if such record 
date had not been fixed.
<PAGE>
(d)(i) For the purpose of any 
computation hereunder, the 
"current per share market price" of any security (a 
"Security" for the purpose of this Section 
11(d)(i)) on any date shall be deemed to be the 
average of the daily closing prices per share of 
such Security for the thirty (30) consecutive 
Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined) 
immediately prior to such date; provided, however, 
that in the event that the current per share market 
price of the Security is determined during a period 
following the announcement by the issuer of such 
Security of (A) a dividend or distribution on such 
Security payable in shares of such Security or 
securities convertible into such shares, or (B) any 
subdivision, combination or reclassification of 
such Security and prior to the expiration of thirty 
(30) Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for 
such dividend or distribution, or the record date 
for such subdivision, combination or 
reclassification, then, and in each such case, the 
current per share market price shall be 
appropriately adjusted to reflect the current 
market price per share equivalent of such Security. 
The closing price for each day shall be the last 
sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale 
takes place on such day, the average of the closing 
bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case 
as reported in the principal consolidated 
transaction reporting system with respect to 
securities listed or admitted to trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange or, if the Security is not 
listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated 
transaction reporting system with respect to 
securities listed on the principal national 
securities exchange on which the Security is listed 
or admitted to trading or, if the Security is not 
listed or admitted to trading on any national 
securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if 
not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low 
asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as 
reported by the National Association of Securities 
Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations System 
("NASDAQ") or such other system then in use, or, if 
on any such date the Security is not quoted by any 
such organization, the average of the closing bid 
and asked prices as furnished by a professional 
market maker making a market in the Security 
selected by the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation. If on any such date no such market 
maker is making a market in the Security, the fair 
value of the Security on such date as determined in 
good faith by the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation shall be used. The term "Trading Day" 
shall mean a day on which the principal national 
securities exchange on which the Security is listed 
or admitted to trading is open for the transaction 
of business or, if the Security is not listed or 
admitted to trading on any national securities 
exchange, a Business Day.

(ii) For the purpose of any 
computation hereunder, the 
"current per share market price" of the Common 
Shares shall be determined in accordance with the 
method set 
<PAGE>
forth in Section 11(d)(i). If the 
Common Shares are not publicly traded, the "current 
per share market price" of the Common Shares shall 
mean the fair value per share as determined in good 
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, 
whose determination shall be described in a 
statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be 
binding on the Rights Agent.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein 
to the contrary, no adjustment in the Purchase 
Price shall be required unless such adjustment 
would require an increase or decrease of at least 
1% in the Purchase Price; provided, however, that 
any adjustments which by reason of this 
Section 11(e) are not required to be made shall be 
carried forward and taken into account in any 
subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this 
Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to 
the nearest hundred thousandth of a Common Share or 
thousandth of any other share or security as the 
case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of 
this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this 
Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier 
of (i) three (3) years from the date of the 
transaction which mandates such adjustment or 
(ii) the Final Expiration Date.

(f) If as a result of an adjustment 
made pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13(a) 
hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter 
exercised shall become entitled to receive any 
shares of capital stock of the Corporation other 
than Common Shares, thereafter the number of other 
shares so receivable upon exercise of any Right 
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in 
a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as 
practicable to the provisions with respect to the 
Common Shares contained in Section 11(a) through 
(c), inclusive, and the provisions of Sections 7, 
9, 10, 13 and 14 with respect to the Common Shares 
shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.

(g) All Rights originally issued by 
the Corporation subsequent to any adjustment made 
to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the 
right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, 
the number of Common Shares purchasable from time 
to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all 
subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(h) Unless the Corporation shall 
have exercised its election as provided in 
Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase 
Price as a result of the calculations made in 
Sections 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding 
immediately prior to the making of such adjustment 
shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at 
the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of Common 
Shares (calculated to the nearest thousandth of a 
Common Share) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the 
number of Common Shares covered by a Right 
immediately prior to this adjustment by (y) the 
Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such 
adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing 
the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in 
effect immediately 
<PAGE>
after such adjustment of the 
Purchase Price.

(i) The Corporation may elect on or 
after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase 
Price to adjust the number of Rights, in lieu of 
any adjustment in the number of Common Shares 
purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of 
the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the 
number of Rights shall be exercisable for the 
number of Common Shares for which a Right was 
exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. 
Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment 
of the number of Rights shall become that number of 
Rights (calculated to the nearest one thousandth) 
obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect 
immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase 
Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately 
after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The 
Corporation shall make a public announcement of its 
election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating 
the record date for the adjustment, and, if known 
at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be 
made. This record date may be the date on which 
the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day 
thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have 
been issued, shall be at least ten (10) days later 
than the date of the public announcement. If Right 
Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment 
of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 
11(i), the Corporation shall, as promptly as 
practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of 
record of Right Certificates on such record date 
Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 
14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such 
holders shall be entitled as a result of such 
adjustment, or, at the option of the Corporation, 
shall cause to be distributed to such holders of 
record in substitution and replacement for the 
Right Certificates held by such holders prior to 
the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, 
if required by the Corporation, new Right 
Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which 
such holders shall be entitled after such 
adjustment. Right Certificates so to be 
distributed shall be issued, executed and 
countersigned in the manner provided for herein and 
shall be registered in the names of the holders of 
record of Right Certificates on the record date 
specified in the public announcement.

(j) Irrespective of any adjustment 
or change in the Purchase Price or the number of 
Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the 
Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and 
thereafter issued may continue to express the 
Purchase Price and the number of Common Shares 
which were expressed in the initial Right 
Certificates issued hereunder.
<PAGE>
(k) Before taking any action that 
would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase 
Price below the then par value, if any, of the 
number of Common Shares or other securities 
issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the 
Corporation shall take any corporate action which 
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in 
order that the Corporation may validly and legally 
issue such number of fully paid and non-assessable 
Common Shares or other securities at such adjusted 
Purchase Price. 

(l) In any case in which this 
Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the 
Purchase Price be made effective as of a record 
date for a specified event, the Corporation may 
elect to defer until the occurrence of such event 
the issuance to the holder of any Right exercised 
after such record date the Common Shares or other 
securities of the Corporation, if any, issuable 
upon such exercise over and above the Common Shares 
or other securities of the Corporation, if any, 
issuable upon exercise on the basis of the Purchase 
Price in effect prior to such adjustment; provided, 
however, that the Corporation shall deliver to such 
holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument 
evidencing such holder's right to receive such 
additional shares upon the occurrence of the event 
requiring such adjustment.

(m) Notwithstanding anything in this 
Section 11 to the contrary, the Corporation shall 
be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase 
Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly 
required by this Section 11, as and to the extent 
that it in its sole discretion shall determine to 
be advisable in order that (i) any consolidation or 
subdivision of the Common Shares, (ii) issuance 
wholly for cash of Common Shares at less than the 
current market price, (iii) issuance wholly for 
cash of Common Shares or securities which by their 
terms are convertible into or exchangeable for 
Common Shares, (iv) stock dividends or (v) issuance 
of rights, options or warrants referred to in this 
Section 11, hereafter made by the Corporation to 
holders of its Common Shares shall not be taxable 
to such stockholders.

(n) The Corporation covenants and 
agrees that it shall not, at any time after the 
Distribution Date, (i) consolidate with any other 
Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Corporation 
in a transaction which does not violate 
Section 11(o) hereof), (ii) merge with or into any 
other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the 
Corporation in a transaction which does not violate 
Section 11(o) hereof), or (iii) sell or transfer 
(or permit any Subsidiary to sell or transfer), in 
one transaction, or a series of related 
transactions, assets or earning power aggregating 
more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the 
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) 
to any other Person or Persons (other than the 
<PAGE>
Corporation and/or any of its Subsidiaries in one 
or more transactions each of which does not violate 
Section 11(o) hereof), if (x) at the time of or 
immediately after such consolidation, merger, sale 
or transfer there are any charter or by-law 
provisions or any rights, warrants or other 
instruments or securities outstanding or agreements 
in effect or other actions taken, which would 
materially diminish or otherwise eliminate the 
benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights or 
(y) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately 
after such consolidation, merger or sale, the 
stockholders of the Person who constitutes, or 
would constitute, the "Principal Party" for 
purposes of Section 13(a) hereof shall have 
received a distribution of Rights previously owned 
by such Person or any of its Affiliates and 
Associates. The Corporation shall not consummate 
any such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer 
unless prior thereto the Corporation and such other 
Person shall have executed and delivered to the 
Rights Agent a supplemental agreement evidencing 
compliance with this Section 11(n).

(o) The Corporation covenants and 
agrees that, after the Distribution Date, it will 
not, except as permitted by Section 23 or 
Section 27 hereof, take (or permit any Subsidiary 
to take) any action the purpose of which is to, or 
if at the time such action is taken it is 
reasonably foreseeable that the effect of such 
action is to, materially diminish or otherwise 
eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by 
the Rights.

(p) Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, in the event that at any 
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to 
the Distribution Date, the Corporation shall (i) 
declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares 
payable in Common Shares or (ii) effect a 
subdivision, combination or consolidation of the 
Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise 
than by payment of dividends in Common Shares) into 
a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then 
in any such case, the number of Rights associated 
with each Common Share then outstanding, or issued 
or delivered thereafter but prior to the 
Distribution Date, shall be proportionately 
adjusted so that the number of Rights thereafter 
associated with each Common Share following any 
such event shall equal the result obtained by 
multiplying the number of Rights associated with 
each Common Share immediately prior to such event 
by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the 
total number of Common Shares outstanding 
immediately prior to the occurrence of the event 
and the denominator of which shall be the total 
number of Common Shares outstanding immediately 
following the occurrence of such event. The 
adjustments provided for in this Section 11(p) 
shall be made successively whenever such a dividend 
is declared or paid or such a subdivision, 
combination or consolidation is effected.
<PAGE>
(q) The exercise of Rights under 
Section 11(a)(ii) shall only result in the loss of 
rights under Section 11(a)(ii) to the extent so 
exercised and shall not otherwise affect the rights 
represented by the Rights under this Rights 
Agreement, including the rights represented by 
Section 13.

Section 12. Certificate of Adjusted 
Purchase Price or Number of Shares. Whenever an 
adjustment is made as provided in Sections 11 or 13 
hereof, the Corporation shall promptly (a) prepare 
a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a 
brief statement of the facts accounting for such 
adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with 
each transfer agent for the Common Shares a copy of 
such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary 
thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate in 
accordance with Section 26 hereof. The Rights 
Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any 
such certificate and on any adjustment therein 
contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge 
of such adjustment unless and until it shall have 
received such certificate.

Section 13. Consolidation, Merger or Sale 
or Transfer of Assets or Earning Power. (a) In 
the event that, on or following the Shares 
Acquisition Date, directly or indirectly, (x) the 
Corporation shall consolidate with, or merge with 
and into, any Interested Stockholder, or if in such 
merger or consolidation all holders of Common 
Shares are not treated alike, any other Person, 
(y) the Corporation shall consolidate with, or 
merge with, any Interested Stockholder, or if in 
such merger or consolidation all holders of Common 
Shares are not treated alike, any other Person, and 
the Corporation shall be the continuing or 
surviving corporation of such consolidation or 
merger (other than, in a case of any transaction 
described in (x) or (y), a merger or consolidation 
which would result in all of the securities 
generally entitled to vote in the election of 
directors ("voting securities") of the Corporation 
outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing 
to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by 
being converted into securities of the surviving 
entity) all of the voting securities of the 
Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding 
immediately after such merger or consolidation and 
the holders of such securities not having changed 
as a result of such merger or consolidation), or 
(z) the Corporation shall sell or otherwise 
transfer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall 
sell or otherwise transfer), in one transaction or 
a series of related transactions, assets or earning 
power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or 
earning power of the Corporation and its 
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any Interested 
Stockholder or Stockholders or if in such 
transaction all holders of Common Shares are not 
treated alike, any other Person (other than the 
Corporation or any 
<PAGE>
Subsidiary of the Corporation in 
one or more transactions each of which does not 
violate Section 11(o) hereof), then, and in each 
such case (except as provided in Section 13(d) 
hereof), proper provision shall be made so that 
(i) each holder of a Right, except as provided in 
Section 7(e) hereof, shall thereafter have the 
right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a 
price equal to the then current Purchase Price, in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in 
lieu of Common Shares, such number of freely 
tradeable Common Shares of the Principal Party (as 
hereinafter defined), not subject to any liens, 
encumbrances, rights of first refusal or other 
adverse claims, as shall equal the result obtained 
by (A) multiplying the then current Purchase Price 
by the number of Common Shares for which a Right is 
then exercisable (without taking into account any 
adjustment previously made pursuant to 
Section 11(a)(ii)) and dividing that product by 
(B) 50% of the then current per share market price 
of the Common Shares of such Principal Party 
(determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on 
the date of consummation of such Section 13 Event; 
(ii) such Principal Party shall thereafter be 
liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such 
Section 13 Event, all the obligations and duties of 
the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement; 
(iii) the term "Corporation" shall thereafter be 
deemed to refer to such Principal Party, it being 
specifically intended that the provisions of 
Section 11 hereof shall apply only to such 
Principal Party following the first occurrence of a 
Section 13 Event; and (iv) such Principal Party 
shall take such steps (including, but not limited 
to, the reservation of a sufficient number of its 
Common Shares) in connection with the consummation 
of any such transaction as may be necessary to 
assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter 
be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in 
relation to the Common Shares thereafter 
deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights.

(b) "Principal Party" shall mean:

(i) in the case of any 
transaction described in clause (x) or (y) of 
the first sentence of Section 13(a), the 
Person that is the issuer of any securities 
into which Common Shares of the Corporation 
are converted in such merger or consolidation, 
and if no securities are so issued, the Person 
that is the other party to such merger or 
consolidation (including, if applicable, the 
Corporation if it is the surviving 
corporation); and

(ii) in the case of any 
transaction described in clause (z) of the 
first sentence of Section 13(a), the Person 
that is the party receiving the greatest 
portion of the assets or earning power 
transferred pursuant to such transaction or 
transactions;
<PAGE>
provided, however, that in any of the foregoing 
cases, (1) if the Common Shares of such Person are 
not at such time and have not been continuously 
over the preceding twelve (12) month period 
registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, 
and such Person is a direct or indirect Subsidiary 
of another Person the Common Shares of which are 
and have been so registered, "Principal Party" 
shall refer to such other Person; (2) in case such 
Person is a Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of 
more than one Person, the Common Shares of two or 
more of which are and have been so registered, 
"Principal Party" shall refer to whichever of such 
Persons is the issuer of the Common Shares having 
the greatest aggregate market value; and (3) in 
case such Person is owned, directly or indirectly, 
by a joint venture formed by two or more Persons 
that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the 
same Person, the rules set forth in (1) and (2) 
above shall apply to each of the chains of 
ownership having an interest in such joint venture 
as if such party were a "Subsidiary" of both or all 
of such joint venturers and the Principal Parties 
in each such chain shall bear the obligations set 
forth in this Section 13 in the same ratio as their 
direct or indirect interests in such Person bear to 
the total of such interests.

(c) The Corporation shall not 
consummate any such consolidation, merger, sale or 
transfer unless the Principal Party shall have a 
sufficient number of its authorized Common Shares 
which have not been issued or reserved for issuance 
to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in 
accordance with this Section 13 and unless prior 
thereto the Corporation and such Principal Party 
shall have executed and delivered to the Rights 
Agent a supplemental agreement providing for the 
terms set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
Section 13 and further providing that, as soon as 
practicable after the date of any consolidation, 
merger, sale or transfer mentioned in paragraph (a) 
of this Section 13, the Principal Party at its own 
expense shall:

(i) prepare and file a 
registration statement under the Act with 
respect to the Rights and the securities 
purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an 
appropriate form, and use its best efforts to 
cause such registration statement to 
(A) become effective as soon as practicable 
after such filing and (B) remain effective 
(with a prospectus at all times meeting the 
requirements of the Act) until the Final 
Expiration Date;

(ii) use its best efforts to 
qualify or register the Rights and the 
securities purchasable upon exercise of the 
Rights under the blue sky laws of such 
jurisdictions as may be necessary or 
appropriate; and
<PAGE>
(iii) deliver to holders of the 
Rights historical financial statements for the 
Principal Party which comply in all respects 
with the requirements for registration on 
Form 10 under the Exchange Act.

The provisions of this Section 13 shall 
similarly apply to successive mergers or 
consolidations or sales or other transfers. The 
rights under this Section 13 shall be in addition 
to the rights to exercise Rights and adjustments 
under Section 11(a)(ii) and shall survive any 
exercise thereof.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, Section 13 shall not be 
applicable to a transaction described in 
subparagraphs (x) and (y) of Section 13(a) if: 
(i) such transaction is consummated with a Person 
or Persons who acquired Common Shares pursuant to a 
Permitted Offer (or a wholly owned Subsidiary of 
any such Person or Persons); (ii) the price per 
Common Share offered in such transaction is not 
less than the price per Common Share paid to all 
holders of Common Shares whose shares were 
purchased pursuant to such Permitted Offer; and 
(iii) the form of consideration offered in such 
transaction is the same as the form of 
consideration paid pursuant to such Permitted 
Offer. Upon consummation of any such transaction 
contemplated by this Section 13(d), all Rights 
hereunder shall expire.

Section 14. 
Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares. (a) The 
Corporation shall not be required to issue 
fractions of Rights or to distribute Right 
Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In 
lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid 
to the registered holders of the Right Certificates 
with regard to which such fractional Rights would 
otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to 
the same fraction of the current market value of a 
whole Right. For the purposes of this 
Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole 
Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for 
the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on 
which such fractional Rights would have been 
otherwise issuable. The closing price for any day 
shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in 
case no such sale takes place on such day, the 
average of the closing bid and asked prices, 
regular way, in either case as reported in the 
principal consolidated transaction reporting system 
with respect to securities listed or admitted to 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the 
Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the 
principal consolidated transaction reporting system 
with respect to securities listed on the principal 
national securities exchange on which the Rights 
are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Rights 
are not listed or admitted to trading on any 
national securities exchange, the last quoted price 
or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid 
and low asked prices in the over-the-counter 
<PAGE>
market, as reported by NASDAQ or such other system 
then in use or, if on any such date the Rights are 
not quoted by any such organization, the average of 
the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a 
professional market maker making a market in the 
Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation. If on any such date no such market 
maker is making a market in the Rights, the fair 
value of the Rights on such date as determined in 
good faith by the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation shall be used.

(b) The Corporation shall not be 
required to issue fractions of Common Shares upon 
exercise of the Rights or to distribute 
certificates which evidence fractional Common 
Shares. In lieu of fractional Common Shares, the 
Corporation shall pay to the registered holders of 
Right Certificates at the time such Rights are 
exercised as herein provided an amount in cash 
equal to the same fraction of the current market 
value of one Common Share. For the purposes of 
this Section 14(b), the current market value of a 
Common Share shall be the closing price of a Common 
Share (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(ii) 
hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to 
the date of such exercise.

(c) The holder of a Right by the 
acceptance of the Right expressly waives his right 
to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional 
share upon exercise of a Right (except as provided 
above).

Section 15. Rights of Action. All rights 
of action in respect of this Agreement, excepting 
the rights of action given to the Rights Agent 
under Section 18 hereof, are vested in the 
respective registered holders of the Right 
Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, 
the registered holders of the Common Shares); and 
any registered holder of any Right Certificate (or, 
prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common 
Shares), without the consent of the Rights Agent or 
of the holder of any other Right Certificate (or, 
prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common 
Shares), may, in his own behalf and for his own 
benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain 
any suit, action or proceeding against the 
Corporation to enforce, or otherwise act in respect 
of, his right to exercise the Rights evidenced by 
such Right Certificate in the manner provided in 
such Right Certificate and in this Agreement. 
Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies 
available to the holders of Rights, it is 
specifically acknowledged that the holders of 
Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for 
any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled 
to specific performance of the obligations under, 
and injunctive relief against actual or threatened 
violations of the obligations of any Person subject 
to, this Agreement.
<PAGE>
Section 16. Agreement of Right Holders. 
Every holder of a Right, by accepting the same, 
consents and agrees with the Corporation and the 
Rights Agent and with every other holder of a Right 
that:

(a) prior to the Distribution Date, 
the Rights will be transferable only in connection 
with the transfer of the Common Shares;

(b) after the Distribution Date, the 
Right Certificates are transferable only on the 
registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered 
at the principal office or offices of the Rights 
Agent designated for such purpose, duly endorsed or 
accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer and 
with the appropriate form fully executed;

(c) subject to Section 6 and 
Section 7(f) hereof, the Corporation and the Rights 
Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name 
the Right Certificate (or, prior to the 
Distribution Date, the associated Common Shares 
certificate) is registered as the absolute owner 
thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby 
(notwithstanding any notations of ownership or 
writing on the Right Certificate or the associated 
Common Shares certificate made by anyone other than 
the Corporation or the Rights Agent) for all 
purposes whatsoever, and neither the Corporation 
nor the Rights Agent, subject to the last sentence 
of Section 7(e) hereof, shall be required to be 
affected by any notice to the contrary; and

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Corporation 
nor the Rights Agent shall have any liability to 
any holder of a Right or a beneficial interest in a 
Right or other Person as a result of its inability 
to perform any of its obligations under this 
Agreement by reason of any preliminary or permanent 
injunction or other order, decree or ruling issued 
by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a 
governmental, regulatory or administrative agency 
or commission, or any statute, rule, regulation or 
executive order promulgated or enacted by any 
governmental authority, prohibiting or otherwise 
restraining performance of such obligation; 
provided, however, the Corporation must use its 
best efforts to have any such order, decree or 
ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as 
possible.

Section 17. 
Right Certificate Holder Not Deemed a Stockholder. 
No holder, as such, of any Right Certificate shall 
be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed 
for any purpose the holder of the Common Shares or 
any other securities of the Corporation which may 
at any time be issuable on the exercise of the 
Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything 
contained herein or in any Right Certificate be 
construed to confer upon the holder of any Right 
Certificate, 
<PAGE>
as such, any of the rights of a 
stockholder of the Corporation or any right to vote 
for the election of directors or upon any matter 
submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, 
or to give or withhold consent to any corporate 
action, or to receive notice of meetings or other 
actions affecting stockholders (except as provided 
in Section 25 hereof), or to receive dividends or 
other distributions or to exercise any preemptive 
or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the 
Right or Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate 
shall have been exercised in accordance with the 
provisions hereof.

Section 18. Concerning the Rights Agent. 
The Corporation agrees to pay to the Rights Agent 
reasonable compensation for all services rendered 
by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand 
of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and 
counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in 
the administration and execution of this Agreement 
and the exercise and performance of its duties 
hereunder. The Corporation also agrees to 
indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it 
harmless against, any loss, liability, or expense, 
incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful 
misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent, for 
anything done or omitted by the Rights Agent in 
connection with the acceptance and administration 
of this Agreement, including the costs and expenses 
of defending against any claim of liability in the 
premises. The indemnity provided for herein shall 
survive the expiration of the Rights and the 
termination of this Agreement.

The Rights Agent shall be protected and 
shall incur no liability for, or in respect of any 
action taken, suffered or omitted by it in 
connection with, its administration of this 
Agreement in reliance upon any Right Certificate or 
certificate for Common Shares or for other 
securities of the Corporation, instrument of 
assignment or transfer, power of attorney, 
endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, 
consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or 
document believed by it to be genuine and to be 
signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or 
acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons.

Section 19. Merger or Consolidation or 
Change of Name of Rights Agent. Any corporation 
into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights 
Agent may be merged or with which it may be 
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any 
merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent 
or any successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or 
any corporation succeeding to the stock transfer or 
all or substantially all of the corporate trust 
business of the Rights Agent or any successor 
Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights 
Agent under this Agreement without the execution or 
filing of any paper or any further act on the part 
of any of the parties hereto, provided that such 
corporation would be eligible for 
<PAGE>
appointment as a 
successor Rights Agent under the provisions of 
Section 21 hereof. In case at the time such 
successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency 
created by this Agreement, any of the Right 
Certificates shall have been countersigned but not 
delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may 
adopt the countersignature of a predecessor Rights 
Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so 
countersigned; and in case at that time any of the 
Right Certificates shall not have been 
countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may 
countersign such Right Certificates either in the 
name of the predecessor or in the name of the 
successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such 
Right Certificates shall have the full force 
provided in the Right Certificates and in this 
Agreement.

In case at any time the name of the Rights 
Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the 
Right Certificates shall have been countersigned 
but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the 
countersignature under its prior name and deliver 
Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at 
that time any of the Right Certificates shall not 
have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may 
countersign such Right Certificates either in its 
prior name or in its changed name; and in all such 
cases such Right Certificates shall have the full 
force provided in the Right Certificates and in 
this Agreement.

Section 20. Duties of Rights Agent. The 
Rights Agent undertakes only those duties and 
obligations imposed by this Agreement upon the 
following terms and conditions, by all of which the 
Corporation and the holders of Right Certificates, 
by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:

(a) The Rights Agent may consult 
with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for 
the Corporation), and the opinion of such counsel 
shall be full and complete authorization and 
protection to the Rights Agent as to any action 
taken or omitted by it in good faith and in 
accordance with such opinion.

(b) Whenever in the performance of 
its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent 
shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact 
or matter (including, without limitation, the 
identity of an Acquiring Person and the 
determination of the current market price of any 
Security) be proved or established by the 
Corporation prior to taking or suffering any action 
hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other 
evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically 
prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved 
and established by a certificate signed by any one 
of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive 
Officer, the President, any Vice President, the 
Treasurer or the Secretary of the Corporation and 
delivered to the Rights Agent; and such 
<PAGE>
certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for 
any action taken or suffered in good faith by it 
under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance 
upon such certificate.

(c) The Rights Agent shall be liable 
hereunder only for its own negligence, bad faith or 
willful misconduct.

(d) The Rights Agent shall not be 
liable for or by reason of any of the statements of 
fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in 
the Right Certificates (except its countersignature 
on such Right Certificates) or be required to 
verify the same, but all such statements and 
recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made 
by the Corporation only.

(e) The Rights Agent shall not be 
under any responsibility in respect of the validity 
of this Agreement or the execution and delivery 
hereof (except the due execution hereof by the 
Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or 
execution of any Right Certificate (except its 
countersignature thereof); nor shall it be 
responsible for any breach by the Corporation of 
any covenant or condition contained in this 
Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor shall 
it be responsible for any change in the 
exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights 
becoming void pursuant to Section 7(e) hereof) or 
any adjustment required under the provisions of 
Section 11 or Section 13 hereof or responsible for 
the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment 
or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that 
would require any such adjustment (except with 
respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by 
Right Certificates after receipt of the certificate 
described in Section 12 hereof); nor shall it by 
any act hereunder be deemed to make any 
representation or warranty as to the authorization 
or reservation of any Common Shares to be issued 
pursuant to this Agreement or any Right Certificate 
or as to whether any Common Shares will, when 
issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully 
paid and non-assessable.

(f) The Corporation agrees that it 
will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or 
cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and 
delivered all such further and other acts, 
instruments and assurances as may reasonably be 
required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out 
or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions 
of this Agreement.

(g) The Rights Agent is hereby 
authorized and directed to accept instructions with 
respect to the performance of its duties hereunder 
from any one of the Chairman of the Board, the 
Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice 
President, the Treasurer or the Secretary of the 
Corporation, and to apply to such officers for 
advice or instructions in 
<PAGE>
connection with its 
duties, and shall not be liable for any action 
taken or suffered by it in good faith or lack of 
action in accordance with instructions of any such 
officer or for any delay in acting while waiting 
for those instructions. Any application by the 
Rights Agent for written instructions from the 
Corporation may, at the option of the Rights Agent, 
set forth in writing any action proposed to be 
taken or omitted by the Rights Agent under this 
Rights Agreement and the date on or after which 
such action shall be taken or such omission shall 
be effective. The Rights Agent shall not be liable 
for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights 
Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any 
such application on or after the date specified in 
such application (which date shall not be less than 
five Business Days after the date any officer of 
the Corporation actually receives such application, 
unless any such officer shall have consented in 
writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking 
any such action (or the effective date in the case 
of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have 
received written instruction in response to such 
application specifying the action to be taken or 
omitted.

(h) The Rights Agent and any 
stockholder, director, officer or employee of the 
Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the 
Rights or other securities of the Corporation or 
become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in 
which the Corporation may be interested, or 
contract with or lend money to the Corporation or 
otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were 
not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing 
herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting 
in any other capacity for the Corporation or for 
any other legal entity.

(i) The Rights Agent may execute and 
exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested 
in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself 
or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the 
Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable 
for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any 
such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the 
Corporation resulting from any such act, default, 
neglect or misconduct, provided reasonable care was 
exercised in the selection and continued employment 
thereof.

(j) No provision of this Agreement 
shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk 
its own funds or otherwise incur any financial 
liability in the performance of any of its duties 
hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if there 
shall be reasonable grounds for believing that 
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification 
against such risk or liability is not reasonably 
assured to it.

(k) If, with respect to any Rights 
Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for 
exercise or transfer, the 
<PAGE>
certificate attached to 
the form of assignment or form of election to 
purchase, as the case may be, has not been 
completed, the Rights Agent shall not take any 
further action with respect to such requested 
exercise of transfer without first consulting with 
the Corporation.

Section 21. Change of Rights Agent. The 
Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may 
resign and be discharged from its duties under this 
Agreement upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing 
mailed to the Corporation and to the transfer agent 
of the Common Shares by registered or certified 
mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates 
by first-class mail. The Corporation may remove 
the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 
sixty (60) days' notice in writing, mailed to the 
Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case 
may be, and to the transfer agent of the Common 
Shares by registered or certified mail, and to 
holders of the Right Certificates by first-class 
mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be 
removed or shall otherwise become incapable of 
acting, the Corporation shall appoint a successor 
to the Rights Agent. If the Corporation shall fail 
to make such appointment within a period of sixty 
(60) days after giving notice of such removal or 
after it has been notified in writing of such 
resignation or incapacity by the resigning or 
incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a 
Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, 
submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the 
Corporation), then the registered holder of any 
Right Certificate may apply to any court of 
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new 
Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether 
appointed by the Corporation or by such a court, 
shall be a corporation organized and doing business 
under the laws of the United States or of the State 
of New York (or of any other state of the United 
States so long as such corporation is authorized to 
do business as a banking institution in the State 
of New York), in good standing, having an office in 
the State of New York, which is authorized under 
such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock 
transfer powers and is subject to supervision or 
examination by federal or state authority and which 
has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent 
a combined capital and surplus of at least 
$100,000,000. After appointment, the successor 
Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, 
rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had 
been originally named as Rights Agent without 
further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights 
Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor 
Rights Agent any property at the time held by it 
hereunder, and execute and deliver any further 
assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for 
the purpose. Not later than the effective date of 
any such appointment the Corporation shall file 
notice thereof in writing with the predecessor 
Rights Agent and the transfer agent of the Common 
Shares, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the 
registered holders of 
<PAGE>
the Right Certificates. 
Failure to give any notice provided for in this 
Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall 
not affect the legality or validity of the 
resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the 
appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the 
case may be.

Section 22. 
Issuance of New Right Certificates. 
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this 
Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the 
Corporation may, at its option, issue new Right 
Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may 
be approved by its Board of Directors of the 
Corporation to reflect any adjustment or change in 
the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class 
of shares or other securities or property 
purchasable under the Right Certificates made in 
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

In addition, in connection with the 
issuance or sale of Common Shares following the 
Distribution Date and prior to the earliest of the 
Redemption Date, the Final Expiration Date and the 
consummation of a transaction contemplated by 
Section 13(d) hereof, the Corporation (a) shall 
with respect to Common Shares so issued or sold 
pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under 
any employee plan or arrangement, or upon the 
exercise, conversion or exchange of securities, 
notes or debentures issued by the Corporation, and 
(b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary or 
appropriate by the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation, issue Right Certificates representing 
the appropriate number of Rights in connection with 
such issuance or sale; provided, however, that (i) 
the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue any 
such Right Certificates if, and to the extent that, 
the Corporation shall be advised by counsel that 
such issuance would create a significant risk of 
material adverse tax consequences to the 
Corporation or the Person to whom such Right 
Certificate would be issued, and (ii) no Right 
Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent 
that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have 
been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.

Section 23. Redemption and Termination. 
(a)(i) Subject to Section 23(a)(iii), the Board of 
Directors of the Corporation may, at its option, 
redeem all but not less than all the then 
outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.01 
per Right, as such amount may be appropriately 
adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend 
or similar transaction occurring after the date 
hereof (such redemption price being hereinafter 
referred to as the "Redemption Price"), at any time 
prior to the earlier of (x) the time that any 
Person becomes an Acquiring Person, or (y) the 
Final Expiration Date. The Corporation may, at its 
option, pay the Redemption Price either in Common 
Shares (based on the "current per share market 
price," as defined in Section 11(d) hereof, of the 
Common Shares at the time of redemption) or cash; 
provided that if the 
<PAGE>
Corporation elects to pay the 
Redemption Price in Common Shares, the Corporation 
shall not be required to issue any fractional 
Common Shares and the number of Common Shares 
issuable to each holder of Rights shall be rounded 
down to the next whole share. 

(ii) In addition, subject to 
Section 23(a)(iii), the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation may, at its option, at any time 
following a Shares Acquisition Date but prior to 
any Section 13 Event redeem all but not less than 
all of the then outstanding Rights at the 
Redemption Price in connection with any Section 13 
Event in which all holders of Common Shares are 
treated alike and not involving (other than as a 
holder of Common Shares being treated like all 
other such holders) an Interested Stockholder.

(iii) The Board of Directors of 
the Corporation may only redeem Rights pursuant to 
Section 23(a)(i) or 23(a)(ii) hereof if (A) a 
majority of the Disinterested Directors, and (B) a 
majority of all of the directors of the Corporation 
authorize such redemption. Notwithstanding 
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the 
Rights may not be redeemed pursuant to this Section 
23 unless there is at least one member of the Board 
of Directors of the Corporation that is a 
Disinterested Director at the time of such 
redemption.

(b) In the case of a redemption 
permitted under Section 23(a)(i), immediately upon 
the date for redemption set forth (or determined in 
the manner specified in) in a resolution of the 
Board of Directors of the Corporation ordering the 
redemption of the Rights, evidence of which shall 
have been filed with the Rights Agent, and without 
any further action and without any notice, the 
right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the 
only right thereafter of the holders of Rights 
shall be to receive the Redemption Price for each 
Right so held. In the case of a redemption 
permitted only under Section 23(a)(ii), evidence of 
which shall have been filed with the Rights Agent, 
the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and 
represent only the right to receive the Redemption 
Price upon the later of ten Business Days following 
the giving of such notice or the expiration of any 
period during which the rights under Section 
11(a)(ii) may be exercised. The Corporation shall 
promptly give public notice of any such redemption; 
provided, however, that the failure to give, or any 
defect in, any such notice shall not affect the 
validity of such redemption. Within ten (10) days 
after such date for redemption set forth in a 
resolution of the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation ordering the redemption of the Rights, 
the Corporation shall mail a notice of redemption 
to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights 
at their last addresses as they appear upon the 
registry books of the Rights 
<PAGE>
Agent or, prior to the 
Distribution Date, on the registry books of the 
transfer agent for the Common Shares. Any notice 
which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall 
be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives 
the notice. Each such notice of redemption will 
state the method by which the payment of the 
Redemption Price will be made. Neither the 
Corporation nor any of its Affiliates or Associates 
may redeem, acquire or purchase for value any 
Rights at any time in any manner other than that 
specifically set forth in this Section 23 and other 
than in connection with the purchase of Common 
Shares prior to the Distribution Date.

(c) The Corporation may, at its 
option, discharge all of its obligations with 
respect to the Rights by (i) issuing a press 
release announcing the manner of redemption of the 
Rights in accordance with this Agreement and 
(ii) mailing payment of the Redemption Price to the 
registered holders of the Rights at their last 
addresses as they appear on the registry books of 
the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution 
Date, on the registry books of the Transfer Agent 
of the Common Shares, and upon such action, all 
outstanding Rights and Right Certificates shall be 
null and void without any further action by the 
Corporation.

Section 24. Exchange. (a) Subject to 
Section 24(d), the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation may, at its option, at any time after 
the time that any Person becomes an Acquiring 
Person, exchange after all or part of the then 
outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not 
include Rights that have become void pursuant to 
the provisions of Section 7(e) and Section 
11(a)(ii) hereof) for Common Shares of the 
Corporation at an exchange ratio of one Common 
Share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect 
any stock split, stock dividend or similar 
transaction occurring after the date hereof (such 
exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the 
"Exchange Ratio"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall not 
be empowered to effect such exchange at any time 
after any Person (other than the Corporation, any 
Subsidiary of the Corporation, any employee benefit 
plan of the Corporation or any such Subsidiary, any 
entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the 
terms of any such plan or any trustee, 
administrator or fiduciary of such a plan), 
together with all Affiliates and Associates of such 
Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more 
of the Common Shares then outstanding.

(b) Immediately upon the action of 
the Board of Directors of the Corporation ordering 
the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection 
(a) of this Section 24 and without any further 
action and without any notice, the right to 
exercise such rights shall terminate and the only 
right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall 
be to receive that 
<PAGE>
number of Common Shares equal to 
the number of such rights held by such holder 
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Corporation 
shall promptly give public notice of any such 
exchange; provided, however, that the failure to 
give, or any defect in, such notice shall not 
affect the validity of such exchange. The 
Corporation promptly shall mail a notice of any 
such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights 
at their last addresses as they appear upon the 
registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice 
which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall 
be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives 
the notice. Each such notice of exchange will 
state the method by which the exchange of the 
Common Shares for Rights will be effected and, in 
the event of any partial exchange, the number of 
Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial 
exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the 
number of Rights (other than Rights which have 
become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 
7(e) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each 
holder of Rights.

(c) In the event that there shall 
not be sufficient Common Shares issued but not 
outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit 
any exchange of Rights as contemplated in 
accordance with this Section 24, the Corporation 
shall take all such action as may be necessary to 
authorize additional Common Shares for issuance 
upon exchange of the Rights.

(d) The Board of Directors may only 
exchange Rights pursuant to Section 24(a) hereof if 
(i) a majority of the Disinterested Directors, and 
(ii) a majority of all of the directors of the 
Corporation authorize such exchange. 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary, the Rights may not be exchanged pursuant 
to this Section 24 unless there is at least one 
member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation 
that is a Disinterested Director at the time of 
such exchange.

Section 25. Notice of Certain Events. 
(a) In case the Corporation shall propose (i) to 
pay any dividend payable in stock of any class to 
the holders of its Common Shares or to make any 
other distribution to the holders of its Common 
Shares (other than a regularly quarterly cash 
dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of its 
Common Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for 
or to purchase any additional Common Shares or 
shares of stock of any class or any 
other securities, rights or options, (iii) to 
effect any reclassification of its Common Shares 
(other than a reclassification involving only the 
subdivision of outstanding Common Shares), (iv) to 
effect any consolidation or merger into or with any 
other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the 
Corporation in a transaction which does not violate 
Section 11(o) hereof), or to effect any sale or 
other transfer (or to permit one or more of its 
Subsidiaries 
<PAGE>
to effect any sale or other transfer) 
in one or more transactions, of 50% or more of the 
assets or earning power of the Corporation and its 
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person 
or Persons (other than the Corporation and/or any 
of its Subsidiaries in one or more transactions 
each of which does not violate Section 11(o) 
hereof), or (v) to effect the liquidation, 
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, then, 
in each such case, the Corporation shall give to 
each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance 
with Section 26 hereof, a notice of such proposed 
action to the extent feasible and file a 
certificate with the Rights Agent to that effect, 
which shall specify the record date for the 
purposes of such stock dividend, or distribution of 
rights or warrants, or the date on which such 
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, 
transfer, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up 
is to take place and the date of participation 
therein by the holders of the Common Shares, if any 
such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be 
so given in the case of any action covered by 
clause (i) or (ii) above at least twenty (20) days 
prior to the record date for determining holders of 
the Common Shares for purposes of such action, and 
in the case of any such other action, at least 
twenty (20) days prior to the date of the taking of 
such proposed action or the date of participation 
therein by the holders of the Common Shares, 
whichever shall be the earlier.

(b) In case of a Section 11(a)(ii) 
Event, then (i) the Corporation shall as soon as 
practicable thereafter give to each holder of a 
Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 
hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such event, 
which notice shall describe such event and the 
consequences of such event to holders of Rights 
under Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and (ii) all 
references in the preceding paragraph (a) to Common 
Shares shall be deemed thereafter to refer also, if 
appropriate, to capital stock equivalents, as 
provided for in Section 11(a)(iii).

Section 26. Notices. Notices or demands 
authorized by this Agreement to be given or made by 
the Rights Agent or by the holder of any Right

Section 27. Supplements and Amendments. 
(a) Prior to the Distribution Date, subject to 
Section 27(b) hereof, the Corporation and the 
Rights Agent shall, if the Corporation so directs, 
supplement or amend any provision of this Agreement 
without the approval of any holders of certificates 
representing Common Shares. From and after the 
Distribution Date, subject to Section 27(b) hereof, 
the Corporation and the Rights Agent shall, if the 
Corporation so directs, supplement or amend this 
Agreement without the approval of any holders of 
Right Certificates in order (i) to cure any 
ambiguity, (ii) to correct or supplement any 
provision contained herein which may be defective 
or inconsistent with any other provisions herein, 
(iii) to shorten or lengthen any time period 
hereunder or (iv) to change or supplement the 
provisions hereunder in any manner which the 
Corporation may deem necessary or desirable and 
which shall not adversely affect the interests of 
the holders of Right Certificates (other than an 
Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of an 
Acquiring Person); provided, however, that this 
Agreement may not be supplemented or amended to 
lengthen, pursuant to clause (iii) of this 
sentence, (A) a time period relating to when the 
Rights may be redeemed at such time as the Rights 
are not then redeemable, or (B) any other time 
period unless such lengthening is for the purpose 
of protecting, enhancing or clarifying the rights 
of, and/or the benefits to, the holders of Rights. 
Upon the delivery of a certificate from an 
appropriate officer of the Corporation which states 
that the proposed supplement or amendment is in 
compliance with the terms of this Section 27, the 
Rights Agent shall execute such supplement or 
amendment, provided that such supplement or 
amendment does not adversely affect the rights or 
obligations of the Rights Agent under Section 18 or 
Section 20 of this Agreement. Prior to the 
Distribution Date, the 
<PAGE>
interests of the holders of 
Rights shall be deemed coincident with the 
interests of the holders of Common Shares.

(b) The Corporation shall not 
supplement or amend any provision of this Agreement

Directors and (ii) a majority of all of the 
directors of the Corporation authorizes such

Section 27 unless there is at least one member of 
the Board of Directors of the Corporation that is a 
Disinterested Director at the time of such 
supplement or amendment.

Section 28. Determination and Actions by 
the Board of Directors of the Corporation, etc.

this Agreement, and (ii) make all determinations 
deemed necessary or advisable for the 
administration of this Agreement (including, 
without limitation, a determination to redeem or 
not redeem the Rights or to amend the Agreement and 
whether any proposed amendment adversely affects 
the interests of the holders of Right 
Certificates). For all purposes of this Agreement, 
any calculation of the number of Common Shares or 
other securities outstanding at any particular 
time, including for purposes of determining the 
particular percentage of such outstanding Common 
Shares or any other securities of which any Person 
is the Beneficial Owner, shall be made in 
accordance with the last sentence of Rule 13d-
3(d)(1)(i) of the General Rules and Regulations 
under the Exchange Act as in effect on the date of 
this Agreement. All such actions, calculations, 
interpretations and determinations (including, for 
purposes of clause (y) below, all omissions with 
respect to the foregoing) which are done or made by 
the Board in good faith, shall (x) be final, 
conclusive and binding on the Corporation, the 
Rights Agent, the holders of the Right Certificates 
and all other parties, and (y) not subject the

or equitable right, remedy or claim under this 
Agreement; but this Agreement shall be for the sole 
and exclusive benefit of the Corporation, the 
Rights Agent and the registered holders of the 
Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution 
Date, the Common Shares).

Section 31. Severability. If any term, 
provision, covenant or restriction of this 
Agreement is held by a court of competent 
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void 
or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, 
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this 
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and 
shall in no way be affected, impaired or 
invalidated.

Section 32. Governing Law. This

FORM OF TRANSFEREE AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of 
[ ], between [Insert Name of Transferee] 
(the "Transferee") and Loctite Corporation ("Loctite"). 
Capitalized terms used herein which are otherwise not

ascribed to them in the Rights Agreement, dated as of 
April 14, 1994, between Loctite and The First National 
Bank of Boston (the "Rights Agreement").

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, pursuant to the acquisition 
agreement, dated as of [ ] (the 
"Acquisition Agreement"), between [Insert Name of 
Transferor] (the "Transferor") and the Transferee, the 
Transferor has agreed to sell on [ ] (the 
"Closing Date") to the Transferee [ ] 
Common Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions 
thereof (the "Proposed Sale Transaction");

WHEREAS, under the Rights Agreement, in order 
for the Transferee to be deemed to be a Permitted 
Transferee, (i) the Transferee may not have been 
declared an Adverse Person, (ii) [in the case of a 
Transfer from the Krieble Family Group or a Permitted 
Transferee to the Transferee, the Transferee may not 
beneficially own, after giving effect to the Proposed

entered into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the 
promises herein contained and for other good and 
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of 
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be 
legally bound hereby, each of the parties hereto agrees 
as follows:

1. Prohibited Actions. (a) So long as this 
Agreement is in effect, (i) Loctite shall not adopt any 
shareholder rights plan or similar device that does not 
contain substantially the same terms and conditions as 
those set forth in the Rights Agreement (a 
"Substantially Similar Rights Plan") and (ii) Loctite 
shall not amend, modify, waive, terminate or invalidate 
any provision of the Rights Agreement or any 
Substantially Similar Rights Plan or adopt, amend, 
modify, waive, terminate or invalidate any provision of 
its certificate of incorporation or by-laws in any way 
which would adversely affect the rights of the 
Transferee under the Rights Agreement or any 
Substantially Similar Rights Plan.

(b) So long as this Agreement is in 
effect, the Transferee shall not, and shall cause each 
of its Affiliates and Associates and any duly and 
validly elected directors of Loctite (each a 
"Director") designated by, or which is a representative 
of, the Transferee or any of its Affiliates or 
Associates not to, directly or indirectly, seek to (i) 
amend, modify, waive, terminate or invalidate, or cause 
the amendment, modification, waiver, termination or 
invalidation of any provision of the Rights Agreement 
or any Substantially Similar Rights Plan in any manner 
(including, without limitation, by proxy contest, 
shareholder consent, or otherwise) or (ii) redeem or 
exchange the Rights or any rights issued under any 
Substantially Similar Rights Plan, in either case, 
unless a majority of the Directors who are neither 
nominees or representatives of the Transferee or any 
Affiliate or Associate of the Transferee nor officers 
or employees of Loctite (each an "Outside Director") 
consent to such action in writing or at a duly called 
meeting of the Board of Directors of Loctite (the 
"Board"); it being understood that the consent of the 
Outside Directors may only be obtained if there is at 
least one Director that is an Outside Director.

(c) Loctite acknowledges that nothing in 
this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting the 
Transferee, or its Affiliates or Associates, from 
making, or in any way participating in, any 
"solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are defined 
below), or becoming a "participant" in any "election 
contest" (as such terms are defined below), in each 
case, for the election or removal of any of the 
Directors; provided, however, that any Director 
designated by the Transferee, or any Affiliate 
<PAGE>
or Associate of the Transferee, shall be subject to the 
restrictions contained in Section 1(b) hereof.

2. Permitted Transfers. (a) In connection 
with any proposed Permitted Transfer by the Transferee, 
the Transferee shall deliver to Loctite no later than 
30 days prior to the Transfer Date (as defined below) 
(i) written notice of such proposed Permitted Transfer 
(the "Transfer Notice") for such proposed Permitted 
Transfer setting forth (A) the number of Common Shares 
proposed to be transferred, (B) the identity of the 
proposed transferee (the "Proposed Transferee"), 
including the Beneficial Owners thereof to the extent 
known or reasonably determinable by the Transferee, and 
(C) the date on which the proposed Permitted Transfer 
is to be consummated (the "Transfer Date") and (ii) an 
agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to 
the Rights Agreement, duly and validly executed on 
behalf of the Proposed Transferee (the "Transferee 
Agreement"). Upon receipt by Loctite of the Transferee 
Agreement duly executed and delivered by the Proposed 
Transferee, Loctite shall duly execute and deliver the 
Transferee Agreement.

(b) As soon as practicable after receipt 
of the Transfer Notice, the Directors who are neither 
nominees or representatives of the Transferor or any 
Affiliate or Associate of the Transferor nor officers 
or employees of Loctite (each an "Unaffiliated 
Director") shall evaluate whether the Proposed 
Transferee is an Adverse Person. The Transferee shall 
provide the Unaffiliated Directors with any information 
within its control requested by them to facilitate 
their evaluation, as soon as practicable after any 
request for information is made.

(c) Subject to Section 2(d) hereof, a 
proposed Permitted Transfer may be consummated on the 
Transfer Date as set forth in the Transfer Notice and 
the Transferee Agreement related to such proposed 
Permitted Transfer unless the Unaffiliated Directors 
shall have determined that the Proposed Transferee is 
an Adverse Person no later than five days prior to the 
Transfer Date for such proposed Permitted Transfer 
provided that the Transferee complies with its 
obligations in Sections 2(a) and (b) hereof.

(d) With respect to any proposed 
Permitted Transfer, the Proposed Transferee shall be 
deemed to be an Adverse Person for purposes of the 
Rights Agreement, unless there is at least one Director 
that is an Unaffiliated Director during the period from 
and including the date Loctite receives a Transfer 
Notice in respect of such proposed Permitted Transfer 
to and including the Transfer Date for such proposed 
Permitted Transfer. Except as required by applicable 
law, Loctite covenants and agrees that it will not take 
any action to cause there to be fewer than one 
Unaffiliated Director on the Board at any time.
<PAGE>
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, no transferee of any Common 
Shares from the Transferee shall have any rights under 
this Agreement.

provisions of this Agreement for the period prior to 
its termination.

set forth in this Section 5.9, nothing in this

corporation (other than Loctite and the Transferee) any 
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this 
Agreement. The parties agree that, at any time that 
there are no Unaffiliated Directors, the rights of 
action in respect of this Agreement shall be vested in 
the respective holders of Common Shares; and any holder 
of Common Shares, without the consent of any other 
holder of Common Shares, may, on his own behalf and for 
his own benefit, enforce, and may institute and 
maintain any suit, action or proceeding against any 
party to this Agreement to enforce, any provision of 
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any 
remedies available to the holders of Common Shares, it 
is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Common 
Shares would not have an adequate remedy at law for any 
breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to 
specific performance of the obligations under, and 
injunctive relief against actual or threatened 
violations of the obligations of any party subject to, 
this Agreement.

(b) The Transferee hereby agrees that 
in connection with any action by Loctite to enforce any 
provision of this Agreement against the Transferee, the 
Transferee will not take any action that would directly 
or indirectly prevent Loctite from making the necessary 
funds and personnel available to pursue such action.

5.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may 
be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which 
for all purposes shall be deemed an original and all of 
which shall constitute the same instrument.

SUMMARY OF RIGHTS TO PURCHASE COMMON SHARES

UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN THE RIGHTS 
AGREEMENT, RIGHTS ISSUED TO, OR HELD BY, ANY PERSON WHO 
IS, WAS OR BECOMES AN ACQUIRING PERSON OR AN AFFILIATE 
OR ASSOCIATE THEREOF (AS DEFINED IN THE RIGHTS 
AGREEMENT) AND CERTAIN RELATED PERSONS, WHETHER 
CURRENTLY HELD BY OR ON BEHALF OF SUCH PERSON OR BY ANY 
SUBSEQUENT HOLDER, SHALL BECOME NULL AND VOID.

On April 14, 1994, the Board of Directors of 
Loctite Corporation (the "Corporation") declared a 
dividend distribution of one right (a "Right") for each 
outstanding share of Common Stock, $.01 par value per 
share (the "Common Shares"), of the Corporation. The 
dividend is payable to the stockholders of record on 
April 25, 1994 (the "Record Date") and with respect to 
Common Shares issued thereafter until the Distribution 
Date (as defined below), and, in certain circumstances, 
with respect to Common Shares issued after the 
Distribution Date. Except as set forth below, each 
Right, when it becomes exercisable, entitles the 
registered holder to purchase from the Corporation one 
Common Share at a price of $175.00 per Common Share 
(the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment. The 
description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a 
Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") between the 
Corporation and The First National Bank of Boston, as 
Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent"), dated as of 
April 14, 1994.

Initially, the Rights will be attached to all 
certificates representing Common Shares then 
outstanding, and no separate Right Certificates (as 
hereinafter defined) will be distributed. The Rights 
will separate from the Common Shares upon the earlier 
to occur of (i) the date of a public announcement that 
a person or "group" (other than a Grandfathered 
Stockholder (as hereinafter defined) has acquired 
beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding 
Common Shares (except pursuant to a Permitted Offer, as 
hereinafter defined); or (ii) 10 days (or such later 
date as the Board may determine) following the 
commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer the 
consummation of which would result in a person or group 
becoming an Acquiring Person (as hereinafter defined) 
(the earlier of such dates being called the 
"Distribution Date"). A person or group whose 
acquisition of Common Shares causes a Distribution Date 
pursuant to clause (i) above is an "Acquiring Person." 
The date that a person or group becomes an Acquiring 
Person is the "Shares Acquisition Date."

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Acquiring 
Person does not include the following persons 
("Grandfathered Stockholders"): (i) Henkel 
Corporation, a Delaware corporation 
<PAGE>
("Henkel"), (ii) 
Mr. Robert H. Krieble, Ms. Nancy B. Krieble, Mr. 
Frederick B. Krieble, Ms. Collette C. Krieble, Mr. 
James P. Fusscas, Ms. Helen K. Fusscas, Mr. Martin 
Wolman, Management I, Limited and Management II, 
Limited as a "group" (as such term is defined or used 
under Rule 13d-5(b) promulgated pursuant to 
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as amended) (collectively as such group, the "Krieble 
Family Group") and (iii) any Permitted Transferee (as 
hereinafter defined); provided, however, that, except 
under limited circumstances, (a) Henkel will cease to 
be a Grandfathered Stockholder at any time after the 
date of the Rights Agreement that Henkel beneficially 
owns a percentage of outstanding Common Shares in 
excess of the Henkel Percentage (as hereinafter 
defined) then in effect (other than as a result of a 
Permitted Offer), (b) the Krieble Family Group will 
cease to be a Grandfathered Stockholder at the time 
after the date of the Rights Agreement any member of 
the Krieble Family Group beneficially owns any 
additional Common Shares (other than as a result of a 
stock dividend, a stock split, a grant by the 
Corporation pursuant to a directors benefit plan 
established by the Corporation of Common Shares or 
options to purchase Common Shares (and the exercise 
thereof) or a Permitted Offer) and (c) any Permitted 
Transferee will cease to be a Grandfathered Stockholder 
at the time such Permitted Transferee beneficially owns 
any additional Common Shares (other than as a result of 
a stock dividend, a stock split or a Permitted Offer). 
Initially, the "Henkel Percentage" is 35% of the 
outstanding Common Shares and thereafter is subject to 
adjustment as follows: (1) in the event of any 
transfer of Common Shares by Henkel to any person 
(other than by means of a transfer of Common Shares 
pursuant to a registered public offering or a broker's 
transaction under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended, and that satisfies certain other 
conditions to ensure a wide distribution of those 
Common Shares (each such transfer, a "Distribution 
Transaction")), the Henkel Percentage will be reduced 
by the percentage of outstanding Common Shares so 
transferred; (2) in the event of transfers aggregating 
more than 10% of the outstanding Common Shares by 
Henkel by means of Distribution Transactions, the 
Henkel Percentage will be reduced by the aggregate 
percentage of outstanding Common Shares so transferred 
in excess of 10% of the outstanding Common Shares; and 
(3) in the event that the Corporation acquires any 
Common Shares, the Henkel Percentage immediately 
following such acquisition will equal the greater of 
the Henkel Percentage immediately prior to such 
acquisition and the percentage of the outstanding 
Common Shares beneficially owned by Henkel immediately 
following such acquisition.

A "Permitted Transfer" is any transfer of 
Common Shares from Henkel, the Krieble Family Group as 
a whole, or any Permitted Transferee to any person that 
(i) has not been declared an Adverse Person (as 
hereinafter defined) by a majority of those directors 
of the Corporation who are neither 
<PAGE>
officers or employees of the Corporation nor a designee or 
representative of the proposed transferor (the 
"Unaffiliated Directors"), (ii) does not beneficially 
own, after giving effect to the transfer, in the case 
of a transfer from the Krieble Family Group or any 
Permitted Transferee, any Common Shares other than the 
Common Shares so transferred to such transferee or in 
the case of a transfer from Henkel, a percentage of the 
then outstanding Common Shares in excess of the lesser 
of (a) the Henkel Percentage in effect immediately 
prior to such proposed transfer and (b) the sum of 0.3% 
of the then outstanding Common Shares and the 
percentage of the then outstanding Common Shares so 
transferred to such transferee, (iii) at least 30 days 
prior to the consummation of such proposed transfer, 
executes and delivers to the Corporation an agreement 
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 attached to 
the Rights Agreement and (iv) immediately prior to the 
consummation of such transfer, executes and delivers to 
the Corporation an executive officer's certificate 
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 attached to 
the Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement provides 
that any proposed Permitted Transferee will be deemed 
to be an "Adverse Person" if it is declared to be an 
Adverse Person by a majority of the Unaffiliated 
Directors after having determined in its business 
judgment that beneficial ownership by such proposed 
Permitted Transferee of 10% or more of the outstanding 
Common Shares would be reasonably likely to materially 
adversely affect the Corporation or its stockholders.

The Rights Agreement provides that, until the 
Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred with 
and only with the Common Shares. Until the 
Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration 
of the Rights), new Common Share certificates issued 
after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuance of 
Common Shares will contain a notation incorporating the 
Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution 
Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the 
Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates 
for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date 
will also constitute the transfer of the Rights 
associated with the Common Shares represented by such 
certificate. As soon as practicable following the 
Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the 
Rights (the "Right Certificates") will be mailed to 
holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close 
of business on the Distribution Date (and to each 
initial record holder of certain Common Shares issued 
after the Distribution Date), and these separate Right 
Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.

The Rights are not exercisable until the 
Distribution Date and will expire at the close of 
business on April 14, 2004, unless earlier redeemed by 
the Corporation as described below.

In the event that any person becomes an 
Acquiring Person (except pursuant to a tender or 
exchange offer which is for all outstanding Common 
Shares and (i) which is at a price and 
<PAGE>
on terms which a majority of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter 
defined) and a majority of the entire Board determines 
to be adequate and in the best interests of the 
Corporation, its stockholders and its other relevant 
constituencies, other than such person making such 
offer, or (ii) which remains open for a period of at 
least 60 days after the tender or exchange offer has 
commenced and the consummation of which results in the 
person on whose basis the tender or exchange offer is 
made becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of 
the outstanding Common Shares (a "Permitted Offer")), 
each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right 
(the "Flip-In Right") to receive upon exercise the 
number of Common Shares (or, in certain circumstances, 
other securities of the Corporation) having a value 
(immediately prior to this triggering event) equal to 
two times the Purchase Price of the Right. In lieu of 
the Flip-In Right described above, the Board, at its 
option, may exchange each Right for one Common Share, 
provided that at no time has any person been the 
beneficial owner of 50% or more of the outstanding 
Common Shares. Such an exchange must be authorized by 
(a) a majority of the Disinterested Directors and (b) a 
majority of all of the directors of the Board. A 
"Disinterested Director" means any director of the 
Corporation who is neither an officer or employee of 
the Corporation nor any designee or representative of 
any person attempting to effect a business combination 
or similar transaction with the Corporation. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence 
of a person becoming an Acquiring Person, all Rights 
that are, or (under certain circumstances specified in 
the Rights Agreement) were, beneficially owned by any 
Acquiring Person will be null and void. 

In the event that at any time following the 
Shares Acquisition Date, (i) the Corporation is 
acquired in a merger or other business combination 
transaction in which the holders of all of the 
outstanding Common Shares immediately prior to the 
consummation of the transaction are not the holders of 
all of the surviving corporation's voting power, or 
(ii) more than 50% of the Corporation's assets or 
earning power is sold or transferred, in either case 
with or to (a) an Acquiring Person or any affiliate or 
associate or any other person in which such Acquiring 
Person, affiliate or associate has an interest or any 
person acting on behalf of or in concert with such 
Acquiring Person, affiliate or associate, or, (b) any 
other person (but only if in any such transaction 
referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, all holders of 
Common Shares are not treated alike), then each holder 
of a Right (except Rights which previously have been 
voided as set forth above) will have the right (the 
"Flip-Over Right") to receive, upon exercise, common 
shares of the acquiring Corporation having a value 
equal to two times the Purchase Price of the Right. 
The holder of a Right will continue to have the Flip-
Over Right whether or not such holder exercises or 
surrenders the Flip-In Right.
<PAGE>
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of 
Common Shares or other securities issuable, upon 
exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from 
time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a 
stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or 
reclassification of, the Common Shares, (ii) upon the 
grant to holders of the Common Shares of certain rights 
or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares 
at a price, or securities convertible into Common 
Shares with a conversion price, less than the then 
current market price of the Common Shares or (iii) upon 
the distribution to holders of the Common Shares of 
evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular 
quarterly cash dividends) or of subscription rights or 
warrants (other than those referred to above).

The number of outstanding Rights and the 
number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of each 
Right are also subject to adjustment in the event of a 
stock split of the Common Shares or a stock dividend on 
the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or 
subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the 
Common Shares occurring, in any such case, prior to the 
Distribution Date.

With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the 
Purchase Price will be required until cumulative 
adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in 
such Purchase Price. Fractional Common Shares will not 
be required to be issued by the Corporation, and in 
lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based 
on the market price of the Common Shares on the last 
trading day prior to the date of exercise.

At any time prior to the earlier to occur of 
(i) a person becoming an Acquiring Person or (ii) the 
expiration of the Rights, the Corporation may redeem 
the Rights at a price of $.01 per Right (the 
"Redemption Price"), which redemption will be effective 
upon approval of (a) a majority of the Disinterested 
Directors and (b) a majority of all of the directors of 
the Corporation. Additionally, following the Shares 
Acquisition Date, the then outstanding Rights may be 
redeemed at the Redemption Price (if approved by (1) a 
majority of the Disinterested Directors and (2) a 
majority of all of the directors of the Corporation), 
if this redemption is in connection with a merger or 
other business combination transaction or series of 
transactions involving the Corporation in which all 
holders of Common Shares are treated alike but not 
involving an Acquiring Person or its affiliates or 
associates.

Prior to the Distribution Date, all of the 
provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by 
approval of (i) a majority of the Disinterested 
Directors and (ii) a majority of all of the directors 
of the Corporation. After the Distribution Date, the 
provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended upon 
approval of (a) a majority of the Disinterested 
Directors and (b) a majority of all of the directors of 
the Corporation in 
<PAGE>
order to cure any ambiguity, defect 
or inconsistency, or to make changes which do not 
adversely affect the interests of holders of Rights 
(excluding the interests of any Acquiring Person).

The Rights may not be redeemed, exchanged or 
amended unless there is at least one Disinterested 
Director at the time of such redemption, exchange or 
amendment.

Until a Right is exercised, the holder 
thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder 
of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the 
right to vote or to receive dividends. While the 
distribution of the Rights will not be taxable to 
stockholders of the Corporation, stockholders may, 
depending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable 
income should the Rights become exercisable or upon the 
occurrence of certain events thereafter.

A copy of the Rights Agreement has been filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an 
Exhibit to a Registration Statement on Form 8-A dated 
April 15, 1994. A copy of the Rights Agreement is 
available free of charge from the Corporation. This 
summary description of the Rights does not purport to 
be complete and is qualified in its entirety by 
reference to the Rights Agreement, which is hereby 
incorporated herein by reference.

Entity".

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, pursuant to a Stock Purchase 
Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), dated 
May 23, 1985, Henkel of America, Inc., the direct 
parent of Henkel America ("Henkel Parent"), agreed to 
acquire from the sellers listed on Schedule A thereto 
(collectively, the "Selling Stockholders") certain 
shares of common stock, no par value, of Loctite (the 
"Common Stock");

WHEREAS, in connection with the Stock 
Purchase Agreement, Henkel Parent and Loctite entered 
into an agreement, dated May 23, 1985 (the "Standstill 
Agreement"), setting forth certain arrangements with 
respect to the relationships between them;

WHEREAS, Henkel Parent assigned to Henkel 
America all of its rights and obligations under the 
Stock Purchase Agreement and the Standstill Agreement 
and Henkel America acquired from the Selling 
Stockholders all of the shares of Common Stock sold by 
them pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement;

WHEREAS, Henkel America contributed all of 
its shares of Common Stock to the capital of Henkel 
Subsidiary and has designated Henkel Subsidiary to 
receive all shares of Common Stock purchased by Henkel 
America under Section 7(b) of the Stock Purchase 
Agreement; and

WHEREAS, Henkel America and Loctite desire to 
terminate the Standstill Agreement, and the Henkel 
Entities and Loctite desire to enter into an agreement 
for the purpose of governing certain aspects of the 
relationships among them.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the 
promises herein contained, and for other good and 
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of 
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be 
legally bound hereby, each of the parties hereto agrees 
as follows:

<PAGE>

1. Termination of the Standstill Agreement. 
Loctite and Henkel America agree that the Standstill 
Agreement shall terminate effective as of the Record 
Date (as defined below). Effective as of the Record 
Date, the provisions of the Standstill Agreement shall 
be of no further force and effect, and there shall be 
no liability on the part of any party to the Standstill 
Agreement with respect to any of the provisions thereof 
with the sole exception that nothing contained in this 
Agreement shall in any way relieve any party from 
liability for any breach of the provisions of the 
Standstill Agreement for the period commencing on the 
date of this Agreement and ending on the Record Date. 
The "Record Date" shall mean that certain date set 
forth in the Rights Agreement referred to in Section 
2.1 hereof on which the authorized and declared 
dividend of one Right (as defined in the Rights 
Agreement) is issued in respect of each share of Common 
Stock outstanding as of such date.

2. Shareholder Rights Agreement. 

2.1 Adoption. Simultaneously with the 
execution of this Agreement, Loctite is entering into a 
Rights Agreement with a bank or trust company acting as 
rights agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit A 
hereto (the Rights Agreement, as hereafter amended from 
time to time, shall be referred to as the "Rights 
Agreement").

2.2 Prohibited Actions.

2.2.1 Loctite. (a) So long as 
this Agreement is in effect, (i) Loctite shall not 
adopt any shareholder rights plan or similar device 
that does not contain substantially the same terms and 
conditions as those set forth in the Rights Agreement 
(a "Substantially Similar Rights Plan") and 
(ii) Loctite shall not amend, modify, waive, terminate 
or invalidate any provision of the Rights Agreement or 
any Substantially Similar Rights Plan or adopt, amend, 
modify, waive, terminate or invalidate any provision of 
its certificate of incorporation or by-laws in any way 
which would adversely affect the rights of any of the 
Henkel Entities under the Rights Agreement or any 
Substantially Similar Rights Plan. 

(b) In the event of any Proposed 
Loctite Action (as defined below), Loctite will give 
the Henkel Entities notice of such Proposed Loctite 
Action within a reasonable period of time prior to 
Loctite's taking of such Proposed Loctite Action and a 
reasonable opportunity to present to Loctite and the 
Board (as defined below) the Henkel Entities' views on 
the merits of such Proposed Loctite Action; provided, 
however, that if, in the Board's business judgment, the 
giving of such notice and reasonable opportunity to 
make such presentation would adversely affect the 
Board's ability to carry out its fiduciary 
responsibilities and such Proposed Loctite Action is, 
in the business judgment of the Board, in the best 
interests of Loctite and its stockholders, Loctite 
shall have the absolute right to 
<PAGE>
effect such proposed 
Loctite Action without regard to this Section 2.2.1(b) 
(including, without limitation, not providing the 
Henkel Entities with any notice of any such Proposed 
Loctite Action and the opportunity to make a 
presentation with respect thereto). As used herein, 
the term "Proposed Loctite Action" shall mean (i) any 
proposed adoption, amendment, modification, waiver, 
termination or invalidation by Loctite of any provision 
of the Rights Agreement, a Substantially Similar Rights 
Plan, its certificate of incorporation or its bylaws 
that is not prohibited by Section 2.2.1(a) hereof or 
(ii) any proposed issuance by Loctite of additional 
shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to (1) the 
exercise of any outstanding stock option, warrant, 
convertible security or other right to purchase shares 
of Common Stock, (2) any benefit plan or other similar 
employee or director arrangement, (3) any stock split, 
stock dividend or similar distribution made available 
to the holders of Common Stock generally or (4) any 
issuance which alone, or together with any prior 
issuance of additional shares of Common Stock covered 
by this clause (4), would not exceed, in the aggregate, 
2.5% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the 
date of this Agreement).

2.2.2 Henkel Entities. (a) So 
long as this Agreement is in effect, the Henkel 
Entities shall not, and shall cause each of their 
respective Affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 
12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and in 
effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Exchange 
Act")) and any Director (as defined below) nominated 
by, or which is a representative of, any Henkel Entity 
or any of their respective Affiliates not to, directly 
or indirectly, seek to (i) amend, modify, waive, 
terminate or invalidate, or cause the amendment, 
modification, waiver, termination or invalidation of 
any provision of the Rights Agreement or any 
Substantially Similar Rights Plan in any manner 
(including, without limitation, by proxy contest, 
shareholder consent, or otherwise) or (ii) redeem or 
exchange the Rights (as defined in the Rights 
Agreement) or any rights issued under any Substantially 
Similar Rights Plan, in either case, unless a majority 
of the duly and validly elected directors of Loctite 
(each a "Director") who are neither nominees or 
representatives of any Henkel Entity or any of their 
respective Affiliates nor officers or employees of 
Loctite (each an "Outside Director") consent to such 
action in writing or at a duly called meeting of the 
board of Directors of Loctite (the "Board"); it being 
understood that the consent of the Outside Directors 
may only be obtained if there is at least one Director 
that is an Outside Director.

(b) In the event of any Proposed Henkel 
Action (as defined below) by any Henkel Entities or any 
of their respective Affiliates (the "Henkel 
Affiliates"), the Henkel Entities will give Loctite 
notice of such Proposed Henkel Action within a 
reasonable period of time prior to the taking of such 
Proposed Henkel Action by such Henkel Entity or such 
Henkel Affiliate (as 
<PAGE>
the case may be) and a reasonable 
opportunity to present to the Henkel Entities its views 
on the merits of such Proposed Henkel Action; provided, 
however, that if, in the reasonable judgment of the 
Henkel Entities, the giving of such notice and 
reasonable opportunity to make such presentation would 
adversely affect the ability of such Henkel Entity or 
such Henkel Affiliate (as the case may be) to effect 
such Proposed Henkel Action, such Henkel Entity or such 
Henkel Affiliates (as the case may be) shall have the 
absolute right to effect such Proposed Henkel Action 
without regard to this Section 2.2.2(b) (including, 
without limitation, not providing Loctite with any 
notice of such Proposed Henkel Action and the 
opportunity to make a presentation with respect 
thereto). As used herein, the term "Proposed Henkel 
Action" shall mean any proposed action by any Henkel 
Entity or any Henkel Affiliate regarding the 
"solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are defined 
or used in Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act) or 
becoming of a "participant" in any "election contest" 
(as such terms are defined or used in Rule 14a-11 of 
the Exchange Act), in each case, either (i) in 
opposition to any proposal to the holders of shares of 
Common Stock recommended by the Board or (ii) to remove 
any Directors.

(c) Loctite acknowledges that, except 
for the provisions of Section 2.2.2(b) hereof, nothing 
in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting any 
Henkel Entity or any Henkel Affiliates from making, or 
in any way participating in, any "solicitation" of 
"proxies" (as such terms are defined or used in 
Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act), or becoming a 
"participant" in any "election contest" (as such terms 
are defined or used in Rule 14a-11 of the Exchange 
Act), in each case, for the election or removal of any 
of the Directors; provided, however, any Director 
nominated by any Henkel Entity or any Henkel Affiliates 
shall be subject to the restrictions contained in 
Section 2.2.2(a) hereof.

3. Corporate Governance.

3.1 Board of Directors. (a) As 
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in 
no event later than November 15, 1994, the Outside 
Directors and the Henkel Entities shall each recommend 
one person to become a Director (each, an "Initial 
Recommended Person") to fill the two newly-created 
directorships that will result upon the expansion of 
the Board from ten members to twelve members in 
accordance with this Section 3.1. Subject to the 
second sentence of Section 3.1(c)(iii) hereof, each 
Initial Recommended Person shall be subject to the 
approval of a majority of all of the Directors, which 
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; the 
parties hereto acknowledge that it is currently 
anticipated that such consent by the Directors would 
not be withheld in the case of an Initial Recommended 
Person selected by the Henkel Entities unless such 
person is the Executive Vice President-Adhesives (or 
otherwise is an executive within the Adhesives 
division) of Henkel Germany (or another division or 
subdivision of Henkel 
<PAGE>
Germany or its subsidiaries that 
may in the future engage in substantially the same 
activities as the Adhesives division of Henkel Germany 
engages in on the date hereof) or whose membership on 
the Board would be a violation of law. If an Initial 
Recommended Person is not approved as provided herein, 
then the Outside Directors or the Henkel Entities, as 
the case may be, that recommended such person shall 
promptly recommend a substitute or substitutes until 
approval is obtained in accordance with the terms of 
this Section 3.1(a). Loctite shall cause the Board to 
be expanded from ten to twelve members as soon as 
practicable after the Initial Recommended Persons are 
so approved (each Initial Recommended Person which is 
so approved, shall be referred to as an "Initial 
Approved Person"), and Loctite and the Henkel Entities 
shall cause the Initial Approved Persons to be duly and 
validly elected as Directors to fill the new board 
seats resulting from such expansion.

(b) From and after the expansion of the 
Board to twelve members pursuant to Section 3.1(a) 
hereof, Loctite agrees not to expand or reduce the size 
of the Board without the prior written consent of the 
Henkel Entities.

(c) From and after the election of the 
Initial Approved Persons pursuant to Section 3.1(a) 
hereof:

(i) Subject to Section 3.4 hereof, 
the Henkel Entities shall be entitled to recommend the 
number of persons to serve as Directors (each such 
person hereinafter referred to as a "Henkel Recommended 
Person") set forth in the immediately succeeding 
sentence. At any time that the Henkel Entities, 
together with the Henkel Affiliates, own, in the 
aggregate, 25% or more of the outstanding shares of 
Common Stock, the Henkel Entities shall be entitled to 
recommend three Henkel Recommended Persons; at any time 
that the Henkel Entities, together with the Henkel 
Affiliates, own, in the aggregate, less than 25% of the 
outstanding shares of Common Stock, but 15% or more of 
the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Henkel 
Entities shall be entitled to recommend two Henkel 
Recommended Persons; and at any time that the Henkel 
Entities, together with the Henkel Affiliates, own, in 
the aggregate, less than 15% of the outstanding shares 
of Common Stock, but 10% or more of the outstanding 
shares of Common Stock, the Henkel Entities shall be 
entitled to recommend one Henkel Recommended Person.

(ii) The Secretary of Loctite shall 
deliver written notice (the "Secretary Notice") to 
Henkel America no later than 30 days prior to any 
meeting of the Board at which the election of Directors 
is scheduled on the agenda for action by the Board, 
setting forth the date of such meeting. With respect 
to any Secretary Notice, Henkel America must deliver 
written notice to Loctite setting forth the Henkel 
Recommended Persons no later than 15 days after its 
receipt of such Secretary Notice.

(iii) Each Henkel Recommended 
Person shall be subject to the approval of a majority 
of all of the Directors, which approval shall not be 
unreasonably withheld; the parties hereto acknowledge 
that it is currently anticipated that such consent by 
the Directors would not be withheld unless such person 
is the Executive Vice President-Adhesives (or otherwise 
is an executive within the Adhesives division) of 
Henkel Germany (or another division or subdivision of 
Henkel Germany or its subsidiaries that may in the 
future engage in substantially the same activities as 
the Adhesives division of Henkel Germany engages in on 
the date hereof) or whose membership on the Board would 
be a violation of law. Notwithstanding anything herein 
to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be 
construed as limiting in any manner the Directors from 
exercising, in their business judgment, their fiduciary 
duties as Directors under applicable law in connection 
with their making a determination whether to approve an 
Initial Recommended Person selected by the Henkel 
Entities or any Henkel Recommended Person pursuant to 
Section 3.1(a) hereof or Section 3.1(c)(iii) hereof, as 
the case may be. If a Henkel Recommended Person is not 
approved as provided herein, then the Henkel Entities 
shall promptly recommend a substitute or substitutes 
until approval is obtained in accordance with the terms 
of this Section 3.1(c). Loctite shall include any 
Henkel Recommended Person that has been approved by a 
majority of all of the Directors in the slate of 
nominees recommended by the Board to Loctite's 
stockholders for election as Directors. Each Henkel 
Recommended Person who is duly and validly elected by 
the stockholders of Loctite to serve as a Director 
shall be referred to as a "Henkel Nominee." 

(d) From and after the election of the 
Initial Approved Persons pursuant to Section 3.1(a) 
hereof: 

(i) So long as there are any Henkel 
Nominees, the Outside Directors shall recommend the 
remaining persons (other than the Henkel Nominees) to 
serve as Directors (each such person shall be referred 
to as an "Outside Director Recommended Person").

(ii) Each Outside Director 
Recommended Person shall be subject to the approval of 
a majority of all of the Directors, which approval 
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If an Outside 
Director Recommended Person is not approved as provided 
herein, then the Outside Directors shall promptly 
recommend a substitute or substitutes until approval is 
obtained in accordance with the terms of this 
Section 3.1(d). Loctite shall include any Outside 
Director Recommended Person that has been approved by a 
majority of all of the Directors in the slate of 
nominees recommended by the Board to stockholders for 
election as Directors. Loctite shall ensure that at 
least one Outside Director Recommended Person so 
included in such slate shall be neither a nominee or 
representative of any Henkel Entity or any Henkel 
Affiliate nor an officer or employee of Loctite. Each 
Outside Director Recommended Person who is duly and 
validly 
<PAGE>
elected by the stockholders of Loctite to serve 
as a Director shall be referred to as a "Non-Henkel 
Nominee."

(e) Each Henkel Nominee and Non-Henkel 
Nominee shall hold his office until his death, 
retirement or resignation or until his successor shall 
have been duly elected and qualified. If any Henkel 
Nominee or Non-Henkel Nominee shall cease to serve as a 
Director, the vacancy resulting thereby shall be filled 
by another person recommended by the Henkel Entities or 
the Outside Directors, respectively, and approved in 
accordance with Section 3.1(c) or 3.1(d), respectively.

3.2 Committees. Subject to Sections 3.3 
and 3.4 hereof, (a) at least one Henkel Nominee shall 
be a member of any key committee of the Board that has 
up to four members on such key committee and (b) at 
least two Henkel Nominees shall be members of any key 
committee of the Board that has five or more members on 
such key committee.

3.3 Dissolution of Shareholder Relations 
Committee. Loctite shall cause the Shareholder 
Relations Committee of the Board to be dissolved 
effective as of the Record Date; provided, however, 
that Loctite retains the right to reconstitute a 
committee of Disinterested Directors (as defined below) 
or the Outside Directors, if in the opinion of the 
Disinterested Directors or Outside Directors, as 
applicable, a need for such a committee arises. The 
term "Disinterested Directors" means Directors who are 
neither officers or employees of Loctite nor any person 
proposing or attempting to effect a business 
combination or similar transaction with Loctite 
(including, without limitation, a merger, tender offer 
or exchange offer, sale of substantially all of 
Loctite's assets, or liquidation of Loctite's assets), 
any Affiliate or Associate (as defined in Rule 12b-2 
under the Exchange Act) of such person or any other 
person acting directly or indirectly on behalf of, or 
as a representative of, or in concert with, any such 
person, Affiliate or Associate.

3.4 Applicability. Notwithstanding 
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Loctite 
shall have no obligations, and the Henkel Entities 
shall have no rights (including, without limitation, 
the right of the Henkel Entities to recommend any 
person to serve as a Director), under Section 2.2.1(a) 
and this Section 3 from and after the time that the 
Henkel Entities, together with their respective 
Affiliates, own, in the aggregate, less than 10% of the 
outstanding shares of Common Stock.

4. Right of First Refusal. (a)(i) Upon 
receipt by Henkel America of a Seller's Notice (as 
defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement), Henkel 
America shall deliver to Loctite within three days of 
its receipt thereof: (A) a copy of such Seller's 
Notice and (B) written notice (a "Notice of 
Opportunity") setting forth (I) the date that Henkel 
America 
<PAGE>
received the Seller's Notice (the "Receipt 
Date") and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock 
offered for sale pursuant to the Seller's Notice (the 
"Offered Shares"); provided, however, that Henkel 
America need not deliver a Notice of Opportunity if it 
is permitted under Section 4(a)(ii) hereof to acquire 
all of the Offered Shares related to such Seller's 
Notice and, within such three day period, Henkel 
America shall have delivered a Henkel's Notice (as 
defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) exercising in 
full its right to acquire those Offered Shares under 
Section 7(b) of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Unless 
the Offered Shares have been purchased in accordance 
with the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, 
Henkel America shall deliver to Loctite within fifteen 
days of the Receipt Date (the "Henkel Time Period") 
written notice (a "Notice of Decision") setting forth 
whether Henkel America intends to exercise its right 
under Section 7(b) of the Stock Purchase Agreement to 
acquire the Offered Shares related to such Seller's 
Notice and, if so, subject to Section 4(a)(ii) hereof, 
the number of shares of Common Stock which Henkel 
America shall purchase pursuant to Section 7(b) of the 
Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Henkel Purchased 
Shares"). In connection with any Seller's Notice, if 
Henkel America fails to provide Loctite with a Notice 
of Decision within the Henkel Time Period or the Notice 
of Decision fails to set forth the Henkel Purchased 
Shares, the Henkel Purchased Shares shall be deemed to 
be zero. In connection with any Notice of Decision, 
Henkel America shall purchase, or cause Henkel 
Subsidiary to purchase, the Henkel Purchased Shares 
subject to such Notice of Decision in accordance with 
the terms and conditions set forth in Section 7(b) of 
the Stock Purchase Agreement.

(ii) Each of Henkel America and 
Henkel Subsidiary may only purchase shares of Common 
Stock pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Stock Purchase 
Agreement if, after giving effect to such purchase, no 
Henkel Entity is an Acquiring Person (as defined in the 
Rights Agreement).

(iii) In connection with any 
Seller's Notice, Henkel America hereby assigns to 
Loctite all of Henkel America's rights under 
Section 7(b) of the Stock Purchase Agreement with 
respect to the Loctite Purchasable Shares (as defined 
below) related to such Seller's Notice, effective as of 
the earlier of the (A) delivery to Loctite of the 
Notice of Decision related to such Seller's Notice and 
(B) if Henkel America fails to deliver such Notice of 
Decision, the expiration of the Henkel Time Period 
applicable to such Seller's Notice. In connection with 
any Seller's Notice, the term "Loctite Purchasable 
Shares" shall mean that number of shares equal to the 
difference, if any, between (A) the Offered Shares 
related to such Seller's Notice and (B) the Henkel 
Purchased Shares related to such Seller's Notice.

(b) In connection with any Seller's 
Notice, Loctite shall have the right, but not the 
obligation, to purchase any or all of the Loctite 
Purchasable Shares related to such 
<PAGE>
Seller's Notice by 
delivering written notice (the "Loctite Notice") to 
Henkel America and to the proposed seller of the 
Offered Shares to which such Seller's Notice relates no 
later than 30 days after the Receipt Date related to 
such Seller's Notice (the number of shares which 
Loctite agrees to purchase, as set forth in the Loctite 
Notice, shall hereinafter be referred to as the 
"Loctite Purchased Shares"), and Loctite shall purchase 
those Loctite Purchased Shares in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of Section 7(b) of the Stock 
Purchase Agreement.

(c) In connection with any Seller's 
Notice, if the number of shares equal to the 
difference, if any, between (i) the Offered Shares 
related to such Seller's Notice and (ii) the sum of 
(A) the Henkel Purchased Shares related to such 
Seller's Notice and (B) the Loctite Purchased Shares 
related to such Seller's Notice is equal to 3% or more 
of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, each of 
the Henkel Entities and Loctite shall use their 
respective reasonable best efforts to cause those 
shares to be distributed as widely as practicable (it 
being understood that none of the parties hereto shall 
have any obligation to purchase those shares); 
provided, however, that no Henkel Entity shall have any 
obligation to take any action pursuant to this 
Section 4(c) if such Henkel Entity reasonably 
determines that such action could require it to make 
any payment under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act if 
a suit for recovery were duly instituted against such 
Henkel Entity.

(d)(i) The Henkel Entities represent and 
warrant to Loctite that (A) except as set forth in 
Section 4(a) hereof, Henkel America has not granted, 
assigned, pledged or otherwise disposed of any rights 
under Section 7(b) of the Stock Purchase Agreement to 
any person or entity other than Henkel Subsidiary as 
set forth in the fourth recital of this Agreement and 
(B) a true, correct and complete copy of the Stock 
Purchase Agreement, as in effect on the date hereof, 
without amendment or modification, has been previously 
filed as an exhibit to the Schedule 13D of Henkel 
Subsidiary filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission under the Exchange Act.

(ii) Except as provided in 
Section 4(a) hereof, Henkel America shall not assign, 
pledge or otherwise dispose of any of its rights under 
Section 7(b) of the Stock Purchase Agreement and any 
attempted or purported assignment, pledge or other 
disposition in violation of this provision shall be 
void and of no effect.

(iii) Henkel America agrees not to 
amend, modify, waive, terminate or invalidate any 
provision of, or take any action or fail to take any 
action which would adversely affect its rights under, 
Section 7(b) of the Stock Purchase Agreement.

5. Registration Rights. On at least two 
occasions at the request of Henkel America, Loctite 
will prepare and file, and 
<PAGE>
use its best efforts to have 
made effective within six months from the receipt of 
such request, a registration statement on any available 
form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 
"1933 Act"), covering any equity securities of Loctite 
then owned by the Henkel Entities, at the expense of 
the Henkel Entities. In addition, any equity 
securities of Loctite owned by the Henkel Entities 
shall, at Henkel America's request, be included in any 
other registration statement covering Loctite equity 
securities (other than registration statements relating 
to an exchange offer, merger or consolidation by 
Loctite or any equity-based benefit or dividend 
reinvestment plan for directors, officers or employees 
of Loctite or its subsidiaries), the Henkel Entities to 
pay only any incremental expenses resulting from such 
inclusion. This Section 5 will not be operative if, in 
the opinion of counsel for Loctite with which counsel 
for Henkel America concurs, the Henkel Entities may 
dispose of their Loctite equity securities in the 
manner and to the person, persons or class of persons 
contemplated by them without registration under the 
1933 Act, including, without limitation, under Rule 144 
promulgated pursuant to the 1933 Act. In addition, 
Loctite will use its best efforts so that the Henkel 
Entities may sell their Loctite equity securities 
pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated pursuant to the 1933 
Act. In connection with any registration pursuant to 
this Section 5, Loctite and the Henkel Entities will 
enter into customary agreements relating to 
indemnification and other matters.

6. Henkel Transferees.

6.1 Permitted Transfers. (a) In 
connection with any proposed Permitted Transfer (as 
defined in the Rights Agreement) by Henkel America, 
Henkel America shall deliver to Loctite no later than 
30 days prior to the Transfer Date (as defined below) 
for such proposed Permitted Transfer (i) written notice 
of such proposed Permitted Transfer (the "Transfer 
Notice"), setting forth (A) the number of shares of 
Common Stock proposed to be transferred, (B) the 
identity of the proposed transferee (the "Proposed 
Transferee"), including the beneficial owners thereof 
to the extent known or reasonably determinable by 
Henkel America, and (C) the date on which the proposed 
Permitted Transfer is to be consummated (the "Transfer 
Date") and (ii) an agreement substantially in the form 
of Exhibit A-1 to the Rights Agreement, duly and 
validly executed on behalf of the Proposed Transferee 
(the "Transferee Agreement"). Upon receipt by Loctite 
of the Transferee Agreement duly executed and delivered 
by the Proposed Transferee, Loctite shall duly execute 
and deliver the Transferee Agreement.

(b) As soon as practicable after receipt 
of the Transfer Notice, the Outside Directors shall 
evaluate whether the Proposed Transferee is an Adverse 
Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement). Henkel 
America shall provide the Outside Directors with any 
information within its control requested by 
<PAGE>
them to facilitate their evaluation, as soon as practicable 
after any request for information is made.

(c) Subject to Section 6.1(d) hereof, a 
proposed Permitted Transfer may be consummated on the 
Transfer Date as set forth in the Transfer Notice and 
the Transferee Agreement related to such proposed 
Permitted Transfer unless the Outside Directors shall 
have determined that the Proposed Transferee related to 
such proposed Permitted Transfer is an Adverse Person 
no later than five days prior to the Transfer Date for 
such proposed Permitted Transfer; provided, that Henkel 
America complies with its obligations in 
Sections 6.1(a) and (b) hereof.

(d) With respect to any proposed Permitted 
Transfer, the Proposed Transferee shall be deemed to be 
an Adverse Person for purposes of the Rights Agreement 
unless there is at least one Director that is an 
Outside Director during the period from and including 
the date Loctite receives a Transfer Notice in respect 
of such proposed Permitted Transfer to and including 
the Transfer Date for such proposed Permitted Transfer. 
Except as required by applicable law or order of any 
court or other governmental authority, Loctite 
covenants and agrees that it will not take any action 
to cause there to be fewer than one Outside Director on 
the Board at any time.

6.2 Transferability. Notwithstanding 
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no 
transferee of any shares of Common Stock from any 
Henkel Entity shall have any rights under this 
Agreement.

6.3 Distribution Transaction. In 
connection with any Distribution Transaction (as 
defined in the Rights Agreement), Henkel shall use its 
best efforts to cause the shares of Common Stock 
subject to such Distribution Transaction to be 
distributed as widely as practicable.

7. Associates of Henkel Entities. (a) In 
the event that from time to time any of the Henkel 
Entities or Loctite becomes aware of the fact that the 
Henkel Entities, together with their respective 
Affiliates and Associates, beneficially own (as such 
term is used in the Rights Agreement without giving 
effect to the proviso to the definition of the term 
"Associate" in the Rights Agreement) a percentage of 
outstanding shares of Common Stock in excess of the 
Henkel Percentage (as defined in the Rights Agreement) 
then in effect, the Henkel Entities (if any of them 
becomes aware of such fact) shall promptly deliver to 
Loctite, or Loctite (if it becomes aware of such fact)

the percentage of outstanding shares of Common Stock 
beneficially owned by the Henkel Entities, together 
with their respective Affiliates and Associates, 
exceeds the Henkel Percentage and (ii) the date that 
such party became aware of such fact. As used herein, 
(A) the term "Excess 
<PAGE>
Percentage" shall mean the amount 
of the percentage of outstanding shares of Common Stock 
by which the aggregate percentage of outstanding shares 
of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Henkel 
Entities, together with their respective Affiliates and 
Associates (if and to the extent that any Henkel Entity 
has become aware of such ownership directly or pursuant 
to an Associate Notice delivered to the Henkel Entities 
by Loctite), exceeds the Henkel Percentage then in 
effect and (B) the term "Discovery Date" shall mean the 
date that any Henkel Entity becomes aware of the 
existence of an Excess Percentage or if Loctite first 
became aware of the existence of an Excess Percentage, 
the date that the Henkel Entities receive an Associate 
Notice from Loctite in connection therewith.

(b) From and after a Discovery Date and 
so long as the amount of the Excess Percentage is 
greater than zero, the Henkel Entities shall, and shall 
cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) vote with 
respect to any matter that percentage of outstanding 
shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Henkel 
Entities and their respective Affiliates equal to the 
Excess Percentage in the same proportion as all 
outstanding shares of Common Stock not beneficially 
owned by the Henkel Entities and their respective 
Affiliates and Associates are voted on such matter and 
(ii) tender into any tender or exchange offer (or 
otherwise sell to the person making such tender or 
exchange offer) for the shares of Common Stock that is

Common Stock and is held open for a period of at least 
60 days from its commencement, that percentage of 
outstanding shares of Common Stock beneficially owned

as all outstanding shares of Common Stock not 
beneficially owned by the Henkel Entities and their 
respective Affiliates and Associates are tendered in 
such tender or exchange offer.

actual or threatened violations of the obligations of 
any party subject to, this Agreement.

LOCTITE CORPORATION ANNOUNCES
SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND
AGREEMENT WITH HENKEL

Hartford, Connecticut
April 14, 1994

Loctite Corporation (NYSE and PSE: LOC) announced 
today that its Board of Directors has adopted a 
Shareholder Rights Plan designed to protect 
shareholders from various abusive takeover tactics, 
including attempts to acquire control of the Company at 
an inadequate price. The Company also announced that, 
in connection with its adoption of the Plan, the 
Company has entered into an agreement with its largest 
shareholder, Henkel Corporation (and its parent 
company, Henkel KGaA, and another Henkel affiliate) 
that replaces its existing Standstill Agreement with 
Henkel, which would have expired in May, 1995 and 
provides for, among other things, the sharing between 
Henkel and the Company of Henkel's right of first 
refusal on the Krieble family's shares of the Company's 
Common Stock under certain circumstances. The actions 
taken by the Company today were not in response to any 
effort to acquire control of the Company, and the Board 
is not aware of any such effort.
Commenting on the Board action, David Freeman, 
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company 
said, "The agreement entered into between Henkel and 
the Company and the adoption of the Shareholder Rights 
Plan are designed to ensure that all of the Company's 
shareholders realize the long-term value of their 
investment. Henkel's willingness to enter into a new 
arrangement with the Company exemplifies the productive 
relationship that has existed between the Company and 
Henkel over the past nine years."
<PAGE>
Under the Plan announced today, Henkel and its 
affiliates will have the ability to own up to 35% of 
the Company's outstanding Common Stock. Henkel and its 
affiliates currently own approximately 29.7% of the 
Company's outstanding Common Stock. The new agreement 
between Henkel and the Company provides, among other 
things, for the termination of the existing Standstill 
Agreement with Henkel, the enlargement of the size of 
the Board of Directors from 10 to the maximum of 12 
members currently permitted under the Company's 
Articles of Incorporation (with Henkel being entitled 
to recommend three Board nominees) and various 
mechanisms to ensure that the arrangement between the 
Company and Henkel set forth in the Henkel Agreement 
and the Plan will remain in place for 10 years. In 
addition, under the Henkel Agreement, Henkel's right of 
first refusal on the shares of the Company's Common 
Stock held by the Krieble family remains in effect. 
However, given the 35% cap under the Plan on Henkel's 
ownership of the Company's Common Stock, the Henkel 
Agreement provides that Henkel's right of first refusal 
is, in effect, shared with the Company with respect to 
those shares of Common Stock that Henkel is unable to 
purchase without triggering the Plan.
The Plan is designed to assure that any acquisition of 
the Company would take place under circumstances in 
which the Board of Directors can secure the best 
available transaction for all of the Company's 
shareholders. Under the Plan, each shareholder will 
receive a dividend of one Right for each share of the 
Company's outstanding common stock.
Initially, the Rights are attached to the Company's 
Common Stock and are not exercisable. They become 
detached from the Common Stock and become immediately 
exercisable after any person or group that is not a 
grandfathered stockholder becomes the beneficial owner 
of 10% or more of the Company's Common Stock or 10 days 
after any person or group announces a tender or 
exchange offer that would result in that same 
beneficial ownership level, other than pursuant to 
certain "Permitted Offers".
<PAGE>
If a buyer that is not a grandfathered stockholder 
becomes a 10% owner in the Company, all Rights holders 
except the buyer will be entitled to purchase the 
Company's stock at a price discounted from the then 
market price. If the Company is acquired in a merger 
after such an acquisition, all Rights holders except 
the buyer will also be entitled to purchase stock in 
the buyer at a discount in accordance with the Plan.
The Plan "grandfathers" from triggering the rights 
plan certain stockholders that currently own, or may in 
the future own, more than the 10% threshold, including 
Henkel, the Krieble family group and certain 
transferees of Common Stock from Henkel, from the 
Krieble family group and from other persons that 
satisfy certain requirements. The Plan provides 
generally that Henkel will cease to be a grandfathered 
stockholder if it owns more than 35% of the Company's 
outstanding Common Stock and any other grandfathered 
stockholder will cease to be exempt from triggering the 
rights plan if it acquires any additional shares of 
Common Stock.
The distribution of Rights will be made to common 
shareholders of record on April 25, 1994 and shares of 
common stock that are newly-issued after that date will 
also carry Rights until the Rights become detached form 
the common stock. The Rights will expire April 14, 
2004. The Company may redeem the Rights for $0.01 each 
at any time before a buyer acquires a 10% position in 
the Company, and under certain other circumstances. 
The Rights distribution is not taxable to stockholders.
Details of the Plan are included with a letter which 
will be mailed to all of the Company's stockholders.
