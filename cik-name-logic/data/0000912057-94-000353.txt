ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI NAMED TO MORRISON KNUDSEN BOARD OF DIRECTORS

BOISE -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced today that Zbigniew
Brzezinski, who served as National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter,
has been elected to the MK Board of Directors.

Brzezinski, who replaces the retiring Harold Anderson, was elected during
the regular quarterly meeting of the board.

"As MK continues its global expansion, I can think of no finer addition to
our already strong board of directors than Zbigniew Brzezinski," said William
J. Agee, the company's chairman and chief executive officer. "Mr. Brzezinski
brings a wealth of international experience to our board, both as a private
citizen and as a high-level representative of the U.S. government."

Brzezinski, who has been a member of MK's International Advisory Council
since 1989, presently is counselor to the Center for Strategic and International
Studies; and professor of American Foreign Policy at the Paul Nitze School of
Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C.

He served as National Security Advisor to President Carter from 1977 to
1981. In 1981, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his role in
the normalization of U.S.-Chinese relations and for his contributions to the
human rights and national security policies of the United States.

Brzezinski earned bachelor's and master's degrees from McGill University
and a Ph.D. from Harvard University.

Anderson, director and contributing editor of the Omaha World-Herald
Company, had served on the MK board since 1988.

Morrison Knudsen Corporation serves the world's construction,
transportation, environmental, industrial, and power markets as an engineer,
contractor and manufacturer, offering complete development, operations and
