COLUMBIA/HCA HEALTHCARE CORPORATION AND
MEDICAL CARE AMERICA COMPLETE MERGER

Louisville, KY and Dallas, TX, September 16, 1994 -- Columbia/HCA
Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:COL) and Medical Care America, Inc.
(NYSE:MRX) today announced that they have completed their previously
announced merger transaction.

Under terms of the merger, Medical Care shareholders will receive
0.7042 of a share of Columbia/HCA common stock for each share of Medical
Care common stock held. First Union National Bank of North Carolina has
been selected as exchange agent for the transfer. First Union expects to
promptly send to Medical Care shareholders the documents required for
exchanging their Medical Care stock certificates for Columbia/HCA
certificates. Medical Care shareholders should not submit their
certificates for transfer until they receive a letter of transmittal.

"Completing this merger enhances our position in many of the
communities we serve," said David T. Vandewater, Chief Operating Officer
of Columbia/HCA. "Medical Care's surgery centers offer an efficient
setting for the growing number of surgical procedures which can be
provided on an outpatient basis. This merger also improves the geographic
coverage and range of services offered by Columbia/HCA networks."

Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation is the nation's largest
healthcare services provider, with 195 acute-care and specialty hospitals,
and over 100 complementary outpatient healthcare facilities in 31 states,
