HASBRO, INC. ANNOUNCES EXPECTATIONS FOR
SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 1994

Pawtucket, RI (June 16, 1994) -- Hasbro, Inc. (HAS:ASE) today 
reported that it expects its second quarter revenues and earnings to 
be at levels lower than those of a year ago. For the second quarter 
of 1993, the Company reported revenues of $515,551,000 and net 
earnings of $27,150,000.

"We began our year on a positive note with respect to both 
revenues and earnings", said Alan G. Hassenfeld, Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer, "but at the same time we had indicated that our 
major retailers were continuing to move their orders toward the 
second half of the year, a condition which could negatively affect 
our first half. This is now happening."

He continued by stating that "For the second quarter, most of 
our international units are expected to grow from their level during 
the comparable period of 1993 in spite of being adversely impacted by 
the strengthened U.S. dollar. Domestically, we continue to see strong 
retail takeaway of many of our new and ongoing products. Data from 
several of our larger customers indicates their May year to date 
movement, in wholesale dollars, of our products is up almost 10% in 
comparison to 1993. However, with many retailers moving to more 
sophisticated inventory management techniques, this increase has not 
yet translated into new orders. We believe that this will mean that a 
greater percentage of their orders will be placed for immediate 
delivery during the second half of the year, specifically for 
shipment during the fourth quarter."

"Additionally, a comparison with 1993 is adversely impacted by 
the fact that revenues during the second quarter of last year were at 
record levels, in part due to the introduction of our Jurassic 
Park(TM) and Barney(R) products in mid-quarter. This year our new 
introductions are on a more traditional time-line of late second 
quarter or early third quarter. As a result, we now believe that our 
second quarter revenue shortfall could approach 15% and, because of 
the seasonality of our business, a decrease in revenues of this 
magnitude during a traditionally low revenue quarter could all but 
eliminate our net earnings for the quarter."

He further said "In announcing our first quarter results, we 
stated that this year would present us with significant challenges. 
Looking toward the remainder of the year, in spite of the adverse 
impact of the reduced volume in two major product lines, Barney and 
Jurassic Park, we believe that we will achieve a modest revenue and 
earnings growth during the second half, with most of it occurring 
during the fourth quarter. With much of our 1994 product to be 
introduced during the next several months we are continuing to commit 
to inventory at levels sufficient to support that growth. However, as 
we now expect only a modest revenue increase during the second half, 
we believe that our full year results could approximate those of a 
year ago."

Mr. Hassenfeld concluded by noting "With a number of new 
products and relationships under contract and development we are 
enthusiastic about 1995 and beyond and are confident that we will be 
able to continue our excellent track record of providing superior 
long-term shareholder return."
