would be automatically converted at the Effective Time of the Merger into
options to purchase shares of UPC Common Stock based on the Exchange Ratio.
Therefore, in the event and to the extent that there are any GSSC Stock Options
validly issued and outstanding at the time of Closing, such GSSC Stock Options
shall at the Effective Time of the Merger automatically, and without further
action on the part of anyone, be converted

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 13

<PAGE>
into options to purchase shares of UPC Common Stock on the same terms and
conditions attributable to the GSSC Stock Options to purchase shares of GSSC
Common Stock in effect as of the date of this Reorganization Agreement adjusted
in all respects by and in accordance with the Exchange Ratio (i.e. if an
existing GSSC Stock Option for the purchase of 10,000 shares of GSSC Common
Stock were exercisable at $22.375 per share of GSSC Common Stock and the
Exchange Ratio were 1.4206, then at the Effective Time of the Merger such
unexercised GSSC Stock Option would automatically convert into an option to
purchase 14,206 shares of UPC Common Stock at an exercise price of $15.75 per
share). As of the date of this Reorganization Agreement, GSSC has not
repurchased or accelerated the vesting period of any GSSC Stock Options other
than pursuant to the terms and conditions of the GSSC Key Employees Stock Plan,
nor will it repurchase or accelerate the purchase rights of any GSSC Stock
Options, and GSSC has not repurchased any shares of its capital stock. As of
the date of this Reorganization Agreement, there are no shares of GSSC Common
Stock held by GSSC as Treasury Stock, nor will there be any such shares at the
Effective Time of the Merger.

Effective Time of the Merger, each share of $.01 par value common stock of
INTERIM (the "INTERIM Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time of The Merger shall, by virtue of the Merger becoming
effective and without any further action on the part of anyone, be converted
into and become one share of the issued and outstanding common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) Conversion and Cancellation of Shares of
GSSC. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of $1.00 par value
common stock of GSSC (the "GSSC Common Stock") validly issued and outstanding

the right of the GSSC Record Holders to receive in exchange for their shares of
GSSC Common Stock, whole shares of UPC Common Stock and a cash payment in
settlement of any remaining fractional share of UPC Common Stock in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Section 3.1(e) and the Plan of Merger.

fractional share of UPC Common Stock deliverable by UPC or INTERIM to the GSSC

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 15

<PAGE>

The number of shares of UPC Common Stock to be exchanged for each share of GSSC
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger shall be based on an exchange ratio (the "Exchange Ratio") as
determined and set forth in this Section 3.1(e). The Exchange Ratio shall be
determined as follows:

(A) In the event the Current Market Price
Per Share of UPC Common Stock should be greater than or equal to
$24.00 per share of UPC Common Stock but less than or equal to $29.25
per share of UPC Common Stock (the "Primary Collar"), the Exchange
Ratio shall be fixed at 1.4206 shares of UPC Common Stock for each
share of GSSC Common Stock validly issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger;

(B) In the event the Current Market Price
Per Share of UPC Common Stock should be greater than $29.25 per share
of UPC Common Stock but less than or equal to $31.25 per share of UPC
Common Stock (the "Upper Secondary Collar"), the Exchange Ratio shall
be based on (a) a fixed price of $41.55 per share of GSSC Common Stock
divided by (b) the Current Market Price Per Share of UPC Common Stock
for each share of GSSC Common Stock validly issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger;

(C) In the event the Current Market Price
Per Share of UPC Common Stock should be greater than $31.25 per share
of UPC Common Stock (the "Ceiling"), the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed
at 1.3296 shares of UPC Common Stock for each share or GSSC Common
Stock validly issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger; provided, however, that UPC would have
the right to either deliver shares of UPC Common Stock based on the
fixed Exchange Ratio of 1.3296 or to terminate the
transaction;provided, however, should UPC elect to terminate the
transaction under this provision, GSSC shall have the unilateral right
to reinstate the transaction by accepting in exchange for each share
of GSSC Common Stock validly issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger that number of shares of UPC
Common Stock at the Current Market Price Per Share sufficient to equal
$41.55 per share of GSSC Common Stock;

(D) In the event the Current Market Price
Per Share of UPC Common Stock should be greater than or equal to
$22.00 per share of UPC Common Stock but less than $24.00 per share of
UPC Common Stock (the "Lower Secondary

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 16

<PAGE>
Collar"), the Exchange Ratio shall be based on (a) a fixed price of
$34.09 per share of GSSC Common Stock divided by (b) the Current
Market Price Per Share of UPC Common Stock for each share of GSSC
Common Stock validly issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger; and

(E) In the event the Current Market Price
Per Share of UPC Common Stock should be less than $22.00 per share of
UPC Common Stock (the "Floor"), the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at
1.5495 shares of UPC Common Stock for each share of GSSC Common Stock
validly issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger; provided, however, that subject to the terms and
provisions of Section 3.3 of this Reorganization Agreement, GSSC shall
have the right to either accept the fixed Exchange Ratio of 1.5495 or
terminate the transaction in accordance with the terms and provisions
of Section 3.3 of this Reorganization Agreement,provided, however,
that should GSSC elect to terminate the transaction under this
provision and the Current Market Price Per Share of UPC Common Stock
should be greater than or equal to $18.50, UPC shall have the
unilateral right to reinstate the transaction by delivering in
exchange for each share of GSSC Common Stock validly issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger
shares of UPC Common Stock based on that number of shares of UPC
Common Stock at the Current Market Price Per Share sufficient to equal
$34.09 per share of GSSC Common Stock.

The Exchange Ratio as determined in this Section 3.1(e) shall be based on an
aggregate of no more than 9,600,000 shares of GSSC Common Stock being validly
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger
and, for purposes of this paragraph, counting all unexercised GSSC Stock
Options issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger as issued and outstanding shares of GSSC Common Stock so converted and
exchanged; provided, however, that no fractional shares of UPC Common Stock
shall be issued and if, after aggregating all of the shares of UPC Common Stock
to which a GSSC Record Holder is entitled based upon the Exchange Ratio, there
shall be a fractional share of UPC Common Stock remaining, such fractional
share shall be settled by a cash payment therefor pursuant to the Mechanics of
Payment of the Consideration set forth in Section 3.1(f) hereof, which shall be
calculated based upon the Current Market Price Per Share of one (1) full share
of UPC Common Stock.

(1) DEFINITION OF "CURRENT MARKET PRICE
PER SHARE." The "Current Market Price Per Share" shall be the

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 17

<PAGE>
average closing price per share of the "last" real time trades (i.e.,
closing price) of the UPC Common Stock on the NYSE (as published in
The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition) for each of the twenty (20)
NYSE general market trading days on which the NYSE was open for
business next preceding the issuance of all necessary Regulatory
Approvals (the "Pricing Period"). In the event the UPC Common Stock
should not trade on one or more of the trading days during the Pricing
Period (a "No Trade Date"), any such No Trade Date shall be
disregarded in computing the average closing price per share of UPC
Common Stock and the average shall be based upon the "last" real time
trades and number of days on which the UPC Common Stock actually
traded during the Pricing Period.

(2) EFFECTS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS ON THE
EXCHANGE RATIO. The Exchange Ratio shall be unaffected by appraisal
rights as granted under Delaware law because the GSSC Common Stock is
listed for trading on the NASDAQ National Market System, which is a
"national securities exchange" as defined in rules promulgated by the
SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act, and therefore, pursuant to Delaware Code
Section 8-503-262, no GSSC Record Holder may assert appraisal rights
in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated in this
Reorganization Agreement.

(3) EFFECT OF STOCK SPLITS, REVERSE STOCK
SPLITS, STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SIMILAR CHANGES IN THE CAPITAL OF GSSC OR
UPC. Should GSSC or UPC effect any stock splits, reverse stock
splits, stock dividends or similar changes in their respective capital
accounts subsequent to the date of this Reorganization Agreement but
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted in such a manner as the Board of Directors of UPC shall deem
in good faith to be fair and reasonable in order to give effect to
such changes subject to GSSC's Board of Directors' approval.

(f) Mechanics of Payment of Consideration. As
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no more than five (5) Business
Days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Corporate Trust Department of
Union Planters National Bank, Memphis, Tennessee (the "Exchange Agent") shall
deliver to each of the GSSC Record Holders such materials and information
deemed necessary by the Exchange Agent to advise the GSSC Record Holders of the
procedures required for proper surrender of their certificates evidencing and
representing shares of the GSSC Common Stock in order for the GSSC Record
Holders to receive the Consideration. Such materials shall include, without
limitation, a Letter of Transmittal, an Instruction Sheet, and a return

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 18

<PAGE>
mailing envelope addressed to the Exchange Agent (collectively the "Stockholder
Materials"). All Stockholder Materials shall be sent by United States mail to
the GSSC Record Holders at the addresses set forth on a certified stockholder
list to be delivered by GSSC to UPC at the Closing (the "Stockholder List") and
shall also be made available at the Corporate Trust Department offices of the
Exchange Agent. As soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the GSSC Record
Holders of all of the outstanding shares of GSSC Common Stock, shall be
requested by the Exchange Agent to deliver, or cause to be delivered, by United
States Postal Service, hand delivery or any other means of delivery selected by
such GSSC Record Holders, to the Exchange Agent, pursuant to the Stockholder
Materials, the certificates formerly evidencing and representing all of the
shares of GSSC Common Stock which were validly issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and the Exchange Agent
shall take prompt action to process such certificates formerly evidencing and
representing shares of GSSC Common Stock received by it (including the prompt
return of any defective submissions with instructions as to those actions which
may be necessary to remedy any defects). Upon receipt of the proper submission
of the certificate(s) formerly representing and evidencing ownership of the
shares of GSSC Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall, on or prior to the 30th
day after the Effective Time of the Merger but as soon as practicable mail, to
the former GSSC Record Holders in exchange for the certificate(s) surrendered
by them, the Consideration to be delivered for each such GSSC Record Holder's
shares of GSSC Common Stock evidenced by the certificate or certificates which
were cancelled and converted exclusively into the right to receive the
Consideration upon the Merger becoming effective. After the Effective Time of
the Merger and until properly surrendered to the Exchange Agent, each
outstanding certificate or certificates which formerly evidenced and
represented the shares of GSSC Common Stock of a GSSC Record Holder, subject to
the provisions of this Section, shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to
represent and evidence only the right to receive the Consideration into which
such GSSC Record Holder's shares of GSSC Common Stock were converted and
aggregated at the Effective Time of the Merger. Unless and until the
outstanding certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger evidenced and represented the GSSC Record Holder's
GSSC Common Stock shall have been properly surrendered as provided above, the
Consideration payable to the GSSC Record Holder(s) of the cancelled shares as
of any time after the Effective Date shall not be delivered to the GSSC Record
Holder(s) of such certificate(s) until such certificates shall have been
surrendered in the manner required. Each GSSC Record Holder shall be
responsible for all federal, state and local taxes which may be incurred by
such holder on account of the receipt of any

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 19

<PAGE>
Consideration. The GSSC Record Holder(s) of any certificate(s) which shall
have been lost or destroyed may nevertheless, subject to the provisions of this
Section, receive the Consideration to which each such GSSC Record Holder is
entitled, provided that each such GSSC Record Holder shall deliver to UPC and
to the Exchange Agent: (i) a sworn statement certifying the fact of such loss
or destruction and specifying the circumstances thereof and (ii) a lost
instrument bond in form satisfactory to UPC and the Exchange Agent which has
been duly executed by a corporate surety satisfactory to UPC and the Exchange
Agent, indemnifying the Surviving Corporation, UPC, the Exchange Agent (and
their respective successors) to their satisfaction against any loss or expense
which any of them may incur as a result of such lost or destroyed certificates
being thereafter presented. Any costs or expenses which may arise from such
replacement procedure, including the premium on the lost instrument bond, shall
be for the account of the GSSC Record Holder.

(g) Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time
of the Merger, the stock transfer books of GSSC shall be closed and no transfer
of shares of GSSC Common Stock shall be made thereafter.

(h) Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time
of the Merger, the separate existence of INTERIM shall cease, and INTERIM shall
be merged with and into GSSC which, as the Surviving Corporation, shall
thereupon and thereafter possess all of the assets, rights, privileges,
appointments, powers, licenses, permits and franchises of GSSC and INTERIM,
whether of a public or a private nature, and shall be subject to all of the
liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of both GSSC and INTERIM.

(i) Transfer of Assets. At the Effective Time of
the Merger, all rights, assets, licenses, permits, franchises and interests of
GSSC and INTERIM in and to every type of property, whether real, personal, or
mixed, whether tangible or intangible and wherever located, and to choses in
action shall be deemed to be vested in GSSC as the Surviving Corporation by
virtue of the Merger becoming effective and without any deed or other
instrument or act of transfer whatsoever.

(j) Assumption of Liabilities. At the Effective
Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall become and be liable for
all debts, liabilities, obligations and contracts of GSSC as well as those of
INTERIM, whether the same shall be matured or unmatured; whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise; and whether or not reflected or reserved
against in the balance sheets, other financial statements, books of account or
records of GSSC or INTERIM.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 20

<PAGE>
(k) Appraisal Rights of GSSC Stockholders.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 8-503-262 of the Delaware Code, GSSC
Stockholders shall not be entitled to assert appraisal rights in connection
with the Merger or to seek those appraisal remedies afforded by the Delaware
Code because the GSSC Common Stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ,
National Market System which is a "national securities exchange" as defined in
rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act, and therefore, pursuant
to Delaware Code Section 8-503-262, no GSSC Record Holder may assert appraisal
rights in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated in this
Reorganization Agreement.

(l) Reservation, Registration and Listing of
shares of UPC Common Stock. UPC shall reserve for issuance, register under the
applicable Securities Laws and apply for listing for trading on the NYSE a
sufficient number of shares of UPC Common Stock for the purpose of issuing
shares of UPC Common Stock to (i) the GSSC Record Holders in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Section 3.1 and (ii) the holders of
outstanding GSSC Stock Options issued under the terms of the GSSC Key Employees
Stock Plan.

3.2 Time and Place of Closing. The Closing shall take
place at 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day next preceding the date on which the
Effective Time of the Merger is expected to occur, or at such other time as the
Parties, acting through their chief executive officers, presidents or chief
financial officers, may mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). The place of
Closing shall be at the Union Planters Administrative Center, Union Planters
Corporation Executive Offices (Fourth Floor), 7130 Goodlett Farms Parkway,
Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee 38018. The Closing may be held at such other
time and place as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties.

3.3 Price Based Termination. This Reorganization
Agreement may be terminated by GSSC without penalty, if the GSSC Board of
Directors so determines by a majority vote, if (a) the Current Market Price Per
Share of UPC Common Stock should be less than $18.50; or (b) should both of the
following conditions be satisfied:

(i) The Current Market Price Per Share of a share of UPC Common
Stock shall be less than $22.00; and

(ii) (A) The number obtained by dividing the Current Market Price
Per Share of UPC Common Stock by $26.75 (the closing price per share of UPC
Common Stock, as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape reporting
system on June 30, 1994), shall be less than (B) the number obtained by
dividing the average of the

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 21

<PAGE>
Index Price (as defined below) for the Pricing Period by the Index Price on
June 30, 1994 (the last NYSE trading day immediately preceding the date of the
first public announcement of entry by the Parties into this Reorganization
Agreement) and subtracting 0.10 from the quotient in this clause (B); subject,
however, to the following three sentences.

In the event GSSC should elect to exercise its termination right
pursuant to the foregoing, it must give prompt written notice to UPC. Upon the
proper receipt of such notice, UPC shall (provided the Current Market Price Per
Share of UPC Common Stock is greater than or equal to $18.50) have the option
to increase the Consideration to be received by the GSSC Record Holders in the
Merger by adjusting the Exchange Ratio to equal the number (calculated to the
nearest one one-hundredth) obtained by dividing $34.09 (being the product of
$22.00 and the Exchange Ratio) by the Current Market Price Per Share of UPC
Common Stock (the "Maximum Exchange Ratio"). If UPC should so elect, it must
give prompt written notice to GSSC of such election and the adjusted Exchange
Ratio, whereupon no termination will be deemed to have occurred, and this
Reorganization Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

For purposes of this provision of this Reorganization Agreement, the following
definitions shall apply:

"Index Group" means the fifteen (15) companies listed on Schedule 3.3
to this Reorganization Agreement. In the event that the common stock of any
such company should cease to be publicly traded or should a proposal to acquire
any such company be announced after June 30, 1994, such company shall be
removed from the Index Group.

"Index Price," on a given date, means the average of the closing
prices on such date of the common stocks of the companies comprising the Index
Group.

Prior to making any decision to terminate this Reorganization
Agreement, the GSSC Board of Directors shall consult with its financial and
other advisers and shall consider all financial and other information it should
deem relevant to its decision. The matter would not, however, be resubmitted
to the GSSC Record Holders after the GSSC Stockholder Meeting.

prospects of UPC and all UPC Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (iii) have in
effect all federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorizations,

(b) The execution and delivery of this
Reorganization Agreement and the Plan of Merger, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the fulfillment of the terms
hereof and thereof will not result in a violation or breach of any of the terms
or provisions of, or constitute a default under (or an event which, with the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default
under), or conflict with, or permit the acceleration of any obligation under,
any material mortgage, lease, covenant, agreement, indenture or other
instrument to which UPC, INTERIM or any material UPC Subsidiary is a party or
by which they or their property or any of their assets are bound; the corporate
Charter and Bylaws of UPC or the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of

4.3 No Legal Bar. Neither UPC nor INTERIM is a party to,
subject to or bound by any agreement, judgment, letter of understanding, order,
writ, prohibition, injunction or decree of any court or other governmental body
of competent jurisdiction or any law which would prevent the execution of this
Reorganization Agreement and the Plan of Merger by UPC or INTERIM, their
delivery to GSSC, SBM and SBL or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and no action or proceeding is pending against
UPC or INTERIM in which the validity of this Reorganization Agreement or the
Plan of Merger, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
action which has been taken by any of the Parties in connection herewith or
therewith or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby is at issue.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 24

<PAGE>
4.4 Government and Shareholder Approvals. No consent,
approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing
with, any federal, state or local governmental authority is required to be made
or obtained by UPC or INTERIM in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Reorganization Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by UPC or INTERIM, except for the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve of the Merger under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (collectively, the "Government Approval"). Neither UPC nor INTERIM is
aware of any facts, circumstances or reasons why such Government Approval
should not be forthcoming or which would prevent such approval from being
obtained. The transactions contemplated in this Reorganization Agreement,
including, but not limited to, the Merger and the issuance of shares of UPC
Common Stock by UPC is subject to approval of at least a majority of the UPC
Shareholders.

4.5 Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of
UPC consists of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock having no par value (the
"UPC Preferred Stock"), and 50,000,000 shares of common stock having a par
value of $5.00 per share (the "UPC Common Stock"). As of June 30, 1994, UPC
had issued and outstanding: 44,000 shares of $8.00 Nonredeemable Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B; 690,000 shares of 10-3/8% Increasing
Rate, Redeemable, Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C; 253,655 shares of 9.5%
Redeemable, Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D; and 3,107,922 shares of 8%
Cumulative, Convertible Preferred Stock, Series E. In addition, 250,000 shares
of UPC Preferred Stock have been reserved for issuance as Series A Preferred
Stock pursuant to the UPC Share Purchase Rights Agreement dated July 19, 1989,
between UPC and Union Planters National Bank as Rights Agent (the "UPC Share

any GSSC Subsidiary is bound to issue (other than to GSSC) any additional
shares of its capital stock or options, warrants, or rights to purchase or
acquire any additional shares of its capital stock. All of the shares of
capital stock of each GSSC Subsidiary held by GSSC or by any GSSC Subsidiary

there is no action, suit or proceeding pending against GSSC or any GSSC
Subsidiary, or to the best knowledge of GSSC, SBM or SBL threatened against or
affecting GSSC, any GSSC Subsidiary or any of their assets, before any court or
arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official (i) that would, if
decided against GSSC or the GSSC Subsidiary, have a material adverse impact on
the business, properties, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or other)
or prospects of GSSC, SBM or SBL taken as a whole and that are not reflected in
the Audited Financial Statements of GSSC or (ii) by or on behalf of any

means that of the directors and officers of GSSC and all GSSC Subsidiaries and
includes their actual knowledge as well as that which could have been obtained

Property to any liability, either directly or indirectly, under the principles
of law as set forth in United States v. Fleet Factors Corp., 901 F.2d 1550
(11th Cir. 1990).

contract is in default with respect to any material term or condition thereof,
nor has any event occurred which, through the passage of time or the giving of
notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder or would cause the
acceleration of any obligation of any party thereto. Neither GSSC nor any GSSC

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 44

<PAGE>

would not have a material adverse effect on the business or operations of GSSC
and the GSSC Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and GSSC and each GSSC Subsidiary
have withheld and paid to the appropriate governmental authorities or are
holding for payment not yet due to such authorities, all amounts required to be

for any arrears of wages, taxes, penalties or other sums for failure to comply
with any of the foregoing. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.17, there is no:
unfair labor practice complaint against GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary pending
before the National Labor Relations Board or any state or local agency; pending
labor strike or other labor trouble affecting GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary;
labor grievance pending against GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary; pending
representation question respecting the employees of GSSC or any GSSC
Subsidiary; pending arbitration proceedings arising out of or under any
collective bargaining agreement to which GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary is a
party, or to the best knowledge of GSSC, any basis for which a claim may be
made under any collective bargaining agreement to which GSSC or any GSSC
Subsidiary is a party.

5.18 Records and Documents. The Records of SBM are and
will be sufficient to enable SBM to continue conducting its business as a
Mississippi state banking corporation under similar standards as SBM has
heretofore conducted such business. The Records of SBL are and will be
sufficient to enable SBL to continue conducting its business as a Louisiana
state banking corporation under similar standards as SBL has heretofore
conducted such business.

of GSSC consists of 15,000,000 shares of common stock having a par value of
$1.00 per share (the "GSSC Common Stock"), no shares of preferred stock (the

GSSC as treasury stock and no shares of GSSC Preferred Stock were issued and

preemptive rights of any GSSC Stockholder. Except as described in Section 2.7
of this Reorganization Agreement or as described on Schedule 5.19 hereto, as of
the date hereof, there are no outstanding securities or other obligations which
are convertible into GSSC Common Stock or into any other equity or debt
security of GSSC, and there are no outstanding options, warrants, rights,
scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls or other commitments of any nature which
would entitle the holder, upon exercise thereof, to be issued GSSC Common Stock
or any other equity or debt security of GSSC. Accordingly, immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger, there will be not more than 9,600,000
shares of GSSC Common Stock issued and outstanding. Except as set forth in
Schedule 5.19 hereto, GSSC owns and is the beneficial and record holder of, and
has good and freely transferable title to, all of the 3,465,440 shares of SBM
Common Stock outstanding, and recorded on the books and Records of SBM as being
held in its name, free and clear of all liens, charges or encumbrances, and
such stock is not subject to any voting trusts, agreements or similar
arrangements or other claims which could affect the ability of GSSC to freely
vote such stock in support of the transactions contemplated herein. Except as
set forth in Schedule 5.19 hereto, GSSC owns and is the beneficial and record
holder of, and has good and freely transferable title to, all of the 5,000,000
shares of SBL Common Stock outstanding, and recorded on the books and Records
of SBL as being held in its name, free and clear of all liens, charges or
encumbrances, and such stock is not subject to any voting trusts, agreements or
similar arrangements or other claims which could affect the ability of GSSC to
freely vote such stock in support of the transactions contemplated herein.

SBL nor any Subsidiary of any of them has been or is a party to: any letter of
intent or agreement to merge, to consolidate, to sell or purchase assets (other
than in the normal course of its business) or to any other agreement which
contemplates the involvement of GSSC, SBM or SBL or any Subsidiary of either
(or any of their assets) in any business combination of any kind; or any
agreement obligating GSSC, SBM or SBL to issue or sell or authorize the sale or
transfer of GSSC Common Stock or the capital stock of SBM or SBL. Except as
described in Schedule 5.20 hereto, there are no (nor will there be at the
Effective Time of the Merger any) shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of GSSC outstanding, except for shares of GSSC Common Stock
presently issued and outstanding, and there are no (nor will there be at the
Effective Time of the Merger any) outstanding options, warrants, scrip, rights

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 46

<PAGE>
exchangeable for, shares of the capital stock of GSSC, SBM or SBL, or
contracts, commitments, understandings, or arrangements by which GSSC, SBM or
SBL is or may be bound to issue additional shares of their capital stock or
options, warrants, or rights to purchase or acquire any additional shares of
their capital stock. There are no (nor will there be at the Effective Time of
the Merger any) contracts, commitments, understandings, or arrangements by
which GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary is or may be bound to transfer or issue to
any third party any shares of the capital stock of any GSSC Subsidiary, and
there are no (nor will there be at the Effective Time of the Merger any)
contracts, agreements, understandings or commitments relating to the right of
GSSC to vote or to dispose of any such shares.

5.21 Disclosure. The information concerning, and
representations and warranties made by, GSSC, SBM and SBL set forth in this
Reorganization Agreement, or in the schedules of GSSC hereto, or in any
document, statement, certificate or other writing furnished or to be furnished
by GSSC, SBM or SBL to UPC and INTERIM pursuant hereto, does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit and will not omit to state a
material fact required to be stated herein or therein necessary to make the
statements and facts contained herein or therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were or are made, not false or misleading. Copies of all
documents heretofore or hereafter delivered or made available to UPC or INTERIM
by GSSC, SBM or SBL pursuant hereto were or will be complete and accurate
copies of such documents.

5.22 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as described
in Schedule 5.22 hereto, to the best of the knowledge, information and belief
of GSSC, SBM and SBL neither GSSC nor any GSSC Subsidiary has any obligation or
liability (contingent or otherwise) that is material to the financial condition
or operations of GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary, or that, when combined with all
similar obligations or liabilities, would be material to the financial
condition or operations of GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary (i) except as disclosed
in the Audited Financial Statements of GSSC delivered to UPC prior to the date
of this Reorganization Agreement or (ii) except obligations or liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of its business consistent with past practices
or (iii) except as contemplated under this Reorganization Agreement and the
schedules of GSSC hereto. Since December 31, 1993, neither GSSC nor any GSSC
Subsidiary has incurred or paid any obligation or liability which would be
material to the financial condition or operations of GSSC or such GSSC
Subsidiary, except for obligations paid by GSSC, SBM or SBL under the terms of
this Reorganization Agreement (all such obligations or payments are fully
described by GSSC in Schedule 5.22 hereto) or in connection with transactions
made by

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 47

<PAGE>
it in the ordinary course of its business consistent with past practices, laws
and regulations applicable to GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary.

5.23 Allowance for Possible Loan or ORE Losses. To the
best of the knowledge, information and belief of GSSC, SBM and SBL, the
allowance for possible loan losses shown on the Audited Financial Statements of
GSSC is (with respect to periods ended on or before December 31, 1993) or will
be (with respect to periods ending subsequent to December 31, 1993) adequate in
all respects to provide for anticipated losses inherent in Loans outstanding or
for commitments to extend credit or similar off-balance- sheet items (including
accrued interest receivable) as of the dates thereof.

The allowance for possible losses on other real estate ("ORE") shown
on the Audited Financial Statements of GSSC is (with respect to periods ended
on or before December 31, 1993) or will be (with respect to periods ending
subsequent to December 31, 1993) adequate in all respects to provide for
anticipated losses inherent in ORE owned or held by GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary
and the net book value of ORE on the Balance Sheet of the Audited Financial
Statements of GSSC is the fair value of the ORE determined in accordance with
Statement of Position 92-3.

5.24 Compliance with Laws. GSSC and each GSSC Subsidiary:

(a) To the best of the knowledge, information and
belief of the management of GSSC and each GSSC Subsidiary, is in compliance
with all laws, rules, regulations, reporting and licensing requirements, and
orders applicable to its business or employees conducting its business
(including, but not limited to, those relating to consumer disclosure and
currency transaction reporting) the breach or violation of which would or could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or operations of GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary, or which would or could
reasonably be expected to subject GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary or any of its
directors or officers to civil money penalties; and

(b) Has received no notification or communication
from any agency or department of federal, state, or local government or any of
the Regulatory Authorities, or the staff thereof (i) asserting that GSSC or any
GSSC Subsidiary is not in compliance with any of the statutes, rules,
regulations, or ordinances which such governmental authority or Regulatory
Authority enforces, which, as a result of such noncompliance, would result in a
material adverse impact on GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary, (ii) threatening to
revoke any license, franchise, permit, or governmental authorization which is
material to the

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 48

<PAGE>
financial condition or operations of GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary, or (iii)
requiring GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary to enter into a cease and desist order,
consent, agreement, or memorandum of understanding.

5.25 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) GSSC has previously provided to UPC true and
complete copies of each "employee pension benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") which, to
the best of its knowledge, is subject to any provision of ERISA and covers any
employee, whether active or retired, of GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary or any
other entity which is a member of a controlled group or is under common control
with GSSC or its Subsidiaries in the manner defined and further described in
Section 414(b), (c), or (m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Such plans are
hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Employee Pension Benefit Plans",
and each such Employee Pension Benefit Plan is listed in Schedule 5.25(a)
hereto. GSSC has also provided to UPC true and complete copies of all trust
agreements, collective bargaining agreements, and insurance contracts related
to such Employee Pension Benefit Plans.

To the best knowledge of GSSC and its Subsidiaries,
each Employee Pension Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is so qualified and each trust
forming a part thereof is exempt from tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Copies of the latest determination letters concerning
the qualified status of each Employee Pension Benefit Plan which is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code have been
provided to UPC. Requests for determination letters relating to amendments
required to cause such Employee Pension Benefit Plans to be in compliance with
the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, the Deficit Reduction Act
of 1984 and the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 were timely filed and have been
received by GSSC and its Subsidiaries. Requests for determination letters
relating to any subsequent amendments to such plans which are currently pending
have been provided to UPC. All such requests were timely and properly filed
and appropriate notice of any such filing was timely and properly provided to
affected plan participants and beneficiaries.

To the best of the knowledge, information and belief
of GSSC, SBM and SBL, each of the Employee Pension Benefit Plans has been
operated in substantial conformity with the written provisions of the
applicable plan documents which have been delivered to UPC and in substantial
compliance with the

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 49

<PAGE>
requirements prescribed by all statutes, orders, rules, and regulations
including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, which are
applicable to such Employee Pension Benefit Plans. To the extent that the
operation of an Employee Pension Benefit Plan has deviated from the written
provisions of the plan, such operational deviations have been disclosed in
Schedule 5.25(a) hereto. All such deviations have been made in conformity with
applicable laws, including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.

With respect to Employee Pension Benefit Plans which
are subject to the annual report requirement of ERISA Section 103 or to the
annual return requirement of Internal Revenue Code Section 6047, all required
annual reports and annual returns, or such other documents as may have been
required as alternative means of compliance with the annual report requirement,
have been timely filed. Copies of all such annual returns/reports, including
all attachments and Schedules, for the three (3) plan years immediately
preceding the current date have been delivered to UPC. With respect to
Employee Pension Benefit Plans which complied with the annual return
requirement by satisfaction of an alternate compliance method, any documents
required to be filed with the Department of Labor in satisfaction of such
requirements have been provided to UPC.

With respect to all Employee Pension Benefit Plans
which are subject to the summary plan description requirement of ERISA Section
102, all such summary plan descriptions as were required to be filed with the
Department of Labor and distributed to participants and beneficiaries have been
timely filed and distributed. Copies of all such summary plan descriptions
have been delivered to UPC. No Employee Pension Benefit Plan constitutes a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.

No Employee Pension Benefit Plan subject to Part III
of Subtitle B of ERISA or Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code, or both,
has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of Internal
Revenue Code Section 412, whether or not waived. All required contributions to
all Employee Pension Benefit Plans have been timely made. Any penalties or
taxes which have been incurred by GSSC or its Subsidiaries or by any Employee
Pension Benefit Plan with respect to the timing or amount of payment of any
contribution to an Employee Pension Benefit Plan have been timely paid. The
limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section 415 have not been exceeded with
respect to any Employee Pension Benefit Plan or combination of such plans to
which such limitations apply.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 50

<PAGE>
No "reportable event" (as described in Section
4043(b) of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Employee Pension Benefit
Plan. No Employee Pension Benefit Plan or any trust created thereunder, nor
any "disqualified person" with respect to the plan (as defined in Section 4975
of the Internal Revenue Code), has engaged in a "prohibited transaction", as
such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could
subject such Employee Pension Benefit Plan, any such trust or any such
disqualified person (other than a person for whom neither GSSC nor any GSSC
Subsidiary is directly or indirectly responsible) to liability under Title I of
ERISA or to the imposition of any tax under Section 4975 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

No condition exists with regard to any Employee
Pension Benefit Plan which constitutes grounds for the termination of such plan
pursuant to Section 4042 of ERISA.

The fair market value of the assets of any Employee
Pension Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA (excluding for these
purposes any accrued but unpaid contributions) exceeded the present value of
all benefits accrued under any such plan, determined on a termination basis
using the assumptions established by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
as in effect on such date. Neither GSSC nor its Subsidiaries have incurred any
liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the termination
of, or complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously
covered by Title IV of ERISA. The termination of any Internal Revenue Code
Section 401(a) qualified Employee Pension Benefit Plan previously terminated by
GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary did not adversely affect the qualification of such
Employee Pension Benefit Plan. The distribution of the assets of any such
Employee Pension Benefit Plan was made or is currently being made in conformity
with the requirements of that Employee Pension Benefit Plan and of applicable
legal requirements and has not resulted in, will not result in, and is
reasonably not anticipated to result in the assessment of any tax, penalty, or
excise tax against such pension plan, its related trusts, the fiduciary and
administrators of the Employee Pension Benefit Plan, GSSC or its Subsidiaries,
or any disqualified person (as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 4975)
with respect to the Employee Pension Benefit Plan.

Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(a) hereto, all
Employee Pension Benefit Plans were in effect for substantially all of calendar
year 1993. There has been no material amendment of any such plans (other than
amendments required to comply with applicable law) or material increase in the
cost of maintaining such plans or providing benefits

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 51

<PAGE>
thereunder on or after the last day of the plan year which ended in calendar
year 1993 for each such Employee Pension Benefit Plan.

GSSC has provided to UPC copies of the annual
actuarial valuation or allocation report for each Employee Pension Benefit Plan
for the three (3) plan years for such plan immediately preceding the current
date. With regard to Employee Pension Benefit Plans which are not intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, copies of
financial statements or reports containing information regarding the expense of
maintaining any such Employee Pension Benefit Plan for the three (3) plan years
preceding the current date have been delivered to UPC.

(b) GSSC has furnished to UPC true and complete copies of
each "Employee Welfare Benefit Plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA,
which, to the best of its knowledge, is subject to any provision of ERISA and
covers any employee, whether active or retired, of GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary
or members of a controlled group or entities under common control with GSSC or
its Subsidiaries in the manner defined and further described in Section 414(b),
(c), or (m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Such plans are hereinafter referred
to collectively as the "Employee Welfare Benefit Plans", and each such Employee
Welfare Benefit Plan is listed in Schedule 5.25(b) hereto.

GSSC has also provided to UPC true and complete
copies of documents establishing all funding instruments for such Employee
Welfare Benefit Plans, including but not limited to, trust agreements,
cafeteria plans (pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 125), and voluntary
employee beneficiary associations (pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section
501(c)(9)). Each of the Employee Welfare Benefit Plans has been operated in
substantial conformity with the written provisions of the plan documents which
have been delivered to UPC and in compliance with the requirements prescribed
by all statutes, orders, rules, and regulations including, but not limited to,
ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, which are applicable to such Employee
Welfare Benefit Plans. Any deviation in the operation of such plans from the
requirements of the plan documents or of applicable laws have been listed in
Schedule 5.25(b) hereto. GSSC has provided any notification required by law to
any participant covered under any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan which has
failed to comply with the requirements of any Internal Revenue Code section
which results in the imposition of a tax on benefits provided to such
participants under such plan.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 52

<PAGE>
With respect to all Employee Welfare Benefit Plans
which are subject to the annual report requirement of ERISA Section 103 or to
the annual return requirement of Internal Revenue Code Section 6039D, all
annual reports and annual returns as were required to be filed pursuant to such
sections have been timely filed. Copies of all such annual returns/reports,
including all attachments and Schedules, for the three (3) plan years
immediately preceding the current date for all plans subject to such
requirements have been delivered to UPC. With respect to all Employee Welfare
Benefit Plans which are subject to the summary plan description requirement of
ERISA Section 102, all such summary plan descriptions as were required to be
filed with the Department of Labor and distributed to participants and
beneficiaries have been timely filed and distributed. Copies of all such
summary plan descriptions have been delivered to UPC.

Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(b) hereto, all
Employee Welfare Benefit Plans which are in effect were in effect for
substantially all of calendar year 1993. Except as disclosed in Schedule
5.25(b) hereto, there has been with respect to such Employee Welfare Benefit
Plans no material amendment thereof or material increase in the cost thereof or
benefits payable thereunder on or after December 31, 1993.

To the best of the knowledge, information and belief
of GSSC, SBM and SBL, no Employee Welfare Benefit Plan or any trust created
thereunder, nor any "party in interest" with respect to the plan (as defined in
Section 3(14) of ERISA), has engaged in a "prohibited transaction", as such
term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA, which could subject such Employee
Welfare Benefit Plan, any such trust, or any party in interest (other than a
person for whom neither GSSC nor any GSSC Subsidiary is directly or indirectly
responsible) to the imposition of a penalty for such prohibited transaction
under Section 502(i) of ERISA. The Department of Labor has not assessed any
such penalty or served notice to GSSC or any of its Subsidiaries that such a
penalty may be imposed upon any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan.

Neither GSSC nor any GSSC Subsidiary has failed to
make any contribution to, or pay any amount due and owing by GSSC or an GSSC
Subsidiary under the terms of, an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan. Except as
disclosed in Section 5.25(b) hereto, no claims have been incurred with respect
to any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan which may, to the best knowledge,
information and belief of GSSC, constitute a liability for GSSC or any GSSC
Subsidiary after the application of any insurance, trust or other funds which
are applicable to the payment of such claims.

Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(b) hereto, to
the best knowledge, information and belief of GSSC, no condition

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 53

<PAGE>
exists that could subject any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan or any person
(other than a person for whom neither GSSC nor any GSSC Subsidiary is directly
or indirectly responsible) to liabilities, damages, losses, taxes, or sanctions
that arise under Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code or Sections 601
through 608 of ERISA for failure to comply with the continuation health care
coverage requirements of ERISA Sections 601 through 608 and Internal Revenue
Code Section 4980B with respect to any current or former employee of GSSC or
any GSSC Subsidiary, or the beneficiaries of such employee.

(c) GSSC has furnished to UPC true and complete copies
and/or descriptions of each plan or arrangement maintained or otherwise
contributed to by GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary which is not an Employee Pension
Benefit Plan and is not an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan and which (exclusive
of base salary and base wages) provides for any form of current or deferred
compensation, bonus, stock option, profit sharing, retirement, group health or
insurance, welfare benefits, fringe benefits, or similar plan or arrangement
for the benefit of any employee or class of employees, whether active or
retired, or independent contractors of GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary. Such plans
and arrangements shall collectively be referred to herein as "Benefit
Arrangements" and all such Benefit Arrangements of GSSC and GSSC's Subsidiaries
are listed on Schedule 5.25(c) hereto. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(c)
hereto, there are no other benefit arrangements of the GSSC companies and all
Benefit Arrangements which are in effect were in effect for substantially all
of calendar year 1993. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(c) hereto, there
has been with respect to Benefit Arrangements no material amendment thereof or
material increase in the cost thereof or benefits payable thereunder on or
after December 31, 1993. There has been no material increase in the base
salary and wage levels of GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary and, except in the
ordinary course of business, no change in the terms or conditions of employment
(including severance benefits) compared, in each case, to those prevailing for
substantially all of calendar year 1993. Except as disclosed in Schedule
5.25(c) hereto, there has been no material increase in the compensation of, or
benefits payable to, any senior executive employee of GSSC or any GSSC
Subsidiary on or after December 31, 1993, nor has any employment, severance, or
similar contract been entered into with any such employee, nor has any
amendment to any such contract been made on or after December 31, 1993.

With respect to all Benefit Arrangements which are
subject to the annual return requirement of Internal Revenue Code Section
6039D, all annual returns as were required to be filed have been timely filed.
Copies of all such annual returns for

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 54

<PAGE>
the three (3) plan years immediately preceding the current date have been
delivered to UPC.

(d) Listed on Schedule 5.25(d) hereto are all Employee
Pension Benefit Plans, Employee Welfare Benefit Plans, and Benefit Arrangements
which provide compensation or benefits which become effective upon a change in
control of GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary, including, but not limited to,
additional compensation or benefits, or acceleration in the amount or timing of
payment of compensation or benefits which had become effective prior to the
date of such acceleration. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(d) hereto,
there is no Employee Pension Benefit Plan, Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, or
Benefit Arrangement covering any employee of GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary which
individually or collectively could give rise to the payment of any amount which
would constitute an "excess parachute payment", as such term is defined in
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations proposed pursuant to
that section.

(e) Except as described in Schedule 5.25(e) hereto, each
Employee Pension Benefit Plan, Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, or Benefit
Arrangement and each personal services contract, fringe benefit, consulting
contract or similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any officer,
director, employee, or other person may be terminated by GSSC (or by GSSC as
the Surviving Corporation) within a period of no more than thirty (30) days
following the effective time of the merger, without payment of any amount as a
penalty, bonus, premium, severance pay, or other compensation for such
termination. No limitation on the right to terminate any such plan has been
communicated by GSSC or its Subsidiaries to employees, former employees, or
retirees who are or may be participants in or beneficiaries of such plans or
arrangements. Except as described in Schedule 5.25(e) hereto, each Employee
Pension Benefit Plan which is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code as a qualified defined benefit pension plan permits the reversion
of excess assets to the employer maintaining the plan or its successors or
assigns upon a plan termination and such provision has been included in the
Employee Pension Benefit Plan for the period required under ERISA Section
4044(d).

(f) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(f) hereto,
neither GSSC nor any GSSC Subsidiary has received notice from any governmental
agency of any alleged violation of applicable laws or of any prospective audit
or other investigation for the purpose of reviewing compliance with applicable
laws with respect to any Employee Pension Benefit Plan, Employee Welfare
Benefit Plan or Benefit Arrangement.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 55

<PAGE>
Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(f) hereto, no
suits, actions or claims have been filed in any court of law or with any
governmental agency regarding the operation of any Employee Pension Benefit
Plan, Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, or Benefit Arrangement and no such
additional suits, actions, or claims are, to the best information, knowledge
and belief of GSSC, anticipated to be filed.

5.26 Material Contracts. Except as reflected in the
Audited Financial Statements of GSSC, or as described in Schedule 5.26 hereto,
neither GSSC nor any GSSC Subsidiary, nor any of their respective assets,
businesses, or operations, is as of the date of this Reorganization Agreement a
party to, or is bound or obligated by, or receives benefits under any contract
or agreement or amendment thereto that in each case would (assuming that each
were a reporting company under the 1934 Act, whether or not it is so
registered) be required to be filed as an exhibit to an Annual Report on Form
10-K filed by GSSC as of the date of this Reorganization Agreement that has not
already been filed as an exhibit to GSSC's Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1993, or in any other SEC Document filed prior to the date
of this Reorganization Agreement. Set forth on Schedule 5.26 hereto is an
accurate and complete list and true and complete copies of all contracts to
which GSSC, SBM or SBL are a party and having a value in excess of $100,000.

5.27 Material Contract Defaults. To the best of the
knowledge, information and belief of GSSC, SBM and SBL, neither GSSC nor any
GSSC Subsidiary is in default in any respect under any contract, agreement,
commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy, or other instrument to which
it is a party or by which its respective assets, business, or operations may be
bound or affected or under which it or its respective assets, business, or
operations receives benefits, and which default is reasonably expected to have
either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on GSSC or
any GSSC Subsidiary on a consolidated basis, and there has not occurred any
event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a default.

5.28 Reports. Since December 31, 1989, GSSC, SBM and SBL
have filed all reports and statements, together with any amendments required to
be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file with (i) the MSBD
or the LOFI; (ii) the Federal Reserve, including, but not limited to, Reports
on FR Y-6 and FR Y-9; (iii) the FDIC, (iv) the SEC, including, but not limited
to, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and proxy
statements; and (vi) any other applicable federal or state securities or
banking authorities (except, in the case of federal or state securities
authorities, filings that

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 56

are not material). As of their respective dates, each of such reports and
documents, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto,
complied in all material respects with all of the requirements of their
respective forms and all of the statutes, rules, and regulations enforced or
promulgated by the Regulatory Authority with which they were filed. All such
reports were true and complete in all material respects and did not contain any
untrue statement as stated including any amendments thereto of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. GSSC has previously provided to UPC true and
correct copies of all such reports filed by GSSC, SBM or SBL after December 31,
1989.

5.29 Exchange Act and Listing Filings.

(a) The outstanding shares of GSSC Common Stock are registered
with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act and GSSC has filed with the SEC all
material forms and reports required by law to be filed by GSSC with the SEC,
which forms and reports, taken as a whole, are true and correct in all material
respects, and do not misstate a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(b) The outstanding shares of GSSC Common Stock are listed for

required by law to be filed by GSSC with the NASDAQ, which forms and reports,
taken as a whole, are true and correct in all material respects, and do not
misstate a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

5.30 Statements True and Correct. None of the information

or any other GSSC Subsidiary included or to be included in the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to GSSC's Stockholders in connection with the GSSC Stockholders
Meeting, and any other documents to be filed with the SEC, or any other
Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated herein,
at the respective times such documents are filed, and, with respect to the
Proxy Statement, when first mailed to the GSSC Stockholders, be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 57

<PAGE>
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or, in the case of
the Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the time
of the GSSC Stockholders Meeting, be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any

ARTICLE 6

COVENANTS OF UPC

6.1 Proxy Statement; UPC Shareholder Approval. UPC shall
call the UPC Shareholders Meeting to be held as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Reorganization Agreement and the Federal Reserve shall
have entered its Order approving the transactions contemplated in this
Reorganization Agreement, for the purpose of (i) approving this Reorganization
Agreement and the Plan of Merger, and (ii) such other related matters as it
deems appropriate. In connection with the UPC Shareholders Meeting, (i) UPC
shall, with GSSC's assistance, prepare a Proxy Statement to be filed with the
SEC and with any other appropriate Regulatory Authority; shall mail or cause to
be mailed such Proxy Statement to the UPC Shareholders and shall provide GSSC
the opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement at least five (5)
business days prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement with the Regulatory
Authorities for prior review and at least five (5) business days prior to the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the UPC Shareholders; (ii) the Parties shall
furnish to each other all information concerning them that the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of such Proxy Statement;
(iii) the Board of Directors of UPC shall recommend (subject to compliance with
its legal and fiduciary duties as advised by counsel) to UPC Shareholders the
approval of this Reorganization Agreement and the Plan of Merger; and (iv) UPC
shall use its best efforts, subject to compliance with its legal and fiduciary
duty as advised by counsel, to obtain such UPC Shareholders' approvals.

6.2 Regulatory Approvals. Within sixty (60) days after
execution of this Reorganization Agreement, UPC shall file any and all
applications with the appropriate government Regulatory Authorities in order to
obtain the Government

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 58

<PAGE>
Approvals and shall take such other actions as may be reasonably required to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Reorganization Agreement and
the Plan of Merger with reasonable promptness. UPC shall pay all fees and
expenses arising in connection with such applications for regulatory approval.
UPC agrees to provide the appropriate Regulatory Authorities with the
information required by such authorities in connection with UPC's applications
for regulatory approval and UPC agrees to use its best efforts to obtain such
regulatory approvals, and any other approvals and consents as may be required
for the Closing, as promptly as practicable; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 6.2 shall be construed to obligate UPC to take any action to meet
any condition required to obtain prior regulatory approval if UPC shall, in
UPC's reasonable judgment, deem such condition to be unreasonable or
inconsistent with previous regulatory approvals received by UPC in transactions
of this type and to constitute a significant impediment upon UPC's ability to
carry on its business or acquisition programs or to require UPC to increase
UPC's capital ratios to amounts in excess of the Federal Reserve's minimum
capital ratio guidelines which may be in effect from time to time. UPC shall
not knowingly take any action, or omit to take any action during the term of
this Reorganization Agreement which would adversely affect the receipt by UPC
of the Government Approvals or adversely affect the ability of UPC to perform
its obligations under this Reorganization Agreement. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Reorganization Agreement, UPC and INTERIM agree to use all
reasonable efforts and to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or to cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective, with
reasonable promptness after the date of this Reorganization Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement, including, without
limitation, using reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or
restraining or other order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement. UPC
shall use, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its best efforts to
obtain consents of all third parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or
desirable for the consummation of each of the transactions contemplated by this
Reorganization Agreement.

6.3 Reservation, Listing and Registration of UPC Common Stock
under the Securities Laws. UPC shall reserve for issuance that number of
shares of UPC Common Stock necessary to (i) satisfy the Consideration to be
delivered to the GSSC Record Holders at the Effective Time of the Merger and
(ii) provide shares of UPC Common Stock which will be issued upon the exercise
of options granted under the GSSC Key Employees Stock Plan and

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 59

<PAGE>
which are outstanding immediately prior to Effective Time of the Merger. UPC
shall cooperate with GSSC in the preparation of the GSSC Proxy Statement to be
used at the GSSC Stockholders Meeting (and which shall serve also as UPC's
prospectus with respect to UPC's issuance of shares of the UPC Common Stock)
and shall cause a registration statement on the appropriate form of the SEC to
be prepared and filed so as to cause any shares of UPC Common Stock which may
be delivered to the GSSC Record Holders in payment of the Consideration to be
registered under the 1933 Act and to be duly qualified under appropriate state
securities laws. UPC shall also list for trading on the NYSE the shares of UPC
Common Stock so delivered. Such reservation, registration, qualification and
listing shall be effected prior to the Closing. As soon as practicable after
the issuance of all Governmental Approvals, but no later than thirty days
following such date, UPC shall file with the SEC a Registration Statement on
Form S-8 to register the shares of UPC Common Stock that will be issued to
holders of options granted under the GSSC Key Employees Stock Plan. UPC shall
use its best efforts to have such Registration Statement declared effective as
promptly as practicable.

6.4 Employee Benefits. Following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein, UPC shall not be obligated to make further
contributions to any of the Employee Plans or Benefit Arrangements of GSSC or
the GSSC Subsidiaries and all employees of GSSC and the GSSC Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger who shall continue as
employees of GSSC as the Surviving Corporation or as employees of any other UPC
Subsidiary will be afforded the opportunity to participate in any employee
benefit plans maintained by UPC or UPC's Subsidiaries, including but not
limited to, any "employee benefit plan," as that term is defined in ERISA, on
an equal basis with employees of UPC or any UPC Subsidiaries with comparable
positions, compensation, and tenure. Service with GSSC or with any GSSC
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time of the Merger by former employees of
GSSC or any GSSC Subsidiary will be deemed service with UPC for purposes of
determining eligibility for participation and vesting in such employee benefit
plans of UPC and UPC's Subsidiaries. In its sole discretion, UPC may
elect to postpone until the first day of July next following the Effective Time
of the Merger the participation of the employees of GSSC and GSSC's
Subsidiaries in the employee benefit plans maintained by UPC or UPC's
Subsidiaries; provided, however, during any such postponement period, the GSSC
Employee Plans and all related employee benefit plans shall continue in full
force and effect, (including the continued receipt of all customary corporate
contributions in accordance with the past practice of GSSC, SBM and SBL for the
period prior to the termination of the plans), except as expressly modified or
amended by the terms of this

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 60

<PAGE>
Reorganization Agreement, or until such time as the plans are replaced by
benefit plans maintained by UPC.

6.5 Conduct of Business; Notice of Adverse Change. UPC shall
not knowingly engage in any activity which would (i) prohibit UPC or INTERIM
from delivering the Consideration to the Exchange Agent at Closing; (ii)
prevent UPC or INTERIM from consummating the transactions contemplated in this
Reorganization Agreement; (iii) prevent or impede the ability of UPC to account
for the Merger as a pooling of interests on the financial statements of UPC;
and (iv) prevent or impede the ability of UPC, GSSC and the GSSC Record Holders
to accomplish the Merger as a tax-free reorganization and, except with respect
to cash received in lieu of a fractional share of UPC Common Stock, on a
tax-free basis to the GSSC Record Holders. Upon receipt of UPC Shareholder
Approval and the satisfaction (or lawful waiver by UPC) of all conditions
precedent, UPC shall vote the shares of INTERIM in favor of the Merger. UPC
shall notify GSSC in writing immediately upon becoming aware of any material
adverse change in the financial condition or prospects of UPC or of any event
which would prohibit UPC's performance under the terms of this Reorganization
Agreement.

GSSC shall use its best efforts, subject to compliance with its legal and
fiduciary duty as advised by counsel, to obtain such GSSC Stockholders'
approvals.

7.2 Conduct of Business -- Affirmative Covenants. Unless
the prior written consent of UPC shall have been obtained, which consent will

and, except as otherwise contemplated herein:

(a) Except as may be required by statute, rule or
regulation, GSSC, SBM and SBL shall, and shall cause each GSSC Subsidiary to:

(i) Operate its business only in the
usual, regular, and ordinary course;

(ii) Preserve intact its business
organizations and assets and to maintain its rights and franchises;

(iii) Take no action, unless otherwise

the ability of such Party to perform its covenants and agreements
under this Reorganization Agreement;

(iv) Except as they may terminate in

7.4 Conduct of Business -- Certain Actions.

(a) Except to the extent necessary to consummate the
transactions specifically contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement, GSSC,
SBM and SBL shall not, and shall use their respective best efforts to ensure
that their respective directors, officers, employees, and advisors do not,
directly or indirectly, institute, solicit, or knowingly encourage (including
by way of furnishing any information not legally required to be furnished) any
inquiry, discussion, or proposal, or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any confidential or non-public information to,
any corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group (other than to
UPC or any UPC Subsidiary) concerning any "Acquisition Proposal" (as defined
below), except for actions reasonably considered by the Board of Directors of
GSSC, based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, to be required in order
to fulfill its fiduciary obligations. GSSC shall notify UPC immediately if any
Acquisition Proposal has been or should hereafter be received by GSSC, SBM or
SBL, such notice to contain, at a minimum, the identity of such persons, and,
subject to disclosure being consistent with the fiduciary obligations of GSSC's
Board of Directors, a copy of any written inquiry, the terms of any proposal or
inquiry, any information requested or discussions sought to be initiated, and
the status of any reports, negotiations or expressions of interest. For
purposes of this Section, "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposed tender
offer, agreement, understanding or other proposal pursuant to which any
corporation, partnership, Person or other entity or group, other than UPC or
any UPC Subsidiary, would directly or indirectly (i)

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 67

<PAGE>
acquire or participate in a merger, share exchange, consolidation or any other
business combination involving GSSC, SBM or SBL; (ii) acquire the right to vote
ten percent (10%) or more of the GSSC Common Stock, SBM Common Stock or SBL
Common Stock; (iii) acquire a significant portion of the assets or earning
power of GSSC, SBM or SBL; or (iv) acquire in excess of ten percent (10%) of
the outstanding GSSC Common Stock, SBM Common Stock or SBL Common Stock.

(b) As a condition of and as an inducement to UPC's
entering into this Reorganization Agreement, GSSC, SBM and SBL covenant,
acknowledge, and agree that it shall be a specific, absolute, and
unconditionally binding condition precedent to either GSSC's, SBM's or SBL's
entering into a letter of intent, agreement in principle, or definitive
agreement (whether or not considered binding, non-binding, conditional or
unconditional) with any third-party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or
supporting or indicating an intent to support an Acquisition Proposal, other
than this Reorganization Agreement and the transactions contemplated in this
Reorganization Agreement, regardless of whether GSSC, SBM or SBL has otherwise
complied with the provisions of Section 7.4(a) hereof, that GSSC or such
third-party which is a party to any Acquisition Proposal shall have paid UPC
the sum of Twelve Million and No/100 Dollars ($12,000,000), which sum
represents the (i) direct costs and expenses (including, but not limited to,
fees and expenses incurred by UPC's financial or other consultants, printing
costs, investment bankers, accountants, and counsel) incurred by or on behalf
of UPC in negotiating and undertaking to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement; (ii) indirect costs and expenses
of UPC in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Reorganization
Agreement, including UPC's management time devoted to negotiation and
preparation for the transactions contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement;
and (iii) UPC's loss as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Reorganization Agreement not being consummated. Accordingly, GSSC, SBM and SBL
hereby jointly and severally stipulate and covenant that prior to GSSC's, SBM's
or SBL's entering into a letter of intent, agreement in principle, or
definitive agreement, (whether binding or non-binding, conditional or
unconditional) with any third-party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
supporting or indicating an intent to support an Acquisition Proposal, either
GSSC or such third-party shall have paid to UPC the amount set forth above in
immediately available funds to satisfy the specific, absolute, and
unconditionally binding condition precedent imposed by this Section 7.4.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4(b) to the contrary, in the event
such Acquisition Proposal should be the result of an unsolicited offer or
takeover of GSSC, SBM or SBL, any sums due UPC by GSSC pursuant to the terms of
this

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 68

<PAGE>
Section 7.4 shall be paid by GSSC to UPC at the closing of the transactions set
forth in such Acquisition Proposal and all obligations of UPC to hold the
Closing by the Target Date shall be tolled until such time as the transactions
set forth in any such Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated or until
such time as the Acquisition Proposal shall have expired plus such reasonable
time as UPC shall require. UPC and INTERIM each acknowledges that under no
circumstances shall any officer or director of GSSC, SBM or SBL (unless such
officer or director shall have an interest in a potential acquiring party in
any Acquisition Proposal) be held personally liable to UPC or INTERIM for any
amount of the foregoing payment. On payment of such amount to UPC, UPC and
INTERIM shall have no cause of action or claim (either in law or equity)
whatsoever against GSSC, SBM or SBL, or any officer or director of GSSC, SBM or
SBL, with respect to or in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, this
Reorganization Agreement or the Plan of Merger.

(c) The requirements, conditions, and obligations
imposed by this Section 7.4 shall continue in full force and effect from the
date of this Reorganization Agreement until October 1, 1995, unless and until
the earlier of any of the following events shall occur, in which event,
thereafter neither GSSC, SBM nor SBL shall be obligated to pay the amount
required by this Section 7.4 as a condition precedent to such transaction:

(1) This Reorganization Agreement shall have been terminated (i)
mutually by the Parties pursuant to Section 9.1(a) of this
Reorganization Agreement; (ii) by UPC and INTERIM pursuant to
Section 9.1(b) of this Reorganization Agreement; (iii) by UPC
and INTERIM or GSSC, SBM and SBL pursuant to Section 9.1(c) of
this Reorganization Agreement; (iv) by UPC and INTERIM or
GSSC, SBM and SBL pursuant to Section 9.1(d) of this
Reorganization Agreement; (v) by UPC and INTERIM or GSSC, SBM
and SBL pursuant to Section 9.1(e) of this Reorganization
Agreement, and in the case of termination pursuant to Section
9.1(e), only on the basis of the failure to satisfy the
conditions enumerated in subparagraph (2) below; (vi) by UPC
and INTERIM pursuant to Section 9.1(f) of this Reorganization
Agreement; (vii) by UPC and INTERIM or GSSC, SBM and SBL
pursuant to Section 9.1(g) of this Reorganization Agreement;
(viii) by UPC and INTERIM pursuant to Section 9.1(h) of this
Reorganization Agreement; (ix) by UPC and INTERIM pursuant to
Section 9.1(i) of this Reorganization Agreement; and (x) by
UPC and INTERIM or GSSC, SBM and SBL pursuant to Section

Reorganization Agreement;

Reorganization Agreement;

as required by the provisions of Section 8.3(b) of
this Reorganization Agreement other than any such
failure arising out of any action or inaction on the
part of GSSC, SBM or SBL;

(v) The occurrence of material legal proceedings as
contemplated by the provisions of Section 8.3(a) of
this Reorganization Agreement;

(vi) The failure on the part of the appropriate
officers of UPC to deliver the certificates set forth
in Section 8.1(c) of this Reorganization Agreement,
or the failure on the part of counsel to UPC to
deliver the requisite opinion required by the
provisions of Section 8.1(e) of this Reorganization
Agreement;

(vii) UPC shall have determined not to consummate the
Merger pursuant to Sections 8.2(d), 8.2(f), 8.2(i),

UPC's independent financial adviser as required by 
Section 8.2(n) of this Reorganization Agreement;

presented by UPC in the registration statement or an
action or inaction on the part of UPC; or

(xi) The failure of any Affiliate of GSSC to execute
an Affiliate Letter as required by Section 8.3(m) of
this Reorganization Agreement (unless such
requirement is waived by UPC) but only if the failure
of any Affiliates of GSSC to execute the Affiliate
Letter would not potentially disqualify the
transactions contemplated by this Reorganization
Agreement from qualifying for pooling-of-interests
accounting treatment.

transactions in accordance with the terms of this Reorganization Agreement or
(ii) to terminate this Reorganization Agreement without penalty;

(g) Opinion of GSSC's Counsel. UPC shall have
been furnished with an opinion of legal counsel to GSSC, SBM and SBL, dated the

(i) GSSC is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the

(ii) SBM is a Mississippi banking
corporation, duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Mississippi; SBL is a Louisiana banking
corporation, duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Louisiana;

(iii) this Reorganization Agreement has
been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by GSSC, SBM
and SBL and (assuming that this Reorganization Agreement is a binding
obligation of UPC and INTERIM and the Plan of Merger is a binding
obligation of UPC and INTERIM) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of GSSC, SBM and SBL enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject as to enforceability to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to the application of
equitable principles and judicial discretion; and

(iv) to the knowledge of such counsel
after due inquiry, no consent or approval, which has not already been
obtained, by any governmental authority is required for execution,
delivery and performance by GSSC, SBM or SBL of this Reorganization
Agreement or any of the documents to be executed and delivered by
GSSC, SBM and SBL in connection herewith.

Such opinion may (i) expressly rely as to matters of fact upon certificates
furnished by appropriate officers of GSSC, SBM or SBL or appropriate government
officials; and (ii) in the case of matters of law governed by the laws of the
states in which they are not licensed, reasonably rely upon the opinions of
legal counsel duly licensed in such states and may be limited, in any event, to
Federal Law and the law of the State of Delaware;

merge; consolidate with; effect a business combination with; sell any
substantial part of GSSC's, SBM's or SBL's assets; acquire a significant part
of the shares or assets of any other Person or entity (financial or otherwise);
adopt any "poison pill" or other type of anti-takeover arrangement, any
shareholder rights provision, any "golden parachute" or similar program after
the date hereto which would have the effect of materially decreasing the value
of GSSC, SBM or SBL or the benefits of acquiring the GSSC Common Stock;

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 77

<PAGE>
(i) Maintenance of Certain Covenants, Etc. At
the time of Closing (i) the total assets of GSSC shall be not less than
$2,300,000,000; (ii) the consolidated equity capital of GSSC shall have been
not less than $178,000,000 as of March 31, 1994, and shall have increased since
that date through normal earnings growth; (iii) the consolidated tangible
equity capital of GSSC shall have been not less than $171,000,000 as of March
31, 1994, and shall have increased since that date through normal earnings
growth; (iv) neither GSSC, SBM nor SBL shall have issued or repurchased from
the date hereof any additional equity or debt securities, or any rights to
purchase or repurchase such securities, except as set forth in this Agreement
(therefore, there shall be not more than 9,600,000 shares of GSSC Common Stock
validly issued and outstanding at the Effective Time of the Merger); (iv) from

Agreement, and all validly issued and outstanding GSSC Stock Options shall have
been fully exercised prior to the Closing or tendered to GSSC for conversion
into options to purchase shares of UPC Common Stock as contemplated in Section
2.7 of this Reorganization Agreement and none shall have been repurchased by
GSSC, SBM or SBL prior to the Closing; (vi) from the date hereof, GSSC shall
not have declared or paid any cash dividends except its customary and
historical quarterly cash dividend prior to Closing; and (vii) the Merger can
be accounted for as a "pooling of interests" on the financial statements of
UPC. The criteria and calculations set forth above shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP assuming that GSSC, SBM and SBL shall have been operated
consistently in the normal course of their business; provided, however, that
the effects of any balance sheet expansion through abnormal, unusual,
nonrecurring or out of the ordinary borrowings or by the realization of
extraordinary or nonrecurring gains or other income from the disposition of
assets or liabilities or through similar transactions shall be eliminated from
the calculations;

(j) Non-Compete Agreements. Each member of the
Boards of Directors of GSSC, SBM and SBL shall have entered into a non-compete
agreement with UPC and GSSC substantially in the form of UPC's standard form of
non-compete agreement, a copy which is annexed hereto as Exhibit 8.2(j),
providing for a term of not less than two (2) years and covering the general

written opinion from its counsel to the effect that the transactions
contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement and the Plan of Merger will
constitute one or more tax-free reorganizations under Section 368 of the

UPC shall have received (i) from Price Waterhouse, or other independent
accountants acceptable to UPC, a letter dated within five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, in form and substance acceptable to UPC, stating the accountants'
opinion that, based upon the information furnished to them, the Merger should
be accounted for by UPC as a "pooling of interests" for financial statement
purposes and that such accounting treatment is in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and (ii) from GSSC's regularly retained
independent accountants or other independent accountants acceptable to UPC, a
letter dated within five (5) days prior to the Closing Date stating that, upon
a review of GSSC's books and records, the accountants are aware of no reason
why the business combination contemplated in this Reorganization Agreement to
which GSSC is a party should not be accounted for as a "pooling of interests"
under GAAP;

(m) Receipt of Affiliate Letters. Pursuant to
the provisions of Section 2.6 of this Reorganization Agreement, UPC shall have
received a written commitment in form and substance satisfactory to UPC and its
counsel (an "Affiliate Letter") from each GSSC Record Holder who would be
deemed by GSSC to be an Affiliate of GSSC at the time of Closing under the
Securities Laws and who accepts shares of UPC Common Stock as Consideration for
the cancellation, exchange and conversion of his shares of GSSC Common Stock
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Reorganization Agreement,
committing to UPC that such GSSC Record Holder shall not pledge, assign, sell,
transfer, devise, otherwise alienate or take any action which would eliminate
or diminish the risk of owning or holding the shares of UPC Common Stock to be
received by such GSSC Record Holder upon consummation of the Merger, nor enter
into any formal or informal agreement to pledge, assign, sell or transfer,
devise, or otherwise alienate his right, title and interests in any of the
shares of UPC Common Stock to be delivered by UPC to such GSSC Record Holder
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Reorganization Agreement until
such time as UPC shall have publicly released a statement of UPC's consolidated
earnings reflecting the combined financial results of operations of UPC and
GSSC for a period of not less than thirty (30) days subsequent to the Effective
Time of the Merger; and

(n) Fairness Opinion. UPC shall have received a

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 79

<PAGE>
to the effect that, in the opinion of such adviser, the Consideration to be
received by the GSSC Record Holders is fair to the UPC Shareholders from a
financial point of view, and such "fairness opinion" shall not have been
withdrawn prior to the Closing Date, and UPC shall have received an updated
"fairness opinion" letter from such advisers within five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date reinforcing the opinions provided in the initial "fairness
opinion" letter.

obligation of each party to effect the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be subject to the fulfillment, at or prior to the Closing, of the following
conditions:

(a) No Pending or Threatened Claims. That no

(c) By UPC or INTERIM or by GSSC, SBM or SBL in
the event the Closing shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 1995 (the

failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform its
obligations hereunder in a timely manner. If UPC shall have filed any and all
applications to obtain the requisite Government Approvals within sixty (60)
days of the date hereof, and if the Closing shall not have occurred solely

written request, extend the Closing Date until such time as all Government
Approvals have been obtained and any stipulated waiting periods have expired;

(d) By either UPC or INTERIM or by GSSC, SBM or
SBL, upon written notice to the other Party, upon denial of any Governmental
Approval necessary for the consummation of the Merger (or should such approval
be conditioned upon a substantial deviation from the transactions contemplated);
provided, however, that either UPC or GSSC may, upon written notice to 
the other, extend the term of this Reorganization Agreement for only
one sixty (60) day period to prosecute diligently and overturn such denial,
provided that such denial has been appealed within ten (10) business days of
the receipt thereof;

(e) By UPC or INTERIM in the event the conditions
set forth in Sections 8.2 or 8.3 are not satisfied in all material respects as
of the Closing Date, or by GSSC, SBM or SBL if the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1 or 8.3 are not satisfied in all material respects as of the Closing
Date, and such failure has not been waived prior to the Closing or it is
determined that no such Closing Date shall occur;

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 81

<PAGE>
(f) By UPC or INTERIM in the event that there
shall have been, in UPC's good faith opinion, a material adverse change in the
business, property, assets (including loan portfolios), liabilities (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), prospects, operations, liquidity,
income, condition (financial or otherwise) or net worth of GSSC, SBM or SBL
taken as a whole, or upon the occurrence of any event or circumstance which may
have the effect of limiting or restricting UPC's voting power or other rights
normally enjoyed by the registered holders of the GSSC Common Stock which are
the subject of the instant transaction;

(g) By UPC or INTERIM or GSSC, SBM or SBL in the
event that there shall have been a material breach of any obligation of the
other Party hereunder and such breach shall not have been remedied within
thirty (30) days after receipt by the breaching Party of written notice from
the other Party specifying the nature of such breach and requesting that it be
remedied;

(h) By UPC or INTERIM should GSSC or any GSSC
Subsidiary enter into any letter of intent or agreement with a view to being
acquired by, or effecting a business combination with any other Person; or any
agreement to merge, to consolidate, to combine, or, other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices, to sell a material portion
of its assets; or to be acquired in any other manner by any other Person; or,
other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices,
to acquire a material amount of assets or a material equity position in any
other Person, whether financial or otherwise;

(i) By UPC or INTERIM should GSSC, SBM or SBL or
any GSSC Subsidiary enter into any formal agreement, letter of understanding,
memorandum or other similar arrangement with any bank regulatory authority
establishing a formal capital plan requiring GSSC, SBM or SBL to raise
additional capital or to sell a substantial portion of its assets;

(j) By GSSC, SBM or SBL in the event the Current
Market Price Per Share of the UPC Common Stock should be less than $22.00 per
share of UPC Common Stock; By UPC or INTERIM in the event the Current Market
Price Per Share of the UPC Common Stock should be greater than $31.25 per share
of UPC Common Stock; provided, however, any such termination of this
Reorganization Agreement by GSSC, SBM or SBL or by UPC or INTERIM pursuant to
this Section 9.1(j) shall be subject to the limitations imposed on the Parties
by Section 3.1(e) of this Reorganization Agreement;

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 82

<PAGE>
(k) By either Party, within thirty (30) days from
the date of this Reorganization Agreement, in the event such Party, based on
the Party's opportunity to conduct a preliminary due diligence review of the
books, records and operations of the other Party as provided for in Section 2.3
of this Reorganization Agreement, in good faith determines in it sole
discretion that the results of the review conducted by such Party or its agents
do not support and reinforce the reviewing Party's preliminary expectations as
to the sustained growth and earnings prospects of the reviewed Party;

(l) By GSSC, SBM or SBL in the event that there
shall have been, in GSSC's good faith opinion, a material adverse change in the
business, property, assets (including loan portfolios), liabilities (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), prospects, operations, liquidity,
income, condition (financial or otherwise) or net worth of UPC taken as a
whole, or upon the occurrence of any event or circumstance which may have the
effect of limiting or restricting the GSSC Record Holder's voting power or

If a Party should elect to terminate this Reorganization Agreement pursuant to
subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l) or (m) of
this Section 9.1, it shall give notice to the other Party, in writing, of its
election in the manner prescribed in Section 10.1 ("Notices") of this
Reorganization Agreement.

9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event that this
Reorganization Agreement should be terminated pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof,
all further obligations of the Parties under this Reorganization Agreement
shall terminate without further liability of any Party to another; provided,
however, that a termination under Section 9.1 hereof shall (i) not relieve any
Party of any liability for a breach of this Reorganization Agreement or for any
misstatement or misrepresentation made hereunder prior to such termination, or
be deemed to constitute a waiver of any available remedy for any such breach,
misstatement or misrepresentation; and (ii) shall not be deemed a termination
of the obligations of GSSC to UPC under Section 7.4 of this Reorganization
Agreement which are intended by the Parties hereto

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 83

to survive a termination under Section 9.1 hereof, and any termination of this
Reorganization Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4 hereof shall give rise to
liability only to the extent therein provided.

Agreement described in Section 2.4 herein, the Schedules, Annexes, Exhibits and

hereafter executed and delivered in accordance with Section 10.9 hereof
constitute the entire agreement of the Parties hereto pertaining to the
transaction contemplated hereby and supersede all prior written and oral (and
all contemporaneous oral) agreements and understandings of the Parties hereto
concerning the subject matter hereof. The Schedules, Annexes, Exhibits and
certificates attached hereto or furnished pursuant to this Reorganization
Agreement are hereby incorporated as integral parts of this Reorganization
Agreement. Except as provided herein, by specific language and not by mere
implication, this Reorganization Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
other person not a Party to this Reorganization Agreement any rights or
remedies hereunder.

10.8 Severability. If any portion or provision of this

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 86

<PAGE>
(d) except as provided in Section 2.5 of this

Agreement or the Plan of Merger; provided, however, that no provision of this

writing signed by the Parties hereto or their respective successors in interest
and expressly stating that it is an amendment to this Reorganization Agreement.

10.10 Interpretation. The headings contained in this
Reorganization Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Reorganization Agreement.

10.11 Payment of Expenses. Except as set forth in Section

and expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses) incurred
by it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder.

10.12 Finders and Brokers. UPC, INTERIM, GSSC, SBM and SBL
represent and warrant to each other that except for the employment by GSSC of
The Robinson Humphrey Company, Inc. they have employed no broker or finder in
connection with the transactions described in this Reorganization Agreement

or finder as a result of the execution of this Reorganization Agreement or the
closing of the transactions contemplated herein. This section shall survive
the termination of this Reorganization Agreement.

10.13 Equitable Remedies. The Parties hereto agree that, in
the event of a breach of this Reorganization Agreement by GSSC, SBM or SBL, UPC
and INTERIM will be without an adequate remedy at law by reason of the unique
nature of GSSC, SBM and SBL. In recognition thereof, in addition to (and not
in lieu of) any remedies at law which may be available to UPC and INTERIM, UPC
and INTERIM shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief, including the
remedies of specific performance and injunction, in the event of a breach of
this Reorganization Agreement by GSSC, SBM or SBL, and no attempt on the part
of UPC or INTERIM to obtain such equitable relief shall be deemed to constitute
an election of remedies by UPC or INTERIM which would preclude UPC or INTERIM
from obtaining any remedies at law to which it would otherwise be entitled.
GSSC, SBM and SBL covenant that they shall not contend in any such proceeding
that UPC or INTERIM is not entitled to a decree of specific performance by
reason of having an adequate remedy at law. Nothing in this Section 10.13
shall be deemed to restrict any remedies which the Parties hereto may have
under law or equity.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 87

<PAGE>
10.14 Attorneys' Fees. If any Party hereto shall bring an
action at law or in equity to enforce its rights under this Reorganization

any warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein), the
prevailing Party in such action shall be entitled to recover from the other
Party its reasonable costs and expenses necessarily incurred in connection with
such action (including fees, disbursements and expenses of attorneys and costs
of investigation).

10.15 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made by the Parties hereto or in any instrument
or document furnished in connection herewith, shall survive the Closing and any
investigation at any time made by or on behalf of the Parties hereto and shall
expire at the Effective Time of the Merger except as to any matter which is
based upon willful fraud with respect to which the representations and
warranties set forth in this Reorganization Agreement shall expire on the
earlier of six months from the Effective Time of the Merger or the expiration
of the applicable statutes of limitation; provided, however, nothing herein
shall create any right of action as to any individual who has not personally
and individually engaged in any act of willful fraud giving rise to any breach
of the representations and warranties made by the Parties hereto. Nothing in
this Section 10.15 shall limit GSSC's, SBM's, SBL's, UPC's or INTERIM's rights
or remedies for misrepresentations, breaches of this Reorganization Agreement
or any other improper action or inaction by the other Party hereto prior to the
its termination. All obligations, agreements, covenants and undertakings of
the Parties hereto to be performed either in whole or in part after the
Effective Time of the Merger shall survive the Closing and shall not expire at
the Effective Time of the Merger.

10.16 No Waiver. No failure, delay or omission of or by any
Party in exercising any right, power or remedy upon any breach or default of
any other Party shall impair any such rights, powers or remedies of the Party
not in breach or default, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such
right, power or remedy, or an acquiescence in any similar breach or default;
nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any
other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver,
permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any Party
of any provisions of this Reorganization Agreement must be in writing and must
be executed by the Parties to this Reorganization Agreement and shall be
effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.
