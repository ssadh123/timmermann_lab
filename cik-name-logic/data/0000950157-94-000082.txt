Item 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On June 22, 1994, National Health Laboratories
Incorporated (the "Company" or "NHL"), the predecessor in
interest of National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc., 
announced that N Acquisition Corp. (the "Purchaser"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of NHL, had accepted for payment
8,361,409 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share
(the "Shares"), of Allied Clinical Laboratories, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Allied"), representing in excess of
99% of all outstanding Shares and constituting all the
Shares tendered as of Midnight, New York City time, on June
21, 1994, pursuant to the Purchaser's tender offer for all
outstanding Shares for a price of $21.50 per Share net to
the seller in cash. 2,768,815 shares of those tendered were
delivered pursuant to the Stock Option Agreements, each
dated as of May 3, 1994, as amended by the Amendments
thereto, each dated as of June 7, 1994, among NHL, the
Purchaser, and Haywood D. Cochrane, Jr. (264,773 shares) and
Warburg, Pincus Capital Company, L.P. (2,504,042 shares),
respectively. On June 23, 1994, the Purchaser paid for such
Shares using the proceeds of the credit facility established
pursuant to the Credit Agreement dated as of June 21, 1994, 
among NHL Intermediate Holdings Corp. II, the banks,
financial institutions and other institutional lenders
listed on the signature pages thereof, Citicorp USA Inc., as
administrative agent and certain co-agents for the Lenders
thereunder, thereby becoming the beneficial owner of in
excess of 90% of all Shares then outstanding.

On June 23, 1994, the effective date of the merger
contemplated by the tender offer described above (the
"Merger"), the Purchaser was merged with and into Allied
pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, with Allied continuing as the surviving corporation and
as a wholly-owned subsidiary of NHL with 100 shares of
common stock outstanding. On June 23, 1994, NHL announced
that the Merger transaction had been completed, at which
time all shares of Allied common stock ceased to be
outstanding and traded, and each Share thereafter
represented a right to receive $21.50 per Share.

The total purchase price for the Allied
acquisition of $190.7 million, including aggregate related
acquisition costs of $6.0 million, has been allocated to the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities
of Allied based upon management's preliminary estimates of
their fair value with the remainder allocated to cost in
excess of assets acquired. The allocation of purchase price

Page 2 of 12
Exhibit Index is on page 11 of this filing 

<PAGE>3

for the Allied acquisition is subject to revision when
additional information concerning asset and liability
valuations is obtained. In management's opinion, the asset
and liability valuations for the Allied acquisition will not
be materially different from the pro forma financial data 
presented. For purposes of presenting pro forma results, no
changes in revenues or expenses have been made to reflect
the result of any modification to operations that might have
been made had the Merger been consummated on the assumed
effective dates of the Merger. The pro forma expenses
include the recurring costs which are directly attributable
to the Merger, such as interest expense and the related tax
effects thereof and the change in depreciation and
amortization expenses resulting from the allocation of the
purchase cost.

Item 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL
INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS

a. Financial Statements of Allied.

For a statement of Allied's financial condition,
see the financial statements included in Allied's Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993 and
Allied's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
March 31, 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference.

b. Pro Forma Financial Information.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

The following unaudited pro forma financial data
of the Company are based on the historical consolidated
financial statements of the Company and Allied adjusted to
give effect to the Merger. The Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Consolidated Statement of Earnings Data and Other Data for
the year ended December 31, 1993 and the three months ended
March 31, 1994 give effect to the Merger as if it had
occurred on January 1, 1993. The Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Consolidated Balance Sheet Data give effect to the
Merger as if it had occurred on March 31, 1994. The pro 
forma adjustments are based upon available information and
certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable. 
The pro forma financial data do not purport to represent
what the Company's results of operations or financial
position would actually have been had the Merger in fact
occurred on January 1, 1993 or March 31, 1994, or to project
the Company's results of operations or financial position
for or at any future period or date. The pro forma
financial data should be read in conjunction with the
historical consolidated financial statements of the Company
and Allied incorporated by reference herein. See "Exhibits".

SECTION 2.02. Making the Advances. (a) Except as
otherwise provided in Section 2.16, each Borrowing shall be made
on notice given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) 
on the first Business Day prior to the date of a proposed Base
Rate Borrowing or the third Business Day prior to the date of a

Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier, telex or cable. 
Each such notice of a Borrowing (a "Notice of Borrowing") shall
be by telecopier, telex or cable, and, with respect to a Notice
of Borrowing by telex or cable, confirmed immediately thereafter
in writing, in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto,
specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing,
(ii) Facility under which such Borrowing is to be made, (iii)
Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iv) aggregate

12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing,
make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office
to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s
Account, in same day funds, such Lender s ratable portion of

outstanding on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, plus
interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of such date, 
available to the Issuing Bank and such other Revolving Credit
Lenders for repayment of such Letter of Credit Advances.

(b) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and
binding on the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each
Appropriate Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by
such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before
the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such
Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III,
including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the
Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when
such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such
date.

(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from an Appropriate Lender prior to the date of 
any Borrowing under a Facility under which such Lender has a
Commitment that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender s ratable portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume, or at its option
request confirmation from such Lender, that such Lender has made
such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date
of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this
Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon
such assumption or confirmation (as the case may be), make
available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. 
If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made
such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the
date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i)
in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at
such time under Section 2.06 to Advances comprising such
Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the cost
(expressed as a rate per annum) to the Administrative Agent of
funding such Lender s ratable portion; provided that, upon the
request of such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall provide
such Lender with a certificate as to the calculation of such
amount. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent
such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
constitute such Lender s Advance as part of such Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement. 

<PAGE>39

(d) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to
be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its
Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the 
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any
Borrowing.

(e) The Borrower may not request a Borrowing
comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances or, pursuant to Section
2.15, convert Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances
or select a new Interest Period for existing Eurodollar Rate
Advances if, after the making or Conversion of such Advances or

commencing on different dates) would exceed ten.

of

<PAGE>44

each March, June, September and December during such
periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be
Converted or paid in full.

(ii) Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as 
such Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum
equal at all times during each Interest Period for such
Advance to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest
Period plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to
time, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest
Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more
than three months, on each day that occurs during such
Interest Period every three months from the first day of
such Interest Period.

(b) Default Interest. The Borrower shall pay on
demand interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance
that is not paid when due and on the unpaid amount of all
interest, fees and other amounts then due and payable hereunder
that is not paid when due from the due date thereof to the date
paid, at a rate per annum equal at such time to (i) in the case
of any amount of principal, 2% per annum above the rate of
interest per annum required to be paid on such Advance 
immediately prior to the date on which such amount became due
and payable and (ii) in the case of all other amounts, 2% per
annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on Base Rate
Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above.

SECTION 2.07. Interest Rate Determination. (a) The
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower
and each Lender of the applicable interest rate determined by
the Administrative Agent for purposes of Section 2.06(a), and
the applicable rate, if any, furnished by Citibank for the
purpose of determining the applicable interest rate under
Section 2.06(a).

(b) If Citibank cannot furnish timely information to
the Administrative Agent for determining the Eurodollar Rate,
the Administrative Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrower and
each Lender that the interest rate cannot be determined for such
Eurodollar Rate Advances, whereupon (i) each such Eurodollar 
Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to
Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower that Citibank has determined that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist.

(c) If the Required Lenders notify the Administrative
Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for such

<PAGE>45

Eurodollar Rate Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to
such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their pro rata
shares of such Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest
Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the
Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon (i) each such Eurodollar 
Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to
Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower that such Lenders have determined that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

(d) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration
of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in
accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of
"Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Administrative Agent will
forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and the
Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances will be one
month.

SECTION 2.08. Fees. (a) Commitment Fee. The
Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of the Lenders a commitment fee on the average daily
unused portion of each Appropriate Lender s Term A Commitment,
on the average daily unused portion of each Appropriate Lender's
Term B Commitment and on the average daily Unused Revolving
Credit Commitment of such Lender from the date hereof, in the
case of each Bank, and from the effective date specified in the
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender,
in the case of each other Lender, until the Termination Date at
a rate equal to (i) 1/2 of 1% per annum during any period in
which the Performance Level of the Borrower is at Level III or
Level IV or (ii) 3/8 of 1% per annum during any other period, in
each case payable in arrears on the date of the initial
Borrowing, thereafter quarterly on the last Business Day of each
March, June, September and December commencing June 30, 1994,
and the Termination Date. 

(b) Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for its own account such fees as are set 
forth in the fee letter dated May 3, 1994 between the Borrower
and Citibank, as the same may be amended or otherwise modified
from time to time.

SECTION 2.09. Increased Costs. (a) Except as to
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings or
liabilities with respect thereto (it being understood that the
Borrower shall not have any liability for any taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings or liabilities with
respect thereto, except as provided in Section 2.12), if, due to

<PAGE>46

either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any
change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements
included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance
by any Lender with any guideline or request from any central 
bank or other governmental authority in any case introduced,
changed, interpreted or requested after the date hereof (whether
or not having the force of law), there shall be (x) imposed,
modified or deemed applicable any reserve, special deposit or
similar requirement against assets held by, or letters of credit
or guarantees issued by, or deposits in or for the account of,
any Lender or (y) imposed on any Lender any other condition
relating to this Agreement or the Advances made by it, and the
result of any event referred to in clause (x) or (y) shall be to
increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making,
funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the
Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender
(with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent) made
within 60 days after the first date on which such Lender has
actual knowledge that it is entitled to make demand for payment
under this Section 2.09(a), pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender for such increased cost; provided, 
however, that if such Lender fails to so notify the Borrower
within such 60-day period, such increased cost shall commence
accruing on such later date on which the Lender notifies the
Borrower; provided further that, before making any such demand,
such Lender agrees to use its best efforts (consistent with its
internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of
such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the
amount of, such increased cost and would not, in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost,
submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such
Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

(b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any
law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central
bank or other governmental or monetary authority in regard to 
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law)
including, without limitation, any guideline contemplated by the
report dated July 1988 entitled "International Convergence of
Capital Management and Capital Standards" issued by the Bank
Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices, in
any case in which such law, regulation, guideline or request
became effective or was made after the date hereof, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital
of, or maintained by, such Lender or any corporation controlling
such Lender as a consequence of such Lender s Advances or
Commitments

<PAGE>47

hereunder and other commitments of this type, by increasing the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender, to a level
below that which such Lender or any corporation controlling such
Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, 
change or compliance (taking into account such Lender s or such
corporation s policies with respect to capital adequacy), then
the Borrower shall, from time to time, pay such Lender, upon
demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent) made within 60 days after the first date
on which such Lender has actual knowledge that it is entitled to
make demand for payment under this Section 2.09(b) of such
reduction in return, such additional amount as may be specified
by such Lender as being sufficient to compensate such Lender for
such reduction in return, to the extent that such Lender
reasonably determines such reduction to be attributable to the
existence of such Lender s commitment to lend hereunder;
provided however, that if such Lender fails to so notify the
Borrower within such 60-day period, such amounts shall commence
accruing on such later date on which the Lender notifies the
Borrower. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender shall be
conclusive and biding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.10. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if the introduction of or any
change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation
makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental
authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its
Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder
to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, then, upon written notice by
such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Lender will
automatically Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the
obligation of such Lender to make, or to Convert Base Rate
Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until
the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
exist; provided, however, that, before making any such demand,
such Lender shall designate a different Eurodollar Lending 
Office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need
for giving such notice and demand and would not, in the judgment
of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

For purposes of this Section 2.10, a notice to the
Borrower by a Lender shall be effective with respect to any
Advance on the last day of the then current Interest Period for
such Advance; provided, however, that, if it is not lawful for
such Lender to maintain such Advance until the end of the

<PAGE>48

Interest Period applicable thereto, then the notice to the
Borrower shall be effective upon receipt by the Borrower.

SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations. (a) The
Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes 
not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when
due in U.S. dollars to the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent s Account in same day funds. The
Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be
distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or
interest or commitment fees ratably (other than amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.09 or 2.12) to the Lenders for the account
of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds
relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any
Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending
Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and
Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in
the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after the
effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the
Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under
the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the
Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment 
and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly
between themselves.

(b) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if
and to the extent payment of principal, interest or fees owed to
such Lender is not made when due hereunder or under the Note or
Notes held by such Lender, to charge from time to time against
any or all of the Borrower s accounts with such Lender any
amount so due.

(c) All computations of interest based on the
Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the
Administrative Agent, on the basis of a year of 360 days, and
all computations of interest based on the Base Rate and of
commitment fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the
basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, in each
case for the actual number of days (including the first day but 
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such
interest or commitment fees are payable. Each determination by
the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note
shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day,
and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the

<PAGE>49

computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as the
case may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause
payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances
to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment
shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Lenders hereunder or under any Note that
the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume, or at its option request
confirmation from the Borrower, that the Borrower has made such
payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption,
cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an
amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed
to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from
the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the
date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
at the Federal Funds Rate.
(f) If the Administrative Agent receives funds for
application to the Obligations under the Loan Documents under
circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the
Advances or the Facility to which, or the manner in which, such
funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall
not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each
Lender ratably in accordance with such Lender's proportionate
share of the principal amount of all outstanding Advances and
the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding,
in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Advances
or other Obligations owed to such Lender, and for application to
such principal installments, as the Administrative Agent shall
direct.

SECTION 2.12. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by
the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in
accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and without 
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each
Lender and the Administrative Agent, (i) taxes imposed on its
income, and franchise taxes and backup withholding taxes imposed
on it, by the United States or the jurisdiction under the laws
of which such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case
may be) is organized or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein, (ii) taxes imposed on its income,
and

<PAGE>50

franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such
Lender s or the Administrative Agent s principal office or
Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein and (iii) United States withholding
tax payable with respect to payments hereunder under laws 
(including, without limitation any statute, treaty, ruling,
determination or regulation) in effect on the Initial Date with
respect to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, but not
excluding any United States withholding tax payable as a result
of any change in such laws occurring after the Initial Date (all
such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as
"Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct
any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or
under any Note to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i)
the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that
after making all required deductions of Taxes (including
deductions of Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 2.12) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions of Taxes been made, (ii)
the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation 
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law;
provided, however, that any such Lender shall designate a
different Eurodollar Lending Office if, in the judgment of such
Lender, such designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the
amount of, any Taxes required to be deducted from or in respect
of any sum payable hereunder to such Lender or the
Administrative Agent and would not, in the judgment of such
Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

(b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any
present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise
or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any
payment made hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "Other
Taxes").

(c) The Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the 
Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
(including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12)
paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may
be) and any liability (including penalties, additions to tax,
interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto; provided that, in the event such Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, successfully contests
the assessment of such Taxes or Other Taxes or any liability
arising therefrom

<PAGE>51

or with respect thereto, such Lender or the Administrative Agent
shall refund, to the extent of any refund thereof made to such
Lender or the Administrative Agent, any amounts paid by the
Borrower under this Section 2.12(c) in respect of such Taxes,
Other Taxes or liabilities arising therefrom or with respect 
thereto. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent agree that it
will contest such Taxes, Other Taxes or liabilities if (i) the
Borrower furnishes to it an opinion of reputable tax counsel
acceptable to such Lender or the Administrative Agent to the
effect that such Taxes or Other Taxes were wrongfully or
illegally imposed and (ii) such Lender or the Administrative
Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that it would not be
disadvantaged or prejudiced in any manner whatsoever as a result
of such contest. This indemnification shall be made within 30
days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as
the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of 
Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at
its address referred to in Section 8.02, appropriate evidence of
payment thereof. If no Taxes are payable in respect of any
payment hereunder or under the Notes by the Borrower from an
account or branch outside the United States or on behalf of the 
Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, the
Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at such
address, a certificate from each appropriate taxing authority,
or an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Administrative Agent,
in either case stating that such payment is exempt from or not
subject to Taxes. For purposes of this Section 2.12, the terms
United States" and "United States person" shall have the
meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Code.

(e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States and the Administrative
Agent, if organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States, shall, on or prior to the Initial Date and from
time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent (but only so long thereafter as such
Lender or the Administrative Agent remains lawfully able to do
so), provide the Borrower and (in the case of any such Lender
other than the Administrative Agent) the Administrative Agent 
with two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service form
1001 or 4224, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed
by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender or
the Administrative Agent is entitled to benefits under an income
tax treaty to which the United States is a party that reduces
the rate of withholding tax on payments under this Agreement or
the Notes or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to
this Agreement or the Notes is effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

<PAGE>52

(f) For any period with respect to which the
Administrative Agent or a Lender has failed to provide the
Borrower with the appropriate forms described in subsection (e)
above (other than if such failure is due to a change in law
occurring after the date on which such person was originally 
required to provide such forms, or if such forms are otherwise
not required under subsection (e) above), the Administrative
Agent or such Lender shall not be entitled to increased payments
or indemnification under subsection (a) or (c) above with
respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided,
however, that should the Administrative Agent or a Lender become
subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form
required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as the
Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request to
assist the Lender to recover such Taxes if, in the judgment of
the Borrower such steps would avoid the need for, or reduce the
amount of, any Taxes required to be deducted from or in respect
of any sum payable hereunder to the Administrative Agent or such
Lender and would not, in the judgment of the Borrower, be
disadvantageous to the Borrower.

(g) Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and 
obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.12 shall
survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder
and under the Notes.

(h) If a Lender shall change its Applicable Lending
Office other than (i) at the request of the Borrower or (ii) at
a time when such change would not result in this Section 2.12
requiring the Borrower to make a greater payment than if such
change had not been made, such Lender shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under this Section 2.12 than such
Lender would have been entitled to receive had it not changed
its Applicable Lending Office.

SECTION 2.13. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any
Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary,
through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on
account of the Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to
Section 2.09 or 2.12) in excess of its ratable share of payments 
on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such
Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess
payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that, if
all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each
Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the
purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such
recovery together with an amount

<PAGE>53

equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment
to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing
Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. 
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect
to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.14. Removal of Bank. In the event that any
Lender demands payment of costs or additional amounts pursuant
to Section 2.09 or Section 2.12 or asserts pursuant to Section
2.10 that it is unlawful for such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances, then (subject to such Lender's right to rescind such
demand or assertion within 10 days after the notice from the
Borrower referred to below) the Borrower may, upon 20 days'
prior written notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, elect to cause such Lender to assign its Advances and
Commitments in full to an assignee institution selected by the
Borrower that meets the criteria of an Eligible Assignee and is 
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, so long as
such Lender receives payment in full of the outstanding
principal amount of all Advances made by it and all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts due and payable to
such Lender as of the date of such assignment (including without
limitation amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.09 or 2.12), and
in such case such Lender agrees to make such assignment, and
such assignee shall agree to accept such assignment and assume
all obligations of such Lender hereunder, in accordance with
Section 8.07.

SECTION 2.15. Conversion of Advances. (a) Optional. 
The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the
Administrative Agent not later than noon (New York City time) on
the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed
Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.07 and
2.09, Convert all or any portion of the Advances of one Type
comprising the same Borrowing into Advances of the other Type; 
provided, however, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate
Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made on, and only on,
the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate
Advances, and any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be subject to the limitation set
forth in Section 2.02(e) and in an amount not less than
$10,000,000. Each such notice of Conversion shall, within the
restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such
Conversion, (ii) the Advances to be Converted and (iii) if such
Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the

<PAGE>54

initial Interest Period for such Advances. Each notice of
Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

(b) Mandatory. (i) On the date on which the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances 
comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or
prepayment or otherwise, to less than $10,000,000, such Advances
shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances. 

(ii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
any Event of Default (or, in the case of any involuntary
proceeding described in Section 6.01(e), a Default), (A) each
Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of
the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base
Rate Advance and (B) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or
to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended.

SECTION 2.16. Letters of Credit. (a) The Letter of
Credit Facility. The Issuing Bank agrees, on the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, to issue letters of credit
(the "Letters of Credit") for the account of the Borrower from
time to time on any Business Day during the period from the date 
of the initial Borrowing until 60 days before June 30, 1999
(i) in an aggregate Available Amount for all Letters of Credit
not to exceed at any time the Issuing Bank's Letter of Credit
Commitment and (ii) in an Available Amount for each such Letter
of Credit not to exceed the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments
of the Revolving Credit Lenders on such Business Day. No Letter
of Credit shall have an expiration date (including all rights of
the Borrower or the beneficiary to require renewal) later than
the earlier of 30 days before the Termination Date and, in the
case of a Standby Letter of Credit, one year after the date of
issuance thereof, but may by its terms be renewable annually
with the consent of the Issuing Bank, and, in the case of a
Trade Letter of Credit, 60 days after the date of issuance
thereof. Within the limits of the Letter of Credit Facility,
and subject to the limits referred to above, the Borrower may
request the issuance of Letters of Credit under this
Section 2.16(a), repay any Letter of Credit Advances resulting
from drawings thereunder pursuant to Section 2.16(c) and request 
the issuance of additional Letters of Credit under this
Section 2.16(a).

(b) Request for Issuance. (i) Each Letter of Credit
shall be issued upon notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M.
(New York City time) on the tenth Business Day prior to the date
of the proposed issuance of such Letter of Credit, by the
Borrower to the Issuing Bank, which shall give to the
Administrative Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender prompt
notice thereof by telex, telecopier or cable. Each such notice

<PAGE>55

of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a "Notice of Issuance") shall
be by telex, telecopier or cable, confirmed immediately in
writing, specifying therein the requested (A) date of such
issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (B) Available Amount
of such Letter of Credit, (C) expiration date of such Letter of 
Credit, (D) name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter
of Credit and (E) form of such Letter of Credit, and shall be
accompanied by such application and agreement for letter of
credit (a "Letter of Credit Agreement") as the Issuing Bank may
specify to the Borrower for use in connection with such
requested Letter of Credit. If the requested form of such
Letter of Credit is acceptable to the Issuing Bank and the
Administrative Agent in their sole discretion, the Issuing Bank
will, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III, make such Letter of Credit available to the
Borrower at its office referred to in Section 8.02 or as
otherwise agreed with the Borrower in connection with such
issuance. In the event and to the extent that the provisions of
any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.

(ii) The Issuing Bank shall furnish (A) to the
Administrative Agent on the first Business Day of each week a 
written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of
Letters of Credit issued during the previous week and drawings
during such week under all Letters of Credit, (B) to each
Revolving Credit Lender on the first Business Day of each month
a written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of
Letters of Credit issued during the preceding month and drawings
during such month under all Letters of Credit and (C) to the
Administrative Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender on the
first Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report
setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount
during the preceding calendar quarter of all Letters of Credit.

(c) Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by the
Issuing Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall
constitute for all purposes of this Agreement the making by the
Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit Advance, which shall be a
Base Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft. Upon written
demand by the Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to the 
Administrative Agent and the Borrower, each other Revolving
Credit Lender shall purchase from the Issuing Bank, and the
Issuing Bank shall sell and assign to each such other Revolving
Credit Lender, such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
outstanding Letter of Credit Advance as of the date of such
purchase, by making available for the account of its Applicable
Lending Office to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Administrative Agent's
Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of
the

<PAGE>56

outstanding principal amount of such Letter of Credit Advance to
be purchased by such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to each
such sale and assignment. Each Revolving Credit Lender agrees
to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Letter of
Credit Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor 
is made by the Issuing Bank, provided notice of such demand is
given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such
Business Day or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such
demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. Upon
any such assignment by the Issuing Bank to any other Revolving
Credit Lender of a portion of a Letter of Credit Advance, the
Issuing Bank represents and warrants to such other Lender that
the Issuing Bank is the legal and beneficial owner of such
interest being assigned by it free and clear of adverse claims,
but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to such Letter of Credit Advance,
the Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the extent that
any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have so made the amount of
such Revolving Credit Advance available to the Administrative
Agent, such Revolving Credit Lender agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount together
with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by
the Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the 
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender
shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the
account of the Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so
paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Letter of Credit
Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of
this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the
Letter of Credit Advance made by the Issuing Bank shall be
reduced by such amount on such Business Day.

(d) Obligations Absolute. The Obligations of the
Borrower under this Agreement, any Letter of Credit Agreement
and any other agreement or instrument relating to any Letter of
Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such
Letter of Credit Agreement and such other agreement or
instrument under all circumstances, including, without
limitation, the following circumstances:
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this
Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, any Letter of
Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other
agreement or instrument relating thereto (this Agreement
and all of the other foregoing being, collectively, the
"L/C Related Documents");

(ii) any change in the time, manner or place of
payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the
Obligations

<PAGE>57

of the Borrower in respect of any L/C Related Document or
any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to
departure from all or any of the L/C Related Documents;

(iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or 
other right that the Borrower may have at any time against
any beneficiary or any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or
any Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any such
transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or any other
Person, whether in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the L/C Related Documents or any unrelated
transaction;

(iv) any statement or any other document presented
under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement
therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

(v) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that
does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit except for any payment made upon the Issuing Bank's
gross negligence or willful misconduct;
(vi) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
Collateral or other collateral, or any release or amendment
or waiver of or consent to departure from the Guaranty or
any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of
the Borrower in respect of the L/C Related Documents; or

(vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including,
without limitation, any other circumstance that might
otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
of, the Borrower or a guarantor.

(e) Compensation. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit
Lender a commission on such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
average daily aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of
Credit outstanding from time to time at a rate per annum equal 
to the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate Advances in effect
from time to time payable in arrears quarterly on the last
Business Day of each March, June, September and December,
commencing June 30, 1994, and on the Termination Date.

(ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Bank, for
its own account, a fronting and issuance fee on the average
daily aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit
outstanding from time to time at the rate of 1/8 of 1% per
annum, payable in

<PAGE>58

arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing June 30, 1994, and on the
Termination Date.

SECTION 2.17. Defaulting Lenders. (a) In the event 
that, at any one time, (i) any Lender shall be a Defaulting
Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a Defaulted
Advance to the Borrower and (iii) the Borrower shall be required
to make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document
to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the
Borrower may, so long as no Default shall occur or be continuing
at such time and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, set off and otherwise apply the Obligation of the Borrower
to make such payment to or for the account of such Defaulting
Lender against the Obligation of such Defaulting Lender to make
such Defaulted Advance. In the event that the Borrower shall so
set off and otherwise apply the Obligation of the Borrower to
make any such payment against the Obligation of such Defaulting
Lender to make any such Defaulted Advance on any date, the
amount so set off and otherwise applied by the Borrower shall
constitute for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents an Advance by such Defaulting Lender made on such date
under the Facility pursuant to which such Defaulted Advance was 
originally required to have been made pursuant to Section 2.01. 
Such Advance shall be a Base Rate Advance and shall be
considered, for all purposes of this Agreement, to comprise part
of the Borrowing in connection with which such Defaulted Advance
was originally required to have been made pursuant to Section
2.01, even if the other Advances comprising such Borrowing shall
be Eurodollar Advances on the date such Advance is deemed to be
made pursuant to this subsection (a). The Borrower shall notify
the Administrative Agent at any time the Borrower reduces the
amount of the Obligation of the Borrower to make any payment
otherwise required to be made by it hereunder or under any other
Loan Document as a result of the exercise by the Borrower of its
right set forth in this subsection (a) and shall set forth in
such notice (A) the name of the Defaulting Lender and the
Defaulted Advance required to be made by such Defaulting Lender
and (B) the amount set off and otherwise applied in respect of
such Defaulted Advance pursuant to this subsection (a). Any
portion of such payment otherwise required to be made by the 
Borrower to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender which
is paid by the Borrower, after giving effect to the amount set
off and otherwise applied by the Borrower pursuant to this
subsection (a), shall be applied by the Agent as specified in
subsection (b) or (c) of this Section 2.17.

(b) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any
Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender
shall owe a Defaulted Amount to the Administrative Agent or any
of the

<PAGE>59

other Lenders and (iii) the Borrower shall make any payment
hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the
Administrative Agent may, on its behalf or on behalf of such
other Lenders and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable 
law, apply at such time the amount so paid by the Borrower to or
for the account of such Defaulting Lender to the payment of each
such Defaulted Amount to the extent required to pay such
Defaulted Amount. In the event that the Administrative Agent
shall so apply any such amount to the payment of any such
Defaulted Amount on any date, the amount so applied by the
Administrative Agent shall constitute for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents payment, to such extent,
of such Defaulted Amount on such date. Any such amount so
applied by the Administrative Agent shall be retained by the
Administrative Agent or distributed by the Administrative Agent
to such other Lenders, ratably in accordance with the respective
portions of such Defaulted Amounts payable at such time to the
Administrative Agent and such other Lenders and, if the amount
of such payment made by the Borrower shall at such time be
insufficient to pay all Defaulted Amounts owing at such time to
the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders, in the following
order of priority:
(i) first, to the Administrative Agent for any
Defaulted Amount then owing to the Administrative Agent;
and

(ii) second, to any other Lenders for any Defaulted
Amounts then owing to such other Lenders, ratably in
accordance with such respective Defaulted Amounts then
owing to such other Lenders.

Any portion of such amount paid by the Borrower for the account
of such Defaulting Lender remaining, after giving effect to the
amount applied by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
subsection (b), shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as
specified in subsection (c) of this Section 2.17.

(c) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any
Lender shall be Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender 
shall not owe a Defaulted Advance or a Defaulted Amount and
(iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender
shall be required to pay or distribute any amount hereunder or
under any other Loan Document to or for the account of such
Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower or such other Lender shall
pay such amount to the Administrative Agent to be held by the
Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, in escrow or the Administrative Agent shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, hold in escrow
such amount otherwise held by it. Any funds held by the

<PAGE>60

Administrative Agent in escrow under this subsection (c) shall
be deposited by the Administrative Agent in an account with
Citibank, in the name and under the control of the
Administrative Agent, but subject to the provisions of this
subsection (c). The terms applicable to such account, including 
the rate of interest payable with respect to the credit balance
of such account from time to time, shall be Citibank's standard
terms applicable to escrow accounts maintained with it. Any
interest credited to such account from time to time shall be
held by the Administrative Agent in escrow under, and applied by
the Administrative Agent from time to time in accordance with
the provisions of, this subsection (c). The Administrative
Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
apply all funds so held in escrow from time to time to the
extent necessary to make any Advances required to be made by
such Defaulting Lender and to pay any amount payable by such
Defaulting Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, as and when
such Advances or amounts are required to be made or paid and, if
the amount so held in escrow shall at any time be insufficient
to make and pay all such Advances and amounts required to be
made or paid at such time, in the following order of priority:
(i) first, to the Administrative Agent for any amount
then due and payable by such Defaulting Lender to the
Administrative Agent hereunder;

(ii) second, to any other Lenders for any amount then
due and payable by such Defaulting Lender to such other
Lenders hereunder, ratably in accordance with such
respective amounts then due and payable to such other
Lenders; and

(iii) third, to the Borrower for any Advance then
required to be made by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to a
Commitment of such Defaulting Lender.

In the event that such Defaulting Lender shall, at any time,
cease to be a Defaulting Lender, any funds held by the
Administrative Agent in escrow at such time with respect to such
Defaulting Lender shall be distributed by the Administrative 
Agent to such Defaulting Lender and applied by such Defaulting
Lender to the Obligations owing to such Lender at such time
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents ratably in
accordance with the respective amounts of such Obligations
outstanding at such time.

(d) The rights and remedies against a Defaulting
Lender under this Section 2.17 are in addition to other rights
and remedies which the Borrower may have against such Defaulting

<PAGE>61

Lender with respect to any Defaulted Advance and which the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such
Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Amount.

hereby appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers

thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by the 
Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or
collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be
required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but
shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the
instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions
shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes;
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be
required to take any action which exposes the Administrative
Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this
Agreement or applicable law. The Administrative Agent agrees to
give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice and other
report given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

<PAGE>110

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees, shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in
connection with the Loan Documents, except for its or their own 
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of
the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: (i)
may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the
Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and
Acceptance entered into by the Lender that is the payee of such
Note, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as
provided in Section 8.07; (ii) may consult with legal counsel
(including counsel for the Borrower), independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith
by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants

execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any
lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with the Loan Documents or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall
incur no liability under or in respect of the Loan Documents by
acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument
or writing (which may be by telecopier, telegram, cable or
telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the
proper party or parties.

SECTION 7.03. Citicorp and Affiliates. With respect
to its Commitments, the Advances made by it and the Note issued
to it, Citicorp shall have the same rights and powers under the
Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term 
"Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated, include Citicorp hereunder in its individual
capacity. Citicorp and its affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept
investment banking engagements from and generally engage in any
kind of business with, the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries and
any Person who may do business with or own securities of the
Borrower or any such Subsidiary, all as if Citicorp were not the
Administrative Agent and without any duty to account therefor to
the Lenders.

SECTION 7.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon

<PAGE>111

the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on the
financial statements referred to in Section 4.01(f) and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, 
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent
or any other Lender and based on such documents and information
as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement.

SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to
indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed
by the Borrower), ratably according to the respective principal
amounts of the Advances then owing to each of them (or if no
Advances are at the time outstanding or if any Advances are then
owing to Persons which are not Lenders, ratably according to the
respective amounts of their Commitments), from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of
any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action 
taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under the Loan
Documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative
Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of unpaid fees
owing to the Administrative Agent, and any out-of-pocket
expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Administrative
Agent, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or
legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, any
Loan Document, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is
not paid such fees, or the Administrative Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses, by the Borrower.
SECTION 7.06. Successor Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the Required
Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required
Lenders shall have the right to appoint, with the consent of the
Borrower, a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a
Lender, or if no Lender consents to act as Administrative Agent
hereunder, an institution that would be permitted to be an
Eligible Assignee hereunder. If no successor Administrative
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and
shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the
retiring

<PAGE>112

Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the
Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative Agent,
then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall
be a commercial bank that is acceptable to the Borrower (which 
shall not unreasonably withhold its approval). Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent thereunder
by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under
the Loan Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent.

SECTION 7.07. Co-Agents. Each Lender hereby
acknowledges that each of the Co-Agents has no liability
hereunder other than in its capacity as Lender.

waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes, nor

any material portion of the Collateral other than the Liens
created by the Collateral Documents and the Liens permitted by
Section 5.02(a) or (iv) amend this Section 8.01 and (b) no
amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed
by the Required Lenders and each Lender that has a Commitment
affected by such amendment, waiver or consent, (i) increase the

additional obligations, (ii) reduce the principal of, or
interest on, the Notes held by such Lender or any fees or other

Lender or (iii) postpone any date fixed for any mandatory
reduction in the Commitment of such Lender or for any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Notes held by such Lender or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder to such Lender or
(iv) change the order of application of any prepayment set forth 
in Section 2.05 in any manner that materially affects such
Lender; provided further that no amendment, waiver or consent
shall, unless in writing and signed by the Issuing Bank in
addition to the Lenders required above to take such action,
affect the rights or obligations of the Issuing Bank; and
provided further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in
addition to the Lenders required above to take such action,
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under
this Agreement or any Note.

telex answerback or delivered to the cable company,
respectively, except that notices and communications to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Article II or VII shall not be 
effective until received by the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 8.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the
part of any Lender, or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and
no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any Note
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The
remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
remedies provided by law.

SECTION 8.04. Costs; Expenses. (a) The Borrower
agrees to pay on demand all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and

<PAGE>114

expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification
and amendment of the Loan Documents and the other documents to
be delivered hereunder (including, without limitation, (A) all
due diligence, transportation, computer, duplication, appraisal, 
audit and insurance expenses and fees and expenses of
consultants engaged with the prior consent of the Borrower
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (B) the
reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the
Administrative Agent with respect thereto, with respect to
advising the Administrative Agent as to its rights and
responsibilities, or the protection or preservation of rights or

negotiations with the Borrower or with other creditors of the
Borrower arising out of any Default or any events or
circumstances that may give rise to a Default and with respect
to presenting claims in, monitoring or otherwise participating
in any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding
affecting creditors' rights generally and any proceeding
ancillary thereto). The Borrower further agrees to pay on
demand all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the
enforcement of the Loan Documents and the other documents to be 
delivered hereunder, whether in action, suit, litigation, any
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding affecting
creditors' rights generally or otherwise (including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and reasonable expenses of
counsel for the Administrative Agent and each Lender with
respect thereto) and expenses in connection with the enforcement
of rights under this Section 8.04(a).

(b) If any payment of principal of any Eurodollar
Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a
Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for
such Advance, as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to
Section 2.11 or 2.15, acceleration of the maturity of the Notes
pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, the Borrower
shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to
the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate
such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses which 
it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, including,
without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason
of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

(c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender and each of
their affiliates and their officers, directors, employees,
agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and
against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or
awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out
of or in connection with or by

<PAGE>115

reason of (or in connection with the preparation for a defense
of) any investigation, litigation or proceeding arising out of,
related to or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not an Indemnified
Party is a party thereto, whether or not the transactions 
contemplated hereby are consummated and whether or not any such
claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the
Borrower or any other person, except (i) to the extent such
claim, damage, loss, liability or expense (x) is found in a
final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction (a "Final Judgment") to have resulted from such
Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct or
(y) arises from any legal proceedings commenced against any
Lender by any other Lender (in its capacity as such and not as
Administrative Agent), and (ii) in the case of any litigation
brought by the Borrower (A) seeking a judgment against any
Indemnified Party for any wrongful act or omission of such
Indemnified Party and (B) in which a Final Judgment is rendered
in the Borrower's favor against such Indemnified Party, the
provisions of this paragraph will not be available to provide
indemnification for any damage, loss, liability or expense
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with such
litigation described in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section
8.04(c).

SECTION 8.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (i) the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default
and (ii) the making of the request or the granting of the
consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare the Notes due and payable
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, each Lender is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing
by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower
to such Lender now or hereafter existing under this Agreement
and the Note or Notes held by such Lender, whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such
Note or Notes and although such obligations may be unmatured. 
Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any
such set-off and application shall be made by such Lender,
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such set-off and application; provided further
that no Lender shall exercise any such right of set-off or any
other right of set-off without the prior consent of the
Administrative Agent. The rights of each Lender under this
Section 8.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which
such Lender may have.

SECTION 8.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall
become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Borrower 

<PAGE>116

and the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent
shall have been notified by each Bank that such Bank has
executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each
Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that 
the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights
hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders.

SECTION 8.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) 
Each Lender may and, if demanded by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.14, will assign to one or more banks or other entities
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of
its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes
held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment
shall be of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all
rights and obligations under and in respect of one or more
Facilities (ii) the amount of the Commitment of the assigning
Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment
(determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than
$10,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in 
excess thereof, or shall be an assignment to another Lender or
an assignment of all of the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations hereunder and under the Notes, (iii) each such
assignment shall be to another Lender, an Affiliate of the
assigning Lender or to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) each such
assignment made as a result of a demand by the Borrower pursuant
to Section 2.14 shall be arranged by the Borrower after
consultation with the Administrative Agent and shall be either
an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the
assigning Lender under this Agreement or an assignment of a
portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with
another such assignment or other such assignments that together
cover all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender
under this Agreement, (v) no Lender shall be obligated to make
any such assignment as a result of a demand by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.14 unless and until such Lender shall have
received one or more payments from either the Borrower or one or
more Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to 
the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owin
to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the
date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts
payable to such Lender under this Agreement and (vi) the parties
to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the
Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note
or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and
recordation fee of $3,000 from the assignee. Upon such
execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after
the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance,
(x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have

<PAGE>117

been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y)
the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to
such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be 
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the
remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be
a party hereto).

(b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee
thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other
parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such
Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in
or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of
this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with 
respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or the
performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms
that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with
copies of the financial statements referred to in Section
4.01(f) and such other documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision
to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at
the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee
confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee
appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under
this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by 
the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations
which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be
performed by it as a Lender.

(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its
address referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment
and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register
for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders
and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances
owing under each Facility to, each Lender from time to time (the
"Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the

<PAGE>118

Administrative Agent, and the Lenders may treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available
for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing
that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with any Note or Notes
subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if
such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in
substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such
Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained
therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to
the Borrower. Within five Business Days after its receipt of
such notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the
surrendered Note or Notes a new Note or Notes to the order of
such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment
under each Facility assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a
Commitment hereunder under such Facility, a new Note to the
order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the 
Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes
shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate
principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be
dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and
shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1,
Exhibit A-2 or Exhibit A-3, as the case may be.

(e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or
more banks or other entities in or to all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances
owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided,
however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
(including. without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower
hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain
the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, 
(iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any such
participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or
waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to
any departure by the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent
that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce or postpone
any date fixed for payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each
case to the extent subject to such participation.

<PAGE>119

(f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment
or participation or proposed assignment or participation
pursuant to this Section 8.07, disclose to the assignee or
participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information
relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on 
behalf of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such
disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant shall agree pursuant to an agreement substantially
in the form of Exhibit N to preserve the confidentiality of any
confidential information relating to the Borrower received by it
from such Lender.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in
this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances owing to
it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal
Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

SECTION 8.08. Governing Law; Submission to
Jurisdiction. (a) This Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the 
State of New York.

(b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in New York City,
and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by
law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Subject to
the foregoing and to paragraph (c) below, nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any right that any party hereto may 
otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement against any other party hereto in the courts of
any jurisdiction.

(c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any New York
State or Federal court and the defense of an inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.

<PAGE>120

(d) The Borrower agrees that service of process may
be made on the Borrower by personal service of a copy of the
summons and complaint or other legal process in any such suit,
action or proceeding, or by registered or certified mail
(postage prepaid) to the address of the Borrower specified in 
Section 8.02, or by any other method of service provided for
under the applicable laws in effect in the State of New York.

SECTION 8.09. No Liability of the Issuing Bank. The
Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any
beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect
to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither the Issuing Bank
nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or
responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of
Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee
in connection therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or
genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if
such documents should prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by the
Issuing Bank against presentation of documents that do not
comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure
of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to
the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever 
in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit,
except that the Borrower shall have a claim against the Issuing
Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall be liable to the Borrower, to
the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages
suffered by the Borrower that the Borrower proves were caused by
(i) the Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence in
determining whether documents presented under any Letter of
Credit comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) the
Issuing Bank's willful failure to make lawful payment under a
Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a draft and
certificates strictly complying with the terms and conditions of
the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear
on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the
contrary.

SECTION 8.10. Execution in Counterparts. This 
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature
page to this Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE
BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, THE

<PAGE>121

ADVANCES OR THE ACTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, OR ANY
LENDER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR
ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused 
this Agreement to be executed by their respective officers
thereunto duly authorized, as of the date first above written.
