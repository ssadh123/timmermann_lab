ARTICLE III

THE REVOLVING CREDIT

SECTION 3.01. Commitments to Lend. Each Bank severally agrees,
on the terms and conditions set forth in this Amended Credit Agreement, to make
loans to Navistar Financial from time to time on and after the Amendment
Effective Date and before the Termination Date; provided that the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of all Committed Loans made by such Bank under
this Agreement shall not at any time exceed the amount of such Bank's
Commitment. Each Borrowing under this Section shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of $10,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 in the
case of any Domestic Borrowing and $25,000,000 or any larger multiple of
$1,000,000 in the case of any Euro-Dollar Borrowing (except that any such
Borrowing may be in the aggregate amount available in accordance with Section
3.05(e)). Each Borrowing under this Section shall be made from the several
Banks ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments. Within the
foregoing limits, Navistar Financial may borrow under this Section, repay, or
to the extent permitted by Section 3.12, prepay Loans and reborrow under this
Section at any time on and after the Amendment Effective Date and before the
Termination Date.

SECTION 3.02. Notice of Committed Borrowing. (a) Navistar
Financial shall give the Administrative Agent notice, substantially in the form
of Exhibit B-1 or B-2 hereto, as applicable (a "Notice of Committed
Borrowing"), (i) no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of
each Base Rate Borrowing, (ii) no later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on
the second Domestic Business Day prior to each CD Borrowing and (iii) no later
than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Euro-Dollar Business Day
prior to each Euro-Dollar Borrowing, specifying:

(i) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Domestic
Business Day in the case of a Domestic Borrowing or a Euro-Dollar Business
Day in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing,

(ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing, which shall comply 
with the provisions of Section 3.01,

35
<PAGE> 42
(iii) whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to be CD Loans,
Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans; provided that Loans to be made less
than 30 days before the Termination Date shall not be CD Loans, and

(iv) in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, the duration of the
Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing, subject to the provisions of
the definition of "Interest Period".

If Navistar Financial wishes to borrow Loans of different types or different
maturities on the same day, such Notice of Committed Borrowing shall include
the foregoing information with respect to each such Borrowing. If any
statement set forth in any numbered paragraph of any Notice of Committed
Borrowing ceases to be true and correct at any time before the time of any
Borrowing to which such Notice of Borrowing relates, Navistar Financial will
give the Administrative Agent immediate notice thereof. Promptly upon receipt
of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank of the contents
thereof.

(b) If, by 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the maturity date
of any Borrowing outstanding under this Agreement, Navistar Financial has not
given the Administrative Agent either (i) a Notice of Borrowing for a Borrowing
on such maturity date pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 3.02 or
Section 3.03(f) or (ii) a notice stating that Navistar Financial does not
intend to borrow hereunder on such maturity date, then, notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection (a) of this Section, Navistar Financial shall be
deemed to have given the Administrative Agent a Notice of Committed Borrowing
specifying that Navistar Financial intends to borrow on such maturity date an
aggregate amount of Base Rate Loans equal to the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of Loans maturing on such date.

SECTION 3.03. Money Market Borrowings.

(a) The Money Market Option. In addition to Committed Borrowings
pursuant to Section 3.01, at any time that Navistar Financial has Debt Ratings
of BB or higher by S&P and Ba3 or higher by Moody's, Navistar Financial may, as
set forth in this Section, request the Banks on and after the Amendment
Effective Date and before the Termination Date to make Money Market Loans to
Navistar Financial. The Banks may, but shall have no obligation to, make such
offers and Navistar Financial may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any
such offers in the manner set forth in this Section.

36
<PAGE> 43
(b) Money Market Quote Request. When Navistar Financial wishes
to request offers to make Money Market Loans under this Section, it shall
transmit to the Administrative Agent by telex or facsimile transmission a Money
Market Quote Request substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto so as to be
received no later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the fifth
Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the date of Borrowing proposed therein, in
the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the Domestic Business Day next preceding the
date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction
(or, in either case, such other time or date as Navistar Financial and the
Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the
Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first
LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be
effective) specifying:

(i) the proposed date of Borrowing, which shall be a Euro-Dollar
Business Day in the case of a LIBOR Auction or a Domestic Business Day in
the case of an Absolute Rate Auction,

(ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing, which shall be
$10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 in the case of a Money
Market Absolute Rate Borrowing and $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of
$1,000,000 in the case of a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing,

(iii) the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, 
subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period, and

(iv) whether the Money Market Quotes requested are to set forth a
Money Market Margin or a Money Market Absolute Rate.

Navistar Financial may request offers to make Money Market Loans for more than
one Interest Period in a single Money Market Quote Request. No Money Market
Quote Request shall be given within five Euro-Dollar Business Days (or such
other number of days as Navistar Financial and the Administrative Agent may
agree) of any other Money Market Quote Request.

(c) Invitation for Money Market Quotes. Promptly upon receipt of
a Money Market Quote Request, the Administrative Agent shall send to the Banks
by telex or facsimile transmission an Invitation for Money Market Quotes
substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, which shall constitute an
invitation by Navistar Financial to each Bank

37
<PAGE> 44
to submit Money Market Quotes offering to make the Money Market Loans to which
such Money Market Quote Request relates in accordance with this Section.

(d) Submission and Contents of Money Market Quotes. (i) Each
Bank may submit a Money Market Quote containing an offer or offers to make
Money Market Loans in response to any Invitation for Money Market Quotes. Each
Money Market Quote must comply with the requirements of this subsection (d) and
must be submitted to the Administrative Agent by telex or facsimile
transmission at its offices specified in or pursuant to Section 9.01 not later

prior to the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y)
9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case
of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as
Navistar Financial and the Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and
shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market
Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which
such change is to be effective); provided that Money Market Quotes submitted by
the Administrative Agent (or any affiliate of the Administrative Agent) in the
capacity of a Bank may be submitted, and may only be submitted, if the
Administrative Agent or such affiliate notifies Navistar Financial of the terms
of the offer or offers contained therein not later than (x) one hour prior to
the deadline for the other Banks, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) 15
minutes prior to the deadline for the other Banks, in the case of an Absolute
Rate Auction. Subject to Section 3.05 and Article VII, any Money Market Quote
so made shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of the
Administrative Agent given on the instructions of Navistar Financial.

(ii) Each Money Market Quote shall be in substantially the form
of Exhibit E hereto and shall in any case specify:

(A) the proposed date of Borrowing,

(B) the principal amount of the Money Market Loan for which each
such offer is being made, which principal amount (w) may be greater than or
less than the Commitment of the quoting Bank, (x) must be $5,000,000 or a
larger multiple of $1,000,000, (y) may not exceed the principal amount of
Money Market Loans for which offers were requested, and (z) may be subject

38
<PAGE> 45
of Money Market Loans for which offers being made by such quoting Bank may
be accepted,

(C) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, the margin above or below the

(specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) to be added to or subtracted
from such base rate,

per annum (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) (the "Money Market

A Money Market Quote may set forth up to five separate offers by the quoting
Bank with respect to each Interest Period specified in the related Invitation
for Money Market Quotes.

(iii) Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded if it:

(A) is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit E hereto or
does not specify all of the information required by subsection (d)(ii);

(B) contains qualifying, conditional or similar language except
as permitted by subsection (d)(ii)(B)(z) of this Section;

(C) proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth
in the applicable Invitation for Money Market Quotes; or

(D) arrives after the time set forth in subsection (d)(i).

(e) Notice to Navistar Financial. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify Navistar Financial of the terms (x) of any Money Market Quote
submitted by a Bank that is in accordance with subsection (d) and (y) of any
Money Market Quote that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a
previous Money Market Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the same
Money Market Quote Request. Any such subsequent Money Market Quote shall be
disregarded by the Administrative Agent unless such subsequent Money Market
Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Money

39
<PAGE> 46
Market Quote. The Administrative Agent's notice to Navistar Financial shall
specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which
offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the related
Money Market Quote Request, (B) the respective principal amounts and Money
Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered
and (C) if applicable, limitations on the aggregate principal amount of Money
Market Loans for which offers in any single Money Market Quote may be accepted.

(f) Acceptance and Notice by Navistar Financial. Not later than
10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day prior
to the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the
proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in
either case, such other time or date as Navistar Financial and the
Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the
Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first
LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be
effective), Navistar Financial shall notify the Administrative Agent of its
acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to
subsection (e). In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice of Money
Market Borrowing") shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto and
shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period
that are accepted. Navistar Financial may accept any Money Market Quote in
whole or in part; provided that:

(i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing
may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Money Market
Quote Request,

(ii) the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing must be
$10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 in the case of a Money
Market Absolute Rate Borrowing and $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of
$1,000,000 in the case of a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing,

(iii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of 
ascending Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the 
case may be, and

(iv) Navistar Financial may not accept any offer that is 
described in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with 
the requirements of this Agreement.

40
<PAGE> 47
If any statement set forth in any numbered paragraph of any Notice of Money
Market Borrowing ceases to be true and correct at any time before the time of
any Borrowing to which such Notice of Borrowing relates, Navistar Financial
will give the Administrative Agent immediate notice thereof. Promptly upon
receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank whose
Money Market Quote has been accepted in connection with such Borrowing of the
contents of such notice.

(g) Allocation by Administrative Agent. If offers are made by
two or more Banks with the same Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute
Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the
amount in respect of which such offers are accepted for the related Interest
Period, the principal amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such
offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such
Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples of $1,000,000, as the Administrative
Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of
such offers. Determinations by the Administrative Agent of the amounts of
Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

SECTION 3.04. Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans.

(a) Promptly after a Notice of Borrowing is given (or, pursuant
to Section 3.02(b), deemed to have been given) to the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such
Bank's ratable share (if any) of each Borrowing specified therein and such
Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by Navistar Financial.

(b) Not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of
each Borrowing, each Bank participating therein shall (except as provided in
subsection (d) of this Section) make available its share of such Borrowing, in
Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the
Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01. Unless the
Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in
Section 3.05 has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will make the
funds so received from the Banks available to Navistar Financial at the
Administrative Agent's aforesaid address.

(c) Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from a Bank,
at the Administrative Agent's address referred to in Section 9.01, prior to the
date of any Borrowing (or in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing, prior to

41
<PAGE> 48
12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing), stating that
such Bank will not make available its share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that such Bank will make its
share available on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsections
(b) and (d) of this Section and, in reliance on such assumption, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled (but shall not be required) to make a
corresponding amount available to Navistar Financial on such date. If the
Administrative Agent makes such corresponding amount available and such Bank
does not in fact make its share available on such date, the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from
such Bank or from Navistar Financial (and for such purpose shall be entitled to
charge such amount to any account maintained by Navistar Financial with the
Administrative Agent), in each case together with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date of such Borrowing to but excluding the date
such funds are repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate
for such day; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines that a
higher rate is required to recover its cost of funding such corresponding
amount and notifies such Bank and Navistar Financial of such higher rate, such
interest shall be calculated at such higher rate. If the Administrative Agent
recovers such amount from such Bank, then the corresponding amount made
available by the Administrative Agent to Navistar Financial shall be treated as
a Loan by such Bank to Navistar Financial as of the date it was made available
to Navistar Financial. If the Administrative Agent recovers such amount from
Navistar Financial, then such amount shall be treated as a temporary advance by
the Administrative Agent to Navistar Financial pursuant to this subsection (c),
and not as a Loan by such Bank.

(d) If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on a day on which
Navistar Financial is to repay all or any part of an outstanding Loan from such
Bank, such Bank shall apply the proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment
and only an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount being
borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be made available by such Bank to
the Administrative Agent as provided in subsection (b) of this Section, or
remitted by Navistar Financial to the Administrative Agent as provided in
Section 3.13(a), as the case may be.

SECTION 3.05. Conditions to Borrowings. The obligation of each
Bank to make a Loan on the occasion of each Borrowing is subject to the
satisfaction of the following conditions:

42

(or be deemed, pursuant to Section 3.02(b), to have received) a Notice of
Borrowing as required by Section 3.02 or 3.03, as the case may be;

(b) the fact that, immediately after such Borrowing, (A) in the 
case of a Refunding Borrowing, no Event of Default and no other Default
referred to in clause (a) of Section 7.01 shall have occurred and be 
continuing and (B) in the case of any other Borrowing, no Event of Default
specified in clause (f) or (g) of Section 7.01 and no Default referred to 
in any other clause of Section 7.01 shall have occurred and be continuing;

(c) the fact that the representations and warranties of each
Credit Party contained in the Credit Documents to which it is a party will
be true on and as of the date of such Borrowing, except (A) in the case of
any Borrowing, the representation and warranty set forth in Section 5.04(d)
and (B) in the case of any Refunding Borrowing, the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.05 and any other representation (except
any representation set forth in Section 5.06 or 5.08 with respect to a
Federal Priority Lien) as to which (1) the consequences of such
representation being incorrect shall be susceptible of remedy in all
material respects, (2) such Credit Party is diligently attempting to remedy
such consequences and (3) no Event of Default specified in Section 7.01(g)
with respect to such representation shall have occurred;

(d) unless Navistar Financial shall have Debt Ratings of BBB- or
higher by S&P and Baa3 or higher by Moody's, the fact that Third Party
Senior Obligations shall not exceed the Asset Base immediately after such
Borrowing but giving effect to any use of the proceeds thereof on the date
of such Borrowing or on the next succeeding Domestic Business Day;

(e) the fact that, immediately after such Borrowing, the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans will not exceed the
aggregate amount of the Commitments; and

(f) with respect to any Money Market Borrowing, the fact that
Navistar Financial shall have Debt Ratings of BB or higher by S&P and Ba3
or higher by Moody's.

43
<PAGE> 50
SECTION 3.06. Notes. (a) The Loans of each Bank shall be
evidenced by a single Note payable to the order of such Bank for the account of
its Applicable Lending Office in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of such Bank's Loans.

(b) Each Bank may, by notice given to Navistar Financial and the
Administrative Agent, request that its Loans of a particular type be evidenced
by a separate Note in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of such Loans. Each such Note shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A
hereto, with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that it evidences
solely Loans of the relevant type. Each reference in this Agreement to the
"Note" of such Bank shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such
Notes, as the context may require.

(c) Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to Section 2.01(b),
the Administrative Agent shall forward such Note to such Bank. Each Bank shall
record the date, amount, type and maturity of each Loan made by it and the date
and amount of each payment of principal made by Navistar Financial with respect
thereto, and may, if such Bank so elects in connection with any transfer or
enforcement of its Note, endorse on the schedule forming a part thereof
appropriate notations to evidence the foregoing information with respect to
each such Loan then outstanding; provided that any failure of any Bank to make
any such recordation or endorsement, or any error in any such recordation or
endorsement, shall not affect the obligations of Navistar Financial under this
Agreement or under such Note. Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by
Navistar Financial so to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of
its Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when required.

SECTION 3.07. Maturity of Loans. Each Loan included in any
Borrowing shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and
payable, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing.

SECTION 3.08. Interest Rates. (a) Each Base Rate Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from
the date such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to
the sum of the Base Rate and the Base Rate Margin. The "Base Rate Margin"
means a rate per annum determined in accordance with Schedule 1 hereto. Such
interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof.
Subject to subsection (h) of this Section, any overdue principal of and, to the
extent permitted by law, overdue interest on any

44
<PAGE> 51
Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid
at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the rate otherwise applicable
to Base Rate Loans for such day.

(b) Each CD Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of the CD Margin plus the applicable Adjusted CD Rate. Such
interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and,
if such Interest Period is longer than 90 days, 90 days after the first day
thereof. Subject to subsection (h) of this Section, any overdue principal of
and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest on any CD Loan shall bear
interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal
to the sum of 1% plus the higher of (i) the sum of the CD Margin plus the
Adjusted CD Rate applicable to such Loan and (ii) the rate applicable to Base
Rate Loans for such day.

"CD Margin" means a rate per annum determined in accordance with
Schedule 1 hereto.

The "Adjusted CD Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means a
rate per annum determined pursuant to the following formula:

[ CDBR ]*
ACDR = [ ---------- ] + AR
[ 1.00 - DRP ]

ACDR = Adjusted CD Rate
CDBR = CD Base Rate
DRP = Domestic Reserve Percentage
AR = Assessment Rate

__________
* The amount in brackets being rounded upwards, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%

The "CD Base Rate" applicable to any Interest Period is the rate
of interest determined by the Administrative Agent to be the average (rounded
upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) of the prevailing rates
per annum bid at 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (or as soon thereafter as
practicable) on the first day of such Interest Period by two or more New York
certificate of deposit dealers of recognized standing for the purchase at face
value from each CD Reference Bank of its certificates of deposit in an amount
comparable to the unpaid principal

45
<PAGE> 52
amount of the CD Loan of such CD Reference Bank to which such Interest Period
applies and having a maturity comparable to such Interest Period.

"Domestic Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage
(expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for
determining the maximum reserve requirement (including without limitation any
basic, supplemental or emergency reserves) for a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five billion Dollars in
respect of new non-personal time deposits in Dollars in New York City having a
maturity comparable to the related Interest Period and in an amount of $100,000
or more. The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the
effective date of any change in the Domestic Reserve Percentage.

"Assessment Rate" means for any day the annual assessment rate in
effect on such day which is payable by a member of the Bank Insurance Fund
classified as adequately capitalized and within supervisory subgroup "A" (or a
comparable successor assessment risk classification) within the meaning of 12
C.F.R. Section 327.3(e) (or any successor provision) to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (or any successor) for such Corporation's (or such
successor's) insuring time deposits at offices of such institution in the
United States. The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as
of the effective date of any change in the Assessment Rate.

(c) Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin plus the applicable
Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate. Such interest shall be payable for
each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is
longer than three months, three months after the first day thereof.

"Euro-Dollar Margin" means a rate per annum determined in
accordance with Schedule 1 hereto.

The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any
Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded
upwards, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (i) the
applicable London Interbank Offered Rate by (ii) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar
Reserve Percentage.

Period means the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16
of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which deposits in Dollars are
offered to each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the London interbank
market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two Euro-Dollar Business Days
before the first day of such Interest Period in an amount approximately equal
to the principal amount of the Euro-Dollar Loan of such Euro-Dollar Reference
Bank to which such Interest Period is to apply and for a period of time
comparable to such Interest Period.

"Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage
(expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for
determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five billion Dollars in
respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in respect of any other category of
liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or
other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to
United States residents). The Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate shall be
adjusted automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in the
Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

(d) Subject to subsection (h) of this Section, any overdue
principal of or, to the extent permitted by law, interest on any Euro-Dollar
Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day from and including
the date payment thereof was due to but excluding the date of actual payment,
at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the applicable Euro-Dollar
Margin plus the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next
higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (i) the average (rounded upward, if necessary,
to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which one
day (or, if such amount due remains unpaid more than three Euro-Dollar Business
Days, then for such other period of time not longer than six months as the
Administrative Agent may select) deposits in Dollars in an amount approximately
equal to such overdue payment due to each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks
are offered to such Euro-Dollar Reference Bank in the London interbank market
for the applicable period determined as provided above by (ii) 1.00 minus the
Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage (or, if the circumstances described in clause
(i) or (ii) of Section 4.01 shall exist, at a rate per annum

47
<PAGE> 54
equal to the sum of 1% plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such
day).

(e) Subject to Section 4.01, each Money Market LIBOR Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest
Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London
Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with
Section 3.08(c) as if the related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed
Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by the
Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 3.03. Each Money Market
Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal
to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by the Bank making such Loan in
accordance with Section 3.03. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than
three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof.
Subject to subsection (h) of this Section, any overdue principal of or interest
on any Money Market Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day
until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the rate applicable
to Base Rate Loans for such day.

(f) The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate
applicable to the Loans under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall
give prompt notice to Navistar Financial and the participating Banks by telex
or cable of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If and when requested by
Navistar Financial, the Administrative Agent shall advise Navistar Financial of
the CD Base Rate quoted by each CD Reference Bank and the London Interbank
Offered Rate quoted by each Euro-Dollar Reference Bank.

(g) Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best efforts to furnish
quotations to the Administrative Agent as contemplated by this Section 3.08.
If any Reference Bank does not furnish a timely quotation, the Administrative
Agent shall determine the relevant interest rate on the basis of the quotation
or quotations furnished by the remaining Reference Bank or Banks or, if none of
such quotations is available on a timely basis, the provisions of Section 4.01
shall apply.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section to the
contrary, if (i) notice of any Federal Priority Lien shall have been filed and
Navistar Financial

48
<PAGE> 55
is unable to borrow a Refunding Borrowing hereunder solely by reason of such
filing, and (ii) the principal of any Loan shall become due within a period of
30 days after such filing and shall not be paid on the date when due, any
interest accruing on such Loan between the day it becomes due and the end of
such 30-day period shall be due and payable on the last day of such 30-day
period.

SECTION 3.09. Fees. (a) Navistar Financial shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks ratably a facility fee at the
Facility Fee Rate (determined daily in accordance with Schedule 1 hereto).
Such facility fee shall accrue (i) from and including the Amendment Effective
Date to but excluding the Termination Date (or earlier date of termination of
the Commitments in their entirety) on the daily aggregate amount of the
Commitments (whether used or unused) and (ii) from and including the
Termination Date or such earlier date of termination to but excluding the date
the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety on the daily aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Loans. Accrued facility fees shall be paid quarterly
on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 and on the date when
the Commitments terminate in their entirety (and, if later, the date the Loans
shall be repaid in their entirety).

(b) On the Amendment Effective Date, Navistar Financial shall pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a fee calculated by
multiplying such Bank's Commitment by the applicable Participation Fee
Percentage determined with reference to such Bank's Initial Commitment in
accordance with Schedule 4 hereto.

SECTION 3.10. Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments.
Navistar Financial may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to
the Administrative Agent, terminate the Commitments at any time if no Loans are
outstanding at such time, or ratably reduce from time to time by an aggregate
amount of $25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 the aggregate amount
of the Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
the Loans. Any such reduction or termination shall be permanent, and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of any such reduction or
termination under this Section.

SECTION 3.11. Mandatory Termination of Commitments. The
Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date, and any Loans then
outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable
on such date.

49
<PAGE> 56
SECTION 3.12. Optional Prepayments. (a) Subject in the case of
any Fixed Rate Borrowing to Section 3.14, Navistar Financial may (i) upon
notice to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City
time) on the date of prepayment, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing (or any Money
Market Borrowing bearing interest at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans
pursuant to Section 4.01), (ii) upon at least two Domestic Business Days'
notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay any CD Borrowing or (iii) upon at
least two Euro-Dollar Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay
any Euro-Dollar Borrowing, in each case in whole at any time, or from time to
time in part in amounts aggregating $10,000,000 or any larger multiple of
$1,000,000, by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued
interest thereon to the date of prepayment (which shall be a Domestic Business
Day, in the case of any prepayment of a Domestic Borrowing, and a Euro-Dollar
Business Day, in the case of any prepayment of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing). Each
such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the
several Banks included in such Borrowing.

(b) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this Section,
Navistar Financial may not prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of
any Money Market Loan before the maturity thereof.

(c) Upon receiving a notice of prepayment under this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof
and of such Bank's ratable share of such prepayment and such notice shall not
thereafter be revocable by Navistar Financial.

SECTION 3.13. General Provisions as to Payments. (a) Except as
provided in Section 3.04(d), Navistar Financial shall make each payment of
principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees under this Agreement, not
later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date when due, in Federal or
other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Administrative Agent
at its address referred to in Section 9.01 for the account of the Banks. The
Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable share,
if any, of each such payment received by the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Banks. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on,
the Domestic Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic
Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Domestic Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans or Money Market LIBOR Loans shall be due on
a day which is not a Euro-Dollar

50
<PAGE> 57
Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls
in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be
the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal
of, or interest on, the Money Market Absolute Rate Loans shall be due on a day
which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day. If the date for any
payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest
thereon shall be payable for such extended time.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from Navistar Financial prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Banks hereunder that Navistar Financial will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that Navistar Financial has made such payment
in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the
extent that Navistar Financial shall not have so made such payment, each Bank
shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays
such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

SECTION 3.14. Funding Losses. (a) If Navistar Financial makes
any payment of principal with respect to any CD Loan or Euro- Dollar Loan
pursuant to Section 3.12 on any day other than the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto and the applicable notice of prepayment shall contain
a certification by a Senior Officer that such prepayment is required in order
for Navistar Financial to comply with the covenant contained in Section 6.10,
Navistar Financial shall pay to each Bank on demand an amount calculated as set
forth in Schedule 3 hereto. The parties hereto agree that such amount is a
reasonable estimate of the funding loss that will be incurred by each Bank in
connection with any such prepayment and is not a penalty.

(b) If (i) Navistar Financial makes any payment of principal with
respect to any Fixed Rate Loan (pursuant to Article III, IV or VII or otherwise
(except any prepayment to which subsection (a) of this Section applies) on any
day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or the
end of an applicable period fixed pursuant to Section 3.08(d), (ii) Navistar
Financial fails

51
<PAGE> 58
to borrow or prepay any Fixed Rate Loan after notice has been given to any Bank
in accordance with Section 3.04(a) or 3.12(c) or (iii) Navistar Financial
requires a Bank to assign its rights with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan to a
substitute Bank pursuant to Section 4.05 on any day other than the last day of
the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, Navistar Financial shall reimburse
each Bank on demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by any
existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including (without
limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits
from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after such
payment or failure to borrow or required assignment, provided that such Bank
shall have delivered to Navistar Financial a certificate as to the amount of
such loss or expense.

SECTION 3.15. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based
on the Prime Rate under this Agreement shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All other
interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding
the last day).

SECTION 3.16. Withholding Tax Exemption. At least five Domestic
Business Days before the first date on which interest or fees are payable under
this Amended Credit Agreement for the account of any Bank, each Bank that is
not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state
thereof agrees that it will deliver to each of Navistar Financial and the
Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal
Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case that such Bank is
entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each Bank
which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to deliver to each of
Navistar Financial and the Administrative Agent two additional copies of such
form (or a successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or
becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the
most recent form so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions
or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by Navistar Financial or the
Administrative Agent, in each case certifying that such Bank is entitled to
receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event
(including without

52
<PAGE> 59
limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the
date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all
such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank from duly completing
and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank advises Navistar
Financial and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving such
payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income
tax.

ARTICLE IV

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
AFFECTING FIXED RATE LOANS

SECTION 4.01. Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or
Unfair. If on or before the first day of any Interest Period for any Fixed
Rate Borrowing:

(i) the Administrative Agent is advised by the CD Reference Banks
or the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks or the Majority Banks that deposits in
Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to such Banks in
the relevant market for such Interest Period, or

(ii) in the case of a Committed Borrowing, the Majority Banks 
advise the Administrative Agent that the Adjusted CD Rate or the Adjusted 
London Interbank Offered Rate, as the case may be, as determined by the
Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Banks of funding their CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may
be, for such Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to Navistar
Financial and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies
Navistar Financial that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no
longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make CD Loans or Euro-Dollar
Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended. Unless Navistar Financial
notifies the Administrative Agent at least one Domestic Business Day before the
date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has been given
before the date of such suspension stating that it elects not to borrow on such
date, (i) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing
shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such Fixed Rate
Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR Loans
comprising such Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from and including
the first day

53
<PAGE> 60
to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the
rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day.

SECTION 4.02. Illegality. If, on or after October 31, 1994 the
adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any
Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its
Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and
Navistar Financial, whereupon the obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar
Loans shall be suspended until such Bank notifies Navistar Financial and the
Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no
longer exist. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office
if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in
the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such
Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any
of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such
notice, Navistar Financial shall immediately prepay in full the then
outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan, together with
accrued interest thereon. Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar
Loan, Navistar Financial shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal
amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable
contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and
such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

SECTION 4.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If, on or
after (x) October 31, 1994, in the case of any Committed Loan or any obligation
to make Committed Loans or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in
the case of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with

54
<PAGE> 61
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:

(i) shall subject any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) to
any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Fixed Rate Loans, its
Notes or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans, or shall change the basis
of taxation of payments to any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of
the principal of or interest on its Fixed Rate Loans or any other amounts
due under this Agreement in respect of its Fixed Rate Loans or its
obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans (except for changes in the rate of tax
on the overall net income of such Bank or its Applicable Lending Office
imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Bank's principal executive office
or Applicable Lending Office is located); or

(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit, deposit insurance assessment or similar requirement (including,
without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding (A) with respect to any CD
Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Domestic Reserve
Percentage or Assessment Rate and (B) with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan
any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve
Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall
impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on the United
States market for certificates of deposit or the London interbank market
any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note or its
obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans;

and if such Bank determines that the result of any of the foregoing is to
increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or
maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement
or under its Note with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be
material, then such Bank may calculate the additional amount or amounts which
will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction and deliver to
Navistar Financial (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a request for
payment thereof accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis

55
<PAGE> 62
for calculating the amount requested (which may include any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods). Navistar Financial shall pay the amount so
requested directly to such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending
Office within 15 days after receiving such request and accompanying statement.

(b) If any Bank shall determine that, on or after October 31,
1994, the adoption of any applicable law, guideline, rule or regulation
regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any applicable law, guideline,
rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change or clarification
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending
Office) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or
not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Bank's or its Parent's capital as a consequence of such Bank's undrawn
Commitment to make Loans under this Agreement to a level below that which such
Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then such Bank may
calculate the additional amount or amounts which will compensate such Bank (or
its Parent) for such reduction and deliver to Navistar Financial (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent) from time to time a request for payment thereof
accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for calculating the amount
so requested (which may include any reasonable averaging and attribution
methods). Navistar Financial shall pay such amount so requested directly to
such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office within 15 days after
receiving such request and accompanying statement.

(c) Each Bank will promptly notify Navistar Financial and the
Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring on or
after October 31, 1994, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant
to this Section and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if
such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank. Any dispute between Navistar Financial and a
Bank with respect to a request for compensation under this Section shall be
settled, subject to the provisions of Section 9.06, by Navistar Financial
directly with such Bank.

56
<PAGE> 63
SECTION 4.04. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Fixed Rate
Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans has been
suspended pursuant to Section 4.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation
under Section 4.03 with respect to its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans and
Navistar Financial shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior
notice to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the
provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until
such Bank notifies Navistar Financial that the circumstances giving rise to
such suspension or demand for compensation no longer apply:

(a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as CD
Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, shall be made instead as
Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable
contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate Loans of the other Banks),
and

(b) after each of its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case
may be, has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be
applied to repay such Fixed Rate Loan shall be applied to repay its Base
Rate Loans instead.

SECTION 4.05. Substitution of Bank. If any Bank demands
compensation under Section 4.03 with respect to its CD Loans or Euro- Dollar
Loans, Navistar Financial shall have the right to seek a substitute commercial
bank or banks (which may be one or more of the Banks) and to require the Bank
demanding such compensation to assign its Commitment and sell its Loans to such
substitute bank or banks without recourse or warranty (except as to such Bank's
own actions) pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement substantially
in the form of Exhibit M hereto; provided that (i) each such substitute bank
agrees to assume the portion of such Commitment to be assigned to it and pays
the purchase price for its portion of such Loans agreed with the assignor (or,
failing such agreement, a purchase price in the amount of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Loans of the assignor and accrued interest
thereon to the date of payment), (ii) the assignor receives payment of all
facility fees accrued for its account under this Agreement to the date such
assignment becomes effective and (iii) the substitution thereof is approved by
the Administrative Agent (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).
When such assignment or assignments become effective, (A) the Commitment of the
assignor shall terminate, (B) the Commitment of each Assignee which is a Bank
(if any) shall be increased by the portion of the

57
<PAGE> 64
assignor's Commitment assigned to it and (C) each Assignee which is not a Bank
(if any) shall become a Bank for purposes hereof with a Commitment in an amount
equal to the portion of the assignor's Commitment assigned to it. Upon the
consummation of any such assignment, the assignor, the Administrative Agent and
Navistar Financial shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a
new Note is issued to the Assignee. No such assignment shall affect the rights
and obligations of the assignor or any Assignee under this Agreement with
respect to the period prior to the effectiveness of such assignment. If the
Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or
a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which interest or fees
are payable under this Agreement for its account, deliver to Navistar Financial
and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with
Section 3.16.

SECTION 6.14. Sales of Receivables. (a) Navistar Financial will
not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, sell or otherwise transfer
Receivables or undivided interests therein or rights to receive income
therefrom to any Subsidiary of Navistar Financial unless each of the following
conditions is satisfied:

(i) (A) at the time of such sale or transfer, the Collateral
Trustee, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, shall have a perfected
Lien, subject to no other Lien except as permitted by Section 6.16,
pursuant to the NFC Security Agreement in all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of such Subsidiary and all of Navistar Financial's rights in
respect of all intercompany obligations from time to time payable by such
Subsidiary to Navistar Financial and (B) prior to or contemporaneously with
such sale or transfer, such Subsidiary shall have granted to Navistar
Financial, pursuant to an Intercompany Security Agreement substantially in
the form of Exhibit O-1 hereto (with such changes, consistent with the

74
<PAGE> 81
any interest that accrues after, or would accrue but for, the commencement
of any case, proceeding or other action relating to the bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization of such Subsidiary) on any loan or advance
made by Navistar Financial to such Subsidiary or any note issued by such
Subsidiary to Navistar Financial and all obligations from time to time
payable by such Subsidiary to Navistar Financial under the Tax Allocation
Agreement (except prior to the occurrence of an NFRRC Clean-up Event, with
respect to NFRRC) and the Intercompany Security Agreement to which such
Subsidiary is a party, and all action necessary to create and perfect, or
that the Collateral Trustee may reasonably request to create, preserve,
perfect, confirm or validate, the Lien of Navistar Financial thereunder
shall have been taken; provided that, if a relevant rating agency objects
to the granting by a Special Purpose Subsidiary of a Lien in favor of
Navistar Financial on any specific asset of such Special Purpose
Subsidiary, notwithstanding a good faith effort by Navistar Financial to
overcome such objection, such asset may be excluded from such Lien if the
remaining assets subject to such Lien include all of such Special Purpose
Subsidiary's rights to receive payments from the purchasers of Receivables
transferred by it or from any trust to which Receivables shall be or have
been transferred by it or to which a security interest in such Receivables
shall have been granted;

(ii) substantially contemporaneously with such sale or
transfer, such Subsidiary shall (A) in the case of any such Subsidiary
including TRIP, transfer such Receivables or rights to receive the income
therefrom or undivided interests therein to one or more third parties or
(B) in the case of TRIP, grant a security interest therein to the ABCP
Trust to secure Warehousing Debt, provided that, notwithstanding the
provisions of this clause (ii), Navistar Leasing may, upon receipt of any
notice from the Administrative Agent specified in the proviso to clause

sell or transfer any Lease Receivables or Investments in Leases to Harco
Leasing upon an assumption by Harco Leasing of Secured Intercompany
Obligations of Navistar Leasing or receipt of cash or a combination
thereof; and

(iii) such Subsidiary shall be a party to the Tax Allocation
Agreement; provided that (A) the Tax Allocation Agreement, as applicable to
any Special Purpose Subsidiary, may be amended to provide for

75
<PAGE> 82
payments by such Special Purpose Subsidiary to Navistar Financial on terms
no less favorable to Navistar Financial than the Fourth Addendum to the Tax
Allocation Agreement dated April 26, 1993 among Navistar Transportation,
Navistar Financial and NFSC, as originally executed and (B) NFRRC will not
be required to become a party to the Tax Allocation Agreement until an
NFRRC Clean-up Event shall have occurred.

(b) If at any time the Administrative Agent notifies Navistar
Financial that, in the opinion of the Required Banks, the cumulative effect of
sales of Retail Receivables by Navistar Financial has been to cause the average
quality of the outstanding Retail Receivables retained by Navistar Financial to
be materially inferior to the average quality of the outstanding Retail
Receivables sold by Navistar Financial, thereafter neither Navistar Financial
nor any of its Subsidiaries will sell or otherwise transfer any Retail
Receivables to any Person without the consent of the Required Banks; provided
that the foregoing will not prohibit (i) any sale that Navistar Financial or
such Subsidiary was legally obligated to make before it received such notice
from the Administrative Agent or (ii) (A) any sale of Retail Receivables by
Navistar Financial to TRIP or any sale of finance lease receivables by Harco

contemporaneously with such sale, the Retail Receivables or finance lease
receivables, as the case may be, so sold are sold or pledged by TRIP to the
ABCP Trust, (B) any sale of finance lease receivables by Harco Leasing to
Navistar Leasing if, substantially contemporaneously with such sale, such

sold or pledged by TRIP to the ABCP Trust or (C) any sale of Retail Receivables
by TRIP to the ABCP Trust, provided, in the case of each of subclauses (A), (B)
and (C), that the sum of (x) the aggregate face amount of all outstanding
commercial paper issued by the ABCP Trust, (y) the aggregate principal amount
of all loans to the ABCP Trust outstanding under the ABCP Liquidity Facility
Agreement and (z) the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding owner trust
certificates issued by the ABCP Trust does not exceed $311,000,000.

Financial will not (and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to) prepay,
purchase or otherwise retire any subordinated Debt of Navistar Financial prior
to the stated maturity thereof unless at the time of such prepayment, purchase

time exceed $20,000,000;

(iv) Liens created on marketable securities and deposits made in 
the ordinary course of business to secure Navistar Financial's obligations

Security Agreement. If, notwithstanding such efforts, the Person holding the
obligations secured by such Lien ("Senior Secured Obligations") shall require
the physical delivery of such marketable securities, then (i) concurrently with
any such physical delivery pursuant to Section 2.06(c) of the NFC Security
Agreement, Navistar Financial will provide such Person and any Person who will

Intercompany Security Agreement, Navistar Financial shall cause the relevant
Credit Party to comply with procedures comparable to the foregoing.

corporation and no Default would exist immediately after such transaction is

perfect, or that the Collateral Trustee may reasonably request, in order to

of reducing the amount owed by any Subsidiary of Navistar Financial to Navistar
Financial under any Intercompany Loan Agreement or permitting the release,
substitution or sharing of any Collateral subject to the Lien of any
Intercompany Security Agreement, without the consent of the Supermajority
Banks; and (v) deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee,

Affiliates.

(b) The rate which Navistar Financial charges Navistar
Transportation for any period with respect to Wholesale Notes under the Master

for the fact that, under Navistar Transportation's programs for its dealers as
in effect from time to time, Wholesale Notes financed by Navistar Financial may
bear no interest during certain periods, such as in-transit periods or free
floor plan periods) shall not be less than the prevailing rate of interest
charged to Navistar Transportation's dealers generally on interest-bearing
Wholesale Notes financed by Navistar Financial during the same period
(calculated on a daily average basis if such prevailing rate changes during

THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

SECTION 8.01. Appointment and Authorization; Limitations on
Responsibility. Each Bank irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers under the Credit Documents as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms thereof, together with all such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto.

SECTION 8.02. Administrative Agent and Affiliates. Morgan shall
have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may
exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and Morgan and its affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with, Navistar
Financial or any Subsidiary or affiliate of Navistar Financial as if it were
not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

SECTION 8.03. Action by Administrative Agent. The obligations of
the Administrative Agent hereunder are

97
<PAGE> 104
only those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action
with respect to any Default, except as expressly provided in Article VII.

SECTION 8.04. Consultation with Experts. The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Navistar Financial),
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

SECTION 8.05. Liability of Administrative Agent. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it in connection with any Credit Document (i) with the consent
or at the request of the Required Banks (or, to the extent expressly provided
herein, the Majority Banks) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence
or willful misconduct. Except for action expressly required of the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to act under this Agreement unless it
shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks in advance, by deposit of
cash indemnification or otherwise, against any and all liability and expense
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action, except to the extent that such liability or expense is caused by its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
any of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents
or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire
into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection
with any Credit Document or any other document referred to therein or any
transaction contemplated thereby, including without limitation any borrowing
hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any Credit Party under any Credit Document or other document
referred to therein; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in

enforceability or sufficiency of any Credit Document or any other document
referred to therein or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection
herewith or (v) the value or sufficiency of the Collateral described in any
Security Document or the perfection of any security interest created
thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not incur any 

98
<PAGE> 105

liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate,
statement, or other writing (which may be a bank wire, telex, facsimile
transmission or similar writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed
by the proper party or parties. The Administrative Agent may employ agents and
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any such agent or attorney-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

SECTION 8.06. Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default unless the
Administrative Agent has received notice from a Bank, Navistar International,
Navistar Transportation or Navistar Financial referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default".
Upon receipt of such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly advise
Navistar Financial and each Bank as to the contents thereof.

SECTION 8.07. Indemnification. Without limiting the obligations of
Navistar Financial under Section 9.03, each Bank shall, ratably in accordance
with its Commitment (or, if the Commitments shall have expired or been
terminated, ratably in accordance with the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
its Note), indemnify the Administrative Agent, its affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not
reimbursed by Navistar Financial) against any cost, expense (including, without
limitation, counsel fees and disbursements and other costs and expenses which
Navistar Financial is obligated to pay under Section 9.03), claim, demand,
action, loss or liability (except such as result from such indemnitees' gross
negligence or willful misconduct) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur at
any time (whether before or after the repayment of the Loans) in connection
with any Credit Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to
therein or any transaction contemplated thereby or the enforcement of any of
the terms thereof or of any such other document, or any action taken or omitted
by such indemnitees thereunder.

SECTION 8.08. Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each
Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at 

99
<PAGE> 106

the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking any
action under any Credit Document. The Administrative Agent shall not be
required to keep informed as to the performance or observance by any Credit
Party of any Credit Document or any document referred to or provided for
therein, or to make inquiry of, or to inspect the assets or books of, any
Credit Party, Navistar Transportation or Navistar International. Except for
notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be
furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Bank
with any credit or other information concerning any Credit Party, Navistar
Transportation or Navistar International which may come into the possession of
the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates.

SECTION 8.09. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and Navistar
Financial. Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right
to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, with the consent of Navistar
Financial, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks, and
shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, which shall be a major international banking institution
or an Affiliate thereof. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such
successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the
retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure
to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was Administrative Agent.

SECTION 8.10. Co-arrangers Not Liable. Nothing in this Agreement shall
impose upon any Co-arranger, in such capacity, any duties or responsibilities
whatsoever.

damages, costs (including without limitation, settlement costs) and expenses of
any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such
Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) or other dispute brought or
threatened relating to or arising out of any Credit Document or any actual or
proposed use of proceeds of Loans under this Agreement, provided that (i) no
Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified under this Agreement for such
Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) Navistar Financial shall not be liable
under this subsection (c) in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction or any other dispute, for (A) the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm (and one local counsel) for all the
Banks and all Affiliates of the Banks or (B) the fees and expenses of more than
one separate firm (and one local counsel) for the Administrative Agent (in
connection with its actions in such capacity under this Agreement) unless, in
either case,

102
<PAGE> 109
representation by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests.

SECTION 9.04. Sharing of Set-Offs. (a) Each Bank agrees that if it shall,
by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive
payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due
with respect to any Note held by it which is greater than the proportion
received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and
interest due with respect to any Note held by such other Bank, the Bank
receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
participations in the Notes held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments
shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and
interest with respect to the Notes held by the Banks shall be shared by the
Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of
any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to
apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of
Navistar Financial other than its indebtedness under the Notes. Navistar
Financial agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Note, whether or not
acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off
or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as
if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of Navistar Financial
in the amount of such participation.

(b) Participations shall be purchased and sold pursuant to this Section on
the assumption that each Bank will retain all payments previously received by
it with respect to its Loans. If any Bank is subsequently required to repay
any such amount by reason of the provisions of any applicable bankruptcy law,
each Bank will make such further adjustments as may be required to accomplish
the purposes of this Section.

SECTION 9.05. Amendments and Waivers. Unless otherwise expressly provided
herein, any provision of this Agreement or the Notes may be amended or waived
if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by
Navistar Financial and the Required Banks and, if the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent or any Co-arranger (in its capacity as a Co-arranger
hereunder or as a Bank under Section 9.07(c)(v)) are affected thereby, the
Administrative Agent or such Co-arranger, as the case may be; provided that (i)
no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by the Supermajority Banks,
permit the release, substitution or sharing of any Collateral except as
otherwise expressly

103
<PAGE> 110
provided in the Security Documents and (ii) no such amendment or waiver shall,
unless signed by all the Banks, (A) increase the Commitment of any Bank or
subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (B) reduce the principal of or
rate of interest on any Loan or any fees under this Agreement, (C) postpone the
date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees
under this Agreement, or for any termination of any Commitment, or (D) change
the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of the Notes, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or
any of them to take any action under this Section or any other provision of any
Credit Document or change the percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of Secured Obligations or the number or class of Secured Parties which
shall be required for the Secured Parties or any of them to take any action
under the NFC Security Agreement. For purposes of determining, as of any date,
the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of the Notes which shall have consented to any amendment or waiver of any
Credit Document or authorized any other action thereunder, a Bank which has,
prior to such date, granted a participation in its Loans hereunder may
subdivide its vote hereunder to reflect the voting instructions given to it by
its Participants in accordance with Section 9.07(b) with respect to such
amendment, waiver or other action.

SECTION 9.06. Good Faith Determinations. (a) Each determination of an
interest rate, cost or other rate or amount to be made by the Administrative
Agent or a Bank hereunder, and each certification by a Bank pursuant to Section
3.14(b) shall be conclusive, if made reasonably and in good faith. The
Administrative Agent or Bank making such a determination or certification
shall, at Navistar Financial's request, advise Navistar Financial in reasonable
detail as to the basis on which such determination or certification was made.

(b) Without limiting the generality of subsection (a) of this Section,
Navistar Financial agrees that any Bank making a determination or certification
referred to in subsection (a) with respect to a CD Loan, Euro-Dollar Loan or
Money Market LIBOR Loan (except any such determination required to be made in
accordance with Schedule 3 hereto pursuant to the first sentence of Section
3.14(a)) may assume (without regard for the actual facts), solely for purposes
of such determination or certification, that such Bank:

(i) will fund such Loan for the relevant Interest Period with a matching
deposit on which it pays

104
<PAGE> 111
interest at the CD Base Rate or London Interbank Offered Rate
applicable to such Loan;

(ii) will fund any related reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement with a deposit on which it also pays interest at such CD Base
Rate or London Interbank Offered Rate; and

(iii) will maintain any such Loan and such deposits at the Applicable
Lending Office of such Bank or, if such Bank has more than one branch or
other office (an "Office") at which such Bank, in its discretion,
determines that it could maintain such Loan and such deposits without
disadvantage to itself (other than by reason of the operation of this
Section), then at whichever of such Offices will minimize the amount, if
any, payable to such Bank as a result of such determination or
certification;

provided that, if such Bank in fact maintains such Loan at an Office in the
United States and thereby avoids withholding taxes which would otherwise be
imposed by the United States on payments to such Bank hereunder, such Bank's
Office for purposes of this Section shall be its Office in the United States at
which such Loan is actually maintained.

SECTION 9.07. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, except that Navistar Financial may
not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of all the Banks.

(b) Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more commercial banks (each a
"Participant") participating interests in its Loans. In the event of any such
grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not
upon notice to Navistar Financial and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall
remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and
Navistar Financial and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may
grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain
the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of Navistar
Financial under this Agreement including, without limitation, the right to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this

105
<PAGE> 112
Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that, with
respect to the portion of such Bank's Loans in which such participating
interest is granted, such Bank will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement
that (A) permits the release, substitution or sharing of any Collateral except
as otherwise expressly provided in the Security Documents, (B) increases the
Commitment of such Bank or subjects such Bank to any additional obligation, (C)
reduces the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan of such Bank or any
fees payable to such Bank under this Agreement, (D) postpones the date fixed
for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan of such Bank or any
fees payable to such Bank under this Agreement, or for any termination of such
Bank's Commitment, or (E) changes the percentage of the Commitments or of the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Banks, which
shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under Section
9.05 or any other provision of any Credit Document or changes the percentage of
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Secured Obligations or the number or
class of Secured Parties which shall be required for the Secured Parties or any
of them to take any action under the NFC Security Agreement. Subject to
subsection (e) below, Navistar Financial agrees that each Participant shall, to
the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits
of Article IV with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or
other transfer which is not permitted by Section 4.05 or subsection (c) or (d)
below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent
of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b).

(c) Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more commercial banks (each
such commercial bank and each substitute bank to which any Commitment is
assigned pursuant to Section 4.05, an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part
of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and its Note, and
such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an
Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit M
hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and subject
to) the subscribed consent of Navistar Financial and the Administrative Agent
(which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided that (i) unless
otherwise agreed by Navistar Financial and the Administrative Agent, each
assignment pursuant to this subsection (c) shall be in a minimum amount of
$10,000,000 or, if lower, the transferor Bank's entire Commitment; (ii) unless
otherwise agreed by Navistar Financial and the Administrative Agent, no Bank
that is also a party to the

106
<PAGE> 113
ABCP Liquidity Facility Agreement may assign all of its commitment under this
Agreement to any Person unless it simultaneously assigns all of its commitment
under the ABCP Liquidity Facility Agreement to such Person or to another Bank;
(iii) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, an assignment by
any Bank to an Affiliate of such Bank will be permitted without the consent of
Navistar Financial but with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); (iv) any such assignment may, but
need not, include rights of the transferor Bank in respect of outstanding Money
Market Loans; and (v) notwithstanding any of the foregoing, unless otherwise
agreed by Navistar Financial and the Administrative Agent, after giving effect
to all of the transferor Bank's assignments (x) the Commitment of any Bank that
is a Co-arranger hereunder shall not be less than $50,000,000 (or such lower
amount as would reflect proportionately any reductions of the total
Commitments) and (y) unless the transferor Bank is transferring such Bank's
entire Commitment, the Commitment of any Bank that is not a Co-arranger shall
not be less than $15,000,000 (or such lower amount as would reflect
proportionately any reductions of the total Commitments). Upon execution and
delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor
Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor
Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement
and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as
set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be
released from its obligations under this Agreement to a corresponding extent,
and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the
consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor
Bank, the Administrative Agent and Navistar Financial shall make appropriate
arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee. In
connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank shall pay to the
Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in
the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first
date on which interest or fees are payable under this Agreement for its
account, deliver to Navistar Financial and the Administrative Agent
certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 3.16.

(d) Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights under
this Agreement and its Note to a

107
<PAGE> 114
Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank
from its obligations under this Agreement.

(e) No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Bank's rights shall
be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 4.03 than such Bank
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred,
unless such transfer is made with Navistar Financial's prior written consent or
pursuant to Section 4.05 or by reason of the provisions of Section 4.02 or 4.03
requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under
certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such
greater payment did not exist.

(f) If any Bank which is acting as a Reference Bank assigns its Note to an
unaffiliated institution, such Bank shall thereupon cease to be a Reference
Bank and the Administrative Agent shall, in consultation with Navistar
Financial and with the consent of the Required Banks, appoint another bank to
act as a Reference Bank hereunder.

SECTION 9.08. Consent to NFC Security Amendment, Intercompany Security
Amendments, Amendment to NFRRC Intercompany Advance Agreement and Release of
NFSC Seller Certificate. Each Bank (in its capacity as a Bank hereunder and in
any other capacity in which it may now or hereafter be a Secured Party) (i)
consents and agrees to the terms of the NFC Security Amendment and the
Intercompany Security Amendments, (ii) authorizes the Collateral Trustee to
enter into the NFC Security Amendment on its behalf, (iii) authorizes Navistar
Financial to enter into each of the Intercompany Security Amendments, (iv)
consents to the Amended and Restated Intercompany Advance Agreement dated as of
May 3, 1994 between NFRRC and Navistar Financial, substantially in the form
delivered to the Banks prior to November 3, 1994 and (v) instructs the
Collateral Trustee to release the NFSC Seller Certificate (as defined in the
NFC Security Agreement) from the Lien of the NFC Security Agreement upon
receipt by the Collateral Trustee of (A) a certificate of a Responsible Officer
(as defined in the NFC Security Agreement) stating that the NFSC Transfer (as
defined in Schedule 2 hereto) has occurred and (B) the seller certificate to be
issued by the New Dealer Note Trust (as defined in Schedule 2 hereto) in
connection with the NFSC Transfer representing NFSC's senior and subordinated
interests therein, accompanied by duly executed and undated instruments of
transfer and assignment in blank so as to be in suitable form for transfer by
endorsement and delivery by the Collateral Trustee.

108
<PAGE> 115
SECTION 9.09. Limitation on Interest. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or in any Note to the contrary, Navistar Financial's obligation to
pay interest with respect to each Note shall be limited to the extent (and only
to the extent) required so that Navistar Financial will not be obligated to pay
interest with respect thereto at a rate higher than the maximum rate which the
relevant Bank or other recipient of such interest is permitted to charge or
collect with respect thereto under the provisions of law applicable to such
Bank or other recipient.

SECTION 9.10. Severalty of Obligations. The obligations of the Banks under
this Agreement are several. Any failure by any Bank to carry out its
obligations under this Agreement shall not relieve any other Bank, the
Administrative Agent or Navistar Financial of any of its obligations under this
Agreement, nor shall any Bank be responsible for the obligations of, or any
action taken or omitted by, any other Bank under this Agreement.

SECTION 9.11. Headings. The table of contents and the headings of
Articles, Sections and subsections have been included herein for convenience
only and should not be considered in interpreting this Agreement.

SECTION 9.12. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate when the
Commitments have expired or been terminated and all principal of and interest
on the Notes and all other amounts due under this Agreement have been paid in
full; provided that the provisions of Sections 3.14, 4.03, 8.07 and 9.03 shall
not be affected by any such termination.

SECTION 9.13. New York Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and
each Note shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
State of New York. Navistar Financial hereby submits to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York and of any court of the State of New York sitting in New York County
for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Navistar
Financial irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding
brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

109
<PAGE> 116
SECTION 9.14. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF NAVISTAR FINANCIAL, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE CO-ARRANGERS AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

SECTION 9.15. Counterparts; Integration. This Amendment may be signed in
any number of counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any
and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the
subject matter hereof.

<PAGE> 117
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned parties hereto have caused this
Amendment to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the

LIQUIDITY AGREEMENT, dated as of November 7, 1994, among NFC ASSET
TRUST, a Delaware business trust (the "Borrower"), the several banks and
financial institutions parties to this Agreement (each, a "Lender"), the
co-arrangers named on Schedule I (the "Co- Arrangers") and CHEMICAL BANK, a New
York banking corporation, as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such
capacity, together with any successor or assign in such capacity, the
"Administrative Agent").

The parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall
have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in Appendix A unless
otherwise defined herein.

1.2 Other Definitional Provision. Unless otherwise specified
therein, all terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in the Basic Documents or any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto.

(b) As used herein and in the Basic Documents, and in any certificate
or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto, accounting terms relating
to the Borrower not defined in subsection 1.1, and accounting terms partly
defined in subsection 1.1, to the extent not defined, shall have the respective
meanings given to them under GAAP.

(c) The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Section, subsection,
Schedule and Exhibit references are to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified.

(d) The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms.

SECTION 2. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF COMMITMENTS 
AND LOANS 

2.1 Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each
Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to make loans ("Loans") to the
Borrower from time to time during the period from the Effective Date to and
including the Expiry Date of such Lender's Commitment in an aggregate principal
amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the amount of such Lender's
Commitment, which Loans shall be Revolving Loans, Refunding Loans, Non-Pro Rata
Revolving Loans or Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans, as designated by the
Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof. During the period from the

<PAGE> 7
2

Effective Date to the Expiry Date of any Commitment the Borrower may use such
Commitment by borrowing, prepaying the Loans in whole or in part and
reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

(b) The Revolving Loans may from time to time be (i) Eurodollar Loans
or (ii) ABR Loans, as determined by the Borrower and notified to the
Administrative Agent in accordance with subsections 2.3 and 2.11; provided that
all Revolving Loans made pursuant to the same Borrowing shall be of the same
Type. Each Revolving Loan made by any Lender shall be converted on such
Lender's Expiry Date to, and be treated for all purposes thereafter as, a
Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan.

(c) The Refunding Loans shall be ABR Loans. The Borrower shall pay
each Refunding Loan in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Trust
Agreement to the extent that funds are available therefor; provided that the
final maturity date of each Refunding Loan shall be the Final Scheduled Maturity
Date. Refunding Loans may be converted to Revolving Loans pursuant to
subsection 2.11(a).

(d) The Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loans and Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account
Loans may from time to time be (i) Eurodollar Loans or (ii) ABR Loans, as
determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in
accordance with subsections 2.6 and 2.11. The Borrower shall pay each Non-Pro
Rata Revolving Loan in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Trust
Agreement to the extent that funds are available therefor; provided that the
final maturity date of each Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan shall be the Final
Scheduled Maturity Date. The Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans made by any
Lender shall mature on the Expiry Date of such Lender; provided that all or a
portion of each Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loan may be converted to a Non-Pro
Rata Revolving Loan in accordance with subsection 2.5(f).

(e) No Lender shall be required to make a Revolving Loan if the
conditions precedent set forth in subsection 5.3 have not been satisfied.

(f) No Lender shall be required to make a Refunding Loan if the
conditions precedent set forth in subsection 5.4 have not been satisfied. Each
Refunding Loan shall be made by the Lenders notwithstanding (i) any set-off,
counterclaim or defense to payment which the Lenders may have against the
Borrower or (ii) except as set forth in subsection 5.4, the occurrence of a
Default or Event of Default.

2.2 Evidence of Indebtedness. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally
promises to pay to each Lender on the Final Scheduled Maturity Date the unpaid
principal amount of each Loan in immediately available funds at the office of
the Administrative Agent. The Borrower hereby further agrees to pay

<PAGE> 8
3

interest in immediately available funds at the office of the Administrative
Agent on the unpaid principal amount of such Loans from time to time from the
date hereof until payment in full thereof at the rates per annum, and on the
dates, set forth in subsection 2.13.

(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the
appropriate lending office of such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such
lending office of such Lender from time to time, including amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such lending office of such Lender from time to
time under this Agreement.

(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to
subsection 10.6(d), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and
subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, the Type of each Loan made and the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the
amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the
Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

(d) The entries made in the Register and accounts maintained pursuant
to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection 2.2 shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such account, such
Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in
any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable
interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

2.3 Pro Rata Revolving Loans; Procedures for Pro Rata Revolving
Loans. Borrowings of Revolving Loans may be made on any Business Day. When
the Borrower wishes to borrow Revolving Loans, it shall give the Administrative
Agent (a) in the case of a Borrowing of ABR Loans, irrevocable written or
telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, on the requested Borrowing Date, or (b) in the case of a Borrowing
of Eurodollar Loans, irrevocable written notice not later than 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, three Working Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in
each case specifying (i) the requested Borrowing Date (which in the case of a
Borrowing of ABR Loans shall be a Business Day and in the case of a Borrowing
of Eurodollar Loans shall be a Working Day), (ii) the amount to be borrowed,
which shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to $10,000,000 (or such
lesser amount as may be needed to satisfy the Borrower's obligation under
subsection 6.7 or as is remaining available under the Aggregate Commitments)
and

<PAGE> 9
4

integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) that the Borrowing
is to be of Revolving Loans and whether the Borrowing is to be initially
maintained as ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans. Upon receipt of such notice from
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender
thereof. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.4 and 2.5 with respect
to Non-Extending Lenders and Downgraded Lenders, each Lender will make its
Commitment Percentage of all ABR Loans requested to be made on any Borrowing
Date available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at
the office of the Administrative Agent specified in subsection 10.2 in funds
immediately available to the Administrative Agent (a) prior to 3:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the requested Borrowing Date, if a notice from the
Administrative Agent requesting such Borrowing is received by such Lender prior
to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the requested Borrowing Date, or (b)
prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following such
requested Borrowing Date, if a notice from the Administrative Agent requesting
such Borrowing is received by such Lender after 12:00 Noon, New York City time,
on the requested Borrowing Date. Except as otherwise provided in subsections
2.4 and 2.5 with respect to Non-Extending Lenders and Downgraded Lenders, each
Lender will make its Commitment Percentage of all Eurodollar Loans requested to
be made on any Borrowing Date available to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Borrower at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in
subsection 10.2 prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date
requested by the Borrower in funds immediately available to the Administrative
Agent. Subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in
subsection 5.3, and except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.4 and 2.5,
the Administrative Agent will make each Borrowing of Revolving Loans available
to the Borrower by directly depositing in the Collateral Account, for
application in accordance with the Collateral Trust Agreement on the relevant
Borrowing Date, the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the
Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

2.4 Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loans by Non-Extending Lenders. Subject to
the limitations imposed by subsection 2.1, if any Lender shall not have
consented to the extension of its Expiry Date pursuant to subsection 2.23 (such
Lender, a "Non-Extending Lender"), unless the Borrower shall have replaced or
removed such Non-Extending Lender pursuant to subsection 2.24 or the Face Amount
of outstanding Commercial Paper is less than or equal to the Available
Commitments of the Extending Lenders (and any replacement Lenders for
Non-Extending Lenders), on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding such
Non-Extending Lender's Expiry Date the Borrower shall request such Non-Extending
Lender to make, and on such Expiry Date such Non-Extending Lender shall make in
accordance with the provisions hereof, a Loan (a "Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan")
in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Available Commitment of such
Non-Extending Lender and (ii) the product of (A) the Exit Percentage of such
Non-Extending Lender

<PAGE> 10
5

and (B) the excess, if any, of (x) the Face Amount of outstanding Commercial
Paper as of such fifth preceding Business Day over (y) the Available
Commitments of the Extending Lenders as of such fifth preceding Business Day
(and of any replacement Lenders for Non-Extending Lenders); provided, however,
that if the Borrower shall have requested prior to such Expiry Date from each
of the Rating Agencies written confirmation that the failure to request such a
Loan will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of its then current rating,
if any, of the Commercial Paper, and if such written confirmation is received
by the Borrower on or prior to such fifth preceding Business Day, the Borrower
shall not be obligated to request, and such Non-Extending Lender shall not be
obligated to make, such Loan. The Borrower shall make any such request to the
Rating Agencies at least fifteen days prior to such fifth Business Day. After
such Borrowing or, if there is no such Borrowing, after such Non-Extending
Lender's Expiry Date, such Non-Extending Lender shall have no further
obligation under its Commitment to make Loans. The proceeds of any such
Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan shall be deposited in the Non-Pro Rata Funding
Account and, in accordance with subsection 6(b) of the Depositary Agreement,
shall be applied, to the extent of such proceeds, by the Depositary, prior to
its application of any other funds then available to it, to pay maturing
Commercial Paper. The Borrower shall cause the Administrator to use its
reasonable efforts (without the expenditure of money for the sole purpose of
inducing such replacement) to replace a Non-Extending Lender which would be
obligated to make a Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan prior to such Non-Extending
Lender's Expiry Date.

2.5 Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans by Downgraded Lenders. On
the 60th day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business
Day) after any Lender becomes a Downgraded Lender (or on such earlier day as may
be necessary to prevent a reduction in the ratings of the Commercial Paper), and
on each Business Day thereafter, the Borrower (i) unless (A) the Borrower shall
have replaced such Downgraded Lender pursuant to subsection 2.24 or (B) the Face
Amount of outstanding Commercial Paper on such Business Day shall be an amount
less than or equal to the Available Commitments of the Non-Downgraded Lenders
(and any replacement Lenders for the Downgraded Lenders), shall request such
Downgraded Lender to make, and if such request is made, such Downgraded Lender
shall make in accordance with the provisions hereof, a Loan (a "Non-Pro Rata
Reserve Account Loan") in an amount such that the aggregate outstanding amount
of such Downgraded Lender's Non- Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans equals the
lesser of (A) such Downgraded Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Utilized
Available Commitments on such Business Day (such Downgraded Lender's "Required
Reserve Account Funded Amount") and (B) the excess, if any, of (x) the
Commitment of such Downgraded Lender over (y) the aggregate principal amount of
such Lender's Revolving Loans and Refunding Loans then outstanding and (ii) may
request such Downgraded Lender to make, and if such request is made, such
Downgraded Lender shall make, a Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loan in an amount
such that the aggregate outstanding

<PAGE> 11
6

amount of such Downgraded Lender's Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans equals
the lesser of (A) the Reserve Account Pre-Funded Amount notified to such
Downgraded Lender by the Borrower pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection
and (B) the excess, if any, of (x) the Commitment of such Downgraded Lender
over (y) the aggregate principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Loans and
Refunding Loans then outstanding; provided however, that the Borrower shall
request prior to such 60th day from each of the Rating Agencies written
confirmation that the failure to request such Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account
Loans will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of its then current
rating, if any, of the Commercial Paper, and if such written confirmation is
received by the Borrower prior to such 60th day, the Borrower shall not
request, and such Downgraded Lender shall not be obligated to make, such
Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans. The Borrower shall make such request to
the Rating Agencies at least fifteen days prior to such 60th day.

(b) In accordance with the provisions of subsection 2.6, the Borrower
may request that on each Settlement Date each Downgraded Lender make a Non-Pro
Rata Reserve Account Loan in an amount such that the aggregate outstanding
amount of such Downgraded Lender's Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans equals
such Downgraded Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Borrower's good faith
estimate of the maximum amount of the Utilized Available Commitments during the
Accrual Period commencing on such Settlement Date (with respect to such Accrual
Period, such Downgraded Lender's "Reserve Account Pre-Funded Amount").

(c) All proceeds of any such Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans shall
be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Collateral Trustee and deposited
by the Collateral Trustee in the Reserve Account. After any such Borrowing,
such Downgraded Lender shall receive no Commitment Fees with respect to the
portion of its Commitment represented by funds on deposit in the Reserve
Account.

(d) After any Downgraded Lender makes a Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account
Loan and so long as such Downgraded Lender remains a Downgraded Lender, (i) all
Refunding Loans which such Lender would otherwise have been required to make on
or prior to its Expiry Date (A) shall be made by withdrawing funds on deposit in
the Reserve Account with respect to such Downgraded Lender, (B) will increase
the Refunding Loans of such Downgraded Lender by the amount so withdrawn and (C)
will reduce the Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loan of such Downgraded Lender by
the amount so withdrawn, and (ii) any amount which would have otherwise been
applied to repay the principal amount of any outstanding Refunding Loans of such
Downgraded Lender prior to such Downgraded Lender's Expiry Date or, if earlier,
the date the Commitments shall have been terminated pursuant hereto, (A) will be
deposited in the Reserve Account, (B) will reduce the Refunding Loans of such
Downgraded Lender by the amount so

<PAGE> 12
7

deposited and (C) will increase the Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loan of such
Downgraded Lender by the amount so deposited.

(e) Each Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loan shall mature on the Expiry
Date of the related Lender. The Borrower shall instruct the Collateral Trustee
to withdraw the entire amount on deposit in the Reserve Account with respect to
any Downgraded Lender from the Reserve Account in accordance with subsection
5.7 of the Collateral Trust Agreement and to pay such amount to such Downgraded
Lender as a repayment of the Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loan of such
Downgraded Lender on the Expiry Date of such Downgraded Lender (unless such
Downgraded Lender would be required to make a Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan
pursuant to subsection 2.4, in which case, a portion of such amount equal to
the amount of such required Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan shall be deposited in
the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account and thereafter be treated as a Non-Pro Rata
Revolving Loan hereunder) or, if earlier, the date on which the Commitments are
terminated pursuant hereto.

(f) If, on any Settlement Date, the amount on deposit in the Reserve
Account with respect to any Downgraded Lender exceeds the greater of (i) the
Reserve Account Pre-Funded Amount with respect to such Downgraded Lender for
the Accrual Period commencing on such Settlement Date and (ii) the Required
Reserve Account Funded Amount with respect to such Downgraded Lender on such
Settlement Date, then the Borrower shall instruct the Collateral Trustee to
withdraw from the Reserve Account and pay, and the Collateral Trustee shall
withdraw from the Reserve Account, in accordance with subsection 5.7 of the
Collateral Trust Agreement, and pay, to such Downgraded Lender such excess as a
repayment of the Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans of such Downgraded Lender.

(g) If the commercial paper or short term deposit ratings of any
Downgraded Lender are restored to or confirmed at A-1 by S&P and P-1 by
Moody's, then (i) the Borrower shall instruct the Collateral Trustee to
withdraw the entire amount on deposit in the Reserve Account with respect to
such Lender from the Reserve Account in accordance with subsection 5.7 of the
Collateral Trust Agreement and to pay such amount to such Lender as a repayment
of its Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans and (ii) such Lender shall no longer
be a Downgraded Lender hereunder.

(h) If, on any Settlement Date following the expiration of the 60-day
period (or any shorter period referred to in subsection 2.5(a)) occurring after
any Lender became a Downgraded Lender and before such Downgraded Lender has
been replaced in accordance with subsection 2.24, such Downgraded Lender
becomes an Excluded Downgraded Lender, then the Borrower shall instruct the
Collateral Trustee to withdraw the entire amount on deposit in the Reserve
Account with respect to such Excluded Downgraded Lender from the Reserve
Account in accordance with subsection 5.7 of the Collateral Trust Agreement and
to pay

<PAGE> 13
8

such amount to such Excluded Downgraded Lender as a repayment of the Non-Pro
Rata Reserve Account Loan of such Excluded Downgraded Lender on such Settlement
Date (unless such Excluded Downgraded Lender would be required to make a
Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan pursuant to subsection 2.4 (assuming, for purposes
of this paragraph (h), that the Expiry Date of such Excluded Downgraded Lender
shall be deemed to occur on such Settlement Date), in which case, a portion of
such amount equal to the amount of such required Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan
shall be deposited in the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account and be treated as a
Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan hereunder).

(i) The Borrower may on any Settlement Date elect to make a non-pro
rata reduction of the amount of the Maximum Aggregate Commitment by making a
pro rata reduction or termination of the Commitments of the Downgraded Lenders
which are obligated to make Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans. If the
Borrower shall make such election, the Borrower shall instruct the Collateral
Trustee to withdraw from the Reserve Account and pay, and the Collateral
Trustee shall withdraw from the Reserve Account, in accordance with subsection
5.7 of the Collateral Trust Agreement, and pay, to each Downgraded Lender which
has made Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans, the difference between the amount
on deposit in the Reserve Account with respect to such Downgraded Lender and
the Required Reserve Account Funded Amount with respect to such Downgraded
Lender (after giving effect to such reduction of the Commitments) as a
repayment of the Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans of such Downgraded Lender.

2.6 Procedures for Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loans and Non-Pro Rata
Reserve Account Loan. With respect to a Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan to be made
by a Non-Extending Lender or a Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loan to be made by
a Downgraded Lender pursuant to subsection 2.4 or 2.5, the Borrower shall give
the Administrative Agent, (a) in the case of an ABR Loan, irrevocable written
or telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) not later than 10:00 a.m., New York
City time, on the requested Borrowing Date or (b) in the case of a Eurodollar
Loan, irrevocable written notice not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time,
three Working Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in each case
specifying (i) the requested Borrowing Date (which in the case of an ABR Loan
shall be a Business Day and in the case of a Eurodollar Loan shall be a Working
Day), (ii) the name of the Lender from which such Loan is being requested,
(iii) the principal amount of the Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan or Non-Pro Rata
Reserve Account Loan required by subsection 2.4 or 2.5 and (iv) whether such
Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan or Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loan is to be
initially maintained as an ABR Loan or a Eurodollar Loan. Upon receipt of such
notice from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify such
Non-Extending Lender or Downgraded Lender. Each such Non-Extending Lender or
Downgraded Lender will make the requested Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan or
Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loan, as the case may be, available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of

<PAGE> 14
9

the Borrower at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in subsection
10.2 in funds immediately available on the requested Borrowing Date to the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent will make each Borrowing of
Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loans and Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans available
to the Borrower by directly depositing in the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account and
the Reserve Account, respectively, the amounts so made available to the
Administrative Agent and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

2.7 Refunding Loans; Procedure for Refunding Loan Borrowings. (a) If,
on any Business Day that Commercial Paper matures, the sum of (i) all amounts
on deposit in the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account and (ii) the aggregate net
amount of proceeds received by the Borrower from the issuance of additional
Commercial Paper is insufficient to repay in full the Face Amount of all
Commercial Paper maturing on such day (the excess of the amount required to pay
in full all such Commercial Paper maturing on such day, including any interest
due thereon, over the net amount to be obtained by the issuance of Commercial
Paper on such day and the amount of funds to be applied from the Non-Pro Rata
Funding Account on such day, a "Commercial Paper Deficit"), the Borrower shall
request the Collateral Trustee to transfer on such day funds to satisfy the
Commercial Paper Deficit from the Collateral Account to the Commercial Paper
Account. The excess, if any, of the Commercial Paper Deficit for any day over
the aggregate amount to be applied to the Commercial Paper Deficit by transfer
from the Collateral Account pursuant to subsection 5.3(a)(xiii)(B) of the
Collateral Trust Agreement on such day, is referred to herein as the "Remaining
Commercial Paper Deficit." If, on any Business Day that Commercial Paper
matures, a Remaining Commercial Paper Deficit exists, each Lender shall, upon
the request of the Depositary to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph
(c) below, as attorney-in-fact for the Borrower, and subject to the limitations
imposed by subsection 2.1, make a Refunding Loan in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the product of such Lender's Commitment Percentage and the
Remaining Commercial Paper Deficit.

(b) Borrowings of Refunding Loans may be made on any Business Day
under the circumstances set forth in paragraph (a) above; provided that, the
Depositary, as attorney-in-fact of the Borrower, shall give irrevocable written
or telephonic notice to the Administrative Agent (confirmed in writing) prior
to 12:15 p.m., New York City time, on the requested Borrowing Date, specifying
(i) the requested Borrowing Date, (ii) the amount to be borrowed and (iii) that
the Borrowing is to be of Refunding Loans. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly prior to 12:30 p.m., New York City time, notify each Lender of the
receipt of such notice. Each Lender will make its Commitment Percentage of
each Borrowing of Refunding Loans available to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Borrower at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in
subsection 10.2 in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent
prior to 1:00

<PAGE> 15
10
p.m., New York City time, on the requested Borrowing Date. Subject to
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in subsection 5.4, such
Borrowing will then be made available by the Administrative Agent to the
Borrower by directly depositing the amounts made available to the
Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent in the Commercial Paper Account.

(c) If at any time (i) there are ten or more Lenders with Commitments
to make Loans hereunder and (ii) with respect to any Borrowing of Refunding
Loans, one or more Lenders fails to fund its Commitment Percentage of the
Refunding Loans to be provided by the Lenders by 1:15 p.m., New York City time,
on any Business Day then, the Administrative Agent shall notify each of the
other Lenders which are committed to lend on such day not later than 1:30 p.m.,
New York City time, on such Business Day and each of such other Lenders shall,
before 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Business Day, make available to
the Administrative Agent at the office of the Administrative Agent set forth in
subsection 10.2, in immediately available funds, a Refunding Loan in a
principal amount equal to the lesser of (A) such unfunded amount multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Commitment of such Lender and the
denominator of which is the aggregate Commitments with respect to the Lenders
committed to lend on such day (less the Commitments of the defaulting Lenders)
and (B) the Available Commitment of such Lender. After the Administrative
Agent's receipt of such funds, the Administrative Agent will make such funds
available to the Borrower by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, by transferring
such funds to the Commercial Paper Account. If a Lender which shall have so
failed to fund shall subsequently pay such amount, the Administrative Agent
shall apply such amount to repay pro rata the additional Refunding Loans made
by the Lenders pursuant to such subsequent notice from the Administrative
Agent.

2.8 Additional Commitments. (a) Prior to the Wind-Down Date, the
Borrower may, on any Settlement Date, with the consent of the Administrative
Agent, add additional Persons which would be Eligible Assignees as Lenders or
cause an existing Lender to increase its Commitment; provided, however, that no
Person shall be added as a Lender unless such Person delivers to the Rating
Agencies such opinions of counsel as may be required by the Rating Agencies as
to the enforceability of this Agreement against such Person and each Rating
Agency confirms the ratings of the outstanding Commercial Paper, and provided,
further, however, that no such increase shall be effected unless after giving
effect to such increase, and to any simultaneous issuance of Trust
Certificates, the Aggregate OTC Amount shall be at least equal to the Required
OTC Amount. Each new Lender and each Lender increasing its Commitment shall
become a party hereto or increase its Commitment, as the case may be, by
executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower an
Addendum.

<PAGE> 16
11

(b) To the extent that Non-Extending Lenders shall have outstanding
Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loans on the date an additional Person becomes a Lender
or an existing Lender increases its Commitment pursuant to subsection 2.8(a),
such additional Person or, to the extent of the amount of its increase in
Commitment, such existing Lender shall be deemed a replacement bank, in whole
or in part, pursuant to subsection 2.24 for such Non-Extending Lenders. If
there is more than one such Non-Extending Lender at such time and such
additional Person or existing Lender cannot replace such Non-Extending Lenders
in whole, then the Borrower shall pay the principal amount of such
Non-Extending Lenders' Loans pro rata according to the outstanding amounts
thereof.

2.9 Commitment Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee (the
"Commitment Fee") for the period from and including the Effective Date to and
including the date the Commitment of such Lender terminates, computed at the
rate of .25% per annum on the average daily amount of the Available Commitment
of such Lender and payable quarterly in arrears on the Settlement Dates
occurring in April, July, October and January of each year and on the
Settlement Date in the month following the month in which the Expiry Date of
such Lender occurs for the period (a) in the case of the first such payment,
commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the last day of the month
preceding the date of such payment and (b) in the case of each subsequent
payment, commencing on and including the day following the end of the preceding
period for which payment has been made and ending on the last day of the month
preceding the date of such payment or the Expiry Date, as the case may be.

2.10 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Borrower shall
have the right on any Settlement Date, upon not less than three Business Days'
notice to the Administrative Agent and not less than fifteen days' notice to
the Rating Agencies, to terminate or, from time to time, reduce the amount of
the Maximum Aggregate Commitment; provided that, unless the Borrower receives
the written consent of the holders of all outstanding Trust Certificates and
the holders of all outstanding Commercial Paper Notes, no such termination or
reduction shall be permitted if (a) after giving effect thereto and to all
transactions to occur on the effective date thereof, the sum of (i) the Credits
Outstanding and (ii) the Interest Component with respect to outstanding
Commercial Paper on such date would exceed the Maximum Aggregate Commitment
then in effect or (b) such termination or reduction would result in a
downgrading, suspension or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of the ratings
referred to in subsection 5.3(c) of the outstanding Commercial Paper Notes. Any
such reduction shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall reduce permanently the
Maximum Aggregate Commitment then in effect and, subject to subsection 2.5(j),
any such termination or reduction shall be pro rata among the Lenders

<PAGE> 17
12

and shall be effective on the date specified in the Borrower's notice. The
reduction of the Maximum Aggregate Commitment to zero pursuant to the terms of
this subsection 2.10 shall cause the occurrence of the Expiration Date.

2.11 Conversions and Continuations. The Borrower may elect from
time to time to convert Revolving Loans, Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loans and
Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate to
ABR Loans, by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days' prior
irrevocable notice of such election; provided that any such conversion of
Eurodollar Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with
respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Revolving
Loans or Refunding Loans bearing interest at the ABR to Revolving Loans bearing
interest at the Eurodollar Rate or convert Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loans or
Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans bearing interest at the ABR to Eurodollar
Loans, in each case by giving the Administrative Agent at least three Working
Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election; provided that any such
conversion of ABR Loans may be made only on a Working Day. Upon receipt of any
such notice of conversion the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender thereof. All or any part of outstanding Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans
may be converted as provided herein, provided that no Loans bearing interest
at the ABR may be converted into Eurodollar Loans when any Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, after giving effect to such
conversion, each Eurodollar tranche shall be equal to $10,000,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and no Loans bearing interest at the
ABR may be converted into Eurodollar Loans after the date that is one month
prior to the Expiration Date.

(b) Any Eurodollar Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration
of the then Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving notice
to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the definition of "Interest Period" set forth in Appendix A; provided that no
Eurodollar Loans may be continued at such rate when any Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing; provided, further, that if the Borrower
shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or
if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such
Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day of such
then expiring Interest Period.

2.12 Prepayments. The Borrower may, at its option, on any Business
Day, prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty;
provided that, in accordance with subsection 2.20, the Borrower shall reimburse
each Lender for any loss or expense incurred as a result of any prepayment of a
Eurodollar Loan on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period. The
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable written notice of its
intention to prepay any

<PAGE> 18
13

Loan not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of such
prepayment, specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether the
prepayment is of Revolving Loans or Refunding Loans, or a combination thereof,
and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each. Upon receipt
of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender
thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice
shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued
interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments shall be in
an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof.

(b) In the event that Credits Outstanding shall on any Settlement
Date exceed the Borrowing Base on such Settlement Date, then the Borrower,
without notice or demand, shall reduce Credits Outstanding by either setting
aside funds in the Principal Subaccount to pay maturing Commercial Paper or
immediately prepaying, in accordance with the provisions of subsection 2.15,
its Loans in an amount equal to such excess, together with interest earned to
such date on the amount prepaid; provided that any such prepayment shall be
applied first, to any outstanding Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loans and second, to
any outstanding ABR Loans; provided, further that any such prepayment shall be
made solely from funds available pursuant to subsection 5.3(a)(xiii) or
5.4(b)(i), as the case may be, of the Collateral Trust Agreement.

2.13 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. Subject to paragraph (e) of
this subsection, each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for each day during
each Interest Period with respect thereto, from and including the first day
thereof to but excluding the last day thereof, at a rate per annum equal to the
Eurodollar Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin. Interest
on each Eurodollar Loan shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each
Interest Period applicable to such Loan or the day of any prepayment or
conversion (on the amount prepaid or converted) and at maturity and, with
respect to any Eurodollar Loan having an Interest Period of six months, on the
Settlement Date immediately succeeding the day which is three months after the
first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto; provided that interest
accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection shall be payable on
demand.

(b) Subject to paragraph (e) of this subsection, each ABR Loan shall
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR, from and including the date
such Loan (or portion thereof) is made or converted into an ABR Loan to but
excluding the date of payment or conversion into a Eurodollar Loan; provided
that each Refunding Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the
ABR plus 1% per annum, from and including the date such Refunding Loan is made
to but excluding the date of payment or conversion into a Revolving Loan. 
Interest on each ABR Loan shall be payable monthly in arrears on each
Settlement Date, on

<PAGE> 19
14
any prepayment or conversion (on the amount prepaid or converted) and at
maturity; provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
subsection shall be payable on demand.

(c) Subject to paragraph (e) of this subsection, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, then (i) the principal amount of any
Loan and (ii) any interest payable thereon which interest has not been paid
when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), shall
bear interest at a rate per annum which is (x) in the case of principal, the
rate that would be otherwise applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this subsection plus 1% from the date of the occurrence of such
Event of Default until the earlier of the date on which such amount is paid in
full and the date on which such Event of Default is no longer continuing or (y)
in the case of overdue interest, the rate described in paragraph (b) of this
subsection plus 1% from the date of such non-payment until the date on which
such amount is paid in full (after as well as before judgment).

(d) Additional interest accruing pursuant to subsection 2.13(c) shall
be payable solely from funds made available pursuant to subsection
5.3(a)(vi)(J) or 5.3(b)(iii), as the case may be, of the Collateral Trust
Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any interest on the Loans (other
than Default Interest) that has accrued at a rate per annum in excess of the
Program Net Yield on the date such interest is payable hereunder (any such
accrued interest, "Special Interest") shall be payable solely from funds made
available pursuant to subsection 5.3(a)(vi)(B) of the Collateral Trust
Agreement, solely to the extent of any payments made by the Counterparties
under the Interest Rate Caps and deposited in the Collateral Account, and funds
made available pursuant to subsection 5.3(a)(vi)(H) or 5.3(a)(ix) of the
Collateral Trust Agreement.

2.14 Computation of Interest and Commitment Fee. Interest on
Eurodollar Loans and on ABR Loans the interest rate of which is calculated by
reference to the Federal Funds Effective Rate or the Base CD Rate shall be
calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. Interest
on ABR Loans the interest rate of which is calculated by reference to the Prime
Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or, 366-, as the case may be)
day year for the actual days elapsed. Commitment Fees shall be computed on
the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days
elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest
rate on any Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve
Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on
which such change in the ABR is announced or such change in the Eurocurrency
Reserve Requirements becomes effective, as the case may be. The

<PAGE> 20
15

Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the
effective date and the amount of each such change in the interest rate. Each
determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and
the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the
Administrative Agent in determining each interest rate pursuant to subsection
2.13(a).

(b) If any Reference Bank's Commitment shall terminate or all its
Loans are assigned for any reason whatsoever, such Reference Bank shall
thereupon cease to be a Reference Bank and, if, as a result of the foregoing,
there shall only be one Reference Bank remaining, the Borrower may, by notice
to the Administrative Agent, designate another Lender as a Reference Bank.

(c) Each Reference Bank shall use its best efforts to furnish
quotations of rates to the Administrative Agent as contemplated hereby. If any
Reference Bank shall fail to furnish quotations of rates, the rates quoted by
the remaining Reference Banks shall be used.

2.15 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Except as otherwise provided
in subsections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.23 with respect to Non-Extending Lenders and
Downgraded Lenders and subsection 2.24 with respect to the replacement of
Lenders, each Borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each
payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of the principal
of and interest on the Loans and on account of any Commitment Fee hereunder and
any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders hereunder pursuant to a
reduction of the Maximum Aggregate Commitment shall be made pro rata according
to the Commitment Percentages of the Lenders. All payments (including
prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account of principal, interest, fees
or otherwise shall be made without set-off or counterclaim in accordance with
subsection 5.3 of the Collateral Trust Agreement. If any payment hereunder
(other than payments on Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day
other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest
thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If
any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a
Working Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Working Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment
into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Working Day.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in
writing by any Lender prior to a Borrowing Date that such Lender will not make
the amount which would constitute its

<PAGE> 21
16

share of the Borrowing on such Borrowing Date available to the Administrative
Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
amount available to the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date, and the
Administrative Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in reliance upon
such assumption, make available to the Borrower or the Depositary a
corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the Administrative
Agent on a date after such Borrowing Date, such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily
average Federal Funds Effective Rate during such period, times (ii) such
Lender's share of such Borrowing, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days that elapse from and including such Borrowing Date to the
date on which such Lender's share of such Borrowing shall have become
immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which
is 360. If such Lender's share of such Borrowing is not in fact made available
to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such
Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans
hereunder, on demand, from the Borrower. If such Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, the principal portion of such
amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing
for purposes of this Agreement. Until either such Lender repays such amount
owing to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower borrows additional Loans
hereunder to repay such amount, such advance made by the Administrative Agent
shall be deemed to be a Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loan made by the Administrative
Agent for all purposes hereunder, earning interest as set forth in the third
preceding sentence.

2.16 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. In the event that, with
respect to a proposed or any outstanding Eurodollar Loan, prior to the first
day of any Interest Period (including, without limitation, the initial Interest
Period):

(a) the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by
reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market, adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such
Interest Period; or

(b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Majority Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined
for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or
maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period;

<PAGE> 22
17

then the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof
to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such
notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day
of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans that were to
have been converted to or continued as Eurodollar Loans on the first day of
such Interest Period shall be converted to or continued as ABR Loans and (z)
any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such
Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the
Administrative Agent (which shall be without delay and as soon as practical),
no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the
Borrower have the right to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans.

2.17 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if, on
or after November 7, 1994, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Eurodollar Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful
or impossible for any Lender (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) to make,
maintain or fund its Eurodollar Loans and such Lender shall so notify the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice
thereof to the other Lenders, the Borrower and the Administrator, whereupon the
obligation of such Lender to make Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until
such Lender notifies the Borrower, the Administrator and the Administrative
Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist.
Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
subsection 2.17, such Lender shall designate a different Eurodollar Lending
Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will
not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender. If such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to
maintain and fund any of its outstanding Eurodollar Loans to the last days of
the then current Interest Rate Periods with respect to such Eurodollar Loans
and shall so specify in such notice, such Eurodollar Loans shall be immediately
and automatically converted to ABR Loans.

2.18 Requirements of Law. If, on or after (x) November 7, 1994,
the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency:

<PAGE> 23
18

(i) shall subject any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) to
any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Loans or its obligation
to make Loans, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any
Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) of the principal of or interest
on its Loans or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect of
its Loans or its obligation to make Loans (except for changes in the rate
of tax on the overall net income of such Lender or its Applicable Lending
Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's principal
executive office or Applicable Lending Office is located); or

(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit, deposit insurance assessment or similar requirement (including,
without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System including, with respect to any Eurodollar
Loan, any Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements, but excluding with respect to
any ABR Loan the interest rate of which is calculated based on the Base CD
Rate any such requirement included in the applicable CD Reserve Percentage
or the CD Assessment Rate) against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) or shall impose on any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or
on the United States market for certificates of deposit or the London
interbank market any other condition affecting its Loans or its obligation
to make Loans;

and if such Lender determines that the result of any of the foregoing is to
increase the cost to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making
or maintaining any Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this
Agreement by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then such Lender
may calculate the additional amount or amounts which will compensate such
Lender for such increased cost or reduction and deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent) a request for payment thereof accompanied by
a statement setting forth the basis for calculating the amount requested (which
may include any reasonable averaging and attribution methods). The Borrower
shall pay the amount so requested to the Administrative Agent on behalf of such
Lender in accordance with subsection 2.18(d).

(b) If any Lender shall determine that, on or after November 7, 1994,
the adoption of any applicable law, guideline, rule or regulation regarding
capital adequacy, or any change in any applicable law, guideline, rule or
regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change or clarification in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any

<PAGE> 24
19

Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or its Parent's capital as a
consequence of such Lender's Available Commitment to make Loans under this
Agreement to a level below that which such Lender (or its Parent) could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such
Lender to be material, then such Lender may calculate the additional amount or
amounts which will compensate such Lender (or its Parent) for such reduction
and deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time
to time a request for payment thereof accompanied by a statement setting forth
the basis for calculating the amount so requested (which may include any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods). The Borrower shall pay such
amount so requested to the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender in
accordance with subsection 2.18(d).

(c) Each Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring on or
after November 7, 1994, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant
to this subsection 2.18 and will designate a different Applicable Lending
Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender. A certificate as to any additional amounts
payable pursuant to this subsection submitted by such Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. Any dispute between the Borrower and a Lender with respect to
a request for compensation under this subsection 2.18 shall be settled by the
Borrower directly with such Lender.

(d) The obligation of the Borrower to make any payment pursuant to
this subsection 2.18 shall be payable solely from amounts available therefor
pursuant to Section 5.3(a)(vi)(K) or 5.3(b)(iii), as the case may be, of the
Collateral Trust Agreement. The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, pay
amounts payable by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection 2.18.

2.19 Withholding Tax Exemption. At least five Business Days before
the first date on which interest or fees are payable under this Agreement for
the account of any Lender, each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws
of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver
to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies
of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in
either case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes. Each Lender which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to
deliver to each of the Borrower and the

<PAGE> 25
20

Administrative Agent two additional copies of such form (or successor form) on
or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form so delivered
by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, in each case
certifying that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law
or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would
prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with
respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
that it is not capable of receiving such payments without any deduction or
withholding of United States federal income tax.

2.20 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and
to hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may
sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment
when due of the principal amount of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan, (b)
default by the Borrower in making a Borrowing of any Eurodollar Loan or
conversion into or continuation of any Eurodollar Loan after the Borrower has
given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, (c) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment after the
Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement or (d) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day which
is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto, including,
without limitation, in each case, any such loss (including, without limitation,
loss of margin) or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by
it or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were
obtained. Such indemnification shall equal the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so
borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of
such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such
failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans
provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included
therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by
such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing
such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the
interbank eurodollar market. This covenant shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder.

(b) The obligation of the Borrower to make any payment pursuant to
this subsection 2.20 shall be payable solely from

<PAGE> 26
21

amounts available therefor pursuant to Section 5.3(a)(vi)(K) or 5.3(b)(iii), as
the case may be, of the Collateral Trust Agreement. The Administrator may, in
its sole discretion, pay amounts payable by the Borrower pursuant to this
subsection 2.20.

2.21 Securities Law and other Indemnification. Subject to
subsection 2.21(f), the Borrower agrees to pay, indemnify and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Collateral Trustee and each of the
officers and directors of, and any Person controlling, any of the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Collateral Trustee from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities, to which the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Trustee or such Lender may become subject
under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
other federal, state, or foreign securities laws or regulations caused by any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any Commercial Paper Memorandum or any other offering document or other
materials provided to (and authorized by the Borrower to be provided to)
investors or prospective investors in connection with the offering and sale of
the Commercial Paper and any amendments thereof or supplements thereto (so
authorized as aforesaid) (collectively, the "Offering Materials"), or caused by
any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; except insofar as such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses are caused by any such
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Collateral Trustee
expressly for use therein.

(b) The Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Collateral Trustee
agree to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Borrower and the
Administrator, each of the trustees of, each of the officers and directors of,
and any Person controlling the Borrower or the Administrator to the same extent
as the foregoing indemnity from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, such
Lender and the Collateral Trustee, but, in each case, only with reference to
information relating to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Collateral
Trustee, as the case may be, furnished in writing by such Person directly
expressly for use in the Offering Materials.

(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation)
shall be instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be
sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such Person (the
"indemnified party") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such
indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the
indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified
party and any others the

<PAGE> 27
22
indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the
reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.
In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain
its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel
or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that
the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties
(excluding local counsel). Such firm shall be designated in writing by the
Administrative Agent, the Lender or the Collateral Trustee, as the case may be,
in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection
2.21 and by the Borrower in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this subsection 2.21. The indemnifying party shall not be
liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for
the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party
from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or
judgment.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this subsection 2.21 is
unavailable to an indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this
subsection 2.21 or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the
relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Borrower on the one hand
and of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Collateral Trustee, as the
case may be, on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Borrower on the
one hand and of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Collateral
Trustee, as the case may be, on the other shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders or the Collateral Trustee, as the case may be, and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission. The Borrower and the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders or the Collateral Trustee, as the case may be, agree that

<PAGE> 28
23

it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection
2.21 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the considerations referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified
party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in
the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or
defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subsection 2.21, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Collateral
Trustee, as the case may be, shall not be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Commercial Paper was
offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Collateral Trustee, as the case may
be, have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. If any of the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders or the Collateral Trustee is obligated to indemnify or
contribute pursuant to this subsection 2.21, such obligations shall be several
and not joint. No party shall be required to contribute any amount in respect
of the settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent.

(e) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this
subsection 2.21 and the representations and warranties of the Borrower in this
Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i)
any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Collateral Trustee or on behalf of the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Collateral Trustee or any Person
controlling the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Collateral Trustee, as
the case may be, or by or on behalf of the Borrower, its directors or officers
or any Person controlling the Borrower, and (iii) acceptance of any payment for
any of the Commercial Paper.

(f) Pursuant to subsection 2.5(a)(vii) of the Administration
Agreement, the Administrator shall be the sole source of funds with which to
pay any amounts payable by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection 2.21.

2.22 Proceeds; Application of Funds. The proceeds of Commercial
Paper shall be used by the Borrower only to (i) acquire Receivables, (ii) pay
for the Trust Wholesale Certificate and make Wholesale Certificate Advances,
(iii) make the Financing Loan pursuant to the Financing Loan and Security
Agreement, (iv) pay matured Commercial Paper (including Advances made by the
Depositary or the Administrator), including interest thereon, (v)

<PAGE> 29
24

pay Loans, including interest thereon, (vi) pay Commitment Fees, (vii)
reimburse the Administrative Agent for amounts advanced by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to subsection 2.15(b), (viii) pay Servicing Fees, (ix) fund any
deficit in the Spread Account, (x) pay interest in respect of the outstanding
Trust Certificates and (xi) otherwise as described in subsection 5.3 of the
Collateral Trust Agreement.

(b) The proceeds of Revolving Loans shall be used by the Borrower
only to (i) acquire Receivables, (ii) pay for the Trust Wholesale Certificate
and make Wholesale Certificate Advances, (iii) make the Financing Loan pursuant
to the Financing Loan and Security Agreement, (iv) pay matured Commercial Paper
(including Advances made by the Depositary or the Administrator), including
interest thereon, (v) pay interest on Loans, (vi) pay Commitment Fees, (vii)
reimburse the Administrative Agent for amounts advanced by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to subsection 2.15(b), (viii) pay Servicing Fees, (ix) fund any
deficit in the Spread Account, (x) pay interest in respect of the outstanding
Trust Certificates and (xi) otherwise as described in subsection 5.3 of the
Collateral Trust Agreement.

(c) The proceeds of Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loans shall be used by the
Borrower solely to pay maturing Commercial Paper, including interest thereon. 
The proceeds of Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans shall be deposited in the
Reserve Account and applied as set forth in subsection 2.5.

(d) The proceeds of Refunding Loans shall be used by the Borrower
only to pay maturing Commercial Paper, including interest thereon.

(e) The Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree that whenever any
provision of any Basic Document (including, without limitation, the provisions
of subsection 5.3(a)(xiii)(C) of the Collateral Trust Agreement) provides for
the application of funds in reduction of the Loans such funds shall be applied,
first, to any outstanding Non-Pro Rata Revolving Loans, second, to any
outstanding ABR Loans, third, to any Eurodollar Loans maturing on the date of
such payment and, fourth, as a prepayment of other Eurodollar Loans
outstanding, the allocation among such Loans to be as the Borrower shall
determine.

2.23 Extensions of Expiration Date and Expiry Dates. Subject to
paragraph (b) of this subsection and other provisions of this Agreement
permitting earlier termination, the Commitments shall terminate on the
Expiration Date.

(b) If the Borrower desires to extend the Expiration Date, then the
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent at least 195 days prior to the
Expiration Date of its desire to extend the Expiration Date for a period of at
least 364 days, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of
the Borrower's desire to so extend the Expiration Date. Each

<PAGE> 30
25

Lender shall use its reasonable best efforts to notify the Administrative Agent
whether it agrees to such extension within 45 days after receipt of any such
request; provided that failure by a Lender to respond to such request shall not
be construed as a consent by such Lender to such extension. The decision to
extend or not extend shall be made by each Lender in its sole discretion. Each
consent by a Lender to an extension shall be in writing signed by such Lender.
The Administrative Agent shall periodically notify the Borrower in writing of
the decision of each Lender, which notice shall separately set forth the name
and the Commitment of each Lender which shall have decided to extend or not to
extend its Expiry Date to the requested Expiration Date. If the Majority
Lenders agree to an extension, the Expiration Date shall be extended, and the
Expiry Date of each Lender which agrees to extend its Expiry Date shall be
extended for the period set forth in the foregoing notice. No Downgraded
Lender shall be permitted to extend its Expiry Date. In the event that any
Lender desires to extend its Expiry Date for a commitment amount that is less
than the amount of its Commitment prior to the Borrower's request for an
extension of the Expiration Date, the Borrower, in its sole discretion, may
accept such extension; provided, however, that such Lender (x) shall be deemed
to be a Non-Extending Lender for purposes of Section 2.24 and (y) for purposes
of Section 2.4 shall be deemed to be both (i) a Non-Extending Lender with a
Commitment equal to the portion of its Commitment that will not be available
after the extension of its Expiry Date and (ii) an Extending Lender with a
Commitment equal to the portion of its Commitment that will be available after
the extension of its Expiry Date. The Maximum Aggregate Commitment shall be
reduced by the Commitment of each Non-Extending Lender on the Expiry Date of
such Non-Extending Lender (or, in the case of a Lender described in the
immediately preceding sentence, the portion that will not be available after
such extension). The Borrower shall provide notice to the Rating Agencies of
each decision by a Lender not to extend its Expiry Date to the requested
Expiration Date and of the extension of the Expiration Date.

2.24 Replacement of a Lender. In the event that (i) a Lender becomes
a Downgraded Lender, (ii) a Lender becomes a Non- Extending Lender, (iii) a
Lender requests compensation pursuant to subsection 2.18 or (iv) a Lender's
obligation to make Eurodollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to subsection
2.17, the Borrower shall have the right to replace such Lender, in whole or in
part, with a Person which would be an Eligible Assignee by giving five Business
Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and such Lender,
specifying the date on which all or a portion of such Lender's rights and
obligations hereunder shall be terminated; provided, however, that, in the case
of clause (ii) hereof, the Borrower covenants and agrees to use its reasonable
efforts (without the expenditure of money for the sole purpose of inducing such
replacement) to find a bank or other financial institution (a "replacement
bank") that would be an Eligible Assignee hereunder to replace any such
Non-Extending

<PAGE> 31
26

Lender. In the event of the replacement of a Lender, such Lender agrees to
assign its rights and obligations hereunder (or a portion thereof, as the case
may be) to a replacement bank selected by the Borrower upon payment by such
replacement bank to such Lender of the principal amount of such Lender's
outstanding Loans (including any Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans) and any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, accrued Commitment Fee and any other
amounts owed to such Lender (or, in each case, the pro rata portion thereof
being acquired by the replacement bank) and to execute and deliver an
Assignment and Acceptance evidencing such assignment; and provided, further,
that no Commitment shall be terminated pursuant to this subsection to the
extent that, after giving effect to such termination, the Commitments of the
remaining Lenders would be less than the sum of (a) the Credits Outstanding on
such day and (b) the Interest Component of all Commercial Paper Notes
outstanding on such day. Prior to adding any replacement bank as a Lender
under this subsection, the replacement bank shall have (i) paid to the
Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such replacement in
the amount of $3,500, if such replacement bank was not a Lender prior to such
addition, and (ii) delivered to the Rating Agencies such opinions of counsel as
may be required by the Rating Agencies as to the enforceability of this
Agreement against such bank.

SECTION 3. ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER

The Borrower shall not issue or deliver any Commercial Paper Notes
except in accordance with the following provisions:

(a) Each Commercial Paper Note shall be in the form of Exhibit A or
B to the Depositary Agreement and be completed in accordance with this

(b) Such issuance and delivery of Commercial Paper Notes shall be as
provided in, and in accordance with, the Depositary Agreement.

(c) On or prior to the date of such issuance or delivery, neither the
Administrator nor the Depositary shall have received notice from the

(i) the applicable conditions precedent specified in subsection 5.3

<PAGE> 32
27

shall have not been satisfied, (ii) the Commitments shall have been 
terminated in whole for any reason in accordance herewith or (iii) the
issuance of Commercial Paper Notes is prohibited by the provisions of
paragraph (e) below, which notice shall specify one or more of the events
described in clauses (i) through (iii) above as being the reason(s) to
cease issuing and delivering Commercial Paper Notes.

(d) On or prior to the date of such issuance or delivery, the
Borrower shall not have actual knowledge that there shall have occurred one
or more of the events described in clauses (i) through (iii) in paragraph
(c) above, unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent
and the Rating Agencies of the occurrence of such event and the Required
Lenders shall have given their consent in writing to the Depositary to
continue issuing and delivering Commercial Paper Notes.

(e) On or prior to the date of such issuance or delivery (i) an
injunction suspending the issuance of the Commercial Paper Notes shall not
be in effect or proceedings therefor shall not have been initiated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and be pending, (ii) neither the
Borrower, the Lenders nor any other Person shall have been found in a
judicial or administrative proceeding to have violated the Securities Act
in connection with the issuance of the Commercial Paper Notes and (iii)
neither the Borrower, the Lenders nor any other Person shall have offered,
issued or sold to or solicited any offer to acquire any of the Commercial
Paper Notes or any part thereof or any similar security from anyone so as
to bring the issuance and sale of the Commercial Paper Notes within the
registration and prospectus delivery requirements of Section 5 of the
Securities Act.

(f) Prior to the date of the initial issuance of Commercial Paper
Notes, each Lender and the Collateral Trustee shall have received a copy of
the Commercial Paper Memorandum and any other offering materials which
describe a Lender proposed to be used in connection with the offering,
issuance, sale or delivery thereof.

SECTION 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the
Loans, the Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent
and each Lender that:

4.1 Trust Existence; Compliance With Law. The Borrower (a) is a
statutory business trust duly formed, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, (b) has the power and authority, and
the legal right, to own its assets and to transact the business in which it is

<PAGE> 33
28

engaged, (c) is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing under the
laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership or lease of property or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance
with all Requirements of Law, except in the case of (c) and (d) to the extent
that the failure to comply therewith would not reasonably be expected to, in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to it.

4.2 Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. The Borrower has
the power and authority, and the legal right, to execute, deliver and perform
the Basic Documents to which it is a party and to borrow hereunder and has
taken all necessary action required by applicable Requirements of Law and the

set forth in a provision hereof, the Required Lenders, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the
Lenders and all future holders of the obligations owing by the Borrower
hereunder.

9.5 Notice of Default; Other Notices. The Administrative Agent shall
not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or
Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice
from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such
Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice,
the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders. 
The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders;
provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received
such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of
the Lenders. When the Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments
have been terminated, the Administrative Agent shall provide written notice
thereof to the Collateral Trustee.

9.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each
Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has
made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
the Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by
the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the
Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations,

<PAGE> 61
56

property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower
and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial
and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders
by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have
any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial
or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come
into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

9.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by
the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so),
ratably according to their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on the
date on which indemnification is sought under this subsection (or, if
indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have
terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance
with their Commitment Percentages immediately prior to such date of payment in
full), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits and reasonable costs, expenses and
disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without
limitation, at any time following the payment of all amounts owing hereunder)
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the other Basic Documents or
any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by
the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The agreements
in this subsection shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

9.8 Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits
from, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower, the
Administrator or any Affiliate

<PAGE> 62
57

thereof as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder and under the other Basic Documents. With respect to its Loans made
or renewed by it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and
powers under this Agreement and the other Basic Documents as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term
"Lenders" shall include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

9.9 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders. If the
Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement,
then the Majority Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders willing to serve
as Administrative Agent a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor
agent shall be approved by the Borrower (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the
rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term
"Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its
appointment, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as
Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or
deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to
this Agreement or any holders of the obligations hereunder; provided, however,
that the Majority Lenders shall not select a successor Administrative Agent
hereunder without a confirmation by each of the Rating Agencies that such
action will not result in a withdrawal or downgrade of the current ratings of
the outstanding Commercial Paper Notes. After any retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

9.10 Administrative Agent's Fee. The Borrower shall pay the
Administrative Agent the agency fee set forth in the separate letter agreement
between the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. The Administrator shall be
the sole source of funds with which to pay any amounts payable by the Borrower
under this subsection 9.10.

SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS

10.1 Amendments and Waivers. (a) Subject to subsection 10.1(b),
neither this Agreement nor any terms hereof may be amended, waived,
supplemented, restated, discharged or terminated without the written consent of
the Administrative Agent, the Majority Lenders and the Borrower; provided, that
no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall (i)
reduce the principal amount of any Loan, extend the maturity of any Loan or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce
the amount of any fees or

<PAGE> 63
58

commissions receivable by the Lenders hereunder, or increase the amount of any
Lender's Commitment, in each case without the consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby, (ii) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
Required Lenders or Majority Lenders, or cancel, terminate, amend, supplement,
modify or waive this subsection or subsection 7.7(b), in each case without the
written consent of all of the Lenders, (iii) amend, modify or waive any
provision of Section 9 without the written consent of the Administrative Agent
or (iv) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 8 or the definitions of
Retail Receivable Purchase Termination Event, Lease Receivable Purchase
Termination Event or Receivable Purchase Termination Event, in each case,
without the written consent of the Required Lenders; provided, further, that
any provision of this Agreement which by its terms requires the written consent
of all the Lenders shall not be amended, waived, supplemented, restated,
discharged or terminated without the prior written consent of all the Lenders;
and provided, further, that no amendment, waiver, supplement, restatement,
discharge or termination hereunder shall be made without a written confirmation
by each of the Rating Agencies that such action will not result in a withdrawal
or downgrade of the ratings referred to in subsection 5.3(c) of the outstanding
Commercial Paper Notes. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or
modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding
upon the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders
of the obligations owing hereunder. In the case of any waiver, the Borrower,
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former
position and rights hereunder, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall
be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right
consequent thereon.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, NFC,
NLC, Trip, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee,
on behalf of the Lenders, may enter into such amendments to the Basic Documents
as the Administrator deems necessary or advisable to (i) cure any ambiguity
contained in any Basic Document or (ii) to correct or supplement any provision
contained in any Basic Document that may be defective or inconsistent with any
other such provision contained in such Basic Document; provided that no such
amendment shall be effective unless (i) the Administrator shall have delivered
to each Lender a certificate that each such amendment is necessary or advisable
to so cure any such ambiguity or to so correct or supplement any such provision
and that such amendment has no material adverse effect on the Lenders, (ii)(A)
the Administrator shall have sent a copy of each such amendment to each Lender
and each Rating Agency by hand or by overnight courier and (B) such amendment
shall not have been rejected in writing received by the Administrative Agent
within ten Business Days after the Administrator shall have so distributed such
amendment by Lenders with Voting Percentages which aggregate more

<PAGE> 64
59

than 33-1/3% and (iii) the Administrator shall have received written
confirmation by each of the Rating Agencies that such amendment will not result
in the withdrawal or downgrade of the ratings referred to in subsection 5.3(c)
of the outstanding Commercial Paper Notes. The procedures specified in this
subsection 10.1(b) for approval of amendments are in addition to the procedures
specified in subsection 10.1(a) and nothing contained in this subsection shall
limit the Administrator from seeking, at any time, the approval of the Lenders
of any amendment pursuant to subsection 10.1(a).

10.2 Notices. Except where telephonic instructions or notices are
authorized herein to be given, all notices, requests and demands to or upon the
respective parties hereto to be effective shall be in writing and, unless

10.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no
delay in exercising, on the part of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder, and no course of dealing between
the Borrower and any Lender, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges
herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies,
powers and privileges provided by law. No notice to or demand on any party in
any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances, or constitute a waiver of the right of the
other party to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice
or demand.

10.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations
and warranties made by the Borrower hereunder, in any of the other Basic
Documents and in any other document, certificate or statement delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans
hereunder.

10.5 Payment of Expenses and Taxes. (a) Subject to 10.5(c) and
subsection 10.15, the Borrower shall pay, on demand, whether or not this
Agreement becomes effective: (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees and
disbursements of special counsel for the Administrative Agent (and local
counsel consulted by such special counsel) incurred in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of the Basic Documents and the
other documents referred to herein and therein; (ii) the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel to each Lender incurred in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of the opinions referred to in subsection
5.2(c)(ii); (iii) the reasonable fees and disbursements of special counsel for
the Administrative Agent (and local counsel consulted by such special counsel)
incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of any waiver or amendment of, or supplement to or other modification
of, any Basic Document, or any Default or alleged Default under this Agreement
and (iv) if an Event of Default occurs, all reasonable costs and expenses of
collection (including without limitation reasonable fees and disbursements of
special counsel for the Administrative Agent and any other counsel to any
Lender, including reasonable allocated costs and expenses of staff counsel)
incident to the enforcement of, or protection or preservation of any right or
claim of the Administrative Agent,

<PAGE> 66
61

any Lender, the Owner Trustee or the Collateral Trustee under, any Basic
Document.

(b) The Borrower agrees, in addition to its obligations under
subsection 10.5(a) and without limiting the rights of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent thereunder, to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender, their respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
agents and employees of the foregoing (each, an "Indemnitee") and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
costs (including without limitation, settlement costs) and expenses of any
kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such
Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) or other dispute brought or
threatened relating to or arising out of any Basic Document or any actual or
proposed use of proceeds of Loans under this Agreement, provided that (i) no
Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified under this Agreement for such
Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) the Borrower shall not be liable under
this subsection (b) in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in
the same jurisdiction or any other dispute, for (A) the fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm (and one local counsel) for all the Lenders and all
Affiliates of the Lenders or (B) the fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm (and one local counsel) for the Administrative Agent (in
connection with its actions in such capacity under this Agreement) unless, in
either case, representation by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interests.

(c) The Administrator shall be the sole source of funds with which to
pay any amounts payable by the Borrower under this subsection 10.5.

10.6 Successors and Assigns; Participation. (a) This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent, all future holders of the obligations owing hereunder and
their respective successors and assigns; provided that the Borrower shall not
assign or transfer any or all its rights and obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of each Lender.

(b) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
or lending business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to
one or more commercial banks ("Participants") participating interests in any
Loan owing to such Lender, the Commitment of such Lender or any other interest
of such Lender hereunder. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of
participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement to the other parties to this

<PAGE> 67
62

Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible
for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any
obligation owing to it hereunder for all purposes under this Agreement and the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. The Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of subsections 2.18, 2.19, 2.20, 2.21 and
10.5 with respect to its participation in the Commitment and the Loans
outstanding from time to time; provided, that no Participant shall be entitled
to receive any greater amount pursuant to such subsections than the transferor
Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the
participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no
such transfer occurred; provided, further, that no Participant shall have the
right to directly enforce the Borrower's obligations under such subsections.
In the event of any such sale by a selling Lender of a participating interest
to a Participant the selling Lender shall not grant any such Participant any
voting rights or veto power over any action by the selling Lender under this
Agreement, except that the selling Lender may agree not to take any action
which would require the consent of such selling Lender under subsection
10.1(a)(i) or (ii) or 7.7(b)(ii) without the consent of such Participant.

(c) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
or lending business and in accordance with applicable law, (i) with the written
consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), at any time sell all or any part of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement to any Lender or any Affiliate thereof and (ii) with the written
consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (which in each case shall
not be unreasonably withheld) sell to one or more additional commercial banks
party to the NFC Revolving Credit Facility ("Purchasing Lenders"), all or any
part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to an
Assignment and Acceptance, substantially in the form of Exhibit T (an
"Assignment and Acceptance"), executed by such Purchasing Lender, such
transferor Lender (and, in the case of a Purchasing Lender that is not then a
Lender or an Affiliate thereof, by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower),
and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in
the Register; provided that (A) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Administrator and the Borrower, each such sale pursuant to this subsection
10.6(c) shall be in an amount of $10,000,000 or more (or, if less, such
transferor Lender's entire Commitment), (B) such Purchasing Lender is an
Eligible Assignee, (C) such Purchasing Lender delivers to the Rating Agencies
such opinions of counsel as may be required by the Rating Agencies (at such
Purchasing Lender's expense) as to the enforceability of this Agreement against
such Purchasing Lender and (D) such Assignment and Acceptance is accompanied by
a confirmation by each Rating Agency of the

<PAGE> 68
63

ratings of the outstanding Commercial Paper. Upon such execution, delivery,
acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date determined pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the Purchasing Lender thereunder shall
be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder with a
Commitment as set forth therein, and (y) the transferor Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent of the interest transferred, as reflected in such
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of a Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the
remaining portion of a transferor Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such transferor Lender shall cease to be a party hereto). Such
Assignment and Acceptance shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the
extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such
Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of Commitment Percentages
arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the
rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement.

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred
to in subsection 10.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it
and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses
of the Lenders and the Commitment of and the principal amount of any Loans of
each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

(e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by a
transferor Lender and a Purchasing Lender (and, in the case of a Purchasing
Lender that is not then a Lender or an Affiliate thereof, by the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent), together with payment to the Administrative Agent of
a registration and processing fee of $3,500, if such Purchasing Lender is not
then a Lender, the Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant
thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and give
notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and the Borrower.

(f) Subject to subsection 10.17, the Borrower authorizes each Lender
to disclose to any Participant or Purchasing Lender (each, a "Transferee") and
any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's
possession which has been delivered to such Lender pursuant to this Agreement
or which has been delivered to such Lender in

<PAGE> 69
64

connection with such Lender's credit evaluation prior to becoming a party to
this Agreement.

(g) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging or
assigning all or any portion of the Loans to any Federal Reserve Bank in
accordance with applicable law. In order to facilitate such pledge or
assignment, the Borrower hereby agrees that, upon the request of any Lender at
any time and from time to time after the Borrower has made its initial
Borrowing hereunder, the Borrower shall provide to such Lender, at the
Borrower's expense, a promissory note, substantially in the form of Exhibit U,
evidencing the Loans made by such Lender.

10.7 Adjustments. If any Lender (a "benefitted Lender") shall at any
time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans (other than pursuant to
subsection 5.3(a)(xiii)(A) of the Collateral Trust Agreement), or interest
thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 8(e) or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such
payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of
such other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon, such benefitted Lender shall
purchase for cash from the other Lenders such portion of each such other
Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any
such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or
proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or
any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from
such benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase
price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without
interest.

10.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all
of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the
parties shall be lodged with the Administrator and the Administrative Agent.

10.9 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

10.10 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

(a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Basic Documents;

among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders.

irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any
court of the State of New York sitting in New York County for purposes of all

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Borrower irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in
such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

10.13 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER BASIC

10.14 No Bankruptcy Petition. Each Lender and the Administrative
Agent, severally and not jointly, hereby covenants and agrees that prior to the
date which is one (1) year and one (1) day after the later to occur of the
Final Scheduled Maturity Date and the payment in full of all Commercial Paper
Notes, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting
against, the Borrower, Trip, NLC, NFSC, the Wholesale Master Trust or the
Dealer Note Trust any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings or other similar proceeding under the laws of the
United States or any state of the United States. Nothing in this subsection
10.14 shall preclude, or be deemed to estop, any Lender or the Administrative
Agent from taking or omitting to take any action prior to such date in (i) any
case or proceeding voluntarily filed or commenced by or on behalf of the
Borrower, Trip, NLC, NFSC, the Wholesale Master Trust or the Dealer Note Trust

have assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed any part of the obligations of
the Borrower, Trip, NLC, NFSC, the Wholesale Master Trust or the Dealer Note
Trust hereunder) under or pursuant to any such law.

10.15 Limited Recourse. The obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement, the Collateral Trust Agreement and all other Basic Documents are
solely the obligations of the Borrower. Except as otherwise provided in the
Basic Documents, no recourse shall be had for the payment of any amount owing
in respect of Loans or for the payment of any fee or other obligation or claim
arising out of or based upon this Agreement, the Collateral Trust Agreement or
any other Basic Document against any holder of beneficial interest of the
Borrower; provided, however, that nothing in this subsection 10.15 shall
relieve any of the foregoing Persons from any liability which such Person may
otherwise have for his or its willful misconduct. For purposes of this
subsection 10.15 the term "holder of beneficial interest" shall mean and
include such holder of beneficial interest and all Affiliates, employees,
officers, directors, stockholders and beneficial owners of such holder of
beneficial interest.

10.16 Further Assurances. The Borrower agrees to do such further
acts and things and to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such
additional assignments, agreements, powers and instruments, as the
Administrative Agent may require or deem advisable to carry into effect the

and confirm unto the Administrative Agent its rights, powers and remedies
hereunder.

10.17 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to keep confidential all
non-public information provided to it by the Borrower or any Affiliate of the
Borrower pursuant to the Basic Documents; provided that nothing herein shall
prevent any Lender from disclosing any such information (i) to the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (ii) to any prospective Transferee
which agrees to comply with the provisions of this subsection and executes and
delivers to the Administrator an agreement to such effect, (iii) to its
Affiliates, employees, directors, agents, attorneys, accountants and other
professional advisors in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other credit arrangements between such Lender and the Borrower
or any of its Affiliates, (iv) upon the request or demand of any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over such Lender, (v) in response to any order of
any court or other Governmental Authority or as may otherwise be required
pursuant to any Requirement of Law, (vi) which has been publicly disclosed

exercise of any remedy hereunder.

SECTION 5. COLLATERAL ACCOUNT

5.1 Establishment of Collateral Account, etc. The Collateral
Trustee shall establish, and at all times during the term of this Agreement
maintain, an Eligible Deposit Account in the name of and under the control of
the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties and the
Certificateholders, as their interests may appear in this Agreement (said
account being called the "Collateral Account" and being identified on the date
hereof as Chemical Bank Account No. 323-080995), the operation of which shall
be governed by this Section 5.

For administrative purposes only, the Collateral Trustee shall
establish or cause to be established seven subaccounts of the Collateral
Account as follows: the "General Subaccount", the "Collection Subaccount", the
"Expense Subaccount", the "Interest Subaccount", the "Special Interest
Subaccount", "Principal Subaccount" and the "Settlement Subaccount".

It is understood and agreed by the Borrower, the Collateral
Trustee and the Administrative Agent that there shall be deposited in the
Collateral Account the following moneys, cash and proceeds: (a) the proceeds
from the sale of Commercial Paper, to the extent not required to repay any
maturing Commercial Paper on the date of issuance of such Commercial Paper, and
to the extent not maintained in the Commercial Paper Account pursuant to the
terms of the Depositary Agreement, (b) the proceeds of Loans (other than any
proceeds of Refunding Loans deposited directly into the Commercial Paper
Account pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement and any proceeds of Non-Pro Rata
Revolving Loans and Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans), (c) to the extent
provided in Section 3.3(c) of the Trust Agreement, the proceeds from the sale
of Trust Certificates pursuant to the terms of the Equity Documents and (d) all
moneys received by the Collateral Trustee pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Basic Document and required by the terms hereof or thereof to be
deposited by or on behalf of the Borrower in the Collateral Account, including
amounts transferred from the Spread Account in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

The Collateral Trustee shall also establish, and at all times
during the term of this Agreement maintain, an Eligible Deposit Account in the
name of and under the control of the
<PAGE> 12
12

Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties (the "Non-Pro Rata Funding
Account" and being identified on the date hereof as Chemical Bank Account No.
323-081002). The Collateral Trustee, upon receipt of funds identified in a
written notice received by the Collateral Trustee as being from a Non-Extending
Lender pursuant to subsection 2.4 of the Liquidity Agreement, accompanied by
identification of the Non-Extending Lender making such payment, shall deposit
such funds into the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account.

The Collateral Trustee shall also establish, and at all times
during the term of this Agreement maintain, an Eligible Deposit Account in the
name of and under the control of the Collateral Trustee on behalf of Secured
Parties (the "Reserve Account" and being identified on the date hereof as
Chemical Bank Account No. 323-081029). The Collateral Trustee, upon receipt of
funds identified in a written notice received by the Collateral Trustee as
being from a Downgraded Lender pursuant to subsection 2.5 of the Liquidity
Agreement, accompanied by identification of the Downgraded Lender making such
payment, shall deposit such funds into the Reserve Account.

The Collateral Trustee shall also establish, and at all times
during the term of this Agreement maintain, an Eligible Deposit Account in the
name of and under the control of the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the
Secured Parties and the Certificateholders, as their interests may appear in
this Agreement (the "Spread Account" and being identified on the date hereof as
Chemical Bank Account No. 323-081037). The Collateral Trustee, upon receipt of
funds from Trip identified in a written notice received by the Collateral
Trustee as being for deposit in the Spread Account, shall deposit such funds
into the Spread Account and shall deposit any funds allocated for deposit in
the Spread Account pursuant to subsection 5.3(a)(vi)(F) into the Spread
Account.

The Collateral Trustee shall have complete dominion and
control over the Collateral Account, the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account, the
Reserve Account and the Spread Account and the Borrower hereby agrees that only
the Collateral Trustee may make withdrawals from the Collateral Account, the
Non-Pro Rata Funding Account, the Reserve Account and the Spread Account;
provided, however, that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Depositary may request withdrawals from the Collateral Account, the Non-Pro
Rata Funding Account, the Reserve Account and the Spread Account in accordance
with the terms of subsection 5.3.

Except for the Collateral Account, the Non-Pro Rata Funding
Account, the Reserve Account, the Spread Account, the Commercial Paper Account,
the Certificate Distribution Account and the Certificate Reserve Account, the
Borrower agrees that it will not open or maintain a bank account with any
Person without the written consent of the Rating Agencies. The Collateral
Trustee shall give the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
<PAGE> 13
13

Lenders, the Owner Trustee and the Depositary immediate notice if a Responsible
Officer of the Collateral Trustee receives written notice or becomes aware that
the Collateral Account, the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account, the Reserve Account,
the Spread Account or any funds deposited therein become subject to any writ,
order, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process.

5.2 Collateral Account. Throughout the term of this
Agreement, the Collateral Trustee shall be a pledgee in possession of the
Deposited Funds in the Collateral Account and shall have the sole and exclusive
right to endorse any check or any other instrument or security presented for
deposit in the Collateral Account and to withdraw or order a transfer of
Deposited Funds from the Collateral Account subject to the provisions of
subsection 5.3 and the Borrower hereby appoints the Collateral Trustee the true
and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Borrower, with full power of substitution,
for the purpose of such endorsement or making any such withdrawal or ordering
any such transfer of Deposited Funds from the Collateral Account, which
appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.

5.3 Application of Proceeds. (a) On each Business Day, so
long as a Responsible Officer of the Collateral Trustee has not received
written notice that an Event of Default specified in subsection 8(a), (e), (r)
or (s) of the Liquidity Agreement has occurred and is continuing (after giving

and the Spread Account or any Deposited Funds on deposit in the Collateral
Account and the Spread Account are not then subject to any writ, order,
judgment or warrant of attachment, execution or similar process, the Borrower,
through a Borrower Representative (or with respect to clause (xiii)(B) below,
the Depositary, through a Depositary Representative) shall instruct in writing

<PAGE> 21
21

5.3(a)(xiii)(B), a Depositary Representative. The Collateral Trustee may
conclusively rely on the instructions of the Borrower or (with respect to
subsection 5.3(a)(xiii)(B), the Depositary), acting singly, in any instance;
provided, however, that the Collateral Trustee may refrain from taking any
action in any instance in which it receives incomplete, conflicting or
inconsistent instructions from such parties. Any instruction given to the
Collateral Trustee pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall set forth on the face
thereof the specific amounts of the allocations, deposits, transfers or
withdrawals addressed therein, and such other information as shall be
sufficient to enable the Collateral Trustee to carry out the instruction in
accordance with this Section 5.3. The Collateral Trustee shall promptly comply
with any such instructions made by the Borrower or the Depositary in accordance
with the provisions of this subsection 5.3; provided that any such instructions
shall be given at or prior to the times required in the Liquidity Agreement and
the Depositary Agreement. If the Collateral Account is held by an Eligible
Institution other than the Collateral Trustee, a copy of each instruction given
to the Collateral Trustee hereunder shall be given to such Eligible
Institution.

5.4 Eligible Investments. (a) Moneys held in the Collateral
Account, the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account, the Reserve Account and the Spread
Account shall be invested and the proceeds of investments shall be reinvested

direction of the Borrower. On each Settlement Date, all interest and other
investment earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) actually received
since the prior Settlement Date on funds deposited in the Collateral Account,
the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account, the Reserve Account and the Spread Account
shall be transferred to the Settlement Subaccount and allocated in accordance
with subsection 5.3(a). The Collateral Trustee shall not be responsible or
liable for any loss resulting from the investment performance of an investment
or reinvestment of moneys held in the Collateral Account, the Non-Pro Rata
Funding Account, the Reserve Account and the Spread Account in Eligible
Investments. The Collateral Trustee from time to time shall provide the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and any Lender upon written request)
with statements of account relative to the Collateral Account, the Non-Pro Rata
Funding Account, the Reserve Account and the Spread Account in accordance with
the Collateral Trustee's customary practices; provided that, to the extent that
the information contained in such statements of account is supplied by an
institution or institutions other than the Collateral Trustee, the Collateral
Trustee shall not be responsible for the correctness or accuracy of the
information received by it.

(b) Moneys held in the Collateral Account (other than the
Special Interest Subaccount), the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account and the Reserve

Interest Subaccount shall be invested in Eligible Investments having maturities

investments shall be made in the name of, and shall be payable to, the
Collateral Trustee.

(d) The Collateral Trustee may liquidate any Eligible
Investment when required to make an application pursuant to subsection 5.3
without liability for any losses incurred thereby. The Borrower agrees to use
its reasonable efforts to schedule the maturity of such Eligible Investments so
as to avoid the necessity of liquidating the same.

5.5 Security Interest in Commercial Paper Account. The
Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have a security interest in the
Commercial Paper Account only to the extent that funds are on deposit in the
Commercial Paper Account held by the Depositary after payment in full of all
outstanding Commercial Paper and such funds will be promptly transferred by the
Depositary to the Collateral Account in accordance with the Depositary
Agreement.

5.6 Non-Pro Rata Funding Account. Amounts on deposit in the
Non-Pro Rata Funding Account shall be withdrawn by the Collateral Trustee, upon
notice from the Depositary, and transferred to the Commercial Paper Account on
each day on which Commercial Paper matures. Such amounts shall be applied by
the Depositary, prior to its application of any other funds then available to
it, to pay maturing Commercial Paper. Each such notice from the Depositary
shall set forth on its face the specific amount of the withdrawal, together
with such other information as may be necessary for the Collateral Trustee to
carry out the withdrawal.

5.7 Reserve Account. Amounts on deposit in the Reserve
Account shall be withdrawn by the Collateral Trustee, upon receipt of
instruction by the Borrower, the Depositor or the Administrator, on each day on
which Refunding Loans are incurred by the Borrower in an amount equal to the
product of (a) the aggregate of the Commitment Percentages of all Downgraded
Lenders and (b) the aggregate amount of the Refunding Loans being incurred on
such day. On each day on which Refunding Loans mature or are prepaid pursuant
to the Liquidity Agreement, the Collateral Trustee shall, upon the receipt of
instruction by the Borrower, the Depositor or the Administrator, transfer funds
from the Principal Subaccount to the Reserve Account in an aggregate amount
equal to the product of (i) the total amount being repaid on such date and (ii)
the aggregate of the Commitment Percentages of all Downgraded Lenders. On each
day on which Non-Pro Rata Reserve Account Loans mature or are to be prepaid
pursuant to
<PAGE> 23
23

subsection 2.5(e), (f), (g), (h) or (i) of the Liquidity Agreement, the
Collateral Trustee, upon the receipt of instructions by a Borrower
Representative, shall transfer funds to the Downgraded Lender or Excluded
Downgraded Lender (or, if required by subsection 2.5 of the Liquidity
Agreement, to the Non-Pro Rata Funding Account) specified in such instructions
in the amounts specified in such instructions. For purposes of subsection
5.3(a)(xiii)(C), when the Collateral Trustee is required to make distributions
to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, in respect of any
payment of principal of any Refunding Loan, the duties of the Collateral
Trustee and the Administrative Agent with respect to any Downgraded Lender
during the period prior to such Lender's Expiry Date shall be satisfied by the
transfer by the Collateral Trustee of all amounts owing to such Downgraded
Lender into the Reserve Account to the extent of such Downgraded Lender's
Required Reserve Account Funded Amount.

5.8 Certificate Reserve Account. (a) The Collateral
Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, shall establish and
maintain in the name of and under the control of the Collateral Trustee an
Eligible Deposit Account (the "Certificate Reserve Account"), bearing a
designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for
the sole benefit of the Certificateholders.

(b) The Collateral Trustee shall possess all right, title and
interest in all funds on deposit from time to time in the Certificate Reserve
Account and in all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, the Certificate Reserve Account shall be under the sole dominion and
control of the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders.

(c) Trip may from time to time remit funds to the Collateral
Trustee for deposit in the Certificate Reserve Account. The Collateral Trustee
shall, upon receipt of any funds from the Depositor for deposit in the
Certificate Reserve Account, deposit such funds in the Certificate Reserve
Account. Amounts on deposit in the Certificate Reserve Account shall be
invested and the proceeds of investments shall be reinvested by the Collateral
Trustee in Eligible Investments having maturities no later than the Business
Day preceding the next Settlement Date pursuant to the written direction of the
Borrower. All such Eligible Investments shall be made in the name of, and
shall be payable to, the Collateral Trustee. All interest and other investment
earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) actually received on funds
deposited in the Certificate Reserve Account shall be retained in the
Certificate Reserve Account.

(d) In the event that (i) on any Settlement Date, the Monthly
R.O.E. Amount with respect to such Settlement Date exceeds the amounts
allocable to the Certificate Distribution Account pursuant to subsection 5.3 on
such Settlement Date (other than the portion, if any, of such amounts allocable
in respect of
<PAGE> 24
24

principal or OTC Costs) and (ii) the Aggregate OTC Amount on the Settlement
Date immediately preceding such Settlement Date exceeded the Trust Asset
Balance on such preceding Settlement Date, the Collateral Trustee, upon the
receipt of instructions by a Borrower Representative, shall withdraw, or order
the transfer of, an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of such
insufficiency and the amount on deposit in the Certificate Reserve Account from
the Certificate Reserve Account to the Certificate Distribution Account.

(e) On any Settlement Date on which the amount on deposit in
the Certificate Reserve Account for such Settlement Date is greater than the
Certificate Reserve Amount for such Settlement Date (after giving effect to any
withdrawal to be made from the Certificate Reserve Account on such Settlement
Date), the Collateral Trustee, upon the receipt of instructions by a Borrower
Representative, shall transfer the amount of such excess from the Certificate
Reserve Account to an account of Trip specified in writing to the Collateral
Trustee.

SECTION 6. DEFAULT

6.1 Rights of the Collateral Trustee upon Default. If any
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Trustee
shall, upon receipt by a Responsible Officer of the Collateral Trustee of
notice thereof with a direction of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Lenders (which direction shall be in writing (which may include telecopy))
withdraw amounts in the Collateral Account for application as herein provided
and, subject to the provisions of the succeeding paragraph and subsection 6.2,
may also exercise from time to time any rights and remedies available to it
with respect thereto under applicable law. Any amounts obtained by the
Collateral Trustee on account of or as a result of the exercise by the
Collateral Trustee of any right of offset or banker's lien or right of
attachment or garnishment with respect to any funds at any time and from time
to time on deposit in, or otherwise to the credit of, the Collateral Account
shall be held by the Collateral Trustee as additional collateral security for
the repayment of the Obligations and shall be applied as provided in
subsections 4.2 and 5.3.

If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Collateral Trustee, upon receipt by a Responsible Officer of the Collateral
Trustee of notice thereof with a direction (which direction shall be in writing
(which may include telecopy)) of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Lenders shall exercise all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims of
the Borrower under any Basic Document, including the right to give any consent,
request, notice, direction, approval, extension or waiver under any Basic
Document, and any right of the Borrower to take such action shall be suspended.
<PAGE> 25
25

No holder of Commercial Paper shall have any right to require
the Collateral Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action under this
Agreement except as otherwise expressly stated herein.

6.2 Realization upon Assigned Collateral; Remedies. If any
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Trustee,
upon receipt by a Responsible Officer of the Collateral Trustee of notice
thereof with a direction (which direction shall be in writing (which may
include telecopy)) of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders shall
exercise any rights and remedies available to it under applicable law,
including taking possession of the Assigned Collateral and assigning,
optioning, discounting, disposing of or selling the whole, or from time to time
any part of, the Assigned Collateral, by private or public sale or sales in
such order or otherwise in such manner as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably elect in its sole discretion (so long as such sale shall be
conducted in a commercially reasonable manner); provided that, except upon
receipt by a Responsible Officer of the Collateral Trustee of written notice of
(i) the occurrence of an Event of Default set forth in subsection 8(r) or (s)
of the Liquidity Agreement or (ii) an order for relief under the federal
Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) having been entered in any case
or proceeding relating to the Borrower, the Collateral Trustee shall not sell
or otherwise liquidate the Assigned Collateral without the consent of the
holders of a majority in outstanding face amount of the Trust Certificates
unless the Administrative Agent, the Owner Trustee and the Depositary,
respectively, shall certify to the Collateral Trustee that the proceeds of such
sale or liquidation are sufficient to (a) repay the Obligations in full and (b)
distribute to the Certificateholders the Aggregate OTC Amount and all other
amounts to which they are entitled pursuant to the Trust Agreement; and
provided, further, that the Collateral Trustee shall not sell or otherwise
liquidate the Assigned Collateral without the consent of holders of 75% of the
aggregate Principal Component of outstanding Commercial Paper Notes unless the
Administrative Agent and the Depositary, respectively, shall certify to the
Collateral Trustee that the proceeds of such sale or liquidation are sufficient
to repay the Obligations in full (including accrued interest thereon).

The Collateral Trustee shall have, with respect to the
Assigned Collateral, in addition to any other rights and remedies which may be
available to it at law or in equity or pursuant to this Agreement or any other
contract or agreement, all rights and remedies of a secured party under any
applicable version of the UCC of the relevant jurisdictions relating to the
Assigned Collateral, and it is expressly agreed that if the Collateral Trustee
should proceed to dispose of, utilize or sell the Assigned Collateral, or any
part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of such relevant versions of
the UCC, ten Business Days' notice by the Collateral Trustee to the Borrower
shall be
<PAGE> 26
26

deemed to be reasonable notice under any such provision requiring such notice.

The Borrower hereby expressly agrees that no notice of any
sale or disposition of any Eligible Investments need be given. Any sale or
other disposition of Assigned Collateral by the Collateral Trustee may be made
on such commercially reasonable terms as the Administrative Agent may choose,
without assuming any credit risk and without any obligation to advertise or
give notice of any kind other than that necessary under applicable law.
Neither the Collateral Trustee nor the Administrative Agent shall incur any
liability as a result of the sale of the Assigned Collateral, or any part
thereof, at any private or public sale conducted in accordance with this
Agreement. The Collateral Trustee or any Lender may buy any Assigned
Collateral at any public sale conducted in accordance with this Agreement free
of any right or equity of redemption of the Borrower, which right or equity is
hereby waived or released. The Collateral Trustee shall provide each of the
Rating Agencies prior notice of the date on which a public sale, or the date
after which a private sale or other disposition, by the Collateral Trustee of
any Assigned Collateral is intended to take place; provided, however, that the
failure to give any such notice shall not in any way alter, modify or affect
the obligations of the Borrower or the powers, obligations or liability of the
Collateral Trustee.

The Collateral Trustee's sole duty with respect to the
custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Assigned Collateral in
its possession shall be to deal with it in a similar manner as the Collateral
Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to Section
9-207 of the applicable version of the UCC and subject to the protections and
limitations on liability afforded to the Collateral Trustee under this
Agreement. Neither the Collateral Trustee, nor any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize
upon all or any part of the Assigned Collateral or for any delay in doing so or
shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Assigned
Collateral, provided that it has acted in accordance with the instructions of
the Majority Lenders or the Administrative Agent and in compliance with
applicable law and this Agreement.

6.3 Waiver of Stays, etc. To the full extent that the
Borrower may lawfully so agree, the Borrower agrees that it will not at any
time plead, claim or take the benefit of any appraisement, valuation, stay,
extension, moratorium or redemption law now or hereafter in force to prevent or
delay the enforcement of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the
absolute sale of any portion of or all of the Assigned Collateral in accordance
with this Agreement or the possession thereof by any purchaser at any sale
under and in compliance with this Agreement, and the Borrower, for itself and
all who may claim
<PAGE> 27
27

under the Borrower, as far as the Borrower now or hereafter lawfully may do so,
hereby waives the benefit of all such laws.

6.4 Sale of Certain Collateral. The Borrower recognizes that
the Collateral Trustee may be unable to effect a public sale of the Assigned
Collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws, and instead may resort to one or more
private sales of the Assigned Collateral to a restricted group of purchasers
who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such security for
their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or
resale thereof. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that any such private
sale or sales may result in prices and other terms less favorable to the
Borrower than if the disposition were made pursuant to a public sale and,
notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale or sales
made in an otherwise commercially reasonable manner shall not be deemed
commercially unreasonable solely because of the private nature of such sales.
Subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection 6.2, the Collateral Trustee
shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Assigned Collateral
for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer of any securities to
register them for public sale under the Securities Act or under applicable
state securities laws, even if such issuers would agree to do so.

SECTION 7. THE COLLATERAL TRUSTEE

7.1 Acceptance of Trust. The Collateral Trustee, for
itself and its successors, hereby accepts the trusts created by this Agreement
upon and subject to the terms and conditions hereof.

7.2 Exculpatory Provisions. (a) The Collateral Trustee
shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for the correctness of any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein, all of which are
made solely by the Borrower. The Collateral Trustee makes no representations
as to the value or condition of the Assigned Collateral or any part thereof, or
as to the title of the Borrower thereto or as to the security or perfection
afforded by this Agreement, or as to the validity, execution (except its own
execution), enforceability (except against itself), legality or sufficiency of
this Agreement or the Obligations, and the Collateral Trustee shall incur no
liability or responsibility in respect of any such matters. The Collateral
Trustee shall not be responsible for insuring the Assigned Collateral or for
the payment of taxes, charges or assessments or discharging of liens upon the
Assigned Collateral or otherwise as to the maintenance of the Assigned
Collateral, except as provided in subsection 6.2 as to the custody, safekeeping
and physical preservation of the Assigned Collateral.
<PAGE> 28
28

(b) The Collateral Trustee shall not be required to
ascertain or inquire as to the performance by the Borrower of any of the
covenants or agreements contained herein. Whenever it is necessary, or in the
opinion of the Collateral Trustee advisable, for the Collateral Trustee to
ascertain the amount of Obligations then held by Secured Parties, the
Collateral Trustee may conclusively rely on a certificate of the Administrative
Agent.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Collateral Trustee shall be under no obligation or duty to
take any remedial or other action under this Agreement if taking such action
(i) would subject the Collateral Trustee to a tax in any jurisdiction where it
is not then subject to a tax or (ii) would require the Collateral Trustee to
qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified,
unless the Collateral Trustee receives first security or indemnity satisfactory
to it against such tax (or equivalent liability), or any liability resulting
from such qualification, in each case as results from the taking of such action
under this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Collateral Trustee shall not be personally liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with this Agreement except for
its own negligence or willful misconduct.

7.3 Delegation of Duties. The Collateral Trustee may
execute any of the trusts or powers hereof and perform any duty hereunder
either directly or by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact, who may include
officers and employees of the Borrower or any of the Lenders. The Collateral
Trustee shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters
pertaining to such trusts, powers and duties. The Collateral Trustee shall not
be responsible for the supervision of or the negligence or misconduct of any
agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. The
Collateral Trustee may enter into agreements with such agents or
attorneys-in-fact in such form as it may deem necessary or advisable, and shall
be entitled to amend, modify, or waive the provisions of such agreements from
time to time.

7.4 Reliance by Collateral Trustee. (a) Whenever in the
administration of this Agreement the Collateral Trustee shall deem it necessary
or desirable that a factual matter be proved or established in connection with
the Collateral Trustee's taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder,
such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof is herein specifically
prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved or established by a
certificate delivered to the Collateral Trustee by a Borrower Representative in
the case of the Borrower, a Depositary Representative in the case of the
Depositary or by a Responsible Officer in the case of any other Person, and
such certificate shall be full warrant to the Collateral Trustee for
<PAGE> 29
29

any action reasonably taken, suffered or omitted in reliance thereon, subject,
however, to the provisions of subsection 7.5.

(b) The Collateral Trustee may consult with counsel, and
any written opinion or advice of counsel with respect to legal matters shall be
full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action
reasonably taken or suffered by them hereunder in accordance therewith. The
Collateral Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions
concerning the administration of this Agreement from any court of competent
jurisdiction.

(c) The Collateral Trustee may rely, and shall be fully
protected in acting, upon any resolution, statement, certificate, instrument,
opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond or other paper or
document which it has no reason to believe to be other than genuine and to have
been signed or presented by the proper party or parties or, in the case of
cables, telecopies and telexes, to have been sent by the proper party or
parties. In the absence of its negligence or willful misconduct, the
Collateral Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and
the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or
opinions furnished to the Collateral Trustee and conforming to the requirements
of this Agreement. The Collateral Trustee may deem and treat the payee of any
Commercial Paper Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written
notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed
with the Collateral Trustee. The Collateral Trustee shall be fully justified
in failing or refusing to take any discretionary action under this Agreement
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority
Lenders (or, to the extent that this Agreement expressly requires a higher
percentage of Lenders, such higher percentage) as it deems appropriate or it
shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and
all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action, provided, however, that nothing herein
shall obligate the Collateral Trustee to obtain or seek the consent or advice
of any of the Lenders, except to the extent otherwise expressly required by
this Agreement; and provided, further, that from and after the date on which
the Collateral Trustee receives written notice from the Administrative Agent
that the Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments have been
terminated, any advice or instructions with respect to actions by the
Collateral Trustee shall be given by the Owner Trustee, at the direction of the
Certificateholders, rather than the Lenders; and provided, further that nothing
herein shall permit the Collateral Trustee to fail to take any action required
to be taken by it in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
Collateral Trustee shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of
the Majority Lenders (or, to the extent that this Agreement expressly requires
a higher percentage of Lenders, such
<PAGE> 30
30

higher percentage), or the Administrative Agent on their behalf (or, upon
payment of the Obligations and termination of the Commitments, the Owner
Trustee, at the direction of the Certificateholders), and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the
Lenders, all holders of Commercial Paper, all Persons who thereafter become
obligated to make Loans under the Liquidity Agreement, all future holders of
Commercial Paper Notes and all future Certificateholders.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, the Collateral Trustee shall not be under any obligation to
exercise any of the rights or powers vested in the Collateral Trustee by this
Agreement or expend or risk funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
the performance of any of its rights or powers hereunder, whether at the
request or direction of the Majority Lenders or the Administrative Agent on the
Lenders' behalf pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, unless the Collateral
Trustee first shall have been provided adequate security and indemnity
reasonably satisfactory to it against the reasonable costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) and liabilities which may be incurred
by it in compliance with such request or direction, including such reasonable
advances as may be requested by the Collateral Trustee.

(e) Upon any application or demand by the Borrower
(except to the extent any such application or demand which is expressly
permitted to be made orally) to the Collateral Trustee to take or permit any
action under any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Administrator shall
furnish to the Collateral Trustee a certificate of a Responsible Officer
stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Agreement
or in the Liquidity Agreement relating to the proposed action have been
complied with, and in the case of any such application or demand as to which
the furnishing of any document is specifically required by any provision of
this Agreement relating to such particular application or demand, such
additional document shall also be furnished.

7.5 Limitations on Duties of Collateral Trustee. (a)
The Collateral Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of
the Collateral Trustee has received written notice from the Administrative
Agent, a Lender or the Borrower or has otherwise obtained actual knowledge
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default" and the Collateral Trustee
shall be permitted to assume that no Default or Event of Default has occurred
in the absence of such notice or knowledge. The Collateral Trustee shall take
such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
directed by the Administrative Agent; provided that, unless and until a
Responsible Officer of the Collateral Trustee shall
<PAGE> 31
31

have received such directions, the Collateral Trustee may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the
best interests of the Secured Parties. Unless an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, and the Collateral Trustee has received written notice
thereof, the Collateral Trustee shall be obligated to perform such duties and
only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
Collateral Trustee. If and so long as an Event of Default has not occurred,
the Collateral Trustee shall, subject and pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement, and
shall not be liable with respect to any action taken by it, or omitted to be
taken by it, in accordance with the direction of the Administrative Agent or
the Majority Lenders (or, to the extent a higher percentage is expressly
required by this Agreement, at the direction of such higher percentage) or,
after the Obligations have been fully paid and satisfied, in accordance with
the direction of the Owner Trustee acting at the request of Certificateholders
holding Trust Certificates representing more than 50% of the Aggregate OTC
Amount. If and so long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the Collateral Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it only
to the extent requested to do so by the Administrative Agent or the Majority
Lenders (or, to the extent a higher percentage is expressly required by this
Agreement, at the direction of such higher percentage), or, after the
Obligations have been fully paid and satisfied, only to the extent requested to
do so by the Owner Trustee acting at the request of Certificateholders holding
Trust Certificates representing more than 50% of the Aggregate OTC Amount, and
shall not be liable with respect to any action taken by it, or omitted to be
taken by it, in accordance with the direction of the Administrative Agent or
the Owner Trustee, as applicable.

(b) Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, the
Collateral Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action which
is discretionary under the provisions hereof except upon the written request of
the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Majority Lenders (or, to the extent
that this Agreement expressly requires a higher percentage of Lenders, such
higher percentage). The Collateral Trustee shall make available for inspection
and copying by the Administrative Agent and each Lender during normal business
hours, upon reasonable request and at the expense of the Borrower, at offices
designated by the Collateral Trustee, each certificate or other paper furnished
to the Collateral Trustee by the Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement
or any of the Assigned Collateral.

(c) No provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
impose any duty or obligation on the Collateral Trustee to perform any act or
acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on
it, in any jurisdiction in
<PAGE> 32
32

which it shall be illegal, or in which the Collateral Trustee shall be
unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any
such act or acts or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation or if
such performance or exercise would constitute doing business by the Collateral
Trustee in such jurisdiction or imposes a tax on the Collateral Trustee by
reason thereof. No permissive power or authority available to the Collateral
Trustee shall be construed to be a duty.

7.6 Moneys to be Held in Trust. All moneys received by
the Collateral Trustee under or pursuant to any provision of this Agreement
(except Collateral Trustee fees, expenses and indemnity payments) shall be held
in trust for the purposes for which they were paid or are held. The Collateral
Trustee shall be responsible only for moneys actually received by it and all
payments and credits shall be conditional upon clearance and actual receipt of
final payment and any instructions required by this Agreement.

7.7 Resignation and Removal of the Collateral Trustee.
(a) The Collateral Trustee may at any time, by giving written notice to the
Administrative Agent, the Administrator, the Borrower, the Owner Trustee and
the Rating Agencies, resign and be discharged of the responsibilities hereby
created, such resignation to become effective upon (i) the appointment of a
successor Collateral Trustee, (ii) the acceptance of such appointment by such
successor Collateral Trustee and (iii) the approval of such successor
Collateral Trustee evidenced by one or more instruments signed by the
Administrative Agent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Administrative Agent is authorized to appoint a successor
Collateral Trustee subject to the approval of the Administrator and the holders
of the majority in principal amount of the Trust Certificates, which approvals
shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed. If no successor Collateral
Trustee shall be appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 90
days after the Collateral Trustee gives the aforesaid notice of resignation,
the Collateral Trustee or the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the
Administrator may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a
successor Collateral Trustee to act until such time, if any, as a successor
Collateral Trustee shall have been appointed as provided in this subsection
7.7. Any successor so appointed by such court shall immediately and without
further act be superseded by any successor Collateral Trustee appointed by the
Administrative Agent as provided in this subsection 7.7. The Administrative
Agent may, at any time upon giving 30 days' prior written notice thereof to the
Collateral Trustee, the Administrator, the Borrower and the Rating Agencies,
remove the Collateral Trustee and appoint a successor Collateral Trustee, such
removal to be effective upon the acceptance of such appointment by the
successor and the approval of such successor by the Administrator and the
holders of the majority in principal amount of the Trust Certificates, which
approvals shall not
<PAGE> 33
33

unreasonably be withheld or delayed. Any Collateral Trustee shall be entitled
to all Collateral Trustee fees to the extent incurred or arising, or relating
to events occurring, before such resignation or removal becomes effective, and
the protections of subsection 9.5(b) with respect to any indemnified
liabilities (as defined in such subsection 9.5(b)) to the extent incurred or
arising, or relating to events occurring, before such resignation or removal
shall survive.

(b) If at any time the Collateral Trustee shall resign or
be removed or otherwise become incapable of acting, or if at any time a vacancy
shall occur in the office of the Collateral Trustee for any other cause, a
successor Collateral Trustee may be appointed by the Administrative Agent as
set forth in subsection 7.7(a). The powers, duties, authority and title of the
predecessor Collateral Trustee as set forth in subsection 7.7(a) shall be
terminated and canceled without procuring the resignation of such predecessor
and without any other formality (except as may be required by applicable law)
than appointment and designation of a successor in writing duly acknowledged
and delivered to the predecessor, the Administrator, the Owner Trustee and the
Rating Agencies and the Borrower. Such appointment and designation shall be
full evidence of the right and authority to make the same and of all the facts
therein recited, and this Agreement shall vest in such successor, without any
further act, deed or conveyance, all the estates, properties, rights, powers,
trusts, duties, authority and title of its predecessor; but such predecessor
shall, nevertheless, on the written request of the Administrative Agent, the
Borrower, or the successor, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to
such successor all the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties,
authority and title of such predecessor hereunder and shall deliver all
Assigned Collateral held by it or its agents to such successor without
recourse. Should any deed, conveyance or other instrument in writing from the
Borrower be required by any successor Collateral Trustee for more fully and
certainly vesting in such successor the estates, properties, rights, powers,
trusts, duties, authority and title vested or intended to be vested in the
successor Collateral Trustee any and all such deeds, conveyances and other
instruments in writing shall, on request of such successor, be executed,
acknowledged and delivered by the Borrower. If the Borrower shall not have
executed and delivered any such deed, conveyance or other instrument within 10
days after it received a written request from the successor Collateral Trustee
to do so, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
predecessor Collateral Trustee may execute the same on behalf of the Borrower.
The Borrower hereby appoints any predecessor Collateral Trustee as its agent
and attorney-in-fact to act for it as provided in the next preceding sentence.
No predecessor Collateral Trustee shall be liable for any acts or omissions of
any successor Collateral Trustee.
<PAGE> 34
34

7.8 Status of Successor Collateral Trustee. Every
successor Collateral Trustee appointed pursuant to subsection 7.7 shall satisfy
the requirements of Rule 3a-7(a)(4) under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended. The Collateral Trustee is, and every successor Collateral Trustee
shall be, a bank or trust company in good standing and having power to act as
Collateral Trustee hereunder, incorporated under the laws of the United States
of America or any State thereof or the District of Columbia and having its
principal corporate trust office within the 48 contiguous States and rated
investment grade by S&P and Moody's and each other Rating Agency then rating
such institution or deemed otherwise acceptable by the Rating Agencies and
shall also have capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than
$50,000,000, if, in the case of any successor Collateral Trustee, there be such
an institution with such capital, surplus and undivided profits willing,
qualified and able to accept the trust hereunder upon reasonable or customary
terms.

7.9 Merger of the Collateral Trustee. Any Person into
which the Collateral Trustee may be merged, or with which it may be
consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger or consolidation to which
the Collateral Trustee shall be a party, shall be Collateral Trustee under this
Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of the parties hereto.

7.10 Co-Collateral Trustee; Separate Collateral Trustees.
(a) If at any time or times it shall be necessary or prudent in order to
conform to any law of any jurisdiction in which any of the Assigned Collateral
shall be located, or to avoid any violation of law or imposition on the
Collateral Trustee of taxes by such jurisdiction not otherwise imposed on the
Collateral Trustee, or the Collateral Trustee shall be advised by counsel,
satisfactory to it, that it is necessary or prudent in the interest of the
Secured Parties, or the Administrative Agent shall in writing so request the
Collateral Trustee and the Borrower, or the Collateral Trustee shall deem it
desirable for its own protection in the performance of its duties hereunder,
the Collateral Trustee and the Borrower shall execute and deliver all
instruments and agreements necessary or proper to constitute another bank or
trust company, or one or more persons approved by the Collateral Trustee and
the Borrower, either to act as co-trustee or co-trustees of all or any of the
Assigned Collateral under this Agreement, jointly with the Collateral Trustee
originally named herein or any successor Collateral Trustee, or to act as
separate trustee or trustees of any of the Assigned Collateral. Any separate
trustee and any separate co-trustee appointed pursuant to this subsection 7.10
shall agree in writing to be bound by subsection 9.13. If the Borrower shall
not have joined in the execution of such instruments and agreements within 10
days after it receives a written request from the Collateral Trustee to do so,
or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Collateral
Trustee may act under the foregoing provisions of this subsection 7.10(a)
without
<PAGE> 35
35

the concurrence of the Borrower and execute and deliver such instruments and
agreements on behalf of the Borrower. The Borrower hereby appoints the
Collateral Trustee as its agent and attorney-in-fact to act for it under the
foregoing provisions of this subsection 7.10(a) in either of such
contingencies. The Collateral Trustee shall notify the Rating Agencies of the
appointment of a separate trustee or co-trustee.

(b) Every separate trustee and every co-trustee, other
than any successor Collateral Trustee appointed pursuant to subsection 7.7,
shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed and act and be such,
subject to the following provisions and conditions:

(i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred
upon the Collateral Trustee in respect of the custody, control and
management of moneys, papers or securities shall be exercised solely
by the Collateral Trustee or any agent appointed by the Collateral
Trustee;

(ii) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred
or imposed upon the Collateral Trustee hereunder shall be conferred or
imposed and exercised or performed by the Collateral Trustee and such
separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee or co-trustees,
jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such
separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee or co-trustees,
except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which
any particular act or acts are to be performed the Collateral Trustee
shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, or
unless the performance of such act or acts would result in the
imposition of any tax on the Collateral Trustee which would not be
imposed absent such joint act or acts, in which event such rights,
powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by
such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee or
co-trustees;

(iii) no power given hereby to, or which it is provided

the Basic Documents, the Trust Estate, the administration of the Trust
Estate or the action or inaction of the Owner Trustee under the Basic

the Administrator, a firm of independent public accountants acceptable to the
Owner Trustee which shall perform the obligations of the Administrator
thereunder. Such accountants or the Administrator shall provide the Owner
Trustee on or before the first Settlement Date with a letter certifying whether
any withholding tax specified in this subsection 2.7(a) is then required and,

Such accountants or the Administrator shall update such letter if and to the
extent it shall no longer be accurate.

effect for so long as any Commitments remain in effect, any Commercial Paper
Note, Loan or Trust Certificate remains outstanding and unpaid or any other
amount is owing to any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any
Certificateholder pursuant to any of the Basic Documents, after which time this
Agreement shall automatically terminate.

6.2 Resignation or Removal of Administrator (a) The
Administrator shall not resign from its obligations and duties
<PAGE> 15
15

under this Agreement, except upon a determination that the performance of its

be evidenced by an opinion of counsel to the Administrator (and reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent), addressed to the Owner Trustee, on
behalf of the Trust, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Collateral
Trustee and the Rating Agencies.

(b) If any one of the following events shall occur and be
continuing (each, an "Administrator Default"):

(i) failure by the Administrator to make or cause to be
made any payment of any amount required to be made hereunder, which
failure continues unremedied for a period of three Business Days after
the date on which written notice of such failure shall have been given
to the Administrator or after discovery of such failure by an officer
of the Administrator;

(ii) failure by the Administrator to deliver any report
required to be delivered by the Administrator pursuant to Section 3 or
4 when due, which failure continues unremedied for a period of two
Business Days (or, in the case of Section 4.2, 10 Business Days) after
the date on which written notice of such failure shall have been given
to the Administrator;

(iii) failure on the part of the Administrator to duly
observe or perform in any material respect any other covenant or
agreement of the Administrator set forth in this Agreement, which
failure continues unremedied for a period of 30 consecutive days after

to be remedied, shall have been given to the Administrator; or

(iv) any representation, warranty, certificate or
statement of fact made or deemed made by the Administrator pursuant to
this Agreement, shall prove to have been incorrect in any material
respect when made or deemed made, and if the consequences of such
representation, warranty, certificate or statement being incorrect
shall be susceptible of remedy in all material respects, such
consequences shall not be remedied in all material respects within 30
days after the Administrator first becomes aware or is advised that
such representation, warranty, certification or statement was
incorrect in a material respect; or

(v) there shall have occurred an Insolvency Event with
respect to the Administrator;

then, and in each and every case, so long as an Administrator Default shall not
have been remedied, the Owner Trustee, upon the request of the Majority Lenders
and the Holders of Trust
<PAGE> 16
16

Certificates representing a majority of the Aggregate OTC Amount, shall
terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Administrator under this
Agreement; provided that such removal shall become effective upon appointment
of a Successor Administrator in accordance with subsection 6.2(c). The Owner
Trustee shall as promptly as possible appoint a Successor Administrator,
subject to the consents required as set forth in subsection 6.2(c).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no Administrator
Default where an Administrator Default would otherwise exist due to a delay in
or failure of performance for a period of 10 Business Days if the delay or
failure giving rise to such Administrator Default was caused by an act of God
or the public enemy, acts of declared or undeclared war, public disorder,
rebellion or sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning, fire, hurricanes,
earthquakes, floods or similar causes. The preceding sentence shall not
relieve the Administrator from using its best efforts to perform its
obligations in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Administrator shall provide to the Owner Trustee, the Collateral
Trustee and the Administrative Agent with prompt notice of such failure or
delay by it, together with a description of its efforts so to perform its
obligations.

(c) Neither the resignation by the Administrator pursuant to
subsection 6.2(a) nor the removal of the Administrator pursuant to subsection
6.2(b) shall become effective until (i) a successor Administrator designated to
the Owner Trustee by the Majority Lenders and Holders of Trust Certificates
representing a majority of the Aggregate OTC Amount shall have been appointed
by the Owner Trustee, and (ii) such successor Administrator shall have agreed
in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement in the same manner as the
Administrator is bound hereunder (any such successor Administrator so
appointed, the "Successor Administrator"); provided, however, that so long as
NFC acts as the Administrator, the Administrator may, at any time without
notice or consent, delegate any duties under this Agreement or under the other
Basic Documents to any Person more than 50% of the voting stock or other
interest of which is owned directly or indirectly by NIC, provided that no such
delegation shall relieve the Administrator of its responsibility with respect
to any such duties hereunder.

(d) The Administrator shall forthwith upon such
termination or removal deliver to the Successor Administrator all property and
documents of or relating to the Trust Estate and the other Collateral then in
the custody of the Administrator and shall cooperate with the Trust and take
all reasonable steps requested to assist the Trust in making an orderly
transfer of the duties of the Administrator to the Successor Administrator.

2.4 Appointment of Owner Trustee. The Depositor hereby appoints the
Owner Trustee as trustee of the Trust effective as of the date hereof, to have
all the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

2.5 Initial Capital Contribution of Trust Estate. (a) The Depositor
hereby sells, assigns, transfers, conveys and sets over to the Owner Trustee,
as of the date hereof, the sum of $1.00. The Owner Trustee hereby acknowledges
receipt in trust from the Depositor, as of the date hereof, of the foregoing
contribution, which shall constitute the initial Trust Estate and shall be
deposited in the Certificate Distribution Account. The Depositor shall pay
organizational expenses of the Trust as they may arise or shall, upon the
request of the Owner Trustee, promptly reimburse the Owner Trustee for any such

3
<PAGE> 5
contribution. Upon the execution of this Agreement and the completion of the
capital contribution referred to in subsection 2.5(a), such Trust Certificate
shall be executed by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust and authenticated
and delivered to the Depositor. For so long as such Trust Certificate is the
only Trust Certificate outstanding, all earnings from the investment of the
proceeds of such capital contribution shall be distributed to the Depositor in
the manner contemplated by the Trust Certificate, and the provisions of
subsection 5.2 shall not apply. In addition, so long as such Trust Certificate
is the only Trust Certificate outstanding, the terms of this Agreement may be
amended, and/or the Trust may be terminated or revoked, by the Depositor in its
sole discretion, and the provisions of Section 10 and subsection 12.1 shall not
apply; provided, however, that no such amendment that adversely affects the
interests of the Owner Trustee in any respect shall be effective without the
consent of the Owner Trustee.

(c) On the Issuance Date, the Depositor shall surrender the Trust
Certificate held by it in the amount of $1.00 in exchange for an interest in a
new Trust Certificate substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A-1 in an
amount equal to at least 1% of the Aggregate OTC Amount on the Issuance Date
and shall make a capital contribution to the Trust in an amount equal to the
excess of (i) the amount of such Trust Certificate over (ii) $1.00 plus any
income earned by the Trust to the Issuance Date that has not been distributed
to the Depositor.

2.6 Declaration of Trust. The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it
will hold the Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions set
forth herein for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders, subject to the
obligations of the Trust under the Basic Documents. It is the intention of the
parties hereto that the Trust constitute a trust under the Trust Statute and
that this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of such trust. It is
the intention of the parties hereto that, solely for federal income, state and
local income and franchise taxes and any other taxes imposed upon, measured by,
or based upon gross or net income, the Trust shall be treated as a partnership. 
The parties agree that, unless otherwise required by appropriate tax
authorities, the Trust will file or cause to be filed annual or other necessary
returns, reports and other forms consistent with the characterization of the
Trust as a partnership for such tax purposes. Effective as of the date hereof,
the Owner Trustee shall have all rights, powers and duties set forth herein and
in the Trust Statute with respect to accomplishing the purposes

4
<PAGE> 6
of the Trust. The Owner Trustee agrees to file the certificate, substantially
in the form set forth as Exhibit B, required under Section 3810 et seq. of the
Trust Statute in connection with the formation of the Trust as a business trust
under the Trust Statute.

2.7 Liability of the Depositor and the Certificateholders. (a) The
Depositor shall be liable directly to and will indemnify the injured party for
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the Trust (including
Expenses, to the extent not paid out of the Trust Estate) to the extent that
the Depositor would be liable if the Trust were a partnership under the
Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act in which the Depositor were a
general partner; provided, however, that the Depositor shall not be liable for
(i) the obligations of the Trust to make payments (whether for principal,
interest, increased costs or expense reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise)
with respect to the Commercial Paper Notes, the Loans or the Trust Certificates
or (ii) any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of
the imposition of any taxing authority of any federal income taxes, state or
local income or franchise taxes, or any other taxes imposed on or measured by
gross or net income, gross or net receipts, capital net worth and similar items
(including any interest penalties or additions with respect thereto) upon the
Certificateholders, the Lenders, the holders of the Commercial Paper Notes, or
the Collateral Trustee (including any liabilities, costs or expenses with
respect thereto). In addition, any third party creditors of the Trust (other
than in connection with the obligations described in the preceding sentence for
which the Depositor shall not be liable) shall be deemed third party
beneficiaries of this subsection 2.7(a). The obligations of the Depositor
under this subsection 2.7(a) shall be evidenced by the Trust Certificates
issued pursuant to subsections 2.5(b) and (c) and subsection 3.9, which for
purposes of the Trust Statute shall be deemed to be a separate class of Trust
Certificates from all other Trust Certificates issued by the Trust; provided
that the rights and obligations evidenced by all Trust Certificates, regardless
of class, except as provided in subsections 2.5(b) and (c) and this subsection
2.7(a), shall be identical.

(b) No Certificateholder, other than the Depositor, to the extent
set forth in subsection 2.7(a), shall have any personal liability for any
liability or obligation of the Trust.

5
<PAGE> 7
2.8 Title to Trust Property. Legal title to all the Trust Estate
shall be vested at all times in the Trust as a separate legal entity except
where applicable law in any jurisdiction requires title to any part of the
Trust Estate to be vested in a trustee or trustees, in which case title shall
be deemed to be vested in the Owner Trustee, a co-trustee and/or a separate
trustee, as the case may be.

2.9 Situs of Trust. The Trust will be located and administered in the
State of Delaware. All bank accounts maintained by the Owner Trustee on behalf
of the Trust shall be located in the State of Delaware or the State of New
York. The Trust shall not have any employees in any state other than Delaware;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall restrict or prohibit the Owner
Trustee from having employees within or without the State of Delaware. 
Payments will be received by the Trust only in Delaware or New York, and
payments will be made by the Trust only from Delaware or New York. The only
office of the Trust will be at the Corporate Trust Office in Delaware.

2.10 Representations and Warranties of the Depositor. The Depositor
hereby represents and warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

(a) The Depositor (i) is a duly organized corporation,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware, (ii) has the corporate power and authority, and the legal
right, to own its assets and to transact the business in which it is
engaged, (iii) is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership or
lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification and (iv) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law,
except in the case of (iii) and (iv) to the extent that the failure to
comply therewith would not reasonably be expected to, in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to it.

(b) The Depositor has the corporate power and authority,
and the legal right, to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement
and has taken all necessary action required by the applicable
Requirements of Law to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement. No consent or authorization of, filing
with, or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or
any other Person (including, without limitation, equity holders or
creditors of the Depositor) is required in connection with the
execution, delivery, performance, validity or

6
<PAGE> 8
enforceability of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered on behalf of the Depositor and constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Depositor enforceable
against the Depositor in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles
(whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

(c) The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement will not violate any Requirement of Law or Contractual
Obligation of the Depositor and will not result in, or require, the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any of its property, assets or
revenues pursuant to any such Requirement of Law or Contractual
Obligation (other than pursuant to the Basic Documents).

(d) No litigation or proceeding or, to the knowledge of the
Depositor, no investigation of or before any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Depositor, threatened by or against the Depositor or against any of
its properties or revenues (a) with respect to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or (b) which would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Depositor.

2.11 Tax Treatment. (a) Each of the Depositor and the Owner Trustee,
by entering into this Agreement, and each Certificateholder, by acquiring any
Trust Certificate or interest therein,

(i) agrees that it will file its own federal, state and
local income, franchise and other tax returns in a manner that is
consistent with the treatment of the Trust as a partnership in which
each of the Certificateholders is a partner; and

(ii) agrees to use reasonable efforts to notify the
Owner Trustee and the Depositor promptly upon receipt of any notice
from any taxing authority having jurisdiction over such
Certificateholder with respect to the treatment of the Trust
Certificates as anything other than interests in a partnership.

7
<PAGE> 9
(b) Each Certificateholder shall furnish the Depositor, the
Administrator and the Owner Trustee with information necessary to enable the
Depositor to comply with United States federal income tax information reporting
requirements in respect of such Certificateholder's interest in its Trust
Certificate. Each Certificateholder agrees to certify, from time to time, in
such manner as may be reasonably requested by the Owner Trustee, whether such
Person is a U.S. Person as such term is defined in the Section 7701(a)(30) of
the Code. Each Certificateholder hereby represents and warrants that such
Certificateholder is a U.S. Person as such term is so defined.

(c) If any withholding tax is imposed on the Trust with respect to an
allocation of income to a Certificateholder as a consequence of such
Certificateholder's not being a U.S. Person, such tax shall reduce the amount
otherwise distributable to such Certificateholder in accordance with Section 5. 
Such Certificateholder shall indemnify the Trust for the amount of any
withholding tax imposed on the Trust as a consequence of such
Certificateholder's not being a U.S. Person and not withheld from amounts
distributable to such Certificateholder and any interest or penalties resulting
from any failure to withhold the amount of any such tax as a consequence of its
breach of its representation set forth in subsection 2.11(b). The amount of
any withholding tax imposed as a consequence of such Certificateholder's not
being a U.S. Person with respect to a Trust Certificate shall be treated as
cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the time it is withheld by the
Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If there is a
possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to an allocation of
income (other than as a consequence of a Certificateholder's not being a U.S.
Person, in which case required amounts may be withheld without the advice of
counsel as described in this sentence), the Owner Trustee may, upon the advice
of nationally recognized tax counsel that such withholding is required under
applicable law, withhold such amounts in accordance with this subsection
2.11(c). Upon receipt of the advice referred to above, the Owner Trustee is
hereby authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise distributable
to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for the payment of any tax that is
legally owed by the Trust (but such authorization shall not prevent the Owner
Trustee from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and deferring
the payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of such
proceedings). If a Certificateholder wishes to apply for a refund of any such
withholding tax, the Owner Trustee shall reasonably

8
<PAGE> 10
cooperate with such Certificateholder in making such claim so long as such
Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Owner Trustee for any out- of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection therewith.

(d) The agreements in this subsection 2.11 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 3. TRUST CERTIFICATES

3.1 Initial Ownership. Upon the formation of the Trust by the
contribution by the Depositor pursuant to subsection 2.5(a) and until the
issuance of the Trust Certificates pursuant to subsection 3.3, the Depositor
shall be the sole beneficiary of the Trust.

3.2 The Trust Certificates. (a) The Trust Certificates (other than
the Trust Certificate issued pursuant to subsection 2.5(a)) shall be
substantially in the form set forth as Exhibit A-1. Each Trust Certificate
other than a Trust Certificate issued to the Depositor (a) shall be issued in
denominations of $500,000 or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof,
which denomination shall equal the outstanding certificate balance of such
Trust Certificate on the date of issuance thereof, and (b) shall evidence the
right to receive an amount equal to the lesser of such denomination and the
outstanding certificate balance of such Trust Certificate as in effect from
time to time. Each Trust Certificate issued to the Depositor (i) shall be
issued in a denomination of any integral multiple of $1, which denomination
shall equal the certificate balance of such Trust Certificate on the date of
issuance thereof, and (ii) shall evidence the right to receive an amount equal
to the lesser of such denomination and the certificate balance of such Trust
Certificate as in effect from time to time as well as the right pursuant to
subsection 5.3(c) to receive distributions of the balance, if any, of the
property held by the Trust upon the satisfaction in full of the Obligations.
The Trust Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual or
facsimile signature of an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee. Trust
Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who
were, at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to
sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be, when authenticated pursuant to
subsection 3.3, validly issued and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so
authorized prior to the authentication and delivery of such

9
<PAGE> 11
Trust Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of authentication
and delivery of such Trust Certificates.

(b) The Trust Certificates shall be typewritten, printed, lithographed
or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable
to the Owner Trustee, as evidenced by its execution thereof.

(c) The terms of the Trust Certificates set forth in Exhibit A shall
form part of this Agreement.

3.3 Authentication of Trust Certificates. (a) On the Issuance Date
and on any Additional Issuance Date, upon the written order of the
Administrator, the Owner Trustee shall cause the Trust Certificates to be
executed on behalf of the Trust, authenticated and delivered to or upon the
written order of the Depositor, signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Depositor, without further corporate action by the Depositor, in authorized
denominations. No Trust Certificate shall entitle its Certificateholder to any
benefit under this Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose, unless there
shall appear on such Trust Certificate a certificate of authentication
substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A, executed by the Owner Trustee
or Chemical Bank, as the Owner Trustee's authenticating agent, by manual
signature; such authentication shall constitute conclusive evidence that such
Trust Certificate shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.
All Trust Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.

(b) No Trust Certificate (other than the Trust Certificate issued
pursuant to subsection 2.5(a)) shall be originally issued unless the conditions
set forth in the related Certificate Purchase Agreement and, in the case of
Trust Certificates to be issued on an Additional Issuance Date, the requirement
set forth in subsection 3.11(d) of this Agreement shall have been satisfied or
waived and the Owner Trustee has received a certificate from a Responsible
Officer of the Depositor as to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in the related Certificate Purchase Agreement and, if applicable, the
requirement set forth in subsection 3.11(d).

(c) Proceeds received by the Trust in respect of the issuance and
sale of the Trust Certificates shall be deposited into the Collateral Account
and applied as set forth in subsection 5.3(a) of the Collateral Trust
Agreement.

10
<PAGE> 12
3.4 Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Trust Certificates. (a) 
The Certificate Registrar shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office or
agency maintained pursuant to subsection 3.8, a Certificate Register in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Owner Trustee
shall provide for the registration of Trust Certificates and of transfers and
exchanges of Trust Certificates as herein provided; provided, however, that no
Trust Certificate may be subdivided upon transfer or exchange such that the
denomination of any resulting Trust Certificate is less than $500,000. 
Chemical Bank shall be the initial Certificate Registrar. Upon any resignation
of a Certificate Registrar, the Owner Trustee shall promptly appoint a
successor or, if it elects not to make such an appointment, assume the duties
of Certificate Registrar.

(b) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Trust
Certificate at the office or agency maintained pursuant to subsection 3.8, the
Owner Trustee shall execute, authenticate and deliver (or shall cause Chemical
Bank, as its authenticating agent, to authenticate and deliver), in the name of
the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Trust Certificates in
authorized denominations of a like aggregate amount dated the date of
authentication by the Owner Trustee. At the option of a Certificateholder,
Trust Certificates may be exchanged for other Trust Certificates of authorized
denominations of a like aggregate amount upon surrender of the Trust
Certificates to be exchanged at the office or agency maintained pursuant to
subsection 3.8. The transfer of the Trust Certificates is subject to the
transfer restrictions contained in subsection 12.9 and may be subject to
further transfer restrictions contained in the applicable Certificate Purchase
Agreement.

(c) Every Trust Certificate presented or surrendered for registration
of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar duly executed by the Certificateholder or his attorney duly
authorized in writing. Each Trust Certificate surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange shall be cancelled and subsequently disposed of by the
Owner Trustee in accordance with its customary practice.

(d) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer
or exchange of Trust Certificates, but the Owner Trustee or the Certificate
Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or
exchange of Trust Certificates.

11
<PAGE> 13
3.5 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Trust Certificates. (a) If
(i) any mutilated Trust Certificate shall be surrendered to the Certificate
Registrar, or if the Certificate Registrar shall receive evidence to its
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Trust Certificate and
(ii) there shall be delivered to the Certificate Registrar and the Owner
Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of
them harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Trust Certificate shall
have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Trust shall execute and the Owner Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in
exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust
Certificate, a new Trust Certificate of like tenor and denomination. In
connection with the issuance of any new Trust Certificate under this Section,
the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Certificate issued
pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of ownership in
the Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or
destroyed Trust Certificate shall be found at any time.

(b) If, after the delivery of a replacement Trust Certificate or
payment in respect of a destroyed, lost or stolen Trust Certificate pursuant to
subsection 3.5(a), a bona fide purchaser of the original Trust Certificate in
lieu of which such replacement Trust Certificate was issued presents for
payment such original Trust Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to
recover such replacement Trust Certificate (or such payment) from the Person to
whom it was delivered or any Person taking such replacement Trust Certificate
from such Person to whom such replacement Trust Certificate was delivered or
any assignee of such Person, except a bona fide purchaser, and shall be
entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the
extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Owner Trustee in
connection therewith.

(c) In connection with the issuance of any replacement Trust
Certificate under this subsection 3.5, the Owner Trustee may require the
payment by the applicable Certificateholder of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and
any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Owner
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar) in connection therewith.

12
<PAGE> 14
(d) Any duplicate Trust Certificate issued pursuant to this subsection
3.5 in replacement of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust
Certificate shall constitute an original additional beneficial interest in the
Trust, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust
Certificate shall be found at any time or be enforced by anyone, and shall be
entitled to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with
any and all other Trust Certificates duly issued hereunder.

(e) The provisions of this subsection 3.5 are exclusive and shall (to
the extent permitted by law) preclude all other rights and remedies with
respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Trust Certificates.

3.6 Persons Deemed Certificateholders. Prior to due presentation of a
Trust Certificate for registration of transfer, the Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name any Trust Certificate
shall be registered in the Certificate Register as the Certificateholder of
such Trust Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to
Section 5 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and neither the Owner Trustee
nor the Certificate Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the contrary.

3.7 Access to List of Certificateholders' Names and Addresses. The
Owner Trustee shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Administrator or
the Depositor, within 15 days after receipt by the Owner Trustee of a request
therefor from the Administrator or the Depositor, as the case may be, in
writing, a list, in such form as the Administrator or the Depositor, as the
case may be, may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the
Certificateholders as of the most recent Record Date. If three or more
Certificateholders apply in writing to the Owner Trustee, and such application
states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Certificateholders
with respect to their rights under this Agreement or under the Trust
Certificates and such application shall be accompanied by a copy of the
communication that such applicants propose to transmit, then the Owner Trustee
shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, afford
such applicants access during normal business hours to the current list of
Certificateholders. Each Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a Trust
Certificate, shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold any of the Depositor,
the Certificate Registrar or the Owner Trustee accountable by reason of the

13
<PAGE> 15
disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from which such
information was derived.

3.8 Maintenance of Corporate Trust Office or Agency. The Owner
Trustee shall maintain an office or offices or agency or agencies in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, where Trust Certificates may be
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and
demands to or upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the Trust Certificates and
the other Basic Documents may be served. The Owner Trustee initially
designates the offices of Chemical Bank, 55 Water Street, New York, New York,
as its principal office for such purposes. The Owner Trustee shall give prior
written notice to the Depositor, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Trustee and to the Certificateholders of any change in the location of the
Certificate Register or any such office or agency. In no event, however, shall
the Owner Trustee move the Certificate Register, or change the office or agency
designated for the foregoing purposes, to any jurisdiction unless the Owner
Trustee has been advised by counsel that such jurisdiction will not impose any
additional tax upon the Trust or any Certificateholder solely as a result of
the maintenance of the Certificate Register, or such office or agency, in such
jurisdiction.

3.9 Disposition by Depositor. On and after the Issuance Date, the
Depositor shall retain beneficial and record ownership of Trust Certificates
representing at least 1% of the Aggregate OTC Amount. Any attempted transfer
of any Trust Certificate that would reduce such interest of the Depositor below
1% of the Aggregate OTC Amount shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Depositor may pledge the Trust Certificates issued to it to NFC pursuant to
the Intercompany Agreement. The Owner Trustee shall cause any Trust
Certificate issued to the Depositor that represents all or a portion of the
Depositor's 1% ownership of the Aggregate OTC Amount (and any Trust Certificate
issued in exchange therefor) to contain a legend stating "THIS CERTIFICATE IS
NONTRANSFERABLE." On any Additional Issuance Date on which additional Trust
Certificates are being issued pursuant to subsection 3.11(a), the Depositor
shall purchase additional Trust Certificates such that the aggregate
certificate balance of the Trust Certificates owned by the Depositor is at
least equal to 1% of the Aggregate OTC Amount (after giving effect to such
additional issuance).

3.10 Depositor as Certificateholder. The Depositor in its individual
or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Trust Certificates and
may otherwise

14
<PAGE> 16
deal with the Owner Trustee or its Affiliates as if it were not the Depositor.

3.11 Issuance of Additional Trust Certificates. (a) On the date of
the occurrence of any increase in the Maximum Aggregate Commitment pursuant to
the Liquidity Agreement, upon the written request of the Administrator and
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in subsection 3.11(d) below, the Trust
shall issue and sell to one or more purchasers approved by the Depositor and
the Administrator in their sole discretion, pursuant to one or more Certificate
Purchase Agreements, additional Trust Certificates in an aggregate amount such
that, after giving effect to such issuance, the Aggregate OTC Amount will be at
least equal to the Required OTC Amount, calculated after giving effect to the
increase in the Maximum Aggregate Commitment on such date.

(b) In the event that the Aggregate OTC Amount has been reduced
pursuant to subsection 5.5(a) and, as a result of such reduction, the Aggregate
OTC Amount on any Settlement Date is less than the Required OTC Amount, upon
the written request of the Administrator and satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in subsection 3.11(d) below, the Trust shall issue and sell to one or
more purchasers approved by the Depositor and the Administrator in their sole
discretion, pursuant to one or more Certificate Purchase Agreements, additional
Trust Certificates in the aggregate amount requested by the Administrator;
provided, however, that, after giving effect to such issuance, the Aggregate
OTC Amount shall not exceed the Trust Asset Balance on such Settlement Date.

(c) In the event that the Majority Lenders agree to extend the
Expiration Date at any time pursuant to subsection 2.23 of the Liquidity
Agreement and the Certificateholders of all outstanding Trust Certificates do
not unanimously consent to such extension in accordance with subsection 4.2(b),
upon the written request of the Administrator and satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in subsection 3.11(d) below, the Trust shall issue and
sell on any Settlement Date on which the Aggregate OTC Amount shall be reduced
pursuant to subsection 5.5(c) to one or more purchasers approved by the
Depositor and the Administrator in their sole discretion, pursuant to one or
more Certificate Purchase Agreements, additional Trust Certificates reflecting
such extended Expiration Date in an aggregate amount equal to such reduction in
the Aggregate OTC Amount.

15
<PAGE> 17
(d) The obligations of the Trust and the Owner Trustee to issue
additional Trust Certificates on any date (such date, an "Additional Issuance
Date") shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions
precedent:

(i) the Depositor shall have given the Owner Trustee
written notice of such issuance three Business Days prior to such
Additional Issuance Date;

(ii) Credits Outstanding on such Additional Issuance Date
shall not exceed the Borrowing Base on such date (after giving effect
to all transactions to occur on such date);

(iii) the Certificate Purchase Agreements with respect to
such issuance shall have been executed and delivered by the parties
thereto and all conditions precedent set forth therein to the issuance
of such additional Trust Certificates shall have been satisfied or
waived; and

(iv) with respect to the right to issue additional Trust
Certificates pursuant to subsection 3.11(a) only, the Rating Agencies
shall have been notified in writing at least 15 days (or such shorter
period as shall be acceptable to the Rating Agencies) prior to the
proposed issuance of additional Trust Certificates and shall have
confirmed in writing that such issuance will not result in the
withdrawal or downgrading of the ratings of the outstanding Trust
Certificates below the rating assigned by each of the Rating Agencies
with respect to the Trust Certificates immediately prior to the
proposed Additional Issuance Date.

3.12 Appointment of Paying Agent. The Owner Trustee hereby appoints
Chemical Bank, as paying agent, and Chemical Bank may appoint any co-paying
agent acceptable to the Owner Trustee (Chemical Bank, as paying agent, any
co-paying agent and any successor thereto, the "Paying Agent"). The Paying
Agent shall make distributions to Certificateholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5 and shall report the amounts of such
distributions to the Owner Trustee. Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable
power to withdraw funds from the Certificate Distribution Account for the
purpose of making the distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee may
revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee determines
in its sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. Chemical Bank shall
be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days' written

16

<PAGE> 18
notice to the Owner Trustee. If Chemical Bank shall no longer be the Paying
Agent, the Owner Trustee shall appoint a successor to act as Paying Agent
(which shall be a bank or trust company). The Owner Trustee shall cause such
successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the Owner
Trustee to execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an instrument in which such
successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Owner
Trustee that, as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying
Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held by it for distribution to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders entitled
thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Certificateholders. The Paying
Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of
a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall so return all funds in its possession to
the Owner Trustee. The provisions of subsections 8.1, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.6 and
Section 9 shall apply to the Owner Trustee also in its role as Paying Agent,
for so long as the Owner Trustee shall act as Paying Agent and, to the extent
applicable, to any other paying agent appointed hereunder.

SECTION 4. ACTIONS BY OWNER TRUSTEE

4.1 Prior Notice to Certificateholders with Respect to Certain
Matters. (a) With respect to the following matters, the Owner Trustee shall
not take action unless at least 30 days before the taking of such action, the

proposed action and the Certificateholders shall not have notified the Owner
Trustee in writing prior to the 30th day after such notice is given that such
Certificateholders have withheld consent or provided alternative direction:

(b) Upon receipt of written notice of any termination of, or

the Trust Servicing Agreement or the Trip Servicer pursuant to Section 7.03 of
the Trip Servicing Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall give prompt written

Certificateholders.

Expiration Date under the Liquidity Agreement without the unanimous written
consent of the Certificateholders.

Trustee shall not have the power to commence a voluntary proceeding in
bankruptcy relating to

18
<PAGE> 20
the Trust without the unanimous prior approval of all Certificateholders.

4.4 Restrictions on Certificateholders' Power. The Certificateholders
shall not direct the Owner Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action if
such action or inaction would be contrary to any obligation of the Trust or the
Owner Trustee under this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents or would
be contrary to subsection 2.3 nor shall the Owner Trustee be obligated to
follow any such direction, if given.

4.5 Majority Control. Except as expressly provided herein, any action
that may be taken or consent that may be given or withheld by the
Certificateholders under this Agreement may be taken, given or withheld by
Certificateholders holding Trust Certificates evidencing not less than a
majority of the Aggregate OTC Amount. Except as expressly otherwise provided
herein, any written notice, instruction, direction or other writing of the
Certificateholders delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be effective if
signed by Certificateholders holding Trust Certificates evidencing not less
than a majority of the Aggregate OTC Amount at the time of the delivery of such
notice, instruction, direction or other writing.

SECTION 5. APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS; CERTAIN DUTIES

5.1 Establishment of Certificate Distribution Account. (a) The Owner
Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, shall establish and
maintain in the name of the Trust an Eligible Deposit Account (the "Certificate
Distribution Account"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds
deposited therein are held for the sole benefit of the Certificateholders.

(b) The Trust shall possess all right, title and interest in all funds
on deposit from time to time in the Certificate Distribution Account and in all
proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the
Certificate Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion and control
of the Owner Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders. If, at any
time, the Certificate Distribution Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit
Account, the Owner Trustee (or the Depositor on behalf of the Owner Trustee, if
the Certificate Distribution Account is not then held by the Owner Trustee or
an affiliate thereof) shall within 10 Business Days (or such longer period, not
to exceed 30 calendar days, as to which each

19
<PAGE> 21
Rating Agency may consent) establish a new Certificate Distribution Account as
an Eligible Deposit Account and shall transfer any cash and/or any investments
to such new Certificate Distribution Account.

(c) The Owner Trustee, upon instruction from the Administrator, shall
(i) upon receipt of any distribution from the Collateral Account or the
Certificate Reserve Account pursuant to the Collateral Trust Agreement for
deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account, deposit the amount so
distributed in the Certificate Distribution Account and (ii) apply amounts so
deposited as set forth in this Section 5.

5.2 Earnings Distributions. (a) The earnings of the Trust
distributable to the Certificateholders on each Settlement Date (the "Monthly
R.O.E. Amount") shall be equal to the sum for all Trust Certificates of the
Interest Amount distributable with respect to each such Trust Certificate on
such Settlement Date.

(b) On each Settlement Date, the Owner Trustee shall distribute from
the Certificate Distribution Account to the Certificateholders, at the written
direction of the Administrator, the lesser of (i) the Monthly R.O.E. Amount
with respect to such Settlement Date plus any Monthly R.O.E. Amount with
respect to any previous Settlement Date not distributed to the
Certificateholders on any previous date and (ii) the amount on deposit in the
Certificate Distribution Account (other than the portion, if any, of such
amount received as distributions in respect of principal or OTC Costs).

(c) The amounts distributed pursuant to this subsection 5.2 shall be
distributed to the Certificateholders pro rata in accordance with the
respective Interest Amounts to which such Certificateholders are entitled.

5.3 Capital Distributions. (a) The amount (the "Monthly Capital
Amount") distributable to the Certificateholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account on each Settlement Date in respect of principal shall be
equal to:

(i) prior to the Wind-Down Date, zero; and

(ii) on or after the Wind-Down Date, an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) the product of (A) the OTC Percentage on such
Settlement Date and (B) the Principal Payment Amount for such
Settlement Date and (ii) the amount of funds available for
distribution to

20
<PAGE> 22
the Owner Trustee pursuant to subsection 5.3(a)(xiii)(I) or
5.3(b)(ii), as the case may be, of the Collateral Trust Agreement;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Monthly Capital Amount
exceed the Aggregate OTC Amount on such Settlement Date.

(b) On each Settlement Date on or after the Wind-Down Date, upon the
written direction of the Administrator, the Owner Trustee shall allocate and
distribute from the Certificate Distribution Account the Monthly Capital Amount
to the Certificateholders, pro rata in accordance with the certificate balances
of their respective Trust Certificates.

(c) On the first Settlement Date after the Wind-Down Date on which the
Required OTC Amount is zero and the amount on deposit in the Certificate
Distribution Account (after giving effect to distribution of all amounts
required to be distributed pursuant to subsection 5.2 on such Settlement Date)
equals the sum of (i) the Aggregate OTC Amount and (ii) the aggregate amount of
OTC Costs not distributed prior to such date, the Owner Trustee, upon the
written direction of the Administrator, shall distribute from the Certificate
Distribution Account the sum of clauses (i) and (ii) above to the
Certificateholders in accordance with the amounts distributable to such
parties. Any amount remaining in the Certificate Distribution Account after
the payment (or setting aside for payment) of all amounts so payable to the
Certificateholders shall be distributed to the Depositor on such Settlement
Date.

5.4 OTC Costs. On each Settlement Date, after giving effect to the
distributions required pursuant to subsections 5.2 and 5.3 (other than 5.3(c)),
the Owner Trustee, upon the written direction of the Administrator, shall
distribute from the Certificate Distribution Account, the lesser of (a) any
accrued and unpaid OTC Costs and (b) the amount of funds available for deposit
into the Certificate Distribution Account pursuant to subsection 5.3(a)(vi)(L)
or 5.3(b)(iv), as the case may be, of the Collateral Trust Agreement.

5.5 Reduction of Aggregate OTC Amount. (a) In the event that the
Aggregate OTC Amount on any Settlement Date prior to the Wind-Down Date shall
exceed the Trust Asset Balance on such Settlement Date and the amount on
deposit in the Certificate Reserve Account is less than the Certificate Reserve
Amount for such Settlement Date, at the written direction of the Administrator,
the Owner Trustee, after giving at least three Working Days' prior written
notice to the Certificateholders, shall decrease the Aggregate OTC Amount on
such Settlement Date, pro rata, by

21
<PAGE> 23
returning a portion of the certificate balance of the Trust Certificates in an
amount equal to such excess, applying funds available for distribution to the
Owner Trustee pursuant to subsection 5.3(a)(xiii)(H) of the Collateral Trust
Agreement for transfer to the Certificate Distribution Account.

(b) In the event that, as a result of a reduction in the Maximum
Aggregate Commitment pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement (other than a
reduction pursuant to subsection 2.23 of the Liquidity Agreement), the
Aggregate OTC Amount on any Settlement Date prior to the Wind-Down Date shall
exceed the Required OTC Amount on such Settlement Date, at the written
direction of the Administrator, the Owner Trustee, after giving at least three
Working Days' prior written notice to the Certificateholders, shall decrease
the Aggregate OTC Amount, pro rata, by returning a portion of the certificate
balance of the Trust Certificates in an amount designated by the Administrator
(an "OTC Decrease Amount"). The OTC Decrease Amount shall be returned to the
Certificateholders through the distribution on each Settlement Date until the
OTC Decrease Amount is distributed in full of an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) (A) the OTC Decrease Amount minus (B) the portion, if any, of the OTC
Decrease Amount distributed on any prior Settlement Date and (ii) the aggregate
amount of funds available to the Owner Trustee for distribution on such
Settlement Date as a result of the transfer on such Settlement Date to the
Certificate Distribution Account pursuant to subsection 5.3(a)(xiii)(H) of the
Collateral Trust Agreement.

(c) In the event that the Majority Lenders agree to extend the
Expiration Date at any time pursuant to subsection 2.23 of the Liquidity
Agreement and the Certificateholders of all outstanding Trust Certificates do
not unanimously consent to such extension in accordance with subsection 4.2(b),
on any Settlement Date occurring after the Majority Lenders agree, and the
Certificateholders fail to agree, to such extension, at the written direction
of the Administrator, the Owner Trustee, after giving at least three Working
Days' prior written notice to the Certificateholders, shall return the
certificate balances of those Certificateholders who did not consent to such
extension by distributing to such Certificateholders the proceeds of the sale
of additional Trust Certificates issued in accordance with subsection 3.11(c)
and made available to the Owner Trustee for distribution on such Settlement
Date as a result of the transfer on such Settlement Date to the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to subsection 5.3(a)(xiii)(H) of the Collateral
Trust Agreement.

22
<PAGE> 24
5.6 Method of Payment. Subject to subsection 10.1(c), distributions
required to be made to Certificateholders on any Settlement Date shall be made
to each Certificateholder of record on the preceding Record Date either by wire
transfer, in immediately available funds, to the account of such
Certificateholder at a bank or other entity located in the United States having
appropriate facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall have provided
to the Certificate Registrar appropriate written instructions at least five
Business Days prior to such Settlement Date and such Certificateholder's Trust
Certificates in the aggregate evidence a denomination of not less than
$1,000,000, or, if not, by check mailed to such Certificateholder at the
address of such Certificateholder appearing in the Certificate Register.

5.7 Accounting and Reports to the Certificateholders, the Internal
Revenue Service and Others.

(a) Promptly upon receipt thereof pursuant to subsection 4.1 of the
Administration Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall send to each
Certificateholder the Monthly Program Statement provided to the Owner Trustee
by the Administrator. In addition, each Certificateholder may obtain a copy of
any of the following documents by submitting a written request therefor to the
Owner Trustee addressed to the Corporate Trust Office: (i) the Annual Statement
as to Compliance delivered to Trip pursuant to Section 3.01 of the Trip
Servicing Agreement, (ii) the Annual Statement as to Compliance delivered to
the Trust pursuant to Section 3.01 of the Trust Servicing Agreement, (iii) the
Annual Certified Public Accountants' Report delivered to Trip pursuant to
Section 3.02 of the Trip Servicing Agreement, (iv) the Annual Certified Public
Accountants' Report delivered to the Trust pursuant to Section 3.02 of the
Trust Servicing Agreement and (v) the Annual Report delivered to the Owner
Trustee pursuant to subsection 4.2(b) of the Administration Agreement.

(b) The Owner Trustee shall (i) maintain (or cause to be maintained)
the books of the Trust on the basis of a fiscal year ending October 31 on the
accrual method of accounting, (ii) deliver to each Certificateholder, as may be
required by the Code and applicable treasury regulations, such information as
may be required (including Schedule K-1) to enable each Certificateholder to
prepare its Federal, state and local income tax returns, (iii) file such tax
returns relating to the Trust (including a partnership information return,
Internal Revenue Service Form 1065) and make such elections as may from time to
time be required or appropriate under any applicable state or Federal statute
or

23
<PAGE> 25
rule or regulation thereunder so as to maintain the Trust's characterization as
a partnership for Federal income tax purposes, (iv) cause such tax returns to
be signed in the manner required by law and (v) collect or cause to be
collected any withholding tax as described in and in accordance with subsection
2.11(c) with respect to income or distributions to Certificateholders. The
Owner Trustee shall not make the election provided under Section 754 of the
Code.

5.8 Signature on Returns; Tax Matters Partner.

(a) The Owner Trustee shall sign on behalf of the Trust the tax
returns of the Trust.

(b) The Depositor shall be designated the "tax matters partner" of the
Trust pursuant to Section 6231(a)(7)(A) of the Code and applicable treasury
regulations.

SECTION 6. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6.1 Reemployment Costs. Each Certificateholder shall be entitled to
be indemnified and held harmless by the Trust from any loss or expense arising
from interest or fees payable by such Certificateholder to lenders of funds
obtained by it to purchase or maintain its interest in its Trust Certificate as
a consequence of any reduction of the Aggregate OTC Amount on a day other than
a Settlement Date. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant
to the foregoing sentence, accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis
for calculating the amount so payable (which may include any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods), submitted by any Certificateholder to the
Owner Trustee (who shall promptly forward such certificate to the
Administrator) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such indemnification
shall be in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest which would have accrued absent a reduction of the Aggregate OTC
Amount as described above, calculated from the date of such reduction through
the next Settlement Date, in each case at the applicable LIBO Rate over (ii)
the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Certificateholder)
which would have accrued to such Certificateholder on such amount by placing
such amount on deposit for the period described in clause (i) above with
leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. This covenant shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

24
<PAGE> 26
6.2 Market Disruption. If on or prior to the first day of any Accrual
Period, the Administrator notifies the Owner Trustee (which notification shall
be conclusive and binding) in writing that (a) no rate appears on Telerate Page
3750 and deposits in dollars are not being offered to the Reference Banks in
the London interbank market two Working Days prior to the beginning of any
Accrual Period, (b) the rate per annum referred to in the definition of "LIBO
Rate" as the basis upon which the interest rate on any Trust Certificate is to
be determined does not accurately reflect the costs to any applicable
Certificateholder of maintaining its investment in its Trust Certificates at
such time or (c) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for
ascertaining the LIBO Rate, the Owner Trustee shall forthwith give written
notice thereof to the Certificateholders and the Administrator by telecopy (or,
in the case of any Certificateholder, if no telecopy information has been
provided to the Owner Trustee, as described in subsection 12.5), whereupon
until the Administrator notifies the Owner Trustee (who shall promptly notify
the Certificateholders) that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no
longer exist, the interest on the Trust Certificates shall be calculated by
reference to the LIBO Rate in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of
such circumstances.

6.3 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the
contrary, if, after the Issuance Date, the adoption of any applicable law, rule
or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Certificateholder with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for such Certificateholder to
maintain its interest in the Trust Certificates to the extent the return on
such Trust Certificates is calculated by reference to the LIBO Rate, and such
Certificateholder shall so notify the Administrator and the Owner Trustee in
writing, then the return applicable to the Trust Certificates held by such
Certificateholder shall thereafter be calculated by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate. Each Certificateholder shall be entitled to be indemnified and held
harmless by the Trust from any loss or expense arising from any such change in
the method of calculating the return on such Certificateholder's Trust
Certificates. If any such change in the method of calculating the return
occurs on a day which is not the last day of an Accrual Period, such
indemnification shall include an amount equal to the excess,

25
<PAGE> 27
if any, of the amount of interest which would have accrued absent such change
in return, calculated from the date of such change through the next Settlement
Date, at the applicable LIBO Rate over (ii) the amount of interest which did
accrue at the Alternate Base Rate during such period. A certificate as to any
additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence, accompanied by a
statement setting forth the basis for calculating the amount so payable (which
may include any reasonable averaging and attribution methods), submitted by any
Certificateholder to the Administrator and the Owner Trustee shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

6.4 OTC Increased Costs. If, on or after the Issuance Date, the
adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Certificateholder with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency:

(i) shall subject any Certificateholder to any tax, duty
or other charge with respect to its Trust Certificates or shall change
the basis of taxation of payments to any Certificateholder of the
principal of or interest on its Trust Certificates or any other
amounts due to such Certificateholder with respect to its Trust
Certificates (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net
income of such Certificateholder imposed by the jurisdiction in which
such Certificateholder's principal executive office is located); or

(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit, deposit insurance assessment or similar requirement
(including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any
Certificateholder or shall impose on any Certificateholder or on the
London interbank market any other condition with respect to its Trust
Certificates;

and if such Certificateholder determines that the result of any of the
foregoing is to increase the cost to such Certificateholder of purchasing or
maintaining its Trust Certificates, or to reduce the amount of any sum received
or receivable by such Certificateholder with respect to its

26
<PAGE> 28
Trust Certificates by an amount deemed by such Certificateholder to be
material, then such Certificateholder may calculate the additional amount or
amounts (collectively, "OTC Increased Costs") which will compensate such
Certificateholder for such increased cost or reduction and deliver to the Owner
Trustee (with a copy to the Administrator) a request for payment thereof
accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for calculating the amount
requested (which may include any reasonable averaging and attribution methods).
Such OTC Increased Costs will, on the Settlement Date subsequent to such
notification, be distributed in the manner provided in subsection 5.3(a)(vi)(L)
or 5.3(b)(iv) of the Collateral Trust Agreement.

6.5 Changes in Capital Requirements. (a) If any Certificateholder
shall determine that, after the Issuance Date, the adoption of any applicable
law, guideline, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in
any applicable law, guideline, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy,
or any change or clarification in the interpretation or administration thereof
by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
Certificateholder with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Certificateholder's or its Parent's capital as a consequence of owning
such Certificateholder's Trust Certificates to a level below that which such
Lender (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Certificateholder to be material, then
such Certificateholder may calculate the additional amount or amounts which
will compensate such Certificateholder (or its Parent) for such reduction and
deliver to the Owner Trustee (with a copy to the Administrator) from time to
time a request for payment thereof accompanied by a statement setting forth the
basis for calculating the amount so requested (which may include any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods).

SECTION 7. AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF OWNER TRUSTEE

7.1 General Authority. The Owner Trustee is authorized and directed
to execute and deliver the Basic Documents to which the Trust is to be a party
and each certificate or other document attached as an exhibit to or
contemplated by the Basic Documents to which the Trust is to be a party, in
each case, in such form as the Depositor shall approve as evidenced
conclusively by the Owner Trustee's execution thereof. In addition to the
foregoing, the Owner Trustee is authorized, but shall not be obligated, to take
all actions required of the Trust pursuant to the Basic Documents. The Owner
Trustee is further authorized from time to time to take such action as the
Administrator recommends with respect to the Basic Documents, and shall execute
and deliver any amendment to a Basic Document or agreement contemplated by a
Basic Document that is furnished to the Owner Trustee by the Administrator
together with a written request for such execution and delivery.

7.2 General Duties. (a) It shall be the duty of the Owner Trustee to
discharge (or cause to be discharged) all of its responsibilities pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and the other Basic Documents and to administer the
Trust in the interest of the Certificateholders, subject to the Basic Documents
and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is hereby acknowledged and
agreed that the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have discharged its duties and
responsibilities hereunder and under the other Basic Documents to the extent
the Administrator has agreed in the Administration Agreement to perform any act
or to discharge any duty of the Trust or the Owner Trustee hereunder or under
any other Basic Document, and the Owner Trustee shall not be held liable for
the default or failure of the Administrator to carry out its obligations under
the Administration Agreement.

7.3 Action upon Instruction. (a) Subject to subsection 4.4 and in
accordance with the terms of the other

28
<PAGE> 30
Basic Documents, the Certificateholders may by written instruction direct the
Owner Trustee in the management of the Trust. Such direction may be exercised
at any time by written instruction of the Certificateholders pursuant to
subsection 4.5.

(b) The Owner Trustee shall not be required to take any action
hereunder or under any other Basic Document if the Owner Trustee shall have
reasonably determined, or shall have been reasonably advised by counsel, that
such action is likely to result in liability on the part of the Owner Trustee
or is contrary to the terms hereof or of any other Basic Document or is
otherwise contrary to law.

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is unable to decide between
alternative courses of action permitted or required by the terms of this
Agreement or under any other Basic Document, the Owner Trustee shall promptly
give notice (in such form as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to
the Certificateholders requesting instruction as to the course of action to be
adopted, and to the extent the Owner Trustee acts in good faith in accordance
with any written instruction of the Certificateholders received, the Owner
Trustee shall not be liable to any Person on account of such action. If the
Owner Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within 10 days of
such notice (or within such shorter period of time as reasonably may be
specified in such notice or may be necessary under the circumstances) it may,
but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action as the
Owner Trustee in good faith believes to be not inconsistent with this Agreement
or the other Basic Documents and in the best interests of the
Certificateholders, and the Owner Trustee shall have no liability to any Person
for such action or inaction.

(d) In the event that the Owner Trustee is unsure as to the
application of any provision of this Agreement or any other Basic Document or
any such provision is ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to be,
in conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the event that this
Agreement permits any determination by the Owner Trustee or is silent or is
incomplete as to the course of action that the Owner Trustee is required to
take with respect to a particular set of facts, the Owner Trustee may give
notice (in such form as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the
Certificateholders requesting instruction and, to the extent that the Owner
Trustee acts or refrains from acting in good faith in accordance with any such
instruction received, the Owner Trustee shall not be liable to any Person, on
account of such action or inaction.

29
<PAGE> 31
If the Owner Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within 10
days of such notice (or within such shorter period of time as reasonably may be
specified in such notice or may be necessary under the circumstances) it may,
but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action as the
Owner Trustee in good faith believes to be not inconsistent with this Agreement
or the other Basic Documents and in the best interests of the
Certificateholders, and shall have no liability to any Person for such action
or inaction.

7.4 No Duties Except as Specified in this Agreement or in
Instructions. The Owner Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to
manage, make any payment with respect to, register, record, sell, dispose of,
or otherwise deal with the Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or refrain from
taking any action under, or in connection with, any document contemplated
hereby to which the Trust is a party, except as expressly provided by the terms
of this Agreement or any other Basic Document or in any document or written
instruction received by the Owner Trustee pursuant to subsection 7.2 or 7.3;
and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement or any
other Basic Document against the Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee shall have
no responsibility for filing any financing or continuation statement in any
public office at any time or to otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of
any security interest or lien granted to it hereunder or to record this
Agreement or any other Basic Document. The Owner Trustee nevertheless agrees
that it will, at its own cost and expense, promptly take all action as may be
necessary to discharge any liens on any part of the Trust Estate that result
from actions by, or claims against, the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity and not in its capacity as Owner Trustee that are not related to the
ownership or the administration of the Trust Estate.

7.5 No Action Except Under Specified Documents or Instructions. The
Owner Trustee shall not manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or otherwise
deal with any part of the Trust Estate except (i) in accordance with the powers
granted to and the authority conferred upon the Owner Trustee pursuant to this
Agreement, (ii) in accordance with the Basic Documents and (iii) in accordance
with any document or instruction delivered to the Owner Trustee pursuant to
subsection 7.3.

7.6 Restrictions. The Owner Trustee shall not take any action (a)
that is inconsistent with the purposes of the Trust set forth in subsection 2.3
or (b) that, to the actual knowledge of the Owner Trustee, would result in the

30
<PAGE> 32
Trust becoming taxable as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes.

will contravene any Federal or Delaware law, governmental rule or
regulation governing the banking or trust powers of the Owner Trustee
or any judgment or order binding on it or any of its properties, or
constitute any default under its charter documents or by-laws or any
indenture, mortgage, contract, agreement or instrument to which it is
a party or by which any of its properties may be bound.

party, as to such fact or matter and such certificate shall constitute full
protection to the Owner Trustee for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
it in good faith in reliance thereon.

the performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement or the other
Basic Documents, the Owner Trustee (i) may act directly or through its agents

appropriate steps, to contact the remaining Certificateholders concerning
surrender of their Trust Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out

the receipt of such written notice from the Depositor, give prompt written
notice to the Administrative Agent and the Certificateholders of the occurrence
of such event; provided, however, that any failure to give a notice required
by this sentence shall not prevent or delay, in any manner, a termination of
the Trust pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection 10.2. Ninety days
after the date the Depositor gives the notice described in the preceding
sentence, unless, before the end of such 90-day period the Owner Trustee shall
have received written instructions from the Administrative Agent, acting on
behalf of the Majority Lenders, and the Certificateholders (other than the

consolidation to which the Owner Trustee shall be a party, or any Person
succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the
Owner Trustee, shall be the successor of the Owner Trustee hereunder, provided
such Person shall be eligible pursuant to subsection 11.1, without the
execution or filing of any instrument or any further act on the part of any of
the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; provided
further that the Owner Trustee shall mail notice of such merger, consolidation
or other succession to the Administrator and the Rating Agencies.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time, for the
purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part
of the Trust Estate may at the time be located, the Administrator and the Owner
Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all
instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the Owner Trustee to act
as co-trustee, jointly with the Owner Trustee, or separate trustee or separate
trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Estate, and to vest in such Person,
in such capacity, such title to the Trust Estate, or any part thereof, and,
subject to the other provisions of this subsection, such powers, duties,
obligations, rights and trusts as the Administrator and the Owner Trustee may
consider necessary or desirable. If the Administrator shall not have joined in
such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do,
the Owner Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment. No
co-trustee or separate trustee under this Agreement shall be required to meet
the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee pursuant to subsection 11.1 and
no notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be
required pursuant to subsection 11.3.

40
<PAGE> 42
(b) Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and
conditions:

(i) all rights, powers, duties, and obligations conferred
or imposed upon the Owner Trustee shall be conferred upon and
exercised or performed by the Owner Trustee and such separate trustee
or co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee
or co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Owner
Trustee joining in such act), except to the extent that under any law
of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be
performed, the Owner Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to
perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties,
and obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust or any
portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and
performed singly by such separate trustee or co- trustee, solely at
the direction of the Owner Trustee;

(ii) no trustee under this Agreement shall be personally
liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee under
this Agreement; and

(iii) the Administrator and the Owner Trustee acting
jointly may at any time accept the resignation of or remove any
separate trustee or co-trustee.

(c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Owner Trustee
shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and
co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument
appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and
the conditions of this Section 11. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon
its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or
property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the
Owner Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the
provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this
Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording
protection to, the Owner Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with the
Owner Trustee and a copy thereof given to the Administrator.

(d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time appoint the
Owner Trustee as its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority,
to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect
of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any

41
<PAGE> 43
separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or
be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall
vest in and be exercised by the Owner Trustee, to the extent permitted by law,
without the appointment of a new or successor trustee.

11.6 Confidentiality. The Owner Trustee agrees to keep confidential
all non-public information provided to it pursuant to the Basic Documents;
provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Owner Trustee from disclosing
any such information (i) to its Affiliates, employees, directors, agents,
attorneys, accountants and other professional advisors in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Basic Documents, (ii) upon the request or

SECTION 12. MISCELLANEOUS

and 10.1(b) of the Liquidity Agreement, this Agreement and the other Basic
Documents may be amended by the Depositor and the Owner Trustee acting
together, with prior written notice to the Rating Agencies, without the consent
of any of the Certificateholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity, (ii) to correct or
supplement any provisions therein that may be defective or inconsistent with
any other such provisions, (iii) to add to the covenants, restrictions or

provided, however, that, with respect to clause (v), such action shall not, as
evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel, adversely affect in any material respect
the interests of any Certificateholder.

(b) Subject to subsections 7.7(b) and 10.1(b) of the Liquidity
Agreement, this Agreement and the other Basic Documents may also be amended
from time to time by the Depositor and the Owner Trustee acting together, with

than a majority of the Aggregate OTC Amount, for the purpose of adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions
thereof or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders;
provided, however, that no such amendment shall (a) increase or reduce in any
manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of, distributions that

without the consent of all Certificateholders.

Owner Trustee shall furnish written notification of the substance of such
amendment or consent to each Certificateholder.

(d) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders
pursuant to this subsection 12.1 to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment or consent, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve
the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents (and any other
consents of Certificateholders provided for in this Agreement or in any other
Basic Document) and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by
Certificateholders shall be subject to such reasonable requirements as the
Owner Trustee may prescribe.

(e) Promptly after the Owner Trustee's execution of any amendment to
the Certificate of Trust, the Owner Trustee shall cause the filing of such

(f) Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, any

will not result in a withdrawal or downgrade of the ratings on the outstanding
Trust Certificates.

12.3 No Legal Title to Trust Estate in Owners. The Certificateholders

provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the Owner Trustee,

acquiring a Trust Certificate has available to it an exemption from the
prohibited transaction rules under Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of
the Code which exemption is applicable to the purchase and holding of the Trust
Certificates. Unless such an exemption is available, by accepting and holding
a Trust Certificate, the Certificateholder thereof shall be deemed to have

Letter.

(b) Within the three-year period following the issuance of any Trust

an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, provided
that in such case the proposed transferee shall have furnished to the
Depositor, the Administrator and the Owner Trustee (A) if such transfer is to
be made in reliance on Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act, a
Purchaser's Letter substantially in the form of Exhibit C signed by the
proposed transferee or (B) if the transfer is to be made in reliance upon any
other exemption from such registration requirements, (1) a Purchaser's Letter
substantially in the form of Exhibit D, signed by the transferor and the
proposed transferee and (2) an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance
satisfactory to the Owner Trustee. The Trust Certificates are also subject to
the minimum denomination specified in subsection 3.2. The Certificates may be
subject to further transfer restrictions contained in the applicable
Certificate Purchase Agreement.

(c) The Owner Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, shall, upon the request
of any Certificateholder, make publicly available such information as the
Administrator advises it is reasonably necessary to permit sales of the Trust
Certificates pursuant to Rule 144 or 144A under the Securities Act; provided
that nothing herein shall require the Owner Trustee to make available any
information in regard to the Owner Trustee or the Administrator, in its
capacity as such or as Servicer or in its individual capacity, that is not
already publicly available.

12.10 No Petition. The Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust, by
entering into this Agreement and each Certificateholder, by accepting a Trust
Certificate, hereby covenant and agree that they will not, prior to the date

46
<PAGE> 48
which is one year and one day after the termination of this Agreement (as
described in Section 10.1), institute against the Depositor, or join in any
institution against the Depositor of, any bankruptcy, reorganization,

Certificate acknowledges that such Certificateholder's Trust Certificates
represent beneficial interests in the Trust only and do not represent interests
in or obligations of the Depositor, the Administrator, the Owner Trustee or any
Affiliate thereof and no recourse may be had against such parties or their
assets, except as may be expressly set forth or contemplated in this Agreement,
the Trust Certificates or the other Basic Documents.

12.12 Headings. The headings of the various Sections and subsections
herein are for convenience of reference only and shall not define or limit any

PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM HEREIN.

WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF
LAW PROVISIONS, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

12.15 Administrator. The Administrator is authorized to execute on
behalf of the Trust all such documents, reports, filings, instruments,
certificates and opinions as it shall be the duty of the Trust to prepare, file
or deliver pursuant to the Basic Documents. Upon written request, the Owner
Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Administrator a power of attorney
appointing the Administrator its agent and attorney-in-fact to execute all such
documents, reports, filings, instruments, certificates and opinions.

SERVICING AGREEMENT

THIS SERVICING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of November 7, 1994 by
and between NAVISTAR FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("NFC" and,
in its capacity as Servicer hereunder, the "Servicer"), and TRUCK RETAIL
INSTALMENT PAPER CORP., a Delaware corporation ("Trip").

R E C I T A L S:

Trip and NFC Asset Trust, a Delaware business trust (the "Trust"), are
parties to the Financing Loan and Security Agreement, pursuant to which from
time to time the Trust will lend, and Trip will borrow, funds to enable Trip to
finance purchases of Trip Receivables. Trip's obligations under the Financing
Loan and Security Agreement will be secured by the Trip Collateral from time to
time owned by Trip.

The Servicer desires to perform the servicing obligations set forth herein
relating to the Trip Receivables securing Trip's obligations under the
Financing Loan and Security Agreement for and in consideration of the fees and
other benefits set forth in this Agreement.

Trip and the Servicer wish to set forth the terms and conditions upon which
the Trip Receivables are to be serviced by the Servicer.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the other good and
valuable consideration and the mutual terms and covenants contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS

SECTION 1.01 Certain Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used in the above
recitals and in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings assigned them
in Appendix A to the Liquidity Agreement dated as of the date hereof among the
Trust, certain financial institutions as lenders thereunder (the "Lenders") and
Chemical Bank, administrative agent for the Lenders, unless otherwise defined
herein.

SECTION 1.02 Other Definitional Provisions. (a) Unless otherwise specified
therein, all terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in the Basic Documents or any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto.
<PAGE> 5
(b) As used herein and in the Basic Documents, and in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto, accounting terms not defined
in Section 1.01, and accounting terms partly defined in Section 1.01, to the
extent not defined, shall have the respective meanings given to them under
GAAP.

(c) The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import
when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement, and Section, subsection, Schedule
and Exhibit references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified.

(d) The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally applicable
to both the singular and plural forms of such terms.

ARTICLE II
ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF TRIP RECEIVABLES

SECTION 2.01. Duties of the Servicer. The Servicer is hereby appointed and
authorized to act as agent for Trip with respect to servicing the Trip
Receivables and in such capacity shall manage, service, administer and make
collections on the Trip Receivables with reasonable care, using that degree of
skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with respect to comparable
medium and heavy duty truck, bus and trailer receivables that it services for
itself or others. The Servicer hereby accepts such appointment and
authorization and agrees to perform the duties of Servicer with respect to the
Trip Receivables set forth herein. The Servicer's duties shall include
collection and posting of all payments, responding to inquiries of Obligors on
the Trip Receivables, investigating delinquencies, sending payment coupons to
Obligors, reporting tax information to Obligors, policing the collateral
securing the Trip Receivables, accounting for collections with respect thereto
and performing the other duties specified herein. Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.02, the Servicer shall follow its customary standards, policies and
procedures and shall have full power and authority, acting alone, to do any and
all things in connection with such managing, servicing, administration and
collection that it may deem necessary or desirable.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer is hereby
authorized and empowered by Trip, the Trust and the Collateral Trustee
(collectively, the "Interested Parties"), pursuant to this Section 2.01, to
execute and deliver any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or
of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments,
with respect to the Trip Receivables and the related Vehicles. The Servicer is
hereby authorized to commence in the name of Trip or, to the extent necessary,
in its own name, a legal proceeding to enforce a Liquidating Receivable as

-2-
<PAGE> 6
contemplated by Section 2.03, and to commence or participate in any legal
proceeding (including a bankruptcy proceeding) relating to or involving a Trip
Receivable (including a Liquidating Receivable). If the Servicer commences or
participates in any such legal proceeding in its own name, the Interested
Parties shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically assigned such Trip
Receivable to the Servicer solely for purposes of commencing and participating
in any such proceeding as a party or claimant, and the Servicer is hereby
authorized and empowered by the Interested Parties to execute and deliver in
the Servicer's name any notices, demands, claims, complaints, responses,
affidavits or other documents or instruments in connection with any such
proceeding. If in any proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce
a Trip Receivable on the ground that it is not a real party in interest or a
holder entitled to enforce the Trip Receivable, each of the Interested Parties
shall, at the Servicer's expense, take such reasonable steps as the Servicer
reasonably deems necessary to enforce the Trip Receivable, including bringing
suit in the name of such Person. The Interested Parties, upon the written
request of the Servicer, shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney
and other documents and take any other steps which the Servicer may reasonably
deem necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing
and administrative duties under this Agreement and the other Basic Documents.
Except to the extent required by the preceding three sentences, the authority
and rights granted to the Servicer in this Section 2.01 shall be nonexclusive
and shall not be construed to be in derogation of any equivalent authority and
rights of the Interested Parties.

SECTION 2.02. Collection of Receivables Payments. The Servicer shall make
reasonable efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of the Trip Receivables as and when the same shall become due, and
shall follow such collection practices, policies and procedures as it follows
with respect to comparable medium and heavy duty truck, bus and trailer
receivables that it services for itself or others. Except as provided in
subsection 2.06(c), the Servicer is hereby authorized

to grant extensions, rebates or adjustments on a Trip Receivable without the
prior consent of the Interested Parties and to rewrite, in the ordinary course
of its business, a Receivable to reflect the full or partial prepayment of a
Trip Receivable with respect to any related Vehicle without the prior consent
of the Interested Parties. The Servicer is authorized in its discretion to
waive any prepayment charge, late payment charge or any other fees that may be
collected in the ordinary course of servicing such Trip Receivable. The
Servicer shall allocate payments on Trip Receivables between principal and
interest in accordance with the customary servicing procedures it follows with
respect to all comparable medium and heavy duty truck, bus and trailer
receivables that it services for itself or others.

SECTION 2.03. Realization Upon Liquidating Receivables. The Servicer shall
use reasonable efforts, consistent with its customary servicing procedures, to
repossess or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of each Vehicle that it
has reasonably determined should be repossessed or otherwise converted
following a default under the Trip Receivable secured by or relating to each
such Vehicle. The Servicer is authorized to follow such practices, policies
and procedures as it shall deem necessary or advisable and as shall be
customary and usual in its servicing of medium and heavy duty truck, bus and
trailer receivables that it services for itself or others, which practices,
policies and procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon or
obtain benefits of any lease assignments, proceeds from any Dealer Liability,
proceeds from any NITC Purchase Obligations, proceeds from any Insurance
Policies and proceeds from any Guaranties, in each case with respect to the
Trip Receivables, selling the related Vehicle or Vehicles at public or private
sale or sales and other actions by the Servicer in order to realize upon any
Trip Receivable. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any case
in which the Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the Servicer shall not expend
funds in connection with any repair or towards the repossession of such Vehicle
unless it shall determine in its discretion that such repair or repossession
shall increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related Trip Receivable by an
amount greater than or equal to the amount of such expenses.

SECTION 2.04. Maintenance of Insurance Policies. The Servicer shall, in
accordance with its customary servicing procedures, require that each Obligor
shall have obtained physical damage insurance covering each Vehicle as of the
execution of the related Trip Receivable, unless the Servicer has in accordance
with its customary procedures permitted an Obligor to self-insure the Vehicle
or Vehicles securing or relating to such Trip Receivable. The Servicer shall,
in accordance with its customary servicing procedures, monitor such physical
damage insurance with respect to each Vehicle that secures or is related to
each Trip Receivable.

SECTION 2.05. Maintenance of Interests in Vehicles. The Servicer shall, in
accordance with its customary servicing procedures and at its own expense, take
such steps as are necessary to maintain perfection of the first priority
security interest created by a Trip Receivable that is a Retail Receivable in
the related Financed Vehicle or Financed Vehicles and of the first priority
security interest in the Leased Vehicle or Leased Vehicles related to any Trip
Receivable that is a Lease Receivable created under the Lease Receivables
Purchase Agreement. Trip hereby authorizes the Servicer to re-perfect such
security interests as necessary because of the relocation of a Vehicle or for
any other reason.

-4-
<PAGE> 8
SECTION 2.06. Covenants of the Servicer. The Servicer hereby covenants as
follows:

(a) except as contemplated in the Basic Documents, the Servicer shall not
release in whole or in part any Financed Vehicle from the security interest
securing, or any Leased Vehicle from the security interest created under the
Lease Receivables Purchase Agreement in respect of, the related Trip
Receivable;

(b) the Servicer shall do nothing to impair the rights of the Interested
Parties in and to the Trip Receivables; and

(c) the Servicer shall not amend or otherwise modify any Trip Receivable
such that the Annual Percentage Rate is decreased or such that the final
scheduled payment on such Trip Receivable will be due any later than the
earlier of (i) 73 months from the date of such amendment or modification and
(ii) one month prior to the Final Scheduled Maturity Date.

SECTION 2.07. Purchase of Receivables Upon Breach of Covenant. (a) Upon
discovery by the Servicer or a Responsible Officer of any of the Interested
Parties of a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Sections 2.05 and 2.06
with respect to any Trip Receivable, the party discovering such breach shall
give prompt written notice thereof to the others. As of the last day of the
Monthly Period during which such breach was discovered or notice of such breach
was received, the Servicer shall, unless it shall have cured such breach in all
material respects, purchase from Trip any Trip Receivable materially and
adversely affected by such breach and the Servicer shall pay the Administrative
Purchase Payment as described in Section 2.10. It is understood and agreed
that the obligation of the Servicer to purchase any Trip Receivable with
respect to which such a breach has occurred and is continuing shall, if such
obligation is fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against the Servicer for
such breach available to any Interested Party. None of the Interested Parties
shall have any affirmative duty to conduct any investigation as to the
occurrence of any event requiring the repurchase of any Receivable pursuant to
this Section 2.07.

(b) Upon receipt of the Administrative Purchase Payment with respect to a
Trip Receivable which is an Administrative Receivable, the Interested Parties
shall each assign, without recourse, representation or warranty, to the
Servicer (and shall take such other actions as the Servicer may reasonably
request to perfect or confirm such assignment) all of such Interested Party's
right, title and interest in, to and under (i) such Administrative Receivable
and all monies due thereon, (ii) the security interests in, or title to, the
related Vehicle and, to the extent permitted by law, any accessions thereto
which are financed by NFC or NLC, (iii) benefits of any lease assignments with
respect to the Vehicles, (iv) proceeds from any Insurance

-5-
<PAGE> 9
Policies with respect to such Administrative Receivable, (v) proceeds from
Dealer Liability with respect to such Administrative Receivable, proceeds from
any NITC Purchase Obligations with respect to such Administrative Receivable
and proceeds from any Guaranties of such Administrative Receivable, (vi)
proceeds of the foregoing and (vii) the Retail Receivables Purchase Agreement
or Lease Receivables Purchase Agreement, as applicable, with respect to such
Administrative Receivable, such assignment being an assignment outright and not
for security. Upon the assignment of such Administrative Receivable described
in the preceding sentence, the Servicer shall own such Administrative
Receivable, and all such security and documents, free of any further
obligations to such Interested Party with respect thereto.

SECTION 2.08. Servicing Fee. In consideration for its services hereunder
and as compensation for expenses paid as contemplated by Section 2.09, the
Servicer shall be entitled to receive on each Settlement Date a Servicing Fee
in an amount equal to 1/12 of 1% of the average daily Trip Pool Balance during
the immediately preceding Monthly Period, payable solely from amounts available
therefor pursuant to and to the extent provided in Section 5.03(a)(vi)(E) of
the Collateral Trust Agreement.

SECTION 2.09. Servicer Expenses. The Servicer shall be required to pay all
expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities hereunder, including
fees and disbursements of independent accountants, taxes imposed on the
Servicer and expenses incurred in connection with distributions and reports.

SECTION 2.10. Deposits to Collateral Account. The Servicer shall remit to
the Collateral Trustee for deposit to the Collateral Account all payments it
receives from or on behalf of the Obligors on or with respect to the Trip
Receivables within two Business Days after receipt thereof. The Servicer shall
remit to the Collateral Trustee for deposit (in immediately available funds) in
the Collateral Account the aggregate Administrative Purchase Payments with
respect to Administrative Receivables to be purchased as of the last day of any
Monthly Period on the immediately succeeding Settlement Date.

such officer's supervision, and (ii) to such officer's knowledge, based on such

SECTION 3.02. Annual Accountants' Report. The Servicer shall cause a firm
of independent accountants, who may also render other services to the Servicer
or Trip, to deliver to Trip, the Owner Trustee, the Collateral Trustee, the

during normal business hours at offices of the Servicer designated by the
Servicer. Nothing in this Section 3.04 shall derogate from the obligation of
the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure of
information regarding Obligors, and the failure of the Servicer to provide
access as provided in this Section 3.04 as a result of such obligation shall
not constitute a breach of this Section 3.04.

SECTION 3.05. Amendments to Schedules of Receivables. If the Servicer,
during a Monthly Period, assigns to a Trip Receivable an account number that
differs from the account number previously identifying such Receivable on the
Schedule of Receivables listing such Trip Receivable, the Servicer shall
deliver to Trip, the Administrative Agent, the Administrator, the Owner Trustee
and the Collateral Trustee on or before the Settlement Date related to such
Monthly Period an amendment to such Schedule of Receivables to report the newly
assigned account number. Each such amendment shall list all new account
numbers assigned to Trip Receivables during such Monthly Period and shall show
by cross reference the prior account numbers identifying such Trip Receivables
on the previously distributed Schedule of Receivables.

SECTION 3.06. Maintenance of Systems and Receivables Lists.

(a) The Servicer shall maintain accounts and records as to each Trip

Trust to the Collateral Trustee). Indication of Trip's, the Trust's and the
Collateral Trustee's interest in a Trip Receivable shall be deleted from or
modified on the Servicer's computer systems when, and only when, the related
Trip Receivable shall have been paid in full, repurchased by NFC or NLC,
purchased by the Servicer or become a Liquidating Receivable, transferred to
the Trust pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement or transferred
pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Financing Loan and Security Agreement.

other transferee computer tapes, records or printouts (including any of those
restored from backup archives) that, if they refer in any manner whatsoever to
any Trip Receivable, indicate clearly that such Trip Receivable has been sold
and is owned by Trip and has been pledged to the Trust (and by the Trust to the
Collateral Trustee) unless such Trip Receivable has been paid in full or
repurchased by NFC or NLC, purchased by the Servicer, transferred to the Trust

the Trip Receivable Files for the benefit of Trip and maintain such accurate
and complete accounts, records and computer systems pertaining to each Trip
Receivable File as shall enable Trip to comply with its obligations under the
Basic Documents. In performing its duties as custodian the Servicer shall act
with reasonable care, using that degree of skill and attention that the
Servicer exercises with respect to the receivable files relating to comparable

Administrative Agent upon 60 days prior written notice. Subject only to the
Custodian's security requirements applicable to its own employees having access

their officers, directors and agents for any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, compensatory damages, payments, costs or expenses of any kind
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Trip, the
Trust, the Lenders and the Collateral Trustee or any of their officers,
directors and agents as the result of any improper act or omission in any way
relating to the maintenance and custody by the Servicer as custodian of the
Trip Receivable Files; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be liable

misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Owner Trustee or the Collateral
Trustee for any portion of any such amount resulting from the wilful
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Collateral Trustee.

Servicer in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or if all of the
rights and obligations of any Servicer shall have been terminated under Section
VI, the appointment of such Servicer as custodian shall be terminated. Upon

the extent of the obligations in this Agreement specifically undertaken by the
Servicer. The Servicer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Trip, the
Trust, the Certificateholders, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the
Collateral Trustee and any of the trustees, officers, directors and agents of
Trip, the Trust, the Certificateholders, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders
and the Collateral Trustee from and against any and all costs, expenses,

duties under this Agreement.

Indemnification under this Section 6.02 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and shall include reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and
expenses of litigation. If the Servicer shall have made any indemnity payments

Person shall promptly repay such amounts to the Servicer, without interest.

(b) Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors or officers or employees
or agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to any Person, except as
specifically provided in this Agreement, for any action taken or for refraining
from the taking of any action pursuant to this Agreement or for errors in

-14-
<PAGE> 18
judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Servicer
or any such Person against any liability that would otherwise be imposed by
reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (except errors in
judgment) in the performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of
obligations and duties under this Agreement. The Servicer and any director,
officer or employee or agent of the Servicer may rely in good faith on the
advice of counsel or on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed
and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising under this
Agreement.

(c) Except as provided in this Agreement, the Servicer shall not be under
any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action that is not
incidental to its duties to service the Trip Receivables in accordance with
this Agreement and that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or
liability; provided, however, that the Servicer may undertake any reasonable
action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement and
the rights and duties of the parties to this Agreement and the interests of the
Trust.

SECTION 6.03. Delegation of Duties. So long as NFC acts as Servicer, the
Servicer may, at any time without notice or consent, delegate any duties under
this Agreement to any Person more than 50% of the voting stock or other
interest of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by NIC. The Servicer may
at any time perform specific duties as Servicer through sub-contractors who are
in the business of servicing medium and heavy duty truck, bus and trailer
receivables; provided, however, that no such delegation shall relieve the
Servicer of its responsibility with respect to such duties.

7.02, the Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties imposed on
it by this Agreement as Servicer except upon determination that the performance
of its duties under this Agreement is no longer permissible under applicable
law. Any such determination permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall
be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Owner
Trustee, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee. No such
resignation shall become effective until the Collateral Trustee or a successor
Servicer shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the
Servicer in accordance with Section 7.02.

pursuant to this Agreement shall prove to have been incorrect in any material
respect when made, and if the consequences of such representation, warranty or
certification being incorrect shall be susceptible of remedy in all material
respects, such consequences shall not be remedied in all material respects
within 30 days after the Servicer first becomes aware or is advised that such
representation, warranty or certification was incorrect in a material respect;
or

(d) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the Servicer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no Trip Servicer Default where
a Trip Servicer Default would otherwise exist due to a delay in or failure of
performance for a period of 10 Business Days, if the delay or failure giving
rise to such Trip Servicer Default was caused by an act of God or the public
enemy, acts of declared or undeclared war, public disorder, rebellion or
sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning, fire, hurricanes, earthquakes,
floods or similar causes. The preceding sentence shall not relieve the
Servicer from using its best efforts to perform its obligations in a timely
manner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Servicer shall
provide all Interested Parties with prompt notice of such failure or delay by
it, together with a description of its efforts so to perform its obligations.

SECTION 7.02. Consequences of a Trip Servicer Default. If a Trip Servicer
Default shall occur and be continuing, the Collateral Trustee, or after the
payment in full of all Obligations, the Owner Trustee, by notice then given in
writing to the Servicer may, in addition to other rights and remedies available
in a court of law or equity to damages, injunctive relief and specific
performance, terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under
this Agreement. On or after the receipt by the Servicer of such written
notice, all authority

-16-
<PAGE> 20
and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the
Trip Receivables or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the Collateral
Trustee pursuant to and under this Section 7.02. Upon the receipt of such
notice, the Servicer's appointment as custodian shall be terminated and, upon
instruction from the Collateral Trustee, the Servicer shall release any Trip
Receivable File to the Collateral Trustee, or its respective agent or designee,
as the case may be, at such place or places as the Collateral Trustee may
designate, as soon as practicable. The Servicer shall be deemed to have
received proper instructions with respect to the Trip Receivable Files upon its
receipt of written instructions signed by an officer of the Collateral Trustee.
The Collateral Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and
deliver, on behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and
all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement of the Trip
Receivables and related documents, or otherwise. The predecessor Servicer
agrees to cooperate with the Collateral Trustee or the successor Servicer in
effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Servicer
under this Agreement, including the transfer to the Collateral Trustee for
deposit in the Collateral Account of all cash amounts that shall at the time be
held by the Servicer or thereafter received by the Servicer with respect to the
Trip Receivables.

SECTION 7.03. Collateral Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor. On and
after the time the Servicer receives a notice of termination pursuant to
Section 7.02, the Collateral Trustee shall be the successor in all respects to
the Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement and the
transactions set forth or provided for in this Agreement, and shall be subject
to all the responsibilities, restrictions, duties and liabilities relating
thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and provisions of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the predecessor Servicer shall remain liable for, and
the successor Servicer shall have no liability for, any indemnification
obligations of the Servicer arising as a result of acts, omissions or
occurrences during the period in which the predecessor Servicer was the
Servicer; and provided, further, that NFC shall remain liable for all such
indemnification obligations of the Servicer without regard to whether it is
still Servicer hereunder. As compensation therefor, the Collateral Trustee
shall be entitled to such compensation (whether payable out of the Collateral
Account or otherwise) as the Servicer would have been entitled to under this
Agreement if no such notice of termination had been given. Notwithstanding the
above, the Collateral Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling so to act, or
shall, if it is legally unable so to act, appoint, or petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint, a successor (i) having a net worth of not
less than $100,000,000 and (ii) whose regular business includes the servicing
of medium and heavy duty bus, truck and trailer receiv-

-17-

<PAGE> 21
ables, as the successor to the Servicer under this Agreement in the assumption
of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the
Servicer under this Agreement. In connection with such appointment and
assumption, the Collateral Trustee may make such arrangements for the
compensation of such successor out of payments on Trip Receivables as it and
such successor shall agree; provided, however, that no such compensation shall
be in excess of that permitted the Servicer under this Agreement. The
Collateral Trustee and such successor shall take such action, consistent with
this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.

SECTION 7.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Administrative Agent, at the
direction of the Required Lenders (or, upon payment in full of the Obligations,
the Owner Trustee at the direction of Certificateholders holding Trust
Certificates evidencing not less than a majority of the Aggregate OTC Amount),
may waive any default by the Servicer in the performance of its obligations
hereunder and its consequences, except a default in making any required
deposits to the Collateral Account in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any
such waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and any Trip
Servicer Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for
every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent
or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. The Servicer shall
give written notice of each such waiver to the Rating Agencies.

ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 8.01. Amendment. Subject to subsection 10.1(b) of the Liquidity
Agreement, this Agreement may be amended from time to time, with the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Majority Lenders; provided,
however, that (i) no such amendment shall increase or reduce in any manner the
amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of, collections of payments on
Receivables or deposits that shall be required to be made to the Collateral
Account without the prior written consent of each Lender, (ii) amend, modify or
waive any provision of Article VII without the prior written consent of the
Required Lenders and (iii) no amendment hereto which would increase the duties
or liabilities of, or the scope of the authorization granted by, the Trust or
the Collateral Trustee hereunder shall be effective without the prior written
consent of the Trust or the Collateral Trustee, as applicable; and provided,
further, that no amendment hereunder shall be made without a confirmation by
each of the Rating Agencies that such action will not result in a withdrawal or
downgrade of its then current ratings of the outstanding Commercial Paper Notes
and Trust Certificates.

SERVICING AGREEMENT

THIS SERVICING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of November 7,
1994 by and between NAVISTAR FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
("NFC" and, in its capacity as Servicer hereunder, the "Servicer"), and NFC
ASSET TRUST, a Delaware business trust (the "Trust").

R E C I T A L S:

The Trust and Truck Retail Instalment Paper Corp., a Delaware
corporation ("Trip"), are parties to the Receivables Purchase Agreement,
pursuant to which from time to time the Trust will purchase, and Trip will
sell, Trust Receivables and certain related assets.

The Servicer desires to perform the servicing obligations set forth
herein relating to the Trust Receivables for and in consideration of the fees
and other benefits set forth in this Agreement.

The Servicer and the Trust wish to set forth the terms and conditions
upon which the Trust Receivables are to be serviced by the Servicer.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the other good and
valuable consideration and the mutual terms and covenants contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS

SECTION 1.01 Certain Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used in the
above recitals and in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings

hereof among the Trust, certain financial institutions as lenders thereunder
(the "Lenders") and Chemical Bank, administrative agent for the Lenders, unless
otherwise defined herein.

SECTION 1.02 Other Definitional Provisions. (a) Unless otherwise

specified.

(d) The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms.

ARTICLE II
ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF TRUST RECEIVABLES

SECTION 2.01. Duties of the Servicer. The Servicer is hereby
appointed and authorized to act as agent for the Trust with respect to
servicing the Trust Receivables and in such capacity shall manage, service,
administer and make collections on the Trust Receivables with reasonable care,
using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with
respect to comparable medium and heavy duty truck, bus and trailer receivables
that it services for itself or others. The Servicer hereby accepts such
appointment and authorization and agrees to perform the duties of Servicer with
respect to the Trust Receivables set forth herein. The Servicer's duties shall
include collection and posting of all payments, responding to inquiries of
Obligors on the Trust Receivables, investigating delinquencies, sending payment
coupons to Obligors, reporting tax information to Obligors, policing the
collateral securing the Trust Receivables, accounting for collections with
respect thereto and performing the other duties specified herein. Subject to
the provisions of Section 2.02, the Servicer shall follow its customary
standards, policies and procedures and shall have full power and authority,
acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with such managing,
servicing, administration and collection that it may deem necessary or
desirable.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer
is hereby authorized and empowered by the Trust and the Collateral Trustee
(collectively, the "Interested Parties"), pursuant to this Section 2.01, to
execute and deliver any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or
of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments,
with respect to the Trust Receivables and the related Vehicles. The Servicer
is hereby authorized to commence in the name of the Trust or, to the extent
necessary, in its own name, a legal proceeding to enforce a Liquidating
Receivable as contemplated by Section 2.03, and to commence or participate in
any legal proceeding (including a bankruptcy proceeding) relating to or

- 2 -
<PAGE> 6
involving a Trust Receivable (including a Liquidating Receivable). If the
Servicer commences or participates in any such legal proceeding in its own
name, the Interested Parties shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically
assigned such Trust Receivable to the Servicer solely for purposes of
commencing and participating in any such proceeding as a party or claimant, and
the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered by the Interested Parties to
execute and deliver in the Servicer's name any notices, demands, claims,
complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or instruments in
connection with any such proceeding. If in any proceeding it is held that the
Servicer may not enforce a Trust Receivable on the ground that it is not a real
party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Trust Receivable, each of
the Interested Parties shall, at the Servicer's expense, take such reasonable
steps as the Servicer reasonably deems necessary to enforce the Trust
Receivable, including bringing suit in the name of such Person. The Interested
Parties, upon the written request of the Servicer, shall furnish the Servicer
with any powers of attorney and other documents and take any other steps which
the Servicer may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate to enable the
Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under this
Agreement and the other Basic Documents. Except to the extent required by the
preceding three sentences, the authority and rights granted to the Servicer in
this Section 2.01 shall be nonexclusive and shall not be construed to be in
derogation of any equivalent authority and rights of the Interested Parties.

SECTION 2.02. Collection of Receivables Payments. The Servicer
shall make reasonable efforts to collect all payments called for under the
terms and provisions of the Trust Receivables as and when the same shall become
due, and shall follow such collection practices, policies and procedures as it
follows with respect to comparable medium and heavy duty truck, bus and trailer
receivables that it services for itself or others. Except as provided in
subsection 2.06(c), the Servicer is hereby authorized to grant extensions,
rebates or adjustments on a Trust Receivable without the prior consent of the
Interested Parties and to rewrite, in the ordinary course of its business, a
Receivable to reflect the full or partial prepayment of a Trust Receivable with
respect to any related Vehicle without the prior consent of the Interested
Parties. The Servicer is authorized in its discretion to waive any prepayment
charge, late payment charge or any other fees that may be collected in the
ordinary course of servicing such Trust Receivable. The Servicer shall
allocate payments on Trust Receivables between principal and interest in
accordance with the customary servicing procedures it follows with respect to
all comparable medium and heavy duty truck, bus and trailer receivables that it
services for itself or others.

- 3 -
<PAGE> 7
SECTION 2.03. Realization Upon Liquidating Receivables. The
Servicer shall use reasonable efforts, consistent with its customary servicing
procedures, to repossess or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of each
Vehicle that it has reasonably determined should be repossessed or otherwise
converted following a default under the Trust Receivable secured by or relating
to each such Vehicle. The Servicer is authorized to follow such practices,
policies and procedures as it shall deem necessary or advisable and as shall be
customary and usual in its servicing of medium and heavy duty truck, bus and
trailer receivables that it services for itself or others, which practices,
policies and procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon or
obtain benefits of any lease assignments, proceeds from any Dealer Liability,
proceeds from any NITC Purchase Obligations, proceeds from any Insurance
Policies and proceeds from any Guaranties, in each case with respect to the
Trust Receivables, selling the related Vehicle or Vehicles at public or private
sale or sales and other actions by the Servicer in order to realize upon any
Trust Receivable. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any case
in which the Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the Servicer shall not expend
funds in connection with any repair or towards the repossession of such Vehicle
unless it shall determine in its discretion that such repair or repossession
shall increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related Trust Receivable by
an amount greater than or equal to the amount of such expenses.

SECTION 2.04. Maintenance of Insurance Policies. The Servicer
shall, in accordance with its customary servicing procedures, require that each
Obligor shall have obtained physical damage insurance covering each Vehicle as
of the execution of the related Trust Receivable, unless the Servicer has in
accordance with its customary procedures permitted an Obligor to self-insure
the Vehicle or Vehicles securing or relating to such Trust Receivable. The
Servicer shall, in accordance with its customary servicing procedures, monitor
such physical damage insurance with respect to each Vehicle that secures or is
related to each Trust Receivable.

SECTION 2.05. Maintenance of Interests in Vehicles. The Servicer
shall, in accordance with its customary servicing procedures and at its own

SECTION 2.06. Covenants of the Servicer. The Servicer hereby
covenants as follows:

(a) except as contemplated in the Basic Documents, the Servicer

under the Lease Receivables Purchase Agreement in respect of, the related Trust
Receivable;

(b) the Servicer shall do nothing to impair the rights of the
Interested Parties in and to the Trust Receivables; and

(c) the Servicer shall not amend or otherwise modify any Trust

such breach was received, the Servicer shall, unless it shall have cured such
breach in all material respects, purchase from the Trust any Trust Receivable
materially and adversely affected by such breach and the Servicer shall pay the
Administrative Purchase Payment as described in Section 2.10. It is understood
and agreed that the obligation of the Servicer to purchase any Trust Receivable
with respect to which such a breach has occurred and is continuing shall, if
such obligation is fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against the Servicer
for such breach available to any Interested Party. None of the Interested
Parties shall have any affirmative duty to conduct any investigation as to the
occurrence of any event requiring the repurchase of any Receivable pursuant to
this Section 2.07.

(b) Upon receipt of the Administrative Purchase Payment with
respect to a Trust Receivable which is an Administrative Receivable, the
Interested Parties shall each assign, without recourse, representation or
warranty, to the Servicer (and shall take such other actions as the Servicer
may reasonably request to perfect or confirm such assignment) all of such
Interested Party's right, title and interest in, to and under (i) such
Administrative Receivable and all monies due thereon, (ii) the security
interests in, or title to, the related Vehicle and, to the extent permitted by
law, any accessions thereto which are financed by NFC or NLC, (iii) benefits of
any lease assignments

with respect to the Vehicles, (iv) proceeds from any Insurance Policies with
respect to such Administrative Receivable, (v) proceeds from Dealer Liability

any Guaranties of such Administrative Receivable, (vi) proceeds of the
foregoing and (vii) the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Retail
Receivables Purchase Agreement or Lease Receivables Purchase Agreement, as
applicable, with respect to such Administrative Receivable, such assignment
being an assignment outright and not for security. Upon the assignment of such
Administrative Receivable described in the preceding sentence, the Servicer
shall own such Administrative Receivable, and all such security and documents,
free of any further obligations to such Interested Party with respect thereto.

hereunder and as compensation for expenses paid as contemplated by Section
2.09, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive on each Settlement Date a
Servicing Fee in an amount equal to 1/12 of 1% of the Trust Pool Balance with
respect to each Trust Pool as of the last day of the immediately preceding
Monthly Period (multiplied by, in the case of a Trust Pool that was acquired by
the Trust during such Monthly Period, the number of days from the Purchase
Cutoff Date for such Trust Pool through the last day of such Monthly Period
divided by 30), payable solely from amounts available therefor pursuant to and
to the extent provided in Section 5.03(a)(vi)(E) of the Collateral Trust
Agreement.

the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure of

access as provided in this Section 3.04 as a result of such obligation shall
not constitute a breach of this Section 3.04.

Receivable on the Schedule of Trust Receivables listing such Trust Receivable,

security interest in, or otherwise transfer any interest in medium or heavy

against the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Lenders and the Collateral Trustee or
any of their officers, directors and agents as the result of any improper act
or omission in any way relating to the maintenance and custody by the Servicer

Servicer shall not be liable to the Trust for any portion of any such amount
resulting from the willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Owner

- 14 -
<PAGE> 18
this Agreement, for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any
action pursuant to this Agreement or for errors in judgment; provided, however,
that this provision shall not protect the Servicer or any such Person against

duties or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this

action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement and
the rights and duties of the parties to this Agreement and the interests of the
Trust.

Servicer, the Servicer may, at any time without notice or consent, delegate any

to the Owner Trustee, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Trustee. No
such resignation shall become effective until the Collateral Trustee or a
successor Servicer shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of
the Servicer in accordance with Section 7.02.

ARTICLE VII
DEFAULT

SECTION 7.01. Trust Servicer Defaults. Each of the following shall
constitute a "Trust Servicer Default":

(a) any failure by the Servicer to deliver to the Collateral
Trustee for deposit in the Collateral Account any required payment, which
failure continues unremedied for a period of three Business Days after written
notice is received by the Servicer from the Collateral Trustee or after
discovery of such failure by an officer of the Servicer;

(b) failure on the part of the Servicer duly to observe or perform
in any material respect any other covenant or agreement of the Servicer set
forth in this Agreement which failure continues unremedied for a period of 30
consecutive days after the date on which written notice of such failure,
requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer by the
Owner Trustee, the Administrative Agent, or the Collateral Trustee;

(c) any representation, warranty or certification made by the
Servicer pursuant to this Agreement shall prove to have been incorrect in any
material respect when made, and if the consequences of such representation,
warranty or certification being incorrect shall be susceptible of remedy in all
material respects, such consequences shall not be remedied in all material
respects within 30 days after the Servicer first becomes aware or is advised
that such representation, warranty or certification was incorrect in a material
respect; or

(d) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the
Servicer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no Trust
Servicer Default where a Trust Servicer Default would otherwise exist due to a
delay in or failure of performance for a period of 10 Business Days, if the
delay or failure giving rise to such Trust Servicer Default was caused by an
act of God or the public enemy, acts of declared or undeclared war, public
disorder, rebellion or sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning, fire,
hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or similar causes. The preceding sentence
shall not relieve the Servicer from using its best efforts to perform its
obligations in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Servicer shall provide all Interested Parties with prompt notice of
such failure or delay by it, together with a description of its efforts so to
perform its obligations.

SECTION 7.02. Consequences of a Trust Servicer Default. If a Trust
Servicer Default shall occur and be continuing, the

- 16 -
<PAGE> 20
Collateral Trustee, or after the payment in full of all Obligations, the Owner
Trustee, by notice then given in writing to the Servicer may, in addition to
other rights and remedies available in a court of law or equity to damages,
injunctive relief and specific performance, terminate all of the rights and
obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement. On or after the receipt by
the Servicer of such written notice, all authority and power of the Servicer
under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Trust Receivables or
otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the Collateral Trustee pursuant to
and under this Section 7.02. Upon the receipt of such notice, the Servicer's
appointment as custodian shall be terminated and, upon instruction from the
Collateral Trustee, the Servicer shall release any Trust Receivable File to the
Collateral Trustee, or its respective agent or designee, as the case may be, at
such place or places as the Collateral Trustee may designate, as soon as
practicable. The Servicer shall be deemed to have received proper instructions
with respect to the Trust Receivable Files upon its receipt of written
instructions signed by an officer of the Collateral Trustee. The Collateral
Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of
the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other
instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to
complete the transfer and endorsement of the Trust Receivables and related
documents, or otherwise. The predecessor Servicer agrees to cooperate with the
Collateral Trustee or the successor Servicer in effecting the termination of
the responsibilities and rights of the Servicer under this Agreement, including
the transfer to the Collateral Trustee for deposit in the Collateral Account of
all cash amounts that shall at the time be held by the Servicer or thereafter
received by the Servicer with respect to the Trust Receivables.

SECTION 7.03. Collateral Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.
On and after the time the Servicer receives a notice of termination pursuant to
Section 7.02, the Collateral Trustee shall be the successor in all respects to
the Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement and the
transactions set forth or provided for in this Agreement, and shall be subject
to all the responsibilities, restrictions, duties and liabilities relating
thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and provisions of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the predecessor Servicer shall remain liable for, and
the successor Servicer shall have no liability for, any indemnification
obligations of the Servicer arising as a result of acts, omissions or
occurrences during the period in which the predecessor Servicer was the
Servicer; and provided, further, that NFC shall remain liable for all such
indemnification obligations of the Servicer without regard to whether it is
still Servicer hereunder. As compensation therefor, the Collateral Trustee
shall be entitled to such compensation (whether payable out of the Collateral
Account or

- 17 -
<PAGE> 21
otherwise) as the Servicer would have been entitled to under this Agreement if
no such notice of termination had been given. Notwithstanding the above, the
Collateral Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling so to act, or shall, if it is
legally unable so to act, appoint, or petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint, a successor (i) having a net worth of not less than
$100,000,000 and (ii) whose regular business includes the servicing of medium
and heavy duty bus, truck and trailer receivables, as the successor to the
Servicer under this Agreement in the assumption of all or any part of the
responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement.
In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Collateral Trustee may
make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of payments
on Trust Receivables as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however,
that no such compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the Servicer
under this Agreement. The Collateral Trustee and such successor shall take
such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to
effectuate any such succession.

SECTION 7.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Administrative Agent,
at the direction of the Required Lenders (or, upon payment in full of the
Obligations, the Owner Trustee at the direction of Certificateholders holding
Trust Certificates evidencing not less than a majority of the Aggregate OTC
Amount), may waive any default by the Servicer in the performance of its
obligations hereunder and its consequences, except a default in making any
required deposits to the Collateral Account in accordance with this Agreement.
Upon any such waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and
any Trust Servicer Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been
remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. The
Servicer shall give written notice of each such waiver to the Rating Agencies.

ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 8.01. Optional Purchase of Trust Pool Receivables. If on
any Settlement Date, the Trust Pool Balance with respect to any Trust Pool is
10% or less of the Initial Trust Pool Balance with respect to such Trust Pool,
the Servicer shall have the option to purchase from the Trust on such
Settlement Date all Trust Receivables in such Trust Pool and related assets and
rights by depositing in the Collateral Account an amount equal to the aggregate
Administrative Purchase Payments for such Receivables (including Liquidating
Receivables).

SECTION 8.02. Amendment. Subject to subsection 10.1(b) of the
Liquidity Agreement, this Agreement may be amended from time

- 18 -
<PAGE> 22
to time, with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the
Majority Lenders; provided, however, that (i) no such amendment shall increase
or reduce in any manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of,
collections of payments on Receivables or deposits that shall be required to be
made to the Collateral Account without the prior written consent of each Lender
(ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Article VII without the prior
written consent of the Required Lenders and (iii) no amendment hereto which
would increase the duties or liabilities of, or the scope of the authorization
granted by, the Collateral Trustee hereunder shall be effective without the
prior written consent of the Collateral Trustee; and provided, further, that no
amendment hereunder shall be made without a confirmation by each of the Rating
Agencies that such action will not result in a withdrawal or downgrade of its
then current ratings of the outstanding Commercial Paper Notes and Trust
Certificates.

SECTION 8.03. Notices. Except where telephonic instructions or
notices are authorized herein to be given, all notices, requests and demands to
or upon the respective parties hereto to be effective shall be in writing and,

This Receivables Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") is made as of November
7, 1994, between NFC ASSET TRUST, a Delaware business trust (the "Trust"), and

R E C I T A L S:

Trip desires to sell from time to time Retail Receivables and Lease

ARTICLE II
PURCHASE AND SALE OF RECEIVABLES

SECTION 2.01. Purchase and Sale.

At such time or times as Trip may determine (each, a "Receivable Purchase
Date"), subject to the satisfaction of the conditions specified in Article IV,
Trip shall sell, transfer, assign and otherwise convey to the Trust, without
recourse, and the Trust (in such capacity as purchaser, "Purchaser") shall
purchase from Trip, all of Trip's right, title and interest in, to and under
the following assets (collectively, the "Transferred Assets"):

(a) the Receivables identified in the related Schedule of Trust
Receivables (the "Transferred Receivables") and all monies paid thereon
(including Liquidation Proceeds and, with respect to such Transferred
Receivables that are Lease Receivables, Residual Payments) and due thereunder
on and after the related Purchase Cutoff Date;

(b) the security interests (A) in Financed Vehicles granted by Obligors to
secure repayment of any such Transferred Receivable that is a Retail
Receivable (and, to the extent permitted by law, in any accessions thereto
that are financed by NFC) and (B) in Leased Vehicles granted by NLC pursuant
to the Lease Receivables Purchase Agreement and the related Lease Assignment
to secure payment of any such Transferred Receivable that is a Lease
Receivable (and, to the extent permitted by law, in any accessions thereto
which are financed by NLC);

(c) the benefits of any lease assignments with respect to the Vehicles to
which such Transferred Receivables relate;

(d) any proceeds from any Insurance Policies with respect to such

Trip thereunder or in connection therewith, whether payable as fees,
expenses, costs, indemnities, damages for the breach of the Retail
Receivables Purchase

- 2 -

<PAGE> 6

Agreement or otherwise, and all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and
claims of Trip under or with respect to the Retail Receivables Purchase
Agreement (whether arising pursuant to the terms of the Retail Receivables
Purchase Agreement or otherwise available to Trip at law or in equity),
including, without limitation, the right of Trip to enforce the obligations
of NFC thereunder (including the obligation to repurchase Warranty
Receivables under certain circumstances) and to give or withhold any and all
consents, requests, notices, directions, approvals, extensions or waivers
under or with respect to the Retail Receivables Purchase Agreement (it being
understood that such rights do not include the right to purchase from NFC
from time to time Retail Receivable Purchased Assets);

(g) the Lease Receivables Purchase Agreement (other than Section 5.05
thereof), with respect to the Transferred Receivables, including, without
limitation, all amounts payable by NLC pursuant to Section 5.08 of the Lease
Receivables Purchase Agreement and all other monies due and to become due to
Trip thereunder or in connection therewith, whether payable as fees,
expenses, costs, indemnities, damages for the breach of the Lease Receivables
Purchase Agreement or otherwise, and all rights, remedies, powers, privileges
and claims of Trip under or with respect to the Lease Receivables Purchase
Agreement (whether arising pursuant to the terms of the Lease Receivables
Purchase Agreement or otherwise available to Trip at law or in equity),
including, without limitation, the right of Trip to enforce the obligations
of NFC thereunder (including the obligation to repurchase Warranty
Receivables under certain circumstances) and to give or withhold any and all
consents, requests, notices, directions, approvals, extensions or waivers
under or with respect to the Lease Receivables Purchase Agreement (it being
understood that such rights do not include the right to purchase from NLC
from time to time Lease Receivable Purchased Assets);

(h) all Trust Interest Rate Caps heretofore and hereafter entered into by
Trip, including, without limitation, all monies due and to become due to Trip
thereunder or in connection therewith, whether payables as fees, expenses,
costs, indemnities, damages for the breach of such Trust Interest Rate Caps
or otherwise, and all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims of Trip
under or with respect to such Trust Interest Rate Caps (whether arising
pursuant to the terms of such Trust Interest Rate Caps or otherwise available
to Trip at law or in equity), including, without limitation, the right of the
Trust to enforce the obligations of the Counterparties thereunder and to give
or withhold any and all consents, requests, notices, directions, approvals,
extensions or

- 3 -

<PAGE> 7

waivers under or with respect to such Trust Interest Rate Caps; and

(i) the proceeds of any and all of the foregoing.

It is the intention of Trip that the transfer and assignment contemplated by
this Agreement shall constitute a sale of the Transferred Receivables from Trip
to the Trust and the beneficial interest in title to the Transferred
Receivables shall not be part of Trip's estate in the event of the filing of a
bankruptcy petition by or against Trip under any bankruptcy law. Trip and NFC
intend to treat such transfer and assignment as a sale for accounting and tax
purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that such transfer and assignment did not constitute
such a sale or that such beneficial interest is a part of Trip's estate, then
Trip shall be deemed to have granted to the Trust a first priority perfected
security interest in all of Trip's right, title and interest in, to and under
the assets conveyed pursuant to this Agreement, and Trip hereby grants such
security interest. For purposes of such grant, this Agreement shall constitute
a security agreement under the UCC.

SECTION 2.02. The Closings; Purchase Price. The consummation of each
purchase and sale contemplated by Section 2.01 (each, a "Transferred Receivable
Closing") shall take place on the related Receivable Purchase Date, and at such
place and at such time as Trip and the Purchaser may agree upon. At each
Transferred Receivable Closing, Trip shall execute and deliver to Purchaser an
assignment in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each, a "Assignment") with
the related Schedule of Trust Receivables, conveying the related Transferred
Assets to the Trust. At each Transferred Receivable Closing, in consideration
for transfer of the related Transferred Receivables and other Transferred
Assets to the Trust, the Trust shall pay to Trip an amount (the "Receivable
Purchase Price") equal to the Initial Net Trust Pool Balance for the Trust Pool
created on such Receivable Purchase Date plus interest thereon at a rate equal
to LIBO for such date plus 1% (calculated on the basis of a 365/366 day year
and actual days elapsed) for the period from the day as of which such Initial
Net Trust Pool Balance is calculated pursuant to the definition of Trust Pool
Balance through the Receivable Purchase Date. The Trust shall pay the
Receivable Purchase Price by (i) if such Transferred Receivables were Trip
Receivables as of the related Purchase Cutoff Date, first applying the amount
thereof to reduce (not below zero) the Financing Loan Principal Amount and (ii)
second, remitting the remainder (if any) of the Receivable Purchase Price in
accordance with Section 5.3(a)(xiii)(G) of the Collateral Trust Agreement.

SECTION 2.03. Required Trust Interest Rate Caps. (a) On or before each
Receivable Purchase Date, Trip shall enter into and assign to the Trust
interest rate cap agreements (each, a "Trust

- 4 -

<PAGE> 8

Interest Rate Cap") which, after giving effect to the transactions to be
consummated on such Receivable Purchase Date, satisfy the requirements
contained in subsection 2.03(b) with respect to the Trust Pool created on such
Receivable Purchase Date (the "Required Trust Interest Rate Caps").

(b) Trust Interest Rate Caps satisfying the requirements of this
subsection 2.03(b) with respect to any Trust Pool shall (i) be with an Eligible
Counterparty or Eligible Counterparties, (ii) have, in the aggregate, a
notional amount on the applicable Receivables Purchase Date that is at least
equal to the Trust Pool Balance on such date with respect to such Trust Pool
created on such Receivables Purchase Date, (iii) have, in the aggregate, a
notional amount on each Settlement Date thereafter that will equal or exceed
the scheduled Contract Values as of each such Settlement Date of the Eligible
Trust Receivables in such Trust Pool, and (iv) provide for monthly payments by
the Eligible Counterparty or Eligible Counterparties directly into the
Collateral Account.

(c) The Trust agrees that, at any time that it enters into a Trust Interest
Rate Cap, it shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Trustee an assignment
of all amounts payable to Trip under such Trust Interest Rate Cap substantially
in the form of Exhibit B (each a "Trust Interest Rate Cap Assignment").

ARTICLE III
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties Regarding Transferred
Receivables. As of each Receivable Purchase Date, Trip represents and warrants
to the Trust as follows with respect to the Transferred Receivables for such
date:

(a) Eligible Receivables. Each such Transferred Receivable is an Eligible
Receivable.

(b) Schedule of Trust Receivables. The information regarding such
Transferred Receivables set forth in the related Schedule of Trust Receivables
is true and correct in all material respects.

(c) Title. Except as contemplated by the Basic Documents, none of such
Transferred Receivables has been sold, transferred, assigned or pledged by Trip
to any Person other than the Trust. Except as contemplated by the Basic
Documents, immediately prior to the transfer and assignment contemplated
herein, Trip had good title to each such Transferred Receivable free and clear

books of Trip); no tax Lien has been filed and, to the knowledge of Trip, no
claim is being asserted, with respect to any such tax, fee or other charge.

financing statement in each jurisdiction in which required by applicable law,
executed by Trip as seller or debtor, naming the Trust as purchaser or secured

hereunder from time to time, meeting the requirements of the laws of each such
jurisdiction and in such manner as is necessary to perfect under the UCC the
sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance to Trip of such Transferred Assets
(to the extent constituting UCC Collateral). Trip shall deliver a file-stamped
copy, or other evidence satisfactory to the Trust of such filing, to the Trust
on or prior to the initial Receivable Purchase Date.

<PAGE> 15

financing statement or continuation statement filed by Trip in accordance with
Section 5.01 or 5.03(a) seriously misleading within the meaning of Section
9-402(7) of the UCC, unless it shall have given the Trust at least 60 days

amendments as may be necessary to continue the perfection of the Trust's

are kept, is located at 2850 West Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008.
Trip shall give the Trust at least 60 days prior written notice of any
relocation of its principal executive office if, as a result of such
relocation, the applicable provisions of the UCC would require the filing of
any amendment of any previously filed financing or continuation statement or of
any new financing statement. Trip shall at all times maintain each office from
which it services Transferred Receivables and its principal executive office
within the United States of America.

SECTION 5.04. Repurchase Events. (a) Trip hereby covenants and agrees with
the Trust that in the event of (i) a breach of any of Trip's representations
and warranties contained in Section 3.01 hereof with respect to any Transferred
Receivable, unless such breach shall have been cured in all material respects,
or (ii) a breach by Trip of Section 5.06 hereof with respect to any Transferred
Receivable, which breach has a material adverse effect on the Trust's interest
in such Transferred Receivable, Trip will repurchase (or, if such breach is
also a breach of Section 3.01 or 5.05 of the Retail Receivables Purchase
Agreement or the Lease Receivables Purchase Agreement, will cause NFC or NLC,
as appropriate, to repurchase under Section 5.08 of the Retail Receivables
Purchase Agreement, or Lease Receivables Purchase Agreement, as appropriate)
such Transferred Receivable from the Trust as of the last day of the Monthly
Period during which Trip discovered or received notice of such breach, by
delivery to the Collateral Trustee for deposit in the Collateral Account an
amount equal to the Warranty Payment for such Transferred Receivable. It is
understood and agreed that the obligation of Trip to repurchase (or to cause
the repurchase by NFC or NLC) any Transferred Receivable as to which a breach
has occurred and is continuing shall, if such obligation is fulfilled,
constitute the sole remedy against Trip, NFC or NLC for such breach available
to the Trust or the Collateral Trustee.

(b) Upon receipt of the Warranty Payment with respect to a Trust Receivable
which is a Warranty Receivable, each of the Trust and the Collateral Trustee
shall assign, without recourse, representation or warranty, to Trip, NFC or
NLC, as the case may be, all of such Person's right, title and interest in, to
and

- 12 -

<PAGE> 16

under (i) such Warranty Receivable and all monies due thereon, (ii) the
security interests in the related Vehicles and, to the extent permitted by law,
any accessions thereto which are financed by NFC or NLC, (iii) benefits of any
lease assignments with respect to the Vehicles, (iv) proceeds from any
Insurance Policies with respect to such Warranty Receivable, (v) proceeds from
Dealer Liability with respect to such Warranty Receivable, proceeds from any
NITC Purchase Obligations with respect to such Warranty Receivable and proceeds
from any Guaranties of such Warranty Receivable, (vi) proceeds of the property
described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above and (vii) the rights under the
Retail Receivable Purchase Agreement or Lease Receivable Purchase Agreement,
as applicable, with respect to such Warranty Receivable, such assignment being
an assignment outright and not for security. Upon the assignment of such
Warranty Receivable described in the preceding sentence, Trip, NFC or NLC, as
the case may be, shall own such Warranty Receivable, and all such security and
documents, free of any further obligations to the Trust with respect thereto.

SECTION 5.05. Other Liens or Interests. Except for the conveyances
hereunder and as contemplated by the Basic Documents, Trip shall not sell,
pledge, assign or transfer Transferred Assets to any other Person, or grant,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien thereon (except Permitted
Liens) and Trip shall defend the right, title and interest of the Trust in, to
and under all Transferred Assets against all claims of third parties (other
than Permitted Liens) claiming through or under Trip.

SECTION 5.06. Limitation on Transfer of NITC Purchase Obligations. The
Trust acknowledges and agrees that the rights pursuant to the NITC Purchase
Obligations are personal to NFC, and only the proceeds of such rights have been
assigned to the Trust. The Trust is not and is not intended to be (and none of
the Owner Trustee, the Collateral Trustee nor any Lender is or is intended to
be) a third-party beneficiary of such rights and, accordingly, such rights will
not be exercisable by, enforceable by or for the benefit of, or preserved for
the benefit of, the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Collateral Trustee or any
Lender.

SECTION 5.07. Financial Statements. Trip shall furnish to the Trust as soon
as available, but in any event within 100 days after the end of each fiscal
year, commencing with fiscal year 1995, a statement of financial condition of
Trip as of the end of such fiscal year and the related statements of income and
retained earnings and cash flows for such fiscal year, setting forth
(commencing in fiscal year 1996) in comparative form the figures for the
previous fiscal year.

SECTION 5.08. Sale Treatment. Trip intends to treat the transfer and
assignment described herein as a sale for accounting and tax purposes.

above and (vii) this Agreement and the Trip Servicing Agreement with respect to
such Warranty Receivable, such assignment being an assignment outright and not
for security. Upon the assignment of such Warranty Receivable and related
rights, NFC shall own such Warranty Receivable and all such security and
documents, free of any further obligations to Trip with respect thereto. If in
any proceeding it is held that NFC may not enforce a Warranty Receivable on the
ground that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce
the Warranty Receivable, Trip shall, at NFC's expense, take such steps as NFC
deems necessary to enforce the Warranty Receivable, including bringing suit in
the name of such Person.

SECTION 5.09. Further Assignments. NFC acknowledges that Trip shall from
time to time, sell, pledge, assign or transfer all of its right, title and
interest in the Designated Retail Receivables and its rights hereunder to the
Trust pursuant to the Financing Loan and Security Agreement or the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, as the case may be, and that the Trust shall in turn
further sell, pledge, assign or transfer its rights in such Designated Retail
Receivables and this Agreement to the Collateral Trustee pursuant to the
Collateral Trust Agreement. NFC consents to such assignment and agrees that
the Collateral Trustee, to the extent provided in the Collateral Trust
Agreement, shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement and the
rights (including, without limitation, the right to grant or withhold any
consent or waiver) of Trip directly against NFC and, after the satisfaction of
all Obligations, the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to such rights, to the
extent provided in the Basic Documents. In each case, NFC further agrees
that, in respect of its obligations hereunder, it will act at the direction of
and in accordance with all requests and instructions from the Collateral
Trustee delivered pursuant to the Basic Documents until the satisfaction of all
Obligations and, thereafter, with all requests and instructions from the Owner
Trustee delivered pursuant to the Basic Documents. Except as otherwise
contemplated by the Basic Documents, the Collateral Trustee and the Trust shall
have the rights of third-party beneficiaries under this Agreement. NFC shall
deliver copies of all notices, requests, demands and other documents to

12
<PAGE> 16
be delivered by it to Trip pursuant to the terms hereof to the Administrator,
on behalf of the Trust, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, and
the Collateral Trustee.

SECTION 5.10. Pre-Closing Collections. Within two Business Days after each
Retail Receivable Purchase Date, NFC shall transfer to the Collateral Trustee
for deposit in the Collateral Account all collections (from whatever source) on
or with respect to the related Designated Retail Receivables and related Retail
Receivable Purchased Assets held by NFC on such Retail Receivable Purchase Date
and conveyed to Trip pursuant to Section 2.02.

SECTION 5.11. Limitation on Transfer of NITC Purchase Obligations. Trip
acknowledges and agrees that the rights pursuant to the NITC Purchase
Obligations are personal to NFC, and only the proceeds of such rights have been
assigned to Trip. Trip is not and is not intended to be (and none of the Owner
Trustee, the Collateral Trustee nor any Lender is or is intended to be) a
third-party beneficiary of such rights and, accordingly, such rights will not
be exercisable by, enforceable by or for the benefit of, or preserved for the
benefit of, Trip, the Owner Trustee, the Collateral Trustee or any Lender.

SECTION 5.12. Sale Treatment. NFC intends to treat the transfer and
assignment described herein as a sale for accounting and tax purposes.

ARTICLE II
PURCHASE AND SALE OF LEASE RECEIVABLES;
SECURITY INTEREST IN LEASED VEHICLES

SECTION 2.01. Purchase and Sale of Lease Receivables. From time to
time, on such dates as are mutually agreeable to NLC and Trip (each, a "Lease
Receivable Purchase Date"), subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
specified in Article IV, NLC shall sell, transfer, assign and otherwise convey
to Trip, without recourse, and Trip shall purchase from NLC, all right, title
and interest in, to and under the following assets (the "Lease Receivable
Purchased Assets"):

(a) the Lease Receivables identified in the related Schedule of Lease
Receivables (the "Designated Lease Receivables") and all monies paid thereon
(including Liquidation Proceeds and Residual Payments) and due thereunder on
and after the related Purchase Cutoff Date;

(b) the benefits of any lease assignments with respect to the Leased
Vehicles to which such Designated Lease Receivables relate;

(c) any proceeds from any Insurance Policies with respect to such
Designated Lease Receivables;

(d) any proceeds from Dealer Liability with respect to such Designated
Lease Receivables, proceeds from any NITC Purchase Obligations with respect to

SECTION 2.03. The Closings. The consummation of each purchase and
sale contemplated by Section 2.01 and the related grant under Section 2.02
(each, a "Lease Receivable Closing") shall take place on the related Lease

equal to LIBO for such date plus 1% (calculated on the basis of a 365/366 day
year and actual days elapsed) for the period from such Purchase Cutoff Date
through such Lease Receivable Purchase Date, provided that in no event shall
such amount represent less than the fair value of such Lease Receivable
Purchased Assets (determined based on, among other things, then prevailing
interest rates) (the "Lease Receivable Purchase Price"). The Lease Receivable
Purchase Price shall be paid to NLC in immediately available funds.

ARTICLE III
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties Regarding Lease
Receivables. As of each Lease Receivable Purchase Date, NLC represents and
warrants to Trip as follows with respect to the Designated Lease Receivables
for such date:

(a) Eligible Receivables. Each such Designated Lease Receivable is an
Eligible Receivable.

(b) Schedule of Lease Receivables. The information regarding such
Designated Lease Receivables set forth in the related Schedule of Lease
Receivables is true and correct in all material respects.

(c) Title. Immediately prior to the transfer and assignment
contemplated herein, NLC had good title to each such Designated Lease
Receivable free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens and Liens
that will be released as of such transfer) and, immediately upon the transfer

<PAGE> 7
SECTION 3.02. Representations and Warranties Regarding NLC. NLC
represents and warrants to Trip as of the date hereof and as of each Lease
Receivable Purchase Date (and, as applicable, with respect to the Designated
Lease Receivables for such date), that:

(a) Organization and Good Standing. NLC has been duly organized and is
validly existing as a corporation and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, with power and authority to own its properties and to
conduct its business as such properties are presently owned and such business
is presently conducted, and had at all relevant times, and now has, power,
authority and legal right to acquire and own such Designated Lease Receivables.

(b) Due Qualification. NLC is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation in good standing, and has obtained all necessary licenses
and approvals, in all jurisdictions in which the ownership or lease of property
or the conduct of its business requires such qualification except to the extent
that the failure to comply therewith would not, in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to NLC.

(c) Power and Authority. NLC has the corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly
authorized by NLC by all necessary corporate action on the part of NLC. NLC
has the corporate power and authority to sell and assign to Trip such
Designated Lease Receivables and the related Lease Receivable Purchased Assets
(and to grant Trip a security interest in the Related Security), and has duly
authorized such transfers by all necessary corporate action on the part of NLC.

(d) Valid Sale; Binding Obligation. This Agreement, together with the
Lease Assignment for such Designated Lease Receivables and the related Lease
Receivable Purchased Assets, when duly executed and delivered, shall constitute
a valid sale, transfer and assignment of such Designated Lease Receivables and
the related Lease Receivable Purchased Assets, enforceable against creditors of
NLC and each of this Agreement and such Lease Assignment, when duly executed
and delivered, shall constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of NLC
enforceable against NLC in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights in general
and by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

(e) Related Security. Each Lease Assignment, together with the filing of
the UCC-1s provided for in Section 5.01, when duly executed and delivered,
shall be effective to create in favor of Trip (or its nominee) a valid first
priority perfected security

- 4 -
<PAGE> 8
interest in the Related Security identified therein (except Permitted Liens),
and shall be enforceable as such against creditors of and purchasers from NLC,
except to the extent enforceability of such Lien may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally, and by general principles of equity, regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
provided, however that NLC shall not be obligated to transfer title to any
Leased Vehicle.

(f) No Violation. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by NLC
and its performance of its obligations hereunder will not violate any
Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation of NLC, and will not result in, or
require, the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of its property or
assets pursuant to any such Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation, other
than as contemplated by the Basic Documents.

(g) No Proceedings. There are no actions, proceedings or, to NLC's
knowledge, investigations pending or, to NLC's knowledge, threatened, before
any Governmental Authority (i) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement, (ii)
seeking to prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or (iii) seeking any determination or ruling that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to NLC.

(h) No Consent. Except as expressly contemplated by the Basic
Documents, no consent or authorization of, filing with, or other act by or in

SECTION 5.03. Protection of Title.

(a) NLC shall execute and file such financing statements, and cause to be
executed and filed such continuation and other statements, all in such manner

any document filed as provided above, as soon as available following such
filing.

(b) NLC shall not change its name, identity or corporate structure in any
manner that would, could or might make any financing statement or continuation
statement filed by NLC in accordance with Section 5.01 or 5.03(a) seriously

have given Trip at least 60 days prior written notice thereof and shall file
such financing statements or amendments as may be necessary to continue the
perfection of Trip's interest in all Lease Receivable Transferred Assets sold
hereunder.

(c) NLC hereby represents and warrants that its chief place of business
and principal executive office, and the place where its principal records

Transferred Assets are kept, is located at 2850 West Golf Road, Rolling

of any new financing statement. NLC shall at all times maintain each office
from which it services Lease Receivables and its principal executive office
within the United States of America.

SECTION 5.04. Other Liens or Interests. Except for the conveyances

This indemnity obligation shall be in addition to any obligation that NLC may
otherwise have.

SECTION 5.06. Credit and Collection Policy; Contracts.

(a) From and after the Effective Date, NLC shall not make any change
or modification to the credit criteria applied in respect of the origination of
the Designated Lease Receivables or the credit review process followed in
connection with the origination of the Designated Lease Receivables, in each
case in the form delivered prior to the Effective Date to Trip and the Trust
(collectively, the "Credit and Collection Policy"), that could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Lenders.

(b) NLC shall not make any change or modification to the terms of the
Contracts that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the Lenders.

SECTION 5.07. Financial Statements. NLC shall furnish to Trip as soon as
available, but in any event within 100 days after the end of each fiscal year,
commencing with fiscal year 1995, a statement of financial condition of NLC as
of the end of such fiscal year and the related statements of income and
retained earnings and cash flows for such fiscal year, setting forth
(commencing in fiscal year 1996) in comparative form the figures for the
previous fiscal year.

SECTION 5.08. Repurchase Events. (a) NLC hereby covenants and agrees
with Trip for the benefit of Trip and the Trust that in the event of (i) a
breach of any of NLC's representations and warranties contained in Section 3.01
hereof with respect to any Designated Lease Receivable, unless such breach
shall have been cured in all material respects, or (ii) a breach by NLC of
Section 5.04 hereof with respect to any Designated Lease Receivable, which
breach has a material and adverse effect on Trip's interest (or if such
Designated Lease Receivable is a Trust Receivable, on the Trust's interest) in
such Designated Lease Receivable, NLC will repurchase such Designated Lease
Receivable from Trip (or, if such Designated Lease Receivable is a Trust
Receivable, from the Trust) as of the last day of the

- 11 -
<PAGE> 15
Monthly Period during which NLC discovered or received notice of such breach,
by delivering to the Collateral Trustee for deposit in the Collateral Account
on the related Settlement Date immediately following such Monthly Period an
amount equal to the Warranty Payment for such Designated Lease Receivable. It
is understood and agreed that the obligation of NLC to repurchase any
Designated Lease Receivable as to which a breach has occurred and is continuing
shall, if such obligation is fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against NLC
for such breach available to Trip or the Trust.

(b) Upon receipt of the Warranty Payment with respect to a Trip
Receivable which is a Warranty Receivable, Trip shall assign, without recourse,
representation or warranty, to NLC all of Trip's right, title and interest in,
to and under (i) such Warranty Receivable and all monies due thereon, (ii) the
security interests in the related Leased Vehicle or Vehicles and, to the extent
permitted by law, in any accessions thereto which are financed by NLC, (iii)
benefits of any lease assignments with respect to the Leased Vehicles to which
such Receivable relates, (iv) any proceeds from any Insurance Policies with
respect to such Warranty Receivable, (v) any proceeds from Dealer Liability
with respect to such Warranty Receivable, proceeds from any NITC Purchase
Obligations with respect to such Warranty Receivable and proceeds from any
Guaranties of such Warranty Receivable, (vi) proceeds of the property described
in clauses (i) through (v) above and (vii) this Agreement and the Trip
Servicing Agreement with respect to such Warranty Receivable, such assignment
being an assignment outright and not for security. Upon the assignment of such
Warranty Receivable and related rights, NLC shall own such Warranty Receivable
and all such security and documents, free of any further obligations to Trip
with respect thereto. If in any proceeding it is held that NLC may not enforce
a Warranty Receivable on the ground that it is not a real party in interest or
a holder entitled to enforce the Warranty Receivable, Trip shall, at NLC's
expense, take such steps as NLC deems necessary to enforce the Warranty
Receivable, including bringing suit in the name of such Person.

SECTION 5.09. Further Assignments. NLC acknowledges that Trip shall
from time to time, sell, pledge, assign or transfer all of its right, title and
interest in the Designated Lease Receivables and its rights hereunder to the
Trust pursuant to the Financing Loan and Security Agreement or the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, as the case may be, and that the Trust shall in turn
further sell, pledge, assign or transfer its rights in such Designated Lease
Receivables and this Agreement to the Collateral Trustee pursuant to the
Collateral Trust Agreement. NLC consents to such assignment and agrees that
the Collateral Trustee, to the extent provided in the Collateral Trust
Agreement, shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement and the
rights (including, without limitation, the right to grant or withhold any
consent or waiver) of Trip directly against NLC and, after

- 12 -
<PAGE> 16
the satisfaction of all Obligations, the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to
such rights, to the extent provided in the Basic Documents. In each case, NLC
further agrees that, in respect of its obligations hereunder, it will act at
the direction of and in accordance with all requests and instructions from the
Collateral Trustee delivered pursuant to the Basic Documents until the
satisfaction of all Obligations and, thereafter, with all requests and
instructions from the Owner Trustee delivered pursuant to the Basic Documents.
Except as otherwise contemplated by the Basic Documents, the Collateral Trustee
and the Trust shall have the rights of third-party beneficiaries under this
Agreement. NLC shall deliver copies of all notices, requests, demands and
other documents to be delivered by it to Trip pursuant to the terms hereof to
the Administrator, on behalf of the Trust, the Administrative Agent, on behalf
of the Lenders, and the Collateral Trustee.

SECTION 5.10. Pre-Closing Collections. Within two Business Days after
each Lease Receivable Purchase Date, NLC shall transfer to the Collateral
Trustee for deposit in the Collateral Account all collections (from whatever
source) on or with respect to the related Designated Lease Receivables and
related Lease Receivable Purchased Assets held by NLC on such Lease Receivable
Purchase Date and conveyed to Trip pursuant to Section 2.02.

SECTION 5.11. Limitation on Transfer of NITC Purchase Obligations.
Trip acknowledges and agrees that the rights pursuant to the NITC Purchase
Obligations are personal to NLC, and only the proceeds of such rights have been
assigned to Trip. Trip is not and is not intended to be (and none of the Owner
Trustee, the Collateral Trustee nor any Lender is or is intended to be) a
third-party beneficiary of such rights and, accordingly, such rights will not
be exercisable by, enforceable by or for the benefit of, or preserved for the
benefit of, Trip, the Owner Trustee, the Collateral Trustee or any Lender.

SECTION 5.12. Sale Treatment. NLC intends to treat the transfer and
assignment described herein as a sale for accounting and tax purposes.
