FORD'S 1993 PROFIT REFLECTED WORLDWIDE IMPROVEMENT

DEARBORN, Mich., Feb. 9 -- Sharply improved U.S. automotive
operations, another record year in financial services and
successful cost-reduction programs worldwide were key elements of
Ford Motor Company's 1993 earnings of $2.5 billion or $4.55 per
share of common and Class B stock.

"I'm proud of our employees whose hard work has led to the
strongest turnaround in Ford's history," Alex Trotman, chairman
and chief executive officer, said. "As economies around the
world have strengthened or stabilized during the year, we've
improved our profitability. Looking ahead, we're in good shape
for 1994. We have strong new products and we expect better
economic conditions. But, there's still more to do and we remain
committed to increasing efficiency throughout the company."

In 1992, Ford Motor Company lost $7.4 billion, or $15.61 per
share of common and Class B stock, primarily reflecting mandated
accounting changes. Excluding the one-time effects of accounting
changes, Ford lost $502 million in 1992, or $1.46 per share of
common and Class B stock.

<PAGE>
Summary of 1993 Results

A summary of the 1993 results compared with 1992 follows:

- - Net income from worldwide automotive operations was $940
million, up $2.5 billion.

- - Net income from U.S. automotive operations was $1.5 billion, 
up $1.9 billion.

- - Automotive operations outside the U.S. lost $542 million, 
compared with a loss of $1.1 billion in 1992.

- - Net income of the Financial Services Group was $1.6
billion,up $557 million.

- - Worldwide sales and revenues were $108.5 billion, up $8.4
billion.

- - Factory unit sales were 5,964,000, up 200,000 units or three
percent.

- - Stockholders' equity was $15.6 billion, up $821 million.

- - Capital spending was $6.8 billion, up $1 billion.

- - Automotive cash and marketable securities were $9.8 billion, up
$717 million.

- - Automotive debt was $8 billion, down $301 million.

Automotive Operations Improved Over 1992

Ford's net income from worldwide automotive operations
improved $2.5 billion compared with 1992, excluding the one-time
effects of accounting changes in 1992. Most of this improvement
can be attributed to U.S. automotive operations, which increased 
$1.9 billion. Higher vehicle production, reflecting industry
sales growth and increased market share, accounted for much of
the improvement, along with higher margins. Outside the U.S.,
automotive operations improved $587 million. 

"Market share is only one measure of success. But, we're
glad to note that our 25.5 percent share of the total U.S.
vehicle market is up 0.8 of a point from 1992, continuing our
steady growth in market share since the early '80s," Trotman
said. "Following the well-received launch of the Mustang in late
1993, we will strengthen our product lineup further with
introductions of brand new products targeted at high-volume
market segments -- the Ford Windstar, Ford Contour and Mercury
Mystique, as well as the Ford Aspire.

"In Europe, Ford's bright spot in 1993 was the success of
the new Mondeo in the midst of a very weak overall market --
industry sales were down 16 percent," Trotman added. "Following
the restructuring that was completed in 1993, we continue to move
forward with cost-reduction actions there, as we are doing in all
Ford operations."
<PAGE>
During the 1993 calendar year:

- - Mondeo was named 1994 Car of the Year in Europe, and Motor 
Trend Magazine named the Ford Mustang 1994 Car of the Year in the
U.S.

- - Five of the top 10 best-selling vehicles in the U.S. were
Ford products; Ford F-Series was the best-selling vehicle in the
U.S., and the Ford Taurus was the best-selling car. 

- - Ford sold a record 1.7 million trucks in the U.S.

- - In Britain, Ford had car sales leadership, with three of the
top five best-selling cars -- Escort, Fiesta and Mondeo.

- - In Taiwan, Ford retained combined car and truck sales
leadership for the sixth straight year, and in Australia, Ford
retained car sales leadership for the 12th consecutive year. 

The Financial Services Group Continued Record-Setting Pace

The Financial Services Group posted a profit of $1.6 billion,
setting another earnings record and exceeding last year's
performance by $557 million or 54 percent, excluding the one-time
effects of accounting changes in 1992. The record improvement
reflected higher levels of earning assets, lower credit losses
and lower operating expenses.

"Once again, the Financial Services Group has raised the
chinning bar," Trotman said. "Its performance continues to be
outstanding. Not only is the Group vital to Ford Motor Company,
but it is increasingly recognized as a leader in the U.S.
financial services industry."

During 1993:

- - The Financial Services Group achieved a third consecutive
year of record earnings.

- - Ford Credit posted its third straight record earnings year.

- - The Associates recorded its 17th consecutive record earnings
year.

- - USL Capital had its fourth straight record earnings year.

U.S. Automotive Fourth-Quarter Earnings-- Second-Highest Ever

For U.S. automotive operations, the fourth quarter of 1993
was the second-highest ever in the company's history with
earnings of $669 million, up $797 million from a year ago. 
Results for the fourth quarter of 1993 include the favorable one-
time effect of a gain on the sale of part of Ford's North
American automotive seating and seat trim business ($73 million).
<PAGE>
Outside the U.S., automotive operations lost $372 million,
compared with a loss of $909 million a year ago. Fourth-quarter
results in 1993 were affected adversely by restructuring charges
at Jaguar ($109 million) and Ford of Australia ($57 million),
offset partially by the favorable effect of a reduction in German
tax rates ($59 million). Worldwide automotive operations earned
$297 million, up $1.3 billion from 1992. 

The Financial Services Group earned $422 million -- a record
for any quarter --compared with $197 million a year ago.

In total, Ford earned $719 million or $1.30 per share of
common and Class B stock, compared with a loss of $840 million or
$1.85 per share a year ago. Fourth-quarter results in 1992 were
affected adversely by one-time restructuring charges of $334
million at Ford's European automotive operations and $85 million
at Ford's European financial services activities. 

Outlook -- Strong Customer Focus

"Both of our core businesses -- automotive and financial
services -- clearly are poised to take advantage of gradually
improving economic conditions," Trotman said. "We have new
products on tap for worldwide distribution. We're pursuing
opportunities in the world's emerging markets, especially in
Asia, and we're achieving efficiencies at all levels of our
operations. To continue to grow, we -- together with our dealers
and suppliers -- need to remain focused on earning the loyalty of
more and more customers by providing them with high-quality
vehicles and services and a satisfying ownership experience."
