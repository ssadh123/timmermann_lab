CoreStates Reports Record Earnings in Third Quarter

Philadelphia, October 19, 1994--CoreStates Financial Corp today
reported third quarter net income of $104,221,000 or 74 cents per share,
a per share improvement of 12% from $96,081,000 or 66 cents per share in
the third quarter of 1993.

The 1994 earnings were a new quarterly record, and the regional
banking services company continued to improve upon its strong performance
ratios of recent years. Return on average assets was 1.50% and return on
average equity was 18.91%, up from 1.38% and 17.09%, respectively, a year
earlier.

Year-to-date earnings, excluding all closing costs related to
CoreStates acquiring Constellation Bank in the first quarter and
Independence Bancorp in the second quarter, were $2.14 per share for
1994, compared to $1.84 per share a year earlier. Including the closing
costs, the 1994 nine-months' net income was $133,887,000 or 97 cents per
share. All 1993 results are restated to reflect the pooling of interests
with the two acquired banking companies.

Terrence A. Larsen, chairman, said the third quarter results
reflected continuing strength of the basic banking businesses in a
challenging environment, and also demonstrated good progress toward
achieving efficiencies from recent acquisitions.

Compared with the 1993 third quarter results, Larsen said,
sluggish growth in loans and flat revenues from fee-based services were
offset by a strong net financial margin, an improved efficiency ratio and
a better earning asset mix. Net interest income was up 4% from the 1993
third quarter but only slightly from the second quarter. Average assets
were level for all three quarters, with growth in credit card and
commercial finance outstandings offsetting sales of $230 million of
assets in connection with the acquisitions. The net financial margin grew
from 5.63% a year ago to 5.86%, best among regional banking companies in
the second quarter, and 5.91% in the third quarter.

Non-interest income was down year-to-year, reflecting a total of $22
million in one-time or acquisition-related items. These included a one-
time gain of $11 million in the 1993 third quarter from the sale of
branches in the Virgin Islands. They also include $6.5 million in one-
time 1993 gains and 1994 losses and a $4.5 million decrease in ongoing
non-interest revenues all of which result from acquisition-related
business changes.

Overall revenues from fee-based services were flat year-to-year, but
income from CoreStates' joint venture, Electronic Payment Services, Inc.,
was up nearly $5 million as a result of the late 1993 restructuring of
that investment. Except for international service fees, which have grown
strongly over the last several quarters, fees also were flat or slightly
down from the second quarter of 1994.

On the expense side, CoreStates' efficiency ratio (expenses to
revenues) was 60.96% for the third quarter, improved from 62.77% a year
earlier. Total non-financial expenses were down $20 million, of

which $10 million reflected a one-time charge in the third quarter
of 1993 for structuring the new Transys business unit. Excluding that
one-time item, expenses were down by 3.4% year-to-year.

Non-performing assets at September 30 were $356.6 million, compared
to $493.6 million at September 30, 1993 and $352.1 million at June 30,
1994. The slight increase from June 30 reflected ongoing general
improvement offset by the addition of a single $25 million credit to the
category.

The consolidated provision for loan losses was $25 million, compared
to $30 million in the year earlier quarter and unchanged from the regular
provision in the second quarter of 1994. Net charge-offs were $22.4
million for the third quarter and $194.9 million for the first nine
months of 1994, compared to $35.3 million and $86.2 million,
respectively, in 1993. The consolidated reserve for loan losses at
September 30 was $478 million, or 172% of non-performing loans.

Consolidated total assets at September 30 were $27.0 billion,
including $19.7 billion of loans. Consolidated total deposits were $19.5
billion.

Shareholders' equity at September 30 was $2.2 billion, or 8.1% of
total assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 or core capital as a
percentage of quarterly average assets) was 7.9% for the quarter. Tier 1
capital at September 30 was 9.1% of risk-adjusted assets and total
capital was 13.2% of risk-adjusted assets, compared to minimum regulatory
requirements of 4% and 8% respectively.

The one-time charges associated with the acquisitions were $195
million in the first quarter and $59 million in the second quarter.

principle in the first quarter of 1993.
