of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall have consummated any Asset Sale or Asset
Acquisition, Consolidated EBITDA for such person and its Restricted
Subsidiaries for such period shall be adjusted (in the manner set forth in the

liable for Acquired Indebtedness) occurring during the Reference Period, as if
such Asset Sale or Asset Acquisition occurred on the first day of the Reference
Period. Furthermore, in calculating "Consolidated Fixed Charges" for purposes
of determining the denominator (but not the numerator) of this "Consolidated
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio," (i) interest on outstanding Indebtedness
determined on a fluctuating basis as of the Transaction Date and which will
continue to be so determined thereafter shall be deemed to have accrued at a
fixed rate per annum equal to the rate of interest on such Indebtedness in
effect on the Transaction Date, (ii) if interest on any Indebtedness actually
incurred on the Transaction Date may optionally be determined at an interest
rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank
offered rate, or other rates, then the interest rate in effect on the
Transaction Date will be deemed to have been in effect during the Reference
Period and (iii) notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) above, interest on
Indebtedness determined on a fluctuating basis, to the extent such interest is
covered by agreements relating to Interest Rate Protection Obligations, shall
be deemed to have accrued at the rate per annum resulting after giving effect
to the operation of such agreements. In calculating the Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, and giving pro forma effect to any incurrence of
Indebtedness during a Reference Period, pro forma effect shall be given to the
use of proceeds thereof to permanently repay or retire Indebtedness. If such
person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries directly or indirectly guaranteed
Indebtedness of a third person, the above clauses shall give effect to the
incurrence of such guaranteed Indebtedness as if such person or such Restricted
Subsidiary

9

had directly incurred or otherwise assumed such guaranteed Indebtedness.

"Consolidated Fixed Charges" means, with respect to any person
for any period, the sum of, without duplication, the amounts for such period of

Preferred Stock (other than Preferred Stock which is Redeemable Capital Stock)

provided, however, that if, during such period, such person or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries shall have made any Asset Sales or Asset Acquisitions,
Consolidated Fixed Charges for such person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for
such period shall be adjusted (in the manner set forth in the definition of the
term "Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio") to give pro forma effect to
the Consolidated Fixed Charges directly attributable to the assets which are
the subject of such Asset Sales or Asset Acquisitions during such period.

"Consolidated Income Tax Expense" means, with respect to any

of any person combined with such person or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries

(4) a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each such
individual, such condition or covenant has been complied with.

SECTION 103. Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee.

In any case where several matters are required to be certified
by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified person, it is not necessary that
all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such
person or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one
such person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one
or more other such persons as to other matters, and any such person may certify

instruments of

35
<PAGE> 51
substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent
duly appointed in writing, and except as herein otherwise expressly provided,
such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are
delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the
Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and
evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders
signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such
instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for
any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to TIA Section 315) conclusive in
favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this
Section.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any person of any 
such instrument or writing may be proved in any reasonable manner which the 
Trustee deems sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the 
Security Register.

(d) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders any 
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other 
Act, the Company may, at its option, by or pursuant to Board Resolution, fix 
in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other 
Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. Notwithstanding TIA 
Section 316(c), any such record date shall be the record date specified in or 
pursuant to such Board Resolution, which shall be a date not more than 30 days 
prior to the first solicitation of Holders generally in connection therewith 
and no later than the date such solicitation is completed.

If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given
before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close
of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes
of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Securities then
Outstanding have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver

36
<PAGE> 52
or other Act, and for this purpose the Securities then Outstanding shall be
computed as of such record date; provided that no such authorization, agreement
or consent by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless
it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not
later than six months after the record date.

(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other Act by the Holder of any Security shall bind every 
future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued 
upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu 
thereof, in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the 
Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not 
notation of such action is made upon such Security.

SECTION 105. Notices, etc., to Trustee and Company.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by
this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to or filed with

(1) the Trustee by any Holder, the Banks, the holders of
Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Company shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or delivered
in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office,
Attention: Corporate Trust Trustee Administration; or

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein
expressly provided) if made, given, furnished or delivered in
writing to the Company addressed to it at the address of its
principal office specified in the first paragraph of this
Indenture, Attention: President, or at any other address
furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.

37
<PAGE> 53
SECTION 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver.

Where this Indenture provides for notice of any event to
Holders by the Company or the Trustee, such notice shall be sufficiently given
(unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed,
first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his
address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date,
and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such
notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the
failure to mail such notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any
particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to
other Holders. Any notice when deposited for mailing to a Holder in the
aforesaid manner shall be conclusively deemed to have been received by such
Holder, whether or not actually received by such Holder. Where this Indenture
provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the
person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by
Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a
condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver.

In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in
regular mail service or by reason of any other cause, it shall be impracticable
to mail notice of any event as required by any provision of this Indenture,
then any method of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee
shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.

SECTION 107. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.

The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of
Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

SECTION 108. Conflict of Any Provision of Indenture with
Trust Indenture Act.

If and to the extent that any provision of this Indenture 
limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties 

38
<PAGE> 54

imposed by Sections 310 to 318, inclusive, of the Trust Indenture Act or
conflicts with any provision (an "incorporated provision") required by or
deemed to be included in this Indenture by operation of such Trust Indenture
Act Sections, such imposed duties or incorporated provision shall control. If
any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust
Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall
be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or excluded, as the case
may be.

SECTION 109. Successors and Assigns.

All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company
shall bind its respective successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

SECTION 110. Separability Clause.

In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities
shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.

SECTION 111. Benefits of Indenture.

Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or
implied, shall give to any person (other than the parties hereto and their
successors hereunder, any Paying Agent, the Holders and the holders of Senior
Indebtedness) any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under this Indenture.

SECTION 112. Governing Law.

This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard
to the conflict-of-laws rules thereof.

SECTION 113. Legal Holidays.

In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date
or Stated Maturity or Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day,
then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the

39
<PAGE> 55
Securities) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be
made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the
same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date
or at the Stated Maturity or Maturity; provided that no interest shall accrue
for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date,
Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may be, to the next succeeding
Business Day.

<PAGE> 64
officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such
individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the
authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at
the date of such Securities.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and
delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities executed by the
Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for
the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in
accordance with such Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such
Securities.

Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this
Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on
such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form
provided for herein duly executed by the Trustee by manual signature of one of
its duly authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Security shall
be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly
authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this
Indenture.

In case the Company, pursuant to Article Eight, shall be
consolidated or merged with or into any other person or shall convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, and the successor person resulting from such consolidation, or
surviving such merger, or into which the Company shall have been merged, or the
successor person which shall have received a conveyance, transfer, lease or
other disposition as aforesaid, shall have executed an indenture supplemental
hereto with the Trustee pursuant to Article Eight, any of the Securities
authenticated or delivered prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance,
transfer, lease or other disposition may, from time to time, at the request of
the successor person, be exchanged for other Securities executed in the name of
the successor person with such changes in phraseology and form as may be
appropriate, but otherwise in substance of like tenor as the Securities
surrendered for such exchange and of like principal amount; and the

49
<PAGE> 65
Trustee, upon Company Order of the successor person, shall authenticate and
deliver Securities as specified in such request for the purpose of such
exchange. If Securities shall at any time be authenticated and delivered in
any new name of a successor person pursuant to this Section in exchange or
substitution for or upon registration of transfer of any Securities, such
successor person, at the option of any Holder but without expense to such
Holder, shall provide for the exchange of all Securities at the time
Outstanding held by such Holder for Securities authenticated and delivered in
such new name.

SECTION 304. Temporary Securities.

Pending the preparation of definitive Securities, the Company
may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver,
temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed
or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the
tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with
such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as
the officers executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced
by their execution of such Securities.

If temporary Securities are issued, the Company will cause
definitive Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the
preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary Securities shall be
exchangeable for definitive Securities upon surrender of the temporary
Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose
pursuant to Section 1002, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for
cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities, the Company shall execute
and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like
principal amount of definitive securities of authorized denominations. Until
so exchanged, the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the
same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities.

50
<PAGE> 66
SECTION 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and
Exchange.

The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in
any other office or agency designated pursuant to Section 1002 being herein
sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the
registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Security
Register shall be in written form or any other form capable of being converted
into written form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times, the
Security Register shall be open to inspection by the Trustee. The Trustee is
hereby initially appointed as security registrar (the "Security Registrar") for
the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein
provided.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at
the office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 1002, the
Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of
any authorized denomination or denominations of a like aggregate principal
amount.

At the option of the Holder, Securities may be exchanged for
other Securities of any authorized denomination and of a like aggregate
principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such
office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the
Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the
Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or
exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company,
evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or
exchange.

Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange or redemption

51
<PAGE> 67
shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar) be duly
endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed by the
Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of
transfer or exchange or redemption of Securities, but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to pay all documentary, stamp or similar issue or
transfer taxes or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than
exchanges pursuant to Section 303, 304, 906, 1013, 1014 or 1108 not involving
any transfer.

The Company shall not be required (a) to issue, register the
transfer of or exchange any Security during a period beginning at the opening
of business (i) 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of the
Securities selected for redemption under Section 1104 and ending at the close
of business on the day of such mailing or (ii) 15 days before an Interest
Payment Date and ending on the close of business on the Interest Payment Date,
or (b) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for
redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security
being redeemed in part.

SECTION 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen
Securities.

If (i) any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee,
or (ii) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of
the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and there is delivered to the
Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them
to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or
the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the
Company shall execute and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated Security or in lieu of any such
destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of like tenor and principal
amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding.

52
<PAGE> 68
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security
has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion
may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the
Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

Every replacement Security issued pursuant to this Section in
lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute a contractual
obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen
Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to
all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all
other Securities duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall
preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to
the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

SECTION 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.

Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually
paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the
person in whose name such Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is
registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose
pursuant to Section 1002; provided, however, that each installment of interest
may at the Company's option be paid by mailing a check for such interest,
payable to or upon the written order of the person entitled thereto pursuant to
Section 308, to the address of such person as it appears in the Security
Register.

Any interest on any Security which is payable, but is not
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall
forthwith cease to be payable

53
<PAGE> 69
to the holder on the Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder,
and such defaulted interest and (to the extent lawful) interest on such
defaulted interest at the rate borne by the Securities (such defaulted interest
and interest thereon herein collectively called "Defaulted Interest") may be
paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or
(2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make
payment of any Defaulted Interest to the persons in
whose names the Securities (or their respective
Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close
of business on a Special Record Date for the payment
of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in
the following manner. The Company shall notify the
Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted
Interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the
date of the proposed payment, and at the same time
the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount
of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be
paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall
make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
such deposit prior to the date of the proposed
payment, such money when deposited to be held in
trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such
Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided.
Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date
for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which
shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10
days prior to the date of the proposed payment and
not less than 10 days after the receipt by the
Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The
Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such
Special Record Date, and in the name and at the
expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the
proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the
Special Record Date therefor to be mailed,
first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder at his
address as it appears on the Security Register, not
less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.
Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted
Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having
been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid
to the persons in whose names the Securities (or
their respective Predecessor Securities) are
registered at the close of business on such Special

54
<PAGE> 70
Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant 
to the following clause (2).

(2) The Company may make payment of any
Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of any securities
exchange on which the Securities may be listed, and
upon such notice as may be required by such exchange,
if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee
of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such
manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the
Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each
Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in
exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to
interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other
Security.

SECTION 308. Persons Deemed Owners.

Prior to the due presentment of a Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of
such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and
premium, if any) and (subject to Section 307) interest on such Security and for
all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and
none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee
shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

SECTION 309. Cancellation.

All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption,
registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any person other
than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled
by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any
Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company
may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or
to any other person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any
Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued

55
<PAGE> 71
and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the
Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for
any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly
permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee
shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures
unless by Company Order the Company shall direct that cancelled Securities be
returned to it.

SECTION 310. Computation of Interest.

Interest on the Securities shall be computed on the basis of a
360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

SECTION 311. CUSIP Numbers.

The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then
generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices
of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided, that any such notice may
state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers
either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a
redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification
numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be
affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.

SECTION 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and
Annulment.

If an Event of Default (other than as specified in Section
501(9) or 501(10) with respect to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary)
shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then
Outstanding, by notice to the Trustee and the Company, may declare the
principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all
of the Outstanding Securities due and payable immediately, upon which
declaration, all amounts payable in respect of the Securities shall be
immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section
501(9) or 501(10) with respect to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or
one or more Subsidiaries which, in the aggregate, would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, then the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all of the
Outstanding Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
Holder of Securities.

At any time after a declaration of acceleration has been made
and before a judgment or decree for payment of money due has been obtained by
the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Securities Outstanding, by written notice
to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its
consequences if:

(1) the Company has paid or deposited
with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:

(A) all sums paid or advanced by the
Trustee hereunder and the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel,

62
<PAGE> 78
(B) all overdue interest on all
Outstanding Securities,

(C) all unpaid principal of and
premium, if any, on any Outstanding
Securities which has become due otherwise
than by such declaration of acceleration, and
interest on such unpaid principal at the rate
borne by the Securities, and

(D) to the extent that payment of
such interest is lawful, interest upon
overdue interest and overdue principal at the
rate borne by the Securities which has become
due otherwise than by such declaration of
acceleration;

(2) the rescission would not conflict
with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction; and

(3) all Events of Default, other than
the non-payment of amounts of principal of, premium,
if any, and interest on Securities that have become
due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have
been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

SECTION 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for
Enforcement by Trustee.

The Company covenants that if

(a) default is made in the payment of
any installment of interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and
payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or

(b) default is made in the payment of
the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and
payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and inter-

63
<PAGE> 79

est, and interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and, to the
extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any
overdue installment of interest, at the rate borne by the Securities; and, in
addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs
and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such
demand, the Trustee, in its own name as trustee of an express trust, may
institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and
unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may
enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities
and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided
by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the
Securities, wherever situated.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee
may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights
of the Holders by such appropriate private or judicial proceedings as the
Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights.

SECTION 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency,
liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition
or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon
the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their
creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities
shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or
otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on
the Company for the payment of overdue principal, premium, if any, or interest)
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise,

(i) to file and prove a claim for the
whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the
Securities

64
<PAGE> 80
and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any
claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders
allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or
other property payable or deliverable on any such
claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each
Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay
the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any
other amounts due the Trustee under Section 606.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the
Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder
any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition or other
similar arrangement affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder
thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any
Holder in any such proceeding.

SECTION 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims without Possession
of Securities.

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the
Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession
of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating
thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in
its own name and as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment
shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel be
for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which
such judgment has been recovered.

65
<PAGE> 81
SECTION 506. Application of Money Collected.

Subject to Article Thirteen, any money collected by the

Section 606;

SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for
principal of (any premium, if any) and interest on the Securities in

SECTION 507. Limitation on Suits.

No Holder of any Securities shall have any right to institute

the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder,
unless

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the
Trustee of a continuing Event of Default;

(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of
the Outstanding Securities shall have made written request to the
Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default
in its own name as Trustee hereunder;

reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred in compliance with such request;

66
<PAGE> 82
(4) the Trustee for 30 days after its receipt of such
notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any
such proceeding; and

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has
been given to the Trustee during such 30-day period by the Holders of
a majority or more in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities;

it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders shall have any
right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of
this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders,
or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders
or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein
provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders.

SECTION 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive
Principal, Premium and Interest.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the
Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and
unconditional, to receive payment, as provided herein and in such Security of
the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on, such Security on the
respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of
redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement
of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent
of such Holder.

SECTION 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to
enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to
the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any
determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders
shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder and thereafter all rights and reme-

67
<PAGE> 83
dies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding
had been instituted.

SECTION 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last
paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved
to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right
or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or
employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent
the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or
remedy.

SECTION 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any
Security to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default
shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event
of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this
Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time
to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the
Holders, as the case may be.

SECTION 512. Control by Holders.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of
the Outstanding Securities shall have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, provided that

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of
law or with this Indenture,

(2) subject to the provisions of TIA Section 315, the
Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which
is not inconsistent with such direction, and

68

in personal liability or is unjustly prejudicial to the Holders not
consenting.

Securities waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder and its

or interest on any Security, or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under
Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
Holder of each Outstanding Security affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and
any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for
every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

SECTION 514. Undertaking for Costs.

All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any
Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any
court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any
right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for
any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party
litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that
such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to
the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party
litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit
instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of
Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the
enforcement of

69
<PAGE> 85
the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any
Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such
Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).

SECTION 515. Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws.

The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do
so) that it will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner
whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law
or any usury law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Company from
paying all or any portion of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on
the Securities as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time
hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of
this Indenture and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) the Company
hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants
that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein
granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such

into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate,

71
<PAGE> 87
opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order,

premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney;

(7) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or power
hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or
through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible

(8) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken,

it by this Indenture.

The Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of
its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it
shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or
adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to
it.

SECTION 603. Trustee Not Responsible for Recitals or 
Issuance of Securities.

The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except
for the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the
statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their
correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or
sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities, except that the Trustee
represents that it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Indenture,
authenticate the Securities and perform its obligations hereunder and that the
statements made by it in a Statement of Eligibility on Form T-l supplied to the
Company

72
<PAGE> 88
are true and accurate, subject to the qualifications set forth therein. The
Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of
Securities or the proceeds thereof.

SECTION 604. May Hold Securities.

The Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any
other agent of the Company or of the Trustee, in its individual or any other
capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to TIA

rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Security Registrar
or such other agent.

SECTION 605. Money Held in Trust.

Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be
segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee

except as otherwise agreed in writing with the Company.

SECTION 606. Compensation and Reimbursement.

The Company agrees:

(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such
compensation as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time
agree in writing for all services rendered by it hereunder (which
compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to
the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

(2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to
reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in
accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the
reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its
agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance
as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and

73
<PAGE> 89
(3) to indemnify each of the Trustee or any predecessor
Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, damages,
claims or liability or expense, including taxes (other than taxes
based on the income of the Trustee), incurred without negligence or
bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of this trust, including the costs and
expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in
connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or
duties hereunder.

The obligations of the Company under this Section to
compensate the Trustee, to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses,
disbursements and advances and to indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee shall
constitute additional indebtedness hereunder and shall survive the satisfaction

obligations of the Company, the Trustee shall have a claim prior to the
Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as
such, except funds held in trust for the payment of principal of (and premium,
if any) or interest on particular Securities.

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in
connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 501(9) or Section
501(10), the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its
counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute
expenses of administration under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law.

SECTION 607. Conflicting Interests. The Trustee shall
comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the TIA.

SECTION 608. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.

eligible to act as Trustee under TIA Section 310(a)(1) and shall have a
combined capital and surplus of at least $20,000,000 and have its Corporate
Trust Office in The City of New York (or if its Corporate Trust Office shall
not be located in The City of New

74
<PAGE> 90
York, which shall maintain an office in The City of New York where the
Securities may be presented or surrendered and notices and demands hereunder
may be served or made). If such corporation publishes reports of condition at
least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of federal, state,
territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority, then
for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such
corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth
in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the
Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
hereinafter specified in this Article.

notice thereof to the Company.

(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time by an Act of the
Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.

(d) If at any time:

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of
TIA Section 310(b), or

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section
608, or

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be
adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of
its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take
charge or control of the Trustee or of its property

75
<PAGE> 91
or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Company, by a Board Resolution, may remove the
Trustee, or (ii) subject to TIA Section 315(e), any Holder may, on behalf of
himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor
Trustee.

(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of
acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, the
Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. 
If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the
occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee shall be appointed by Act of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities
delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so
appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the
successor Trustee and supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. 
If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Company or the
Holders and accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, the
Company or Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the Securities then
Outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee.

(f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal
of the Trustee and each appointment of a successor Trustee to the Holders of
Securities in the manner provided for in Section 106. Each notice shall
include the name of the successor Trustee and the address of its Corporate
Trust Office.

(g) If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by
Section 610 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after
the giving of such notice of resignation, the Trustee resigning or being
removed may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor Trustee.

76
<PAGE> 92
SECTION 610. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.

Every successor Trustee appointed hereunder shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on request of
the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment
of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such
successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and
shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property
and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. Upon request of any such
successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more
fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all
such rights, powers and trusts.

No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at
the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and
eligible under this Article.

SECTION 611. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or
Succession to Business.

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a
party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the
corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee
hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible
under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall
have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any
successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee
may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with
the same effect as if such successor Trustee had

77
<PAGE> 93
itself authenticated such Securities; and in case at that time any of the
Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor Trustee may
authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or
in the name of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates
shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this
Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; provided,
however, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any
predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities in the name of any
predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger,
conversion or consolidation.

<PAGE> 103
to maintain an office or agency in The City of New York for such purposes. The
Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation
or rescission and any change in the location of any such other office or

SECTION 1003. Money for Security Payments to Be Held in
Trust.

Subject to Article Thirteen, if the Company shall at any time
act as its own Paying Agent, it will, on or before each due date of the
principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities,
segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto a
sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so
becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such persons or otherwise
disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its
action or failure so to act.

Subject to Article Thirteen, whenever the Company shall have
one or more Paying Agents for the Securities, it will, on or before each due
date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on, any Securities,
deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium,
if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the
benefit of the persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and,
unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee, the Company will promptly notify the
Trustee of such action or any failure so to act.

The Company will cause each Paying Agent (other than the
Trustee) to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such
Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this
Section, that such Paying Agent will, subject to Article Thirteen:

the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or
for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay,
to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such
sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such
sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by
any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all
further liability with respect to such sums.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or
then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and
premium, if any) or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two
years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and
payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by
the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such
Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the
Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying
Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as
trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or
such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the
expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in
the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general
circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such
money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall

Company and each Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company shall not be 
required to preserve any such existence (except of the Company), right or

equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals,
replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of
the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection
therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided,

90
<PAGE> 106
Company from discontinuing the maintenance of any of such properties if such

its business or the business of any Restricted Subsidiary and not
disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

contemporaneously therewith the Securities are secured equally and ratably;
provided that (1) if such secured Indebtedness is Pari Passu Indebtedness, the
Lien securing such Pari Passu Indebtedness shall rank equally and ratably with
the Lien securing the Securities and (2) if such secured Indebtedness is

Indebtedness of the Company; provided that any such Lien only extends to the
assets that were subject to such Lien prior to the related acquisition by the
Company and was not created, incurred or assumed in contemplation of such
transaction. The foregoing shall not apply to the incurrence of Indebtedness

occurrence of such Change of Control. The Company shall, subject to the
provisions described below, be required to purchase all Securities properly

Securities until such time as such condition precedent is satisfied. Failure to

SECTION 1014. Disposition of Proceeds of Asset Sales.

(a) The Company will not, and will not permit any of its 
Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Sale unless (i) the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time 
of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value, as determined in 
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, of the shares or assets 
sold or otherwise disposed of and (ii) at least 85% of such consideration 
consists of cash and Cash Equivalents. To the extent that the Net Cash 
Proceeds of any Asset Sale are not required by the terms of any Senior
Indebtedness to be applied to prepay Senior Indebtedness (and thereby
permanently reduce the commitments or amounts available to be reborrowed under
such Senior Indebtedness as required by the terms thereof), or are not so
applied, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may apply
the Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale, within 360 days of such Asset Sale,
to an investment in properties and assets other than working capital that
replace the properties and assets that were the subject of such Asset Sale or
in properties and assets other than working capital that will be used in the
business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries existing on the Issue
Date or in businesses reasonably related thereto ("Replacement Assets") so long
as the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary has notified the Trustee in
writing within 270 days of such Asset Sale that it has determined to apply the
Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale to an investment in such Replacement
Assets. Any Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale not applied as provided in
the preceding two sentences within 360 days of such Asset

100
<PAGE> 116
Sale constitute "Excess Proceeds" subject to disposition as provided in
paragraph (b) below.

(b) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds equals 
$10,000,000 or more, the Company shall apply the Excess Proceeds to the 
repayment of the Securities and any Pari Passu Indebtedness required to
be repaid or repurchased under the instrument governing such Pari Passu
Indebtedness as follows: (i) the Company shall make an offer to purchase (an
"Asset Sale Offer") to all Holders of the Securities in accordance with
paragraph (e) of this Section in the maximum principal amount (expressed as a
multiple of $1,000) of Securities that may be purchased out of an amount (the
"Securities Amount") equal to the product of such Excess Proceeds multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Outstanding principal amount of the
Securities, and the denominator of which is the sum of the Outstanding
principal amount of the Securities and the outstanding principal amount of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness (subject to proration in the event such Securities
Amount is less than the aggregate Asset Sale Offer Price of all Securities
tendered) and (ii) to the extent required by such Pari Passu Indebtedness to
permanently reduce the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, the
Company shall make an offer to purchase or otherwise repurchase or redeem Pari
Passu Indebtedness (a "Pari Passu Offer") in an amount (the "Pari Passu Debt
Amount") equal to the excess of the Excess Proceeds over the Securities Amount;
provided that in no event shall the Company be required to make a Pari Passu
Offer in a Pari Passu Debt Amount exceeding the principal amount of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness plus the amount of any premium required to be paid to
repurchase such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The offer price shall be payable in
cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be
purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon (the "Asset Sale
Offer Price") to the date (the "Asset Sale Offer Date") such Asset Sale Offer
is consummated, in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (e) of
this Section. To the extent that the aggregate Asset Sale Offer Price of the
Securities tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer is less than the
Securities Amount relating thereto or the aggregate amount of Pari Passu
Indebtedness that is purchased is less than the Pari Passu Debt Amount (the
amount of such shortfall, if any, in either case constituting a "Deficiency"),
the Company

101
<PAGE> 117
shall use such Deficiency in any manner. Upon completion of the purchase of
all the Securities tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer and repurchase of
the Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to a Pari Passu Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds, if any, shall be reset at zero.

(c) Whenever the Excess Proceeds received by the Company 
exceed $5,000,000, such Excess Proceeds shall, prior to the purchase of 
Securities or any Pari Passu Indebtedness described in paragraph (b) above, be 
set aside by the Company in a separate account pending (i) deposit with the 
depositary or a Paying Agent of the amount required to purchase the Securities
or Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered in an Asset Sale Offer or a Pari Passu 
Offer, respectively, (ii) delivery by the Company of the Asset Sale Offer Price
to the holders of the Securities or Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered in an 
Asset Sale Offer or a Pari Passu Offer, respectively, and (iii) application, 
as set forth above, of Excess Proceeds in the business of the Company and its 
Restricted Subsidiaries. Such excess proceeds may be invested in Cash 
Equivalents; provided that the maturity date of any such investment shall not
be later than (A) in the event the amount of Excess Proceeds equals $7,000,000
or more, the Asset Sale Offer Date, or (B) in any other event, six months. The
Company shall be entitled to any interest or dividends accrued, earned or paid
on such Cash Equivalents; provided that the Company shall not be entitled to
such interest, and shall not withdraw such interest from the separate account,
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

(d) The Company will not, and will not permit any 
Restricted Subsidiary to, create or permit to exist or become effective any 
restriction (other than restrictions existing under (i) Indebtedness as in 
effect on the Issue Date as such Indebtedness may be refinanced or replaced 
from time to time or (ii) any Senior Indebtedness existing on the Issue Date 
or thereafter, provided that such restrictions contained in such refinanced 
Indebtedness are no less favorable to the Holders of Securities than those 
existing on the date of the Indenture) that would materially impair the 
ability of the Company to make an Asset Sale Offer or, if such Asset Sale Offer
is made, to pay for the Securities tendered for purchase.

102
<PAGE> 118
(e) Notice of an Asset Sale Offer shall be mailed by the

(7) that if Securities in a principal amount in excess of
the Holder's pro rata share of the amount of Excess Proceeds are
tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, the Company shall

the Company so that only Securities in denominations of $1,000 or
integral multiples of $1,000 shall be acquired);

(8) that Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part
will be issued new Securities equal in principal amount to the

(g) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, 
with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other 
securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Securities 
pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.

SECTION 1015. Limitation on Issuance and Sale of Capital 
Stock by Restricted Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries to issue any Capital Stock (other than to the Company or a Wholly

<PAGE> 121
SECTION 1016. Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates.

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or suffer to
exist any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without
limitation, the sale, transfer, disposition, purchase, exchange or lease of
assets, property or services) with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the
Company (other than a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) or any
"beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act)
of 10% or more of the Company's Common Stock at any time outstanding
("Interested Persons"), except (i) on terms that are no less favorable to the

could have been obtained in a comparable transaction or transactions on an
arm's-length basis at such time from persons who are not Affiliates of the
Company or Interested Persons, (ii) with respect to a transaction or series of
transactions involving aggregate payments or value equal to or greater than

recognized investment banking firm stating that the terms of such transaction
or series of transactions are fair to the Company or its Restricted Subsidiary,

Company shall have delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee certifying
that such transaction or series of transactions comply with the preceding
clause (i), and (iii) with respect to any transaction or series of transactions
involving aggregate payments or value equal to or greater than $1,000,000 and

SECTION 1017. Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause
or suffer to exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to (a) pay dividends, in

Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its

restrictions existing under or by reason of (i) any agreement or other
instrument of a person acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company in existence at the time of such acquisition (but not created in
contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to
any person, or the properties or assets of any person, other than the person,
or the property or assets of the person, so acquired, (ii) any encumbrance or
restriction in the Bank Credit Agreement or any other agreement as in effect on
the date of this Indenture and listed on Schedule B hereto and (iii) any
encumbrance or restriction pursuant to any agreement that extends, refinances,
renews or replaces any agreement described in clause (i) and (ii) above, which
is not materially more restrictive or less favorable to the Holders than those
existing under the agreement being extended, refinanced, renewed or replaced.

SECTION 1018. Limitation on Guarantees by Restricted
Subsidiaries.

(a) The Company will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to assume, guarantee or in any
other manner become liable with respect to any

107
<PAGE> 123
Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, unless such Restricted Subsidiary
is a Guarantor or simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture
providing for the guarantee of payment of the Securities by such Restricted
Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of Exhibit A hereto and such guarantee shall
be subordinated to the Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such Restricted
Subsidiary in the manner and to the extent set forth in such Exhibit A;
provided, however, that in the case of any guarantee of any Guarantor with
respect to Senior Indebtedness, the guarantee of the payment of the Securities
by such Guarantor to be provided in accordance herewith shall be subordinated
to the guarantee with respect to such Senior Indebtedness in the same manner
and to the same extent as the Securities are subordinated to such Senior
Indebtedness. The supplemental indenture shall supplement this Indenture by,
among other things, creating an additional Article Fourteen applicable to such
Restricted Subsidiary and any other Guarantor in the form set forth in Exhibit
A hereto, and in connection with the execution and delivery of the supplemental
indenture, such Restricted Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to the Trustee
a Guarantee substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto. Such Article
Fourteen shall not become effective until the provisions of Section 1403 have
been complied with. Each guarantee created pursuant to the provisions
described above is referred to as a "Guarantee," and the issuer of each such
Guarantee, so long as the Guarantee remains outstanding, is referred to as a
"Guarantor."

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a Guarantor is released from all obligations which pursuant to
the first sentence of Section 1018(a) above obligate it to become a Guarantor,
such Guarantor shall be released from all obligations under its Guarantee
(provided that the provisions of the first sentence of Section 1018(a) shall
apply anew in the event that such Guarantor subsequent to being released incurs
any obligations that pursuant to such sentence obligate it to become a
Guarantor). In addition, upon any sale or disposition (by merger or otherwise)
of any Guarantor by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to
any person that is not an Affiliate of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries which is otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture,
such Guarantor will be deemed to be released from all obligations

108
<PAGE> 124
under its Guarantee; provided, however, that each such Guarantor is sold or
disposed of in accordance with Section 1014; provided further that the
foregoing proviso shall not apply to the sale or disposition of a Guarantor in
a foreclosure to the extent that such proviso would be inconsistent with the
requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code.

SECTION 1019. Restriction on Transfer of Assets.

The Company will not sell, convey, transfer or otherwise
dispose of its assets or property to any of its Subsidiaries, except for
transactions pursuant to clause (ix), (xi) and (xii) of the definition of
"Permitted Investments" and sales, conveyances, transfers or other dispositions
(a) made in the ordinary course of business or (b) made to any Wholly Owned
Restricted Subsidiary, if such Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary (x)
simultaneously with such sale, conveyance, transfer or disposal executes and
delivers a supplemental indenture to this Indenture providing for the guarantee
of payment of the Securities by such Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary
pursuant to the terms of Exhibit A hereto and (y) waives, and will not in any
manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of
reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any rights against the Company or
any other Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Wholly Owned Restricted
Subsidiary under its guarantee. Such a guarantee shall be unconditional
(except for a customary savings clause with respect to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer laws) and shall be subordinated to the Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness of such Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary in the manner and to
the extent set forth in such Exhibit A.

SECTION 1020. Limitation on Certain Other Subordinated
Indebtedness.

The Company will not issue, directly or indirectly, any
Indebtedness which is subordinated or junior in ranking in any respect to
Senior Indebtedness unless such Indebtedness is expressly pari passu with or
subordinated in right of payment to the Securities.

109
<PAGE> 125
SECTION 1021. Waiver of Certain Covenants.

The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with
any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 1010 through 1012,
inclusive, and Sections 1015 through 1018, inclusive, if before or after the
time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding Securities, by Act of such Holders, waive such compliance in
such instance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall
extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so
expressly waived, and until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations
of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term,
provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.

the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities are
listed or, if the Securities are not then listed on a national securities
exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee shall
deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for
redemption of portions of the principal amount of Securities; provided,
however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the
principal amount of a Security not redeemed to less than $1,000.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Security

<PAGE> 128
SECTION 1106. Deposit of Redemption Price.

On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit
with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its
own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an
amount of money in same-day funds (or New York Clearing House funds if such
deposit is made prior to the applicable Redemption Date) sufficient to pay the
Redemption Price of, and accrued interest on, all the Securities or portions
thereof which are to be redeemed on that date.

SECTION 1107. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.

Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the
Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and
payable at the Redemption Price therein specified (together with accrued
interest, if any, to the Redemption Date), and from and after such date (unless
the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued
interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any
such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security

be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor
Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record
Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid
upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any)
shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate borne by
the Securities.

SECTION 1108. Securities Redeemed in Part.

Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be
surrendered at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose
pursuant to Section 1002 (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires,

due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such
Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute,

Covenant Defeasance.

The Company may, at its option by Board Resolution, at any

immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article Twelve. Subject to
compliance with this Article Twelve, the Company may exercise its option under
this Section 1202 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under
Section 1203 with respect to the Securities.

SECTION 1203. Covenant Defeasance.

Upon the Company's exercise under Section 1201 of the option
applicable to this Section 1203, the Company shall be released from its

through 1020 with respect to the Outstanding Securities on and after the date
the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant
defeasance"), and the Securities shall thereafter be deemed not to be
"Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration
or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such
covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes
hereunder and Holders of the Securities and the Guarantees and any amounts
deposited under Section 1204 shall cease to be subject to any obligations to,
or the rights of, any holder of Senior Indebtedness or Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness under Article Thirteen, Article Fourteen or otherwise. For this
purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding
Securities, the Company and any Guarantor may omit to comply with and shall
have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in
any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference
elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such
covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such
omission to comply shall not constitute a

115
<PAGE> 131
Default or an Event of Default under Sections 501(3), 501(4) and 501(5), but,
except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities
shall be unaffected thereby.

SECTION 1204. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance.

The following shall be the conditions to application of either
Section 1202 or Section 1203 to the Outstanding Securities:

(1) The Company shall irrevocably have

provisions of this Article Twelve applicable to it)
as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the
following payments, specifically pledged as security
for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the
Holders of such Securities, (A) cash in United States
dollars in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government
Obligations which through the scheduled payment of
principal and interest in respect thereof in
accordance with their terms will provide, not later
than one day before the due date of any payment,
money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof,
sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
written certification thereof delivered to the
Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be
applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee)
to pay and discharge, the principal of (and premium,
if any) and interest on the Outstanding Securities on
the Stated Maturity (or Redemption Date, if
applicable) of such principal (and premium, if any)
or installment of interest; provided that the Trustee
shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such
money or the proceeds of such U.S. Government
Obligations to said payments with respect to the
Securities; and provided further that upon the
effectiveness of this Section 1204, the cash or U.S.

to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness
pursuant to the provisions of Article Thirteen.
Prior to such a deposit, the Company may give the
Trustee, in accordance with Section 1103 hereof, a
notice of its

116
<PAGE> 132
election to redeem all of the Outstanding
Securities at a future date pursuant to Article
Eleven hereof, which notice shall be irrevocable.
Such irrevocable notice, if given, shall be given
effect in applying the foregoing. For this purpose,

are (x) direct obligations of the United States of
America for the timely payment of which its full
faith and credit is pledged or (y) obligations of a
person controlled or supervised by and acting as an
agency or instrumentality of the United States of
America the timely payment of which is
unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit
obligation by the United States of America, which, in
either case, are not callable or redeemable at the
option of the issuer thereof, and shall also include
a depository receipt issued by a bank (as defined in
Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act), as custodian
with respect to any such U.S. Government Obligation
or a specific payment of principal of or interest on
any such U.S. Government Obligation held by such
custodian for the account of the holder of such
depository receipt, provided that (except as required
by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any
deduction from the amount payable to the holder of
such depository receipt from any amount received by
the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government
Obligation or the specific payment of principal of or
interest on the U.S. Government Obligation evidenced
by such depository receipt;

(2) No Default or Event of Default with
respect to the Securities shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as
Section 501(9) or 501(10) hereof are concerned, at
any time during the period ending on the 91st day
after the date of such deposit (it being understood
that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied
until the expiration of such period);

(3) Such defeasance or covenant
defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation
of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or
any other material agreement or instrument to which
the Company or any Guarantor is a party or by which
it is bound;

117
<PAGE> 133
(4) In the case of an election under
Section 1202, the Company shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (x) the
Company has received from, or there has been
published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling,
or (y) since date of the Indenture, there has been a
change in the applicable federal income tax law, in
either case to the effect that, and based thereon
such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the
Outstanding Securities will not recognize income,
gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a
result of such defeasance and will be subject to
federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such defeasance had not occurred;

(5) Such defeasance or covenant
defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a
conflicting interest with respect to any Securities
of the Company or any Guarantor;

(6) In the case of an election under
Section 1203, the Company shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the
Holders of the Outstanding Securities will not
recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and
will be subject to federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such covenant defeasance
had not occurred;

(7) The Company shall have delivered to
the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
(x) the trust funds will not be subject to any rights
of any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company,
including, without limitation, rights arising under
this Indenture, and (y) after the 91st day following
the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to
the effect of any applicable Federal Bankruptcy Code;

(8) The Company shall have delivered to
the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion
of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent provided for relating to either the
defeasance under Section 1202 or the covenant
defeasance under Sec-

118
<PAGE> 134
tion 1203 (as the case may be) have been complied
with;

(9) The Company shall have delivered to
the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by the Company with intent of
preferring the Holders or any Guarantor over the
other creditors of the Company or any Guarantor with
the intent of defeating, hindering or delaying or
defrauding creditors of the Company, any Guarantor or
others;

(10) If the Bank Credit Agreement is in
effect, the Company shall have delivered to the
Trustee any required consent of the lenders under the
Bank Credit Agreement to such defeasance or covenant
defeasance, as the case may be; and

(11) No event or condition shall exist
that would prevent the Company from making payments
of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest
on the Securities on the date of such deposit or at
any time during the period ending on the 91st day
after the date of such deposit (it being understood
that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied
until the expiration of such period).

SECTION 1205. Deposited Money and U.S. Government
Obligations to Be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section
1003, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds
thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee--collectively
for purposes of this Section 1205, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1204 in
respect of the Outstanding Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the
Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this
Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent
(including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may
determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due
thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, but such
money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by

119
<PAGE> 135
law. Money and U.S. Government Obligations so held in trust are not subject to
Article Thirteen.

The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any
tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government
Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1204 or the principal and interest
received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which
by law is for the account of the Holders of the Outstanding Securities.

Anything in this Article Twelve to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to
time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it
as provided in Section 1204 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification
thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which
would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent defeasance or
covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Article.

SECTION 1206. Reinstatement.

If the Trustee or any Paying Agent is unable to apply any
money in accordance with Section 1205 by reason of any order or judgment of any
court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting
such application, then the obligations of the Company and any Guarantor under
this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no
deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 1202 or 1203, as the case may be,
until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such
money in accordance with Section 1205; provided, however, that if the Company
makes any payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any
Security following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such
payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN

SUBORDINATION OF SECURITIES

SECTION 1301. Securities Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness.

The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a
Security, by his acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, for the
benefit of the holders, from time to time, of Senior Indebtedness that, to the
extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article, the
Indebtedness represented by the Securities and the payment of the principal of
(and premium, if any) and interest on each and all of the Securities are hereby
expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment as provided in this
Article to the prior payment in full in cash, Cash Equivalents or other form of
payment acceptable to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of all existing and
future Senior Indebtedness of the Company, which includes, without limitation,
all obligations under the Bank Credit Agreement; provided, however, that the
Securities, the Indebtedness represented thereby and the payment of the
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities in all
respects shall rank equal with all other existing and future Pari Passu
Indebtedness and senior to all future Subordinated Indebtedness or the Company.

This Article shall constitute a continuing offer to all
persons who, in reliance upon such provisions, become holders of, or continue
to hold, Senior Indebtedness, and such provisions are made for the benefit of
the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and such holders are made obligees
hereunder and they and/or each of them may enforce such provisions.

SECTION 1302. Payment Over of Proceeds upon Dissolution,
etc.

In the event of (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or
proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar
case or proceeding in connection therewith, relating to the Company or its
assets, (b) any liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of the Company,
whether voluntary or involuntary and whether or not involving insolvency or
bankruptcy, or (c)

121
<PAGE> 137
any assignment for the benefit of creditors or other marshalling of assets or
liabilities of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary and whether or not
involving insolvency or bankruptcy, then and in any such event

(1) the holders of Senior Indebtedness
shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash,
Cash Equivalents or other form of payment acceptable
to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of all amounts
due on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness, or
provision shall be made for such payment in
accordance with the instrument governing such Senior
Indebtedness, before the Holders of the Securities
are entitled to receive any payment or distribution
of any kind or character (other than any payment or
distribution in the form of equity securities or
subordinated securities of the Company or any
successor obligor with respect to the Senior
Indebtedness provided for by a plan of reorganization
or readjustment that, in the case of any such
subordinated securities, are (A) subordinated in
right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness that may
at the time be outstanding to substantially the same
extent as, or to a greater extent than, the
Securities are so subordinated as provided in this
Article and (B) have an Average Life to Stated
Maturity not less than or not prior to the Securities
(such equity securities or subordinated securities of
a person hereinafter being "Permitted Junior
Securities") or payments made pursuant to Article
Twelve) on account of the principal of (and premium,
if any) and interest on each and all of the
Securities; and

(2) in the event that, notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section, after an
event described in clause (a), (b) or (c), the
Trustee or any Holder of the Securities shall have
received any payment or distribution of assets of the
Company of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property or securities, in respect of the principal
of (and premium, if any) and interest on each and all
of the Securities before all Senior Indebtedness is
paid in full or payment thereof provided for in cash,
Cash Equivalents or other form of payment acceptable
to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, then and in
such event such payment or distribution (other than a
payment or distribution in the form of Permitted

122
<PAGE> 138
Junior Securities or payments made pursuant to
Article Twelve) shall be paid over or delivered
forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver,
liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or
other person making payment or distribution of assets
of the Company for application to the payment of all
Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the extent
necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full in
cash, Cash Equivalents or other form of payment
acceptable to the holders of Senior Indebtedness,
after giving effect to any concurrent payment or
distribution to or for the holders of Senior
Indebtedness.

The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the
Company into, another person or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company
following the conveyance, transfer or lease of its properties and assets
substantially as an entirety to another person upon the terms and conditions
set forth in Article Eight shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding up,
liquidation, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors or
marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company for the purposes of this
Section if the person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is
merged or the person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease such
properties and assets substantially as an entirety, as the case may be, shall,
as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, comply
with the conditions set forth in Article Eight.

SECTION 1303. Suspension of Payment When Senior
Indebtedness in Default.

(a) Unless Section 1302 shall be
applicable, upon the occurrence of a Payment Default, then no payment or
distribution of any assets of the Company of any kind or character (other than
Permitted Junior Securities or payments made pursuant to Article Twelve) shall
be made by the Company or the Trustee (if notice of such Payment Default has
been received by the Trustee pursuant to Section 1309) or received by the
Holders on account of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on
each and all of the Securities or on account of the purchase or redemption or
other acquisition of Securities unless and until such Payment Default shall
have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist or such

123
<PAGE> 139
Senior Indebtedness shall have been discharged or paid in full in cash, Cash
Equivalents or other form of payment acceptable to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness, after which the Company shall resume making any and all required
payments in respect of the Securities, including any missed payments.

(b) Unless Section 1302 shall be
applicable, upon (1) the occurrence of a Non-payment Default and (2) receipt by
the Trustee from the representative of holders of Designated Senior
Indebtedness of written notice of such occurrence, then no payment or
distribution of any assets of the Company of any kind or character (other than
Permitted Junior Securities or payments made pursuant to Article Twelve) shall
be made by the Company on account of the principal of (and premium, if any) and
interest on each and all of the Securities or on account of the purchase or
redemption or other acquisition of Securities for a period ("Payment Blockage
Period") commencing on the date of receipt by the Trustee of such notice from
such representative unless and until (subject to any blockage of payments that
may then be in effect under paragraph (a) of this Section) (A) more than 179
days shall have elapsed since receipt of such written notice by the Company or
the Trustee (provided such Designated Senior Indebtedness as to which notice
was given shall not theretofore have been accelerated), (B) such Non-payment
Default shall have been cured or waived in writing or shall have ceased to
exist (provided that no other Payment Default or Non-payment Default has
occurred and is then continuing after giving effect to such cure or waiver),
(C) such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have been discharged or paid in
full in cash, Cash Equivalents or other form of payment acceptable to the
holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness or (D) such Payment Blockage Period
shall have been terminated by written notice to the Company or the Trustee from
such representative initiating such Payment Blockage Period, after which, in
the case of clause (A), (B), (C) or (D), whichever was earlier, the Company
shall resume making any and all required payments in respect of the Securities,
including any missed payments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, only one Payment Blockage Period may be commenced within any
consecutive 360-day period, and no Non-payment Default which existed or was
continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with
respect to

124
<PAGE> 140
the Designated Senior Indebtedness initiating such Payment Blockage Period
shall be, or can be made, the basis for the commencement of a subsequent
Payment Blockage Period whether or not within a period of 360 consecutive days
unless such event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of
not less than 90 consecutive days. In no event will a Payment Blockage Period
extend beyond 179 days from the date of the receipt by the Trustee of the
notice and there must be at least a 181-consecutive-day period in any 360-day
period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect.

(c) In the event that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Trustee or the Holder of any Security shall have received a
payment prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, then and in
such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith by the
Trustee (if the notice required by Section 1309 has been received by the
Trustee) or an amount equal to such payment or distribution shall be paid over
and delivered forthwith by such Holder to the agent under the Bank Credit
Agreement for the benefit of, and distribution to, the holders of Designated
Senior Indebtedness or, if the Bank Credit Agreement has been terminated, to
the Company; provided that, in the event any Holder has received notice that
such payment is prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section prior to
the receipt of such payment by such Holders, any such Holders shall hold such
payment in trust for the benefit of the holders of Designated Senior
Indebtedness.

SECTION 1304. Payment Permitted If No Default.

Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this
Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent the Company, at any time
except during the pendency of any case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or
other winding up, assignment for the benefit of creditors or other marshalling
of assets and liabilities of the Company referred to in Section 1302 or under
the conditions described in Section 1303, from making payments at any time of
principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities.

125
<PAGE> 141
SECTION 1305. Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior
Indebtedness.

Subject to the payment in full in cash, Cash Equivalents or
other form of payment acceptable to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of all
Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated to the
rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments and
distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior
Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the
Securities shall be paid in full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments
or distributions to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or
securities to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be
entitled except for the provisions of this Article, and no payments pursuant to
the provisions of this Article to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Holders
of the Securities or the Trustee, shall, as among the Company, its creditors
other than holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders of the Securities,
be deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of
the Senior Indebtedness.

SECTION 1306. Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights.

The provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for
the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities on
the one hand and the holders of Senior Indebtedness on the other hand. Nothing
contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities
is intended to or shall (a) impair, as between the Company and the Holders of
the Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the Securities the principal of (and
premium, if any) and interest on the Securities as and when the same shall
become due and payable in accordance with their terms; or (b) affect the
relative rights against the Company of the Holders of the Securities and
creditors of the Company other than the Holders of Senior Indebtedness; or (c)
prevent the Trustee or the holder of any Security from exercising all remedies
otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture,
subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of Senior
Indebtedness, in respect of cash, property or

126
<PAGE> 142
securities of the Company received upon exercise of any such remedy.

SECTION 1307. Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.

Each Holder of a Security by his acceptance thereof authorizes
and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary
or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article and
appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.

SECTION 1308. No Waiver of Subordination Provisions.

(a) No right of any present or future
holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided
shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to
act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith,
by any such holder, or by any non-compliance by the Company with the terms,
provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof
any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with.

(b) Without in any way limiting the
generality of paragraph (a) of this Section, the holders of Senior Indebtedness
may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the
Trustee or the Holders of the Securities, without incurring responsibility to
the Holders of the Securities and without impairing or releasing the
subordination provided in this Article or the obligations hereunder of the
Holders of the Securities to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or
more of the following: (1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or
extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness or any
instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness
is outstanding; (2) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property
pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness; (3) release any
person liable in any manner for the collection or payment of Senior 
Indebtedness; and (4) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against 
the Company and any other person.

127
<PAGE> 143
SECTION 1309. Notice to Trustee.

(a) The Company shall give prompt
written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Company which would
prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the
Securities. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article or any other
provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of
the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment to or
by the Trustee in respect of the Securities, unless and until the Trustee shall
have received written notice thereof from the Company or a holder of Senior
Indebtedness or from any trustee, fiduciary or agent therefor; and, prior to
the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to Section 602
hereof, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist;
provided, however, that, if the Trustee shall not have received the notice
provided for in this Section at least three Business Days prior to the date
upon which by the terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose
(including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of (and premium,
if any) or interest on any Security), then, anything herein contained to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to
receive such money and to apply the same to the purpose for which such money
was received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary which may
be received by it within three Business Days prior to such date.

(b) Subject to Section 602 hereof, the
Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by
a person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a
trustee, fiduciary or agent therefor) to establish that such notice has been
given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee, fiduciary or agent
therefor). In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further
evidence is required with respect to the right of any person as a holder of
Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to
this Article, the Trustee may request such person to furnish evidence to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness
held by such person, the extent to which such person is entitled to participate
in such payment or distribution and any other facts perti-

128
<PAGE> 144
nent to the rights of such person under this Article and, if such evidence is
not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such person pending
judicial determination as to the right of such person to receive such payment.

SECTION 1310. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of
Liquidating Agent.

Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company
referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to Section 602 hereof, and
the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to rely upon any order or
decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any insolvency,
bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding-up
or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in
bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit
of creditors, agent or other person making such payment or distribution,
delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities, for the purpose of
ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such payment or
distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the
Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or
distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article.

SECTION 1311. Rights of Trustee as a Holder of Senior
Indebtedness; Preservation of Trustee's Rights.

The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to
all the rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Senior
Indebtedness which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any
other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall
deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this
Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant
to Section 606.

129
<PAGE> 145
SECTION 1312. Article Applicable to Paying Agents.

In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee
shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term
"Trustee" as used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context
otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying
Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such
Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the
Trustee; provided, however, that Section 1311 shall not apply to the Company or
any Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as Paying Agent.

SECTION 1313. No Suspension of Remedies.

Nothing contained in this Article shall limit the right of the
Trustee or the Holders of Securities to take any action to accelerate the
maturity of the Securities pursuant to Article Five or to pursue any rights or
remedies hereunder or under applicable law.

SECTION 1314. Trust Moneys Not Subordinated.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
payments from cash or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust
under Article Twelve hereof by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) and
which were deposited in accordance with the terms of Article Twelve hereof and
not in violation of Section 1303 hereof for the payment of principal of (and
premium, if any) and interest on the Securities shall not be subordinated to
the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness or subject to the restrictions set
forth in this Article Thirteen, and none of the holders shall be obligated to
pay over any such amount to the Company or any holder of Senior Indebtedness or
any other creditor of the Company.

SECTION 1315. Proof of Claim.

In the event of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the
Securities or the property of the Company or of such

130
<PAGE> 146
other obligor or their creditors, the Holders irrevocably authorize and empower
the agent under the Bank Credit Agreement, if the Bank Credit Agreement is then
in effect (but without imposing any obligation on, or any duty to such agent),
to file and prove all claims therefor in the name of the Holders (or otherwise,
as such agent may determine to be necessary or appropriate for the enforcement
of the provisions of this Article Thirteen) if the Trustee or the Holders do
not file a proper claim or proof of debt in the form required in any such
proceeding prior to 15 days before the expiration of the time to file such
claim or claims.

SECTION 1316. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior
Indebtedness.

The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness and shall not be liable to any such holders if
the Trustee shall in good faith mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders of
Securities or to the Company or to any other person cash, property or
securities to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by
virtue of this Article Thirteen or otherwise. With respect to the holders of
Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such
of its covenants or obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article
Thirteen and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to holders of
Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee.

This Indenture may be signed in any number of counterparts
each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Indenture.

ARTICLE FOURTEEN

GUARANTEE OF SECURITIES

SECTION 1401. Guarantee.

Subject to the provisions of this Article Fourteen, each
Guarantor hereby jointly and severally unconditionally guarantees to each
Holder of a Security Outstanding authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and
to the Trustee, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this
Indenture, the Securities or the obligations of the Company or any other
Guarantors to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities will be duly and
punctually paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted
by law) interest, if any, on the Securities and all other obligations of the
Company or the Guarantors to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder
(including fees, expenses or other) and all other Guarantor Senior Subordinated
Note Obligations will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance
with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of
payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other Senior Subordinated
Note Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed
in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated
Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. This Guarantee is a present and
continuing guarantee of payment and performance, and not of collectibility
only. Accordingly, failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed, or
failing performance of any other obligation of the Company to the Holders under
this Indenture or the Securities, for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be
obligated to pay, or to perform or cause the performance of, the same
immediately. An Event of Default under this Indenture or the Securities shall
constitute an event of default under this Guarantee, and shall entitle the
Holders of Securities to accelerate the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder
in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Company.

<PAGE> 149
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its obligations
hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action
to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities with
respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, any release of any other
Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to
enforce the same, whether or not a Guarantee is affixed to any particular
Security, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each of the Guarantors hereby
waives the benefit of diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of
claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company,
any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice
and all demands whatsoever and covenants that its Guarantee will not be
discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the
Securities, this Indenture and this Guarantee. If any Holder or the Trustee is
required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or to any
Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official
acting in relation to the Company or such Guarantor, any amount paid by the
Company or such Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the
extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the
Holders of Securities and the Trustee, on the other hand, (a) subject to this
Article Fourteen, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be
accelerated as provided in Article Five hereof for the purposes of this
Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing
such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (b) in
the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Five
hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith
become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee.

This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and
continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Company
for liquidation or reorganization, should the Company become insolvent or make
an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be
appointed for all or any signif-

A-2

<PAGE> 150
icant part of the Company's assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at
any time payment and performance of the Securities are, pursuant to applicable
law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned
by any obligee on the Securities, whether as a "voidable preference,"
"fraudulent transfer" or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance
had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is
rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Securities shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount
paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.

The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from
any nonpaying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair
the rights of the Holders under this Guarantee.

SECTION 1402. Execution and Delivery of Guarantee.

The validity and enforceability of any Guarantee shall not be
affected by the fact that it is not affixed to any particular Security. Each of
the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 1401 shall
remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each
Security a notation of such Guarantee.

If an Officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on the
Indenture or a Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee
authenticates any Security or at any time thereafter, such Guarantor's
Guarantee of such Security shall be valid nevertheless.

The delivery of any Guarantee to the Trustee as required by
Section 1018(a) shall constitute due delivery of such Guarantee on behalf of
the Guarantor to and for the benefit of all Holders of the Securities.

SECTION 1403. Additional Guarantors.

Any person may become a Guarantor by executing and delivering
to the Trustee (a) a supplemental indenture in form and substance satisfactory
to the Trustee,

A-3

<PAGE> 151
which subjects such person to the provisions of this Indenture as a Guarantor,
and (b) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture
has been duly authorized and executed by such person and constitutes the legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of such person (subject to such
customary exceptions concerning fraudulent conveyance laws, creditors' rights
and equitable principles as may be acceptable to the Trustee in its
discretion).

SECTION 1404. Guarantee Obligations Subordinated to
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness.

Each Guarantor covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a
Security, by his acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, for the
benefit of the holders, from time to time, of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness
that, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article,
the Indebtedness represented by the Guarantee and all payments pursuant to the
Guarantee made by or on behalf of such Guarantor are hereby expressly made
subordinate and subject in right of payment as provided in this Article to the
prior payment in full in cash, Cash Equivalents or other form of payment
acceptable to the holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of all Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor; provided, however, that the Guarantee,
the Indebtedness represented thereby and all payments pursuant to the Guarantee
made by or on behalf of such Guarantor in all respects shall rank prior to all
future Subordinated Indebtedness.

This Section and the following Sections 1405 through 1418 of
this Article shall constitute a continuing offer to all persons, who in
reliance upon such provisions, become holders of, or continue to hold Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor and, to the extent set forth in Section
1406(b), holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness; and such provisions are
made for the benefit of the holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of each
Guarantor and, to the extent set forth in Section 1406(b), holders of
Designated Senior Indebtedness; and such holders (to such extent) are made
obligees hereunder and they or each of them may enforce such provisions.

<PAGE> 152
SECTION 1405. Payment Over of Proceeds upon Dissolution,
etc., of a Guarantor.

In the event of (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or
proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar
case or proceeding in connection therewith, relating to any Guarantor or its
assets, or (b) any liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of any
Guarantor, whether voluntary or involuntary and whether or not involving
insolvency or bankruptcy, or (c) any assignment for the benefit of creditors or
any other marshalling of assets or liabilities of any Guarantor, whether
voluntary or involuntary and whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy,
then and in any such event

(1) the holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such 
Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash, Cash 
Equivalents or other form of payment acceptable to the holders of 
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of all amounts due on or in respect of 
all Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, or provision shall be made for such 
payment in accordance with the instrument governing such Guarantor 
Senior Indebtedness, before the Holders of the Securities are entitled 
to receive any payment or distribution of any kind or character by and
on behalf of such Guarantor (other than any payment or distribution in 
the form of the Permitted Junior Securities of such Guarantor) on 
account of the Guarantor Senior Subordinated Note Obligations; and

(2) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing 
provisions of this Section, the Trustee or any Holder of the Securities
shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of such 
Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or 
securities, in respect of the Guarantor Senior Subordinated Note 
Obligations before all Guarantor Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in
cash, Cash Equivalents or other form of payment acceptable to the 
holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness or payment thereof is provided
for, then and in such event such payment or distribution (other than a 
payment or distribution in the form of Permitted Junior Securities of 
such Guarantor) shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the 
trustee in bankruptcy,

A-5

<PAGE> 153
receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other
person making payment or distribution of assets of such Guarantor for
application to the payment of all Guarantor Senior Indebtedness
remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness in full in cash, Cash Equivalents or other form of
payment acceptable to the holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness,
after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or
for the holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness.

The consolidation of any Guarantor with, or the merger of any
Guarantor into, another person or the liquidation or dissolution of any
Guarantor following the conveyance, transfer or lease of its properties and
assets substantially as an entirety to another person upon the terms and
conditions set forth in Article Eight shall not be deemed a dissolution,
winding up, liquidation, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of
creditors or marshalling of assets and liabilities of such Guarantor for the
purposes of this Section if the person formed by such consolidation or into
which such Guarantor is merged or the person which acquires by conveyance,
transfer or lease such properties and assets substantially as an entirety, as
the case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance,
transfer or lease, comply with the conditions set forth in Article Eight.

SECTION 1406. Suspension of Guarantee Obligations When
Senior Indebtedness in Default.

(a) Unless Section 1405 shall be applicable, upon the 
occurrence of a Payment Default, then no payment or distribution of any assets 
of any Guarantor of any kind or character (other than Permitted Junior 
Securities of such Guarantor) shall be made by such Guarantor or the Trustee 
(if notice of such Payment Default has been received by the Trustee pursuant to
Section 1309) or received by the Holders on account of the Guarantor Senior 
Subordinated Note Obligations or on account of the purchase or redemption or 
other acquisition of Securities or the Guarantee of such Guarantor unless and 
until such Payment Default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased
to exist or the Senior Indebtedness as to which such Payment Default relates 
shall have been dis-

A-6

<PAGE> 154
charged or paid in full in cash, Cash Equivalents or other form of payment
acceptable to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, after which such Guarantor
shall resume making any and all required payments in respect of the Guarantee,
including any missed payments.

(b) Unless Section 1405 shall be applicable, during any 
Payment Blockage Period in respect of the Securities, no payment or 
distribution of any assets of any Guarantor of any kind or character (other 
than Permitted Junior Securities of such Guarantor) shall be made by such 
Guarantor on account of the Guarantor Senior Subordinated Note Obligations
or on account of the purchase or redemption or other acquisition of Securities
or the Guarantee of such Guarantor; provided, however, that the foregoing
prohibition shall not apply unless such Payment Blockage Period has been
instituted under Section 1303(b) by the representative of holders of Designated
Senior Indebtedness which also constitutes Guarantor Senior Indebtedness. Upon
the termination of any Payment Blockage Period, subject to Section 1405 and
Section 1406(a) (if applicable), such Guarantor shall resume making any and all
required payments in respect of its obligations under this Guarantee.

(c) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
Trustee or the Holder of any Security shall have received a payment prohibited 
by the foregoing provisions of this Section, then and in such event such 
payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith by the Trustee (if the 
notice required by Section 1309 has been received by the Trustee) or an amount 
equal to such payment or distribution shall be paid over and delivered 
forthwith by such Holder to the agent under the Bank Credit Agreement for the 
benefit of, and distribution to, the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness 
only to the extent, if at all, that such Designated Senior Indebtedness also 
constitutes Guarantor Senior Indebtedness or, if the Bank Credit Agreement has 
been terminated, to the Guarantor; provided that, in the event any Holder has 
received notice that such payment is prohibited by the foregoing provisions of 
this Section prior to the receipt of such payment by such Holders, any such 
Holders shall hold such payment in trust for the benefit of the holders of 
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness.

A-7

<PAGE> 155
SECTION 1407. Release of a Guarantor.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
this Indenture, in the event that a Guarantor is released from all obligations 
which pursuant to Section 1018(a) obligate it to become a Guarantor, such 
Guarantor shall be released from all obligations under its Guarantee (provided 
that the provisions of Section 1018(a) shall apply anew in the event that such 
Guarantor subsequent to being released incurs any obligations that pursuant to 
Section 1018(a) obligate it to become a Guarantor).

(b) In addition, except in the case where the prohibition 
on transfer in Article Eight is applicable, upon the sale or disposition of all
of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor by the Company or a Subsidiary, or upon the
consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into any person (in each case, 
other than to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), such Guarantor shall
be deemed automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all 
obligations under this Article without any further action required on the part 
of the Trustee or any Holder; provided, however, that each such Guarantor is 
sold or disposed of in accordance with Section 1014 hereof; and provided 
further that the foregoing proviso shall not apply to the sale or disposition 
of a Guarantor in a foreclosure to the extent that such proviso would be 
inconsistent with the requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code.

(c) The Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument 
evidencing the release of a Guarantor upon receipt of a request of the Company 
accompanied by an Officers' Certificate certifying as to the compliance with 
this Section 1407. Any Guarantor not so released or the entity surviving such 
Guarantor, as applicable, shall remain or be liable under its Guarantee as 
provided in this Article.

The Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably requested
by the Company or a Guarantor in order to evidence the release of such
Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee endorsed on the Securities
and under this Article.

A-8

<PAGE> 156
Except as set forth in Articles Eight and Ten and this Section
1407, nothing contained in the Indenture or in any of the Securities shall
prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or
another Guarantor or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a
Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or
another Guarantor.

SECTION 1408. Waiver of Subrogation.

Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any claim or other
rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of such Guarantor's obligations under this Guarantee and this
Indenture, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, indemnification, and any right to participate in
any claim or remedy of any Holder of Securities against the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in
equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation,
the right to take or receive from the Company, directly or indirectly, in cash
or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on
account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to any
Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and the Securities shall not
have been paid in full, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such
Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Holders
of the Securities and shall, subject to the provisions of this Article and to
Article Thirteen, forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of such
Holders to be credited and applied upon the Securities, whether matured or
unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. Each Guarantor
acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the
financing arrangements contemplated by this Indenture and that the waiver set
forth in this Section is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

This Section as applicable to any particular Guarantor may be
amended or modified, without the consent of the Holders, in a manner to be
consistent with the terms of any waiver of subrogation language set forth in

A-9

<PAGE> 157
any guarantee of such Guarantor issued under the Bank Credit Agreement at the
time that the Guarantee hereunder is first issued and shall thereafter be
required to be modified in the same manner as such guarantee under the Bank
Credit Agreement is thereafter amended or modified; provided that no such
amendment or modification to thereafter conform to the Bank Credit Agreement
shall be in a manner which is adverse to the Holders in any respect. No
modification or amendment referred to in the preceding sentence shall be
permitted if it would disadvantage the Holders relative to the Banks pursuant
to the Bank Credit Agreement other than by operation of the subordination
provisions of this Article.

SECTION 1409. Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness.

Subject to the payment in full of all Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness of the Guarantors and all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the
Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of
such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors to receive payments and
distributions of cash, property and securities of a Guarantor applicable to
such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors until all amounts due
under the Guarantee of such Guarantor shall be paid in full. For purposes of
such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities of such Guarantor to
which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for
the provisions of this Article, and no payments pursuant to the provisions of
this Article to the holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors
by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee, shall, as among such Guarantor,
its creditors other than holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, and the
Holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment or distribution by such
Guarantor to or on account of the Guarantor Senior Indebtedness.

SECTION 1410. Guarantor Provisions Solely to Define
Relative Rights.

The subordination provisions of this Article are and are
intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders
of the Securities on the one hand and the holders of Guarantor Senior
Indebt-

A-10

<PAGE> 158
edness of each Guarantor and, to the extent set forth in Section 1406, holders
of Designated Senior Indebtedness on the other hand. Nothing contained in this 
Article (other than a release pursuant to Section 1407) or elsewhere in this 
Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall (a) impair, as between 
each Guarantor and the Holders of the Securities, the obligation of each 
Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the 
Securities its obligations under the Guarantee as and when the same shall 
become due and payable in accordance with their terms; or (b) affect the 
relative rights against such Guarantor of the Holders of the Securities and 
creditors of such Guarantor other than the holders of Guarantor Senior 
Indebtedness of such Guarantor; or (c) prevent the Trustee or the Holder of 
any Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable 
law upon Default or an Event of Default under this Indenture, subject to the 
rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of Guarantor Senior 
Indebtedness of the Guarantors hereunder and, to the extent set forth in 
Section 1406, holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, 
property or securities of the Company received upon exercise of any such remedy.

The failure by any Guarantor to make a payment in respect of
its obligations under this Guarantee by reason of any provision of this Article
shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default hereunder.

SECTION 1411. Trustee to Effectuate Subordination of
Guarantee Obligations.

Each Holder of a Security by his acceptance thereof authorizes
and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary
or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article and
appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.

SECTION 1412. No Waiver of Guarantee Subordination
Provisions.

(a) No right of any present or future holder of any 
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor to enforce subordination as 
herein provided shall at any

A-11

<PAGE> 159
time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the
part of the Company or any Guarantor or by any act or failure to act, in good
faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company or any
Guarantor with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture,
regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise
charged with.

(b) Without limiting in any way the generality of 
subsection (a) of this Section, the holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of
any Guarantor may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of 
or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities, without incurring 
responsibility to the Holders of the Securities and without impairing or 
releasing the subordination provided in this Article Fourteen or the 
obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Securities to the holders of
such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (1)
change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of,
or renew or alter, such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness or any Senior
Indebtedness as to which such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness relates or any
instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which such Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness or such Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (2) sell,
exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or
otherwise securing such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness or any Senior
Indebtedness as to which such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness relates; (3)
release any person liable in any manner for the collection or payment of such
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness or any Senior Indebtedness as to which such
Guarantor Senior Indebtedness relates; and (4) exercise or refrain from
exercising any rights against such Guarantor and any other person.

SECTION 1413. Guarantors to Give Notice to Trustee.

(a) The Company and each Guarantor shall give prompt 
written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to such Guarantor which would 
prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the 
Securities. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article or any other 
provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of
the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment to

A-12

<PAGE> 160
or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities, unless and until the Trustee
shall have received written notice thereof from the Company, such Guarantor or
a holder of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee, fiduciary or
agent therefor; and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the
Trustee, subject to Section 602 hereof, shall be entitled in all respects to
assume that no such facts exist; provided, however, that if the Trustee shall
not have received the notice provided for in this Section at least three
Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any money may
become payable for any purpose under this Indenture (including, without
limitation, the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest
on any Security) then, anything herein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive
such money and to apply the same to the purpose for which such money was
received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary which may be
received by it within three Business Days prior to such date.

(b) Subject to Section 602 hereof, the Trustee shall be 
entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a person 
representing himself to be a holder of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness (or a 
trustee, fiduciary or agent therefor) to establish that such notice has been 
given by a holder of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee, fiduciary or
agent therefor). In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that 
further evidence is required with respect to the right of any person as a 
holder of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or 
distribution pursuant to this Article, the Trustee may request such person to
furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount
of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness held by such person, the extent to which such
person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other
facts pertinent to the rights of such person under this Article and, if such
evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such person
pending judicial determination as to the right of such person to receive such
payment.

SECTION 1414. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of
Liquidating Agent Regarding Dissolution, etc., of Guarantors.

A-13

<PAGE> 161
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of any Guarantor
referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to Section 602 hereof, and
the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon any
order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such
insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution,
winding-up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the
trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for
the benefit of creditors, agent or other person making such payment or
distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of the Securities, for
the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such payment
or distribution, the holders of Guarantor Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor
and other Indebtedness of such Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable
thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts
pertinent thereto or to this Article.

SECTION 1415. Rights of Trustee as a Holder of Guarantor
Senior Indebtedness; Preservation of Trustee's Rights.

The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to
all the rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Guarantor Senior
Indebtedness of any Guarantor which may at any time be held by the Trustee, to
the same extent as any other holder of such Guarantor Senior Indebtedness, and
nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as
such holder. Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to,
the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 606.

SECTION 1416. Article Applicable to Paying Agents.

In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee
shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term
"Trustee" as used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context
otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying
Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such
Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the
Trustee; provided, however, that Section 1415 shall not

A-14

<PAGE> 162
apply to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate
acts as Paying Agent.

SECTION 1417. No Suspension of Remedies.

Nothing contained in this Article shall limit the right of the
Trustee or the Holders of Securities to take any action to accelerate the
maturity of the Securities pursuant to Article Five or to pursue any rights or
remedies hereunder or under applicable law.

SECTION 1418. Proof of Claim.

In the event of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to any Guarantor or the property of any Guarantor
or its creditors, the Holders irrevocably authorize and empower the agent under
the Bank Credit Agreement, if the Bank Credit Agreement is then in effect and
the Senior Indebtedness incurred thereunder constitutes Guarantor Senior
