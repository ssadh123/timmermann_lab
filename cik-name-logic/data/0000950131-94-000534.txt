</TABLE>
MINNEAPOLIS, April 14, 1994 -- First Bank System, Inc. (NYSE: FBS) today
reported first quarter earnings of $98.5 million, or $0.84 per share, compared
with $77.5 million, or $0.61 per share, in the first quarter of 1993. Return on
average assets and return on average common equity in the first quarter of 1994
were 1.59 percent and 18.8 percent, respectively, compared with returns of 1.25
percent and 14.7 percent in the first quarter of 1993.

The strong results for the first quarter reflect loan and fee income growth,
tight expense control, continued improvement in credit quality and effective
capital management.

Included in the results for the first quarter of 1994 were increases in net
interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis of $6.8 million, or 2.4 percent,
and noninterest income of $10.6 million, or 7.5 percent, and a decrease in
noninterest expense of $4.2 million, or 1.6 percent. Noninterest income was
higher as a result of growth in fee revenues, primarily from the credit card and
trust businesses. The decrease in noninterest expense reflects cost savings
from the integration of 
<PAGE>

Page 2

recent acquisitions. The efficiency ratio, or ratio of expenses to revenues, for
the first quarter of 1994 improved to 58.0 percent, from 61.4 percent for the
same quarter last year. The reduction in the provision for credit losses of
$14.1 million, or 37 percent, was driven by continued declines in net charge-
offs and in nonperforming assets.

Earnings per share in the first quarter of 1994 reflects the impact of the
repurchase of 4.0 million average shares. These shares were repurchased
beginning in October of 1993 in anticipation of their reissuance in connection
with the acquisition of Boulevard Bancorp, which resulted in the issuance of 6.2
million shares on March 25, 1994. Without the effect of the share repurchases
during the first quarter, return on average common equity would have been 17.8
percent.

Nonperforming assets dropped to $217.7 million at March 31, 1994, a decrease
of $8.3 million, or 3.7 percent, from December 31, 1993, and $156.7 million, or
41.9 percent, from March 31, 1993, despite the addition of $29.3 million in
nonperforming assets with the acquisition of Boulevard Bancorp. The ratio of
the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans continues to indicate
very strong reserve coverage, increasing to 293 percent, from 269 percent at the
end of 1993 and 186 percent at March 31, 1993.

First Bank System's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, John F.
Grundhofer, said, "We are pleased to report the continuing trend of strong
quarterly operating results, reflecting higher fee income and lower operating
expenses. This quarter also marked our entry in the Chicago market with the
purchase of Boulevard Bancorp. We plan to convert Boulevard's systems in April,
which will allow us to begin selling First Bank products to consumers in the
Chicago area within a month of closing the transaction." Grundhofer added, "We
also are excited about the new First Bank System/Northwest Airlines WorldPerks
credit card program." On January 26, 1994, Northwest Airlines announced that it
had selected First Bank System to be its

bank credit card marketing partner. By the end of first quarter, First Bank
System had opened well over 100,000 WorldPerks customer accounts.

On March 25, 1994, First Bank System completed its previously announced
purchase of Boulevard Bancorp, Inc. of Chicago, a commercial bank holding
company with $1.6 billion in assets and $1.2 billion in deposits. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase, and therefore, had no significant
effect on first quarter earnings.

</TABLE>

First quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $285
million, an increase of $6.8 million, or 2.4 percent, from the first quarter of
1993. The improvement in net interest income reflects increases in loans and
noninterest-bearing deposits. Average loans for the first quarter totaled $18.0
billion, or 8.1 percent higher than the total of $16.7 billion in the first
quarter of last year, reflecting growth in loans to financial institutions and
small business and middle market loans, as well as home equity and second
mortgage loans. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased $1.1 billion, or
21.3 percent, over the same period. Approximately one-half of the increase in
average loans and three-quarters of the increase in noninterest-bearing 
<PAGE>

Page 4

deposits during the first quarter, as compared with the same period in 1993,
were attributable to cyclical activity in the Company's portfolio of secured
loans to mortgage banking firms and related escrow balances.

The net interest margin on a taxable-equivalent basis was 5.19 percent in the
first quarter of 1994, compared with 5.07 percent in the first quarter of 1993.
The 12 basis-point improvement was attributable primarily to a decrease in
funding costs.

First quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis decreased
$8.3 million, or 2.8 percent, from the fourth quarter of 1993, primarily the
result of lower average loans and noninterest-bearing deposits. Total average
loans decreased by $785 million from last quarter, reflecting a $1 billion
decline in the balances of loans to mortgage bankers and residential mortgage
loans held for sale. Partially offsetting this decrease were increases in
commercial loans, mainly in small business and middle marketing lending, and
home equity loans. The $1.1 billion, or 14.7 percent, decrease in the balance
of average noninterest-bearing deposits, this quarter compared to the fourth
quarter of 1993, was related in large part to the decrease in loans to finance
mortgage banking activities. Net interest margin in the first quarter of 1994
was 19 basis points higher than in the fourth quarter as a result of the effect
of fewer days in the quarter, as well as the decrease in lower margin loans to
mortgage bankers.

first quarter of 1993. Most of the increase occurred in credit card fees,
reflecting higher sales volume for Corporate Card, Procurement Card, and
merchant card processing. Trust fees for the quarter were up from the first
quarter of 1993 level as a result of increased corporate trust fee revenue.

First quarter noninterest expense was lower by $4.2 million, or 1.6 percent,
than in the first quarter of 1993. The decrease in expenses reflects the
benefits of integrating recent acquisitions.

Total salaries and benefits expense for the first quarter decreased by $6.4
million, or 5.1 percent, from that of the first quarter of 1993. Average full-
time equivalent employees decreased by 7.2 percent, to 11,815 in the first
quarter of 1994, from 12,735 in the first quarter of 1993. As compared to the
first quarter of 1993, first quarter net occupancy and equipment expense
decreased by $1.2 million, or 2.9 percent. Advertising expense increased $3.4
million, or 72.3 percent, over the 1993 level, reflecting expanded marketing
efforts in the growing consumer asset businesses.

First quarter provision for credit losses was lower by $14.1 million than in
the first quarter of 1993. Commercial loan net charge-offs for the quarter were
lower by $17.7 million, or 78.0 percent, and consumer loan net charge-offs were
essentially unchanged. The lower provision and net charge-offs for the quarter
resulted from improved credit quality.

end of the first quarter of 1994, compared with 269 percent at the end of 1993
and 186 percent at the end of the first quarter of 1993.

The acquisition of Boulevard Bancorp added $22.4 million to nonperforming loans
and $6.9 million to other real estate in the first quarter of 1994.

Significant decreases in the balance of nonperforming assets at March 31,
1994, as compared with the balance at March 31, 1993, occurred in the categories
of nonperforming HLT and commercial and financial loans and other real estate,
primarily the result of loan repayments and property sales. The increase in
nonperforming consumer loans over this period resulted from the purchase in the
third quarter of 1993 of $24 million of delinquent residential mortgages in
connection with a sale of mortgage loan servicing rights. These loans are
supported by government-sponsored mortgage insurance.

At March 31, 1994, the common-equity-to-assets ratio was 8.2 percent, higher
than the ratios of 7.5 percent at the end of 1993 and 7.7 percent at March 31,
1993, and above the regional bank peer group average of 7.2 percent at December
31, 1993. Shareholders' equity-to-assets at March 31, 1994 was 8.6 percent,
compared with 8.5 percent at December 31, 1993, 9.2 percent at March 31, 1993,
and a peer group average of 7.8 percent at December 31, 1993.
