DEBENTURE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

DEBENTURE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of January 11,
1994 (this "Agreement"), between ZENITH ELECTRONICS CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the Purchasers listed
on Schedule 1 hereto (the "Purchasers").

The Company and each Purchaser agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

AUTHORIZATION AND ISSUANCE OF DEBENTURES

1.1 AUTHORIZATION OF ISSUE. The Company will duly
authorize the issuance of its 8.5% Senior Subordinated
Convertible Debentures due January 18, 2001, in the aggregate
principal amount of $20,000,000. Each Debenture shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto. 

1.2 ISSUANCE OF DEBENTURES. (a) Purchase of
Debentures. Subject to the terms hereof, the Company agrees to
sell, and each Purchaser agrees to purchase, on the Closing Date
hereinafter referred to, Debentures in the aggregate principal
amount of Debentures set forth opposite such Purchaser's name in
Schedule 1 hereto at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, payable in immediately available funds. The
obligations of the Purchasers hereunder are several and not joint
and the Purchasers shall not have any obligation or liability for
the obligations or liabilities of any other Purchaser hereunder.

(b) Closing Date; Delivery of Debentures. The
date for the purchase and sale of Debentures hereunder (the
"Closing Date") shall be January 18, 1994. Purchase and sale of
the Debentures hereunder shall take place at 10:00 A.M., New York
City time, on the Closing Date, at the offices of Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, One New York Plaza, New York, New
York, or such other place as the parties hereto may designate. 
On the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to each Purchaser
against payment of the purchase price therefor, one or more
Debentures in the aggregate principal amount of Debentures then
to be purchased by such Purchaser, dated the Closing Date and
registered in such Purchaser's name or in the name of its
nominee.

1.3 SECURITIES LAWS. (a) The Company's
Representations and Agreements. The Company represents and
warrants to the Purchasers that the Company has not, directly or
through any agent, offered any of the Debentures or any similar
security for sale to, or solicited any offers to buy any thereof
from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof
with, any Person other than the Purchasers and not more than
twenty other institutional investors each of whom was offered a
portion of the Debentures or the Pari Passu Debentures in a
private sale for investment, and the Company agrees that neither
the Company nor any agent acting on the Company's behalf has done
or caused to be done or will do or cause to be done or omit to do
or cause to be done anything which would result in bringing the
issuance or sale of the Debentures within the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

(b) Each Purchaser's Representation. Each
Purchaser represents and warrants, and in entering into this
Agreement the Company understands, and acknowledges that (1) such
Purchaser is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of
Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act and (2) it is
acquiring the Debentures for its own account and not with a view
to distribution (as such term is used under Section 2(11) of the
Securities Act) thereof; provided that the disposition of each
Purchaser's property shall at all times be and remain within such
Purchaser's control. Without limiting the foregoing, each
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Debentures have not
and will not be registered under the Securities Act and it agrees
that it will reoffer or resell the Debentures or the Restricted
Shares purchased by it under this Agreement (i) only (A) to the
Company, (B) pursuant to any transaction under and meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A, as amended from time to time,
promulgated under the Securities Act, (C) pursuant to an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act in
accordance with Rule 144, as amended from time to time,
promulgated under the Securities Act or (D) in accordance with
any other available exemption from the requirements of Section 5
of the Securities Act, (ii) in accordance with any applicable
federal and state securities laws and (iii) in the case of
resales pursuant to subclauses (B), (C) or (D) of clause (i)
above, after delivering to the Company a completed and signed
Assignment Form attached to the Debenture (or equivalent form in
the case of Restricted Shares) or other documentation that
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company that
such transaction is exempt from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. Each Purchaser agrees that it will, and each
subsequent Holder, by its acceptance of a Debenture, will be
deemed to have agreed that it will, comply with, and notify any
purchaser of any 

Debenture or Restricted Share from you or such subsequent Holder,
as the case may be, of the resale restrictions referred to in
this Section 1.3(b). In addition, each Purchaser represents and
warrants, and each subsequent Holder by its acceptance of a
Debenture will be deemed to have represented and warranted, that
the acquisition of the Debenture or Debentures by such Person
does not constitute a "prohibited transaction" within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA. Each
Purchaser further represents and warrants, and each subsequent
Holder by its acceptance of a Debenture will be deemed to have
represented and warranted, that it will not have, immediately
after the acquisition of any Debentures, Beneficial Ownership,
directly or indirectly, of Common Stock of the Company
representing more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock of the
Company. For purposes of calculating such 5% ownership, (i) any
options, rights, stock subscription warrants or debt securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of
Common Stock of the Company owned or held by such Purchaser or
Holder shall be deemed to be that number of outstanding shares of
Common Stock for which they are convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable, but (ii) no shares of Common Stock issuable with
respect to outstanding options, rights, stock subscription
warrants or debt securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be
counted in calculating the total number of shares of outstanding
Common Stock.

ARTICLE II

Company has heretofore filed all reports, statements and
schedules with the Commission required to be filed pursuant to
the Exchange Act since January 1, 1988 (the "SEC Reports") and
has delivered to the Purchasers copies of all SEC Reports. The
SEC Reports did not (as of their respective filing dates) contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of the
Company included in the SEC Reports have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis 

(except as stated in such financial statements) and fairly
present the financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results
of their operations and consolidated cash flows for the periods
then ended, subject, in the case of the unaudited financial
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which were not

whole. The Company and the Subsidiaries have no material
liabilities, fixed or contingent, other than (i) liabilities
fully reflected in said financial statements and (ii) liabilities

Purchaser true, correct and complete copies of each instrument
which evidences, or will evidence on the Closing Date, any Debt
in excess of $5,000,000 of the Company or any Subsidiary and each
instrument under which any Debt in excess of $5,000,000 of the
Company or any Subsidiary is or will be issued or by which it is
or may be secured.

(e) No Material Adverse Change. Other than
changes reflected in the SEC Reports, there has been no material
adverse change in the business, properties, operations or
condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company since

basis.

2.7 LITIGATION. There is no action, suit or proceeding
pending against or, to the best of the Company's knowledge,

the other assets, reflected in the financial statements included
in the SEC Reports or subsequently acquired by the Company or any
Subsidiary other than that subsequently sold or otherwise
disposed of in the ordinary course of business, subject in each
case only to Liens permitted by Section 8.2.

2.9 LEASES. The Company and Subsidiaries enjoy
peaceful and undisturbed possession under all of the leases for
the use of personal property and real property under which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a lessee or is operating. All of
such leases are valid and subsisting, subject only to Liens
permitted by Section 8.2, and none of them is in default, except
for such defaults which do not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially and adversely affect the business, properties,
operations or condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company
and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

2.10 BURDENSOME AND CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS AND
VIOLATIONS OF CHARTER PROVISIONS. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is bound by any agreement or instrument or subject to
any charter or other corporate restriction which materially and
adversely affects the business, properties, operations or
condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company or the
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is (i) in
violation of its charter or by-laws or (ii) in default under or
in violation of any agreement or instrument by which it is bound,
or of any statute, law, rule or regulation, or of any judgment,
decree, writ, injunction, order or award of any arbitrator, court
or governmental authority applicable to it which, in any case
under clause (ii) would result, individually or collectively, in
any material adverse change in the business, properties,
operations or condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company
and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (other than the
effect under the Credit Agreement in connection with the
Company's fourth quarter 

special charge disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form
8-K dated December 15, 1993). Neither the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Debentures, the
consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated,
nor the fulfillment of or compliance with the terms hereof and
thereof, will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the
terms of the charter or by-laws or any other corporate
restriction, or of any statute, law, rule or regulation, or of
any judgment, decree, writ, injunction, order or award of any
arbitrator, court or governmental authority, or of any agreement
or instrument, which is applicable to the Company or any
Subsidiary or by which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound, or
constitute a default thereunder, or result in the imposition of
any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or
any Subsidiary.

2.11 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. The Company has obtained
or made all necessary (i) governmental consents, approvals and
authorizations, and registrations and filings with governmental
authorities and (ii) consents, approvals, waivers and
notifications of stockholders, creditors, lessors and other
non-governmental persons, in each case, in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Debentures and
the consummation of the transactions herein and therein
contemplated.

2.12 STATUS UNDER CERTAIN STATUTES. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary is: (i) a "public utility company" or
a "holding company", or an "affiliate" or a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of such a "subsidiary
company", as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended, or (ii) a "public utility" as
defined in the Federal Power Act, as amended, or (iii) an
"investment company" or an "affiliated person" thereof or an
"affiliated person" of any such "affiliated person", as such
terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.

2.13 COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA; MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS. 
Neither the acquisition of the Debentures by any Purchaser nor
the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is or will constitute a "prohibited transaction"
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of
ERISA. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains,
contributes to or is obligated to contribute to (or has in the
past maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute
to) any Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA for which the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate has, or may have any liability, contingent
or otherwise, other than a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001 of ERISA). 

Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
withdrawal liability (within the meaning of Section 4201 of
ERISA) to any "multiemployer plan" as that term is defined in
Section 4001 of ERISA, which liability has not been fully paid as
of the date hereof and neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate shall incur any withdrawal liability prior to the
Closing Date. If the Company and each ERISA Affiliate were to
incur a complete withdrawal (as described in Section 4203 of
ERISA) from all multiemployer plans as of the Closing Date, the
aggregate withdrawal liability, as determined under Section 4201
of ERISA, with respect to all such multiemployer plans would not
exceed $1,000,000.

2.14 COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. The Company
and the Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable
statutes, rules, regulations and orders of all governmental
authorities relating to environmental protection and pollution
control, with respect to the conduct of their respective
businesses and the ownership of their respective properties,
except where such failure to comply will not individually or in
the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the condition,
financial or otherwise, of the Company and the Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis.

2.15 RESERVATION OF SHARES. The shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Debentures have been duly
authorized and reserved for issuance upon such conversion free
from preemptive rights in favor of the holders of shares of
Capital Stock or other securities of the Company.

2.16 DISCLOSURE. This Agreement, the Debentures and
all other documents, certificates, instruments, reports and
statements furnished to the Purchasers by or on behalf of the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (including any placement memorandum or offering
circular), taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained herein and therein not
misleading. Other than facts relating to pending legislation or
general economic conditions, there is no fact known to the
executive officers of the Company which materially and adversely
affects, or which is reasonably likely to materially and
adversely affect during the six month period commencing on the
date hereof, the business, properties, operations or condition,
financial or otherwise, of the Company and the Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, which has not been set forth in this
Agreement, the Debentures or in the other documents, instruments,
certificates and statements previously furnished in writing to
each Purchaser or Purchasers' counsel by or on behalf of the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

2.17 BROKER'S OR FINDER'S COMMISSIONS. No broker's or
finder's placement fee or commission will be payable by the
Company with respect to the issue of the Debentures or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company will hold the
Purchasers harmless from any claim, demand or liability for
broker's or finder's placement fees or commissions whether or not
payable by the Company alleged to have been incurred in
connection with this transaction.

directly or indirectly, any "margin stock", as defined in

and 

(b) The Company does not intend to apply and will
not apply any part of the proceeds of the sale of the Debentures

ARTICLE V

REGISTRATION, EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER OF DEBENTURES

5.1 AUTHORIZED DENOMINATIONS. The Debentures are
issuable only in denominations of at least $100,000 (or, in the
case of any Debenture, the remaining balance thereof, if less
than $100,000).

5.2 THE DEBENTURE REGISTER; PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. The
Company shall maintain, at its office designated for notices in
accordance with Section 7.12, a register for the Debentures (the
"Debenture Register"), in which the Company shall record the name
and address of the Person in whose name each Debenture has been
issued and the name and address of each transferee and prior
owner of each Debenture. The Company may deem and treat the
Person in whose name a Debenture is so registered as the holder
and owner thereof for all purposes and shall not be affected by
any notice to the contrary, until due 

presentment of such Debenture for registration of transfer as
provided in this Article V.

5.3 ISSUANCE OF NEW DEBENTURES UPON EXCHANGE OR
TRANSFER. Upon registration of transfer of any Debenture at the
office of the Company designated for notices in accordance with
Section 7.12, the Company shall execute and deliver, at its
expense, one or more new Debentures of the same class of any
authorized denominations requested by the Holder of the
surrendered Debenture, each dated the date to which interest has
been paid on the Debenture so surrendered (or, if no interest has
been paid, the date of such surrendered Debenture), but in the
same aggregate unpaid principal amount as such surrendered
Debenture, and registered in the name of such Person or Persons
as shall be designated in writing by such Holder. Every
Debenture surrendered for registration of transfer shall be duly
endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
duly executed, by the Holder of such Debenture or by its attorney
duly authorized in writing. The Company may condition the
issuance of any new Debenture or Debentures in connection with a
transfer by any Person other than a Purchaser on the payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or other governmental
charge imposed in respect of such transfer.

5.4 LOST, STOLEN, DAMAGED AND DESTROYED DEBENTURES. At
the request of any Holder, the Company will issue, at its
expense, in replacement of any Debenture or Debentures lost,
stolen, damaged or destroyed, upon surrender of the mutilated
portions thereof, if any, a new Debenture or Debentures of the
same denominations, of the same unpaid principal amounts and
otherwise of the same class and tenor as, the Debenture or
Debentures so lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed. The Company
may condition the replacement of a Debenture reported by a Holder
as lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed upon the receipt from such
Holder of an indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, provided that if such Holder shall be any Purchaser or
its nominee or an institutional investor having assets in excess
of $100,000,000 or its nominee, such Purchaser's or such
institutional investor's agreement of indemnity shall be
sufficient for purposes of this Section 5.4.

ARTICLE VI

PAYMENT OF DEBENTURES

6.1 REGULAR METHOD OF PAYMENT. Except as provided in
Section 6.2, the principal of, and the premium, if any, and
interest on, each Debenture shall be payable at the office or 

agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 7.12, in
lawful money of the United States of America, against presentment
of such Debenture for notation of payment or, in the case of a
payment in full of such Debenture, against surrender thereof, at
the respective times and in the manner provided herein and in the
Debentures.

6.2 HOME OFFICE PAYMENT. So long as any Purchaser or
its nominee shall be a Holder, the Company will pay all sums
becoming due on each Debenture held by such Purchaser or such
nominee at the address of such Purchaser specified for such
purpose in Schedule 1 hereto, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, or at such other address or by such other method
as such Purchaser shall have designated by notice to the Company,
without presentment and without notations being made thereon,
except that any such Debenture so paid or prepaid in full shall
be surrendered to the Company for cancellation upon written
request by the Company therefor. Before selling or otherwise
transferring any such Debenture, such Purchaser will make a
notation thereon of the aggregate amount of all payments of
principal theretofore made, and of the date to which interest has
been paid. If the transferee of any Debenture is an
institutional investor having assets in excess of $100,000,000 or
its nominee and is the Holder of at least $5,000,000 principal
amount of Debentures, and shall request the Company to make all
payment on account of such Debenture either by check or by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, as specified in such
request, at an address specified in such request, the Company
will make such payments in compliance with such request, provided
that said institutional investor undertakes in said request the
same obligations in respect of such Debenture as those undertaken
by such Purchaser in the immediately preceding sentence.

6.3 LIMITATION ON INTEREST. No provision of this
Agreement or of any Debenture shall require the payment or permit
the collection of interest in excess of the maximum which is
permitted by law. If any such excess interest is provided for
herein or in any Debenture, or shall be adjudicated to be so
provided for, then the Company shall not be obligated to pay such
interest in excess of the maximum permitted by law, and the right
to demand payment of any such excess interest is hereby waived,
any other provisions in this Agreement or in any Debenture to the
contrary notwithstanding.

ARTICLE VII

AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

The Company covenants and agrees that, from the date
hereof until the Debentures have been paid in full in 

accordance with the terms thereof (and thereafter to the extent
provided in Section 7.7):

7.1 PRESERVATION OF FRANCHISES AND EXISTENCE. Except
as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, the Company will
(i) maintain its corporate existence, rights and franchises in
full force and effect, and (ii) cause the Subsidiaries to
maintain their respective corporate existences, rights and
franchises in full force and effect, provided that nothing in
this Section 7.1 shall prevent (x) any merger of a Subsidiary
into the Company or another Subsidiary or (y) the Company or any
Subsidiary from discontinuing any material operations in any
particular state or jurisdiction or at any particular location or
locations within the state or jurisdiction, or prevent the
corporate existence, rights and franchises of any Subsidiary from
being terminated if, in the opinion of the Board of Directors of
the Company, such discontinuance or termination will not
adversely affect the Holders or the business, properties,
operation or condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company
and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

7.2 INSURANCE. The Company will maintain or cause to
be maintained with respect to its properties and business and the
properties and businesses of the Subsidiaries, with financially
sound and reputable insurers, insurance against such casualties
and contingencies of such types and in such amounts as is
consistent with sound business practice.

7.3 PAYMENT OF TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES. The Company
will pay, and will cause each of the Subsidiaries to pay, when
due, (i) all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges or
levies imposed upon it or any of its properties or income, and
(ii) all claims or demands of materialmen, mechanics, carriers,
warehousemen, landlords and other like Persons which, if unpaid,
might result in the creation of a Lien upon any of its
properties, subject, in the case of any of the foregoing or any
Lien in respect thereof, to clause (a) of Section 8.2.

7.4 COMMISSION AND STOCK EXCHANGE FILINGS. Promptly
upon their becoming available, the Company will deliver to each
Holder a copy of (i) all regular or periodic reports, if any,
which the Company or any Subsidiary shall file with the
Commission or any national securities exchange, and (ii) all
reports, proxy statements and financial statements delivered or
sent by the Company to its stockholders or by any Subsidiary to
its stockholders other than the Company.

7.5 COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES. Within 50 days after the
close of each of the first three quarters of each fiscal 

year of the Company, and within 100 days after the close of each
fiscal year of the Company, the Company will deliver to each
Holder a certificate, signed by the Chairman, the President, a
Vice President, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the
Company, stating that a review of the activities of the Company
and the Subsidiaries during such quarter or such fiscal year, as
the case may be, has been made under such officer's supervision
and that no Event of Default or condition or event which, with
notice or lapse of time, would constitute an Event of Default has
occurred, or, if such has occurred, specifying the nature and
status thereof, and containing, as long as any Debenture remains
outstanding, a computation (in reasonable detail) demonstrating
compliance with the provisions of Article VIII. Within 15 days
after the Holder of at least $10,000,000 principal amount of
Debentures shall so request, the Company will execute and deliver
to such Holder a certificate, signed by the Chairman, the
President, a Vice President, the Treasurer or an Assistant
Treasurer of the Company, stating that this Agreement and every
Debenture held by or registered in the name of such Holder are
unmodified and in full effect (or, if there has been any
modification, that this Agreement and every such Debenture are in
full effect as modified, and setting forth such modifications),
and either stating that to the knowledge of the signer of such
certificate no default exists hereunder, or specifying each such
default of which the signer may have knowledge.

7.6 INSPECTION AND OTHER INFORMATION. Each Holder of
at least $10,000,000 principal amount of Debentures, and such
Persons as it may designate, may visit and inspect any of the
properties of the Company or any Subsidiaries, examine their
books of account, take extracts therefrom and discuss the
affairs, finances and accounts of the Company or such Subsidiary
with its officers and public accountants (and by this provision
the Company and each Subsidiary hereby authorize said accountants
to discuss with each Holder and such Persons its finances and
accounts), at such reasonable times during business hours and
with prior notice and as often as such Holder may reasonably
desire. The Company will furnish to each Holder such other
financial information as it from time to time may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
required to disclose to any Holder any information pursuant to
this Section 7.6 if such disclosure would result in a material
breach of a confidentiality agreement to which the Company or a
Subsidiary is a party.

Any information which is furnished pursuant to this
Section 7.6 and is designated in writing by the Company as
confidential shall be treated as confidential by each Holder in
accordance with such procedures as such Holder applies 

generally to information of this kind; provided, however, that
each such Holder may disclose any such information (a) as has
become generally available to the public (other than by an act of
a Holder in violation of this Agreement), (b) as may be required
in any report, statement or testimony required to be submitted to
any municipal, state or Federal regulatory body having or
claiming to have jurisdiction over any such Holder or to the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners or similar
organization or their successors, (c) as may be required in
response to any summons or subpoena or in connection with any
litigation, (d) to the extent that any such Holder believes it
appropriate in order to comply with any law, order, regulation or
ruling applicable to such Holder and (e) to the prospective
transferee in connection with any contemplated transfer of any of
the Debentures by such Holder. Prior to any disclosure by a
Holder to a prospective transferee pursuant to clause (e) above
(which is not an affiliate of such Holder) of any such
information designated in writing by the Company as confidential
which information has not become generally available to the
public through a disclosure by a Holder pursuant to clauses (a),
(b), (c) or (d) above, such Holder will cause such prospective
transferee to enter into an undertaking pursuant to which such
prospective transferee will agree to be bound by the
confidentiality provisions of this Section 7.6.

7.7 COST OF THIS FINANCING. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated:

(a) Payment of Fees and Expenses. The Company
will pay all costs and expenses of each Purchaser in connection
with this Agreement and the consummation of all transactions
contemplated hereby, all printing or reproduction expenses
relating to transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the
cost of transmitting the Debentures to such address as may be
requested by the Purchaser, and will pay (on the Closing Date)
the reasonable fees, expenses, and disbursements of Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, counsel to the Purchasers for their
services in connection therewith. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company agrees to pay the cost of obtaining a
private placement number for the Debentures and authorizes the
submission of such information as may be required by Standard and
Poor's Corporation for the purpose of obtaining such number.

The Company will also pay all costs and expenses of the
Purchasers and each other Holder relating to any future amendment
or supplement to this Agreement or any of the Debentures (or any
proposal for such amendment or supplement) 

requested by the Company whether or not consummated or any waiver
or consent with respect thereto (or any proposal for such waiver
or consent) whether or not consummated, including but not limited
to out-of-pocket expenses, the cost of all accounting services
required thereby, all printing or reproduction expenses relating
to transactions contemplated thereby, and the cost of
transmitting the Debentures to such address as may be requested
by the Purchasers or Holders, and will pay the reasonable fees,
expenses, and disbursements of counsel to the Purchasers and

however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one
such amendment, supplement, waiver or consent, be required to pay
the reasonable fees, expenses, and disbursements of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local

firm shall be designated by the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of Debentures.

costs and expenses of the character referred to in clause (a) of
this Section 7.7 which shall have been paid by any Purchaser or
any Holder.

indemnify each Purchaser and every other Holder of any of the
Debentures against all liability and loss with respect to (i) all
claims for fees or commissions of brokers or finders retained by

of this Agreement, any transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or the original issuance of the Debentures and
(ii) all taxes (other than transfer taxes) and other public
charges payable in connection with the issuance of any of the
Debentures, or the execution, delivery and enforcement of this
Agreement or amendment or supplement to this Agreement.

shall survive the payment, transfer or conversion of the
Debentures.

7.8 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Company will, and will
cause each Subsidiary to, comply with all applicable statutes,
rules, regulations and orders of all governmental authorities,
with respect to the conduct of its business and the ownership of

protection and pollution control, (ii) the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970, as amended, and (iii) ERISA, if failure

material adverse effect on the condition, 

financial or otherwise, of the Company and the Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis.

Company will keep proper books of record and account with respect

Company and its subsidiaries that are customarily provided by the
Company for reporting purposes, all in reasonable detail and
certified by an executive officer of the Company as presenting

firm of independent public accountants selected by the Company,
to the effect that the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the end of the
fiscal year being reported on in conformity with GAAP and that
the examination of such accountants in connection with such
financial statements has been conducted in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards and included such tests of
the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as said
accountants deemed necessary in the circumstances; provided that
so long as the Company is subject to the reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act, the Company may satisfy this requirement by
delivery of the Form 10-K filed by it with the Commission.

(c) Financial Reports. The provisions of
paragraphs (a) and (b) notwithstanding, promptly after the same

financial or other information as any holder of the Debentures or
Restricted Shares or any Person designated by such holder may
reasonably determine is required to permit such holder to comply

Securities Act in connection with the resale by it of the
Debentures or Restricted Shares, in any such case promptly after

the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any Plan;

ARTICLE VIII

NEGATIVE COVENANTS

The Company covenants and agrees that, so long as any of
the Debentures shall be outstanding:

8.1 LIMITATION ON DEBT. The Company will not, and will
not permit any Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume, suffer to
exist or otherwise become liable for, any Debt, except:

(a) Debt of the Company or any Subsidiary
outstanding on October 2, 1993;

(b) Debt under the Credit Agreement or under any
one or more extensions, renewals, replacements or refinancings
thereof; provided, that the aggregate principal amount of Debt
(or if any Debt is issued at a price less than the principal
amount thereof, the original issue price thereof) outstanding
pursuant to this clause (b) at any time shall not exceed
$110,000,000;

(c) Debt, not to exceed $55,000,000 in aggregate
principal amount, evidenced by the Pari Passu Debentures;

(d) Debt, not to exceed $20,000,000 in aggregate
principal amount, evidenced by Debentures delivered under this
Agreement;

(e) Debt which either (i) ranks subordinate in
right of payment to the Debentures (to at least the same extent
as the Debentures are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness) and
which by its terms, upon the happening of any event, or otherwise
(other than as a result of a default or event of default), does
not mature and is not required to be redeemed, and is not
redeemable at the option of the holder, in whole or in part,
prior to the first anniversary of the Stated Maturity of the
Debentures, or (ii) is secured by a Lien permitted by Section
8.2; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of
Debt (or if any Debt is issued at a price less than the principal
amount thereof, the original issue price thereof) 

outstanding pursuant to this clause (e) at any time shall not
exceed $170,000,000, less the sum of (i) the amount by which the
aggregate principal amount of Debt outstanding pursuant to clause
(b) of this Section 8.1 (computed as provided in such clause)
exceeds $90,000,000 and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of
Debt outstanding pursuant to clause (d) of this Section 8.1;
provided, further, that up to $20,000,000 (less the aggregate
principal amount of Debt outstanding pursuant to clause (d) of
this Section 8.1) of the Debt outstanding pursuant to this clause
(e) may rank pari passu in right of payment with the Debentures
if, by its terms, upon the happening of an event, or otherwise
(other than as a result of a default or event of default), it
does not mature and is not required to be redeemed, and is not
redeemable at the option of the holder, in whole or in part,
prior to the Stated Maturity of the Debentures (other than
pursuant to provisions which are substantially similar to
Sections 8.4 and 8.5 hereof); and

(f) Debt of any Subsidiary to the Company or another
Subsidiary or Debt of the Company to any Subsidiary.

For purposes of this Section 8.1, (x) Debt of a Person
existing at the time such Person becomes a Subsidiary shall be
deemed to be Debt incurred by a Subsidiary and (y) Debt assumed
by the Company or a Subsidiary in connection with the acquisition
of assets from a Person shall be deemed to be Debt incurred by
the Company or the Subsidiary, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may exchange
any Debt of the Company that by its terms ranks subordinate in
right of payment to the Debentures for securities which (i) by
their terms rank subordinate in right of payment to the
Debentures (to at least the same extent as the Debentures rank
subordinate to Senior Indebtedness), (ii) by their terms, upon
the happening of any event, or otherwise (other than as a result
of a default or event of default), do not mature and are not
required to be redeemed, in whole or in part, or are not
redeemable at the option of the holder thereof, in whole or in
part, prior to the first anniversary of the Stated Maturity of
the Debentures, and (iii) are issued in an aggregate principal
amount which does not exceed, at any one time outstanding,
$115,000,000; provided, however, that the Company and its
Subsidiaries may not otherwise make any principal payment on or
redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for
value, prior to any scheduled principal payment, scheduled
sinking fund payment or maturity, any Debt of the Company that by
its terms ranks subordinate in right of payment to the Debentures
or has a final maturity debt subsequent to the first anniversary
of the Stated Maturity of the Debentures.

8.2 LIMITATIONS ON LIENS. The Company will not, and
will not permit any Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or
suffer to exist any Lien of any kind upon any of their property
or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income on
profits therefrom, excluding, however, from the operation of the
foregoing:

(a) any Lien arising by reason of (1) any
judgment, decree or order of any court, so long as such Lien is
adequately bonded or the execution or other enforcement thereof
is effectively stayed, any appropriate legal proceedings which
may have been duly initiated for the review of such judgment,
decree or order shall not have been finally terminated or the
period within which such proceedings may be initiated shall not
have expired; (2) taxes, assessments and charges not yet
delinquent or which are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings, provided, that adequate reserves with

materialmen, laborers, carriers, lessors, landlords, employees or
suppliers or similar Persons, incurred in the ordinary course of
business for sums which are not yet delinquent or are being
contested in good faith by negotiations or by appropriate
proceedings which suspend the collection thereof;

(b) any Lien on accounts receivable and/or
inventory, and the related general intangibles, created to secure
financing obtained by the Company or any Subsidiary for working
capital purposes;

(c) any Liens outstanding on the date hereof, and

Subsidiary pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Credit
Agreement and one or more extensions, renewals, replacements or

(d) additional Liens which do not, individually or
in the aggregate, secure Debt which exceeds 25% of the Company's
GAAP Consolidated Adjusted Net Worth (measured at the time of
incurrence of any such Liens).

8.3 LIMITATION ON RESTRICTED PAYMENTS. The Company
will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly:

(a) declare or pay any dividend on, or make any
distribution in respect of, any shares of Capital Stock
(excluding dividends or distributions payable in shares of
Capital Stock, but including dividends or distributions payable
in Redeemable Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to
purchase Redeemable Stock (other than dividends on such
Redeemable Stock payable in shares of such Redeemable Stock)), or

(b) purchase, redeem, prepay or acquire or retire
for value, any Capital Stock (such payments or any other actions
described in clauses (a) and (b) above being collectively
referred to as "Restricted Payments"), unless at the time of and
after giving effect to the proposed Restricted Payment (the
amount of any such Restricted Payment, if other than cash, shall
be as determined by the Company's Board of Directors, whose
determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a resolution
of the Board of Directors) (i) no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the aggregate
amount of Restricted Payments made from and after the date hereof
does not exceed the sum of (a) 80% of the Company's cumulative

Consolidated Operating Net Income shall be a loss, minus 100% of
such loss) for the period commencing on the first day of the
fiscal quarter immediately subsequent to the fiscal quarter in
which the date of this Agreement occurs through and including the
last day of the last fiscal quarter immediately preceding the
date of the proposed Restricted Payment plus (b) the aggregate
net proceeds (including the value of any property other than
cash, as determined by the Company's Board of Directors, whose
determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a resolution
of the Board of Directors) received by the Company from the
issuance of any Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Stock or
Capital Stock issued to its Subsidiaries) during such period,
less the aggregate amount of proceeds used to prepay, defease,
purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire any securities
which by their terms rank subordinate in right of payment to the
Debentures.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any Subsidiary may
declare and pay dividends or make distributions to the Company,
(ii) the Company may redeem any rights (which by their terms are
not separately transferable until the happening of an event)
attached to shares of its Capital Stock in a total aggregate
amount not to exceed $5,000,000, (iii) the Company

acquire or retire shares of its Preferred Stock in exchange for
securities which by their terms rank subordinate in right of
payment to the Debentures and by their terms, upon the happening
of any event, or otherwise (other than as a result of a default
or an event of default), do not mature, are not required to be
redeemed, and are not redeemable at the option of the holder, in
whole or in part, prior to the first anniversary of the Stated
Maturity of the Debentures and (v) the Company may declare and
pay dividends on shares of its Preferred Stock which have been
exchanged for 6-1/4 Debentures in an aggregate annual amount
which does not exceed the aggregate annual amount of interest
that would have been payable on the 6-1/4 Debentures so
exchanged.

described in this Section 8.4.

8.5 ASSET SALE. (a) The Company will not, and will

Section 8.5 shall not be the Company) money in immediately
available funds in an amount sufficient to repay the Debentures,
if all then outstanding Debentures were tendered pursuant to the
Offer to Purchase, to be held for payment in accordance herewith. 
The proceeds may be invested in any Temporary Cash Investment the
maturity date of which shall not be later than the Expiration
Date. The Company shall be entitled to any interest or dividends
accrued, earned or paid on such Temporary Cash Investments,
unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing

the Business Day following the repurchase date, return such
excess to the Company.

(e) Upon the Expiration Date, the Company shall

the Paying Agent which are to be accepted for purchase, the
Company will also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that
such Debentures are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms of this Section 8.5. A Debenture
shall be deemed to have been accepted for purchase at the time
the Paying Agent, directly or through an agent, mails or delivers
payment therefor to the surrendering Holder.

applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in
connection with the repurchase of Debentures pursuant to this
Section. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section,
the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under this Section by virtue thereof.

(i) The Company will not, and will not permit any
Subsidiary to, create or permit to exist or become effective any
restriction (other than restrictions (i) in existence on the date
hereof created pursuant to the Company's 12-1/8% Notes due 1995
or (ii) created pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and any one or
subsequent renewals, extensions, refinancings or replacements of
the Credit Agreement) that would materially impair the ability of
the Company to make an Offer to Purchase or, if such offer is
made, to pay for Debentures tendered for purchase.

8.6 TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. The Company will
not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any
transaction or series of similar transactions (including, 

without limitation, the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with, or make any
payment or transfer to, any Affiliate (other than the Company or
wholly-owned Subsidiary), unless:

(a) such transaction (or series of related
transactions) is entered into in the ordinary course of business
and pursuant to the reasonable requirements of the Company's or
such Subsidiary's business; and

(b) such transaction or series of related
transactions are upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable
to the Company or such Subsidiary than the Company or such
Subsidiary would obtain in a comparable arm's-length transaction
from a Person who is not an Affiliate.

8.7 REPURCHASE OF DEBENTURES. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary thereof, directly or indirectly, shall repurchase
or make any offer to repurchase any Debenture unless the offer
has been made to repurchase Debentures, pro rata, from all
Holders of the Debentures at the same time and upon the same
terms. In case the Company or any Subsidiary thereof repurchases
any Debentures, such Debentures shall thereafter be cancelled and
no Debentures shall be issued in substitution therefor.

ARTICLE IX

EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

9.1 EVENT OF DEFAULT. Each of the following shall
constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement:

installment of interest upon any of the Debentures as and when
the same shall become due and payable, and continuance of such
default for a period of fifteen days; or

(b) The Company defaults in the payment of the
principal of, or premium, if any, on any of the Debentures as and
when the same shall become due and payable either at maturity or
in connection with any redemption, by declaration or otherwise;
or

(c) Any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement shall prove to have been untrue in any
material respect as of the date of this Agreement or the Company
fails duly to observe or perform any covenant contained in
Section 8.4 or 8.5; or

(d) The Company fails duly to observe or perform
any other of the covenants or agreements on the part of the
Company in the Debentures or in this Agreement (other than a
covenant or agreement a default in whose performance or whose
breach is elsewhere in this Section 9.1 specifically dealt with)
continuing for a period of 30 days after the date on which the
Company obtains knowledge of such failure irrespective of the
source; or

(e) An event of default, as defined in any
mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any Debt
of the Company or a Subsidiary (whether such Debt now exists or
shall hereafter be created or incurred) shall occur and shall (i)
consist of default in the payment of such Debt at the maturity
thereof or (ii) shall result in such Debt being declared due and
payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise become due
and payable, and such default in payment is not cured or such
acceleration shall not be rescinded or annulled prior to any
period of grace provided with respect thereto; provided that it
shall not be an Event of Default if the principal amount of Debt
which is not paid at maturity or the maturity of which is
accelerated is less than $5,000,000; and provided, further, that
if, prior to a declaration of acceleration of the maturity of the
Debentures or the entry of judgment in favor of the Holders in a
suit, such default shall be remedied or cured by the Company or
waived by the holders of such Debt, then the Event of Default
hereunder by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been
thereupon remedied, cured or waived without further action upon
the part of any of the holders of the Debentures; or

(f) A court having jurisdiction in the premises
shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the
Company in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or
appoint a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee,
sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company or of
substantially all of its property or winding-up or liquidation of
its affairs, and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and
in effect for a period of ninety consecutive days; or

(g) The Company shall commence a voluntary case
under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law
now or hereafter in effect or shall consent to the entry of an
order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or
shall consent to the appointment of or taking possession by a
receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator
(or similar official) of the Company or of substantially all of
its property, or shall make any general assignment for the
benefit of creditors; or

(h) A final judgment or judgments (after the
expiration of all times to appeal therefrom) for the payment of
money in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate during any
calendar year shall be rendered against the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company unless the same shall be (i) fully
covered by insurance and the insurer shall have accepted
liability therefor in writing or (ii) vacated, stayed, bonded,
paid or discharged within a period of 15 days from the date of
such judgment.

If an Event of Default shall be continuing, then and in
each and every such case, unless the principal of all of the
Debentures shall have already become due and payable, the Holders
of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures then outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to
the Company, may declare the principal, and all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, of all the Debentures to be due and
payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall
become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in this
Agreement or in the Debentures contained to the contrary
notwithstanding; provided, however, that if an Event of Default
under clause (f) or (g) above shall have occurred, the
outstanding principal of all of the Debentures, and all accrued
and unpaid interest thereon, shall immediately become due and
payable, anything in this Agreement or in the Debentures
contained to the contrary notwithstanding. This provision,
however, is subject to the condition that if, at any time after
the principal of the Debentures shall have been so declared due
and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of
the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter
provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Paying
Agent a sum sufficient to pay all accrued and unpaid installments
of interest upon all of the Debentures and the principal of and
premium, if any, on any and all Debentures which shall have
become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on
overdue installments of interest and premium, if any (to the
extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under
applicable law) and on such principal, to the date of such
payment or deposit), and any and all defaults under this
Agreement, other than the nonpayment of principal of and accrued
interest on Debentures which shall have become due by
acceleration, shall have been remedied -- then and in every such
case the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Debentures then outstanding, by written notice to the
Company, may waive all defaults and rescind and annul such
declaration and its consequences; but no such waiver of
rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any
subsequent default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. 
The foregoing is subject in its entirety to the subordination
provisions contained in Article XIII of this Agreement.

In case the Holders shall have proceeded to enforce any
right under this Agreement and such proceedings shall have been
discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment
or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely
to the Holders, then and in every such case the Company and the
Holders shall be restored respectively to their several positions
and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the
Company and the Holders shall continue as though no such
proceeding had been taken.

9.2 OTHER REMEDIES. If any Event of Default shall be
continuing, any Holder may enforce its rights by suit in equity,
by action at law, or by any other appropriate proceedings,
whether for the specific performance (to the extent permitted by
law) of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
in the Debentures or in aid of the exercise of any power granted
in this Agreement or in any of the Debentures, and may enforce
the payment of any Debenture held by such Holder and any of its
other legal or equitable rights.

9.3 CONDUCT NO WAIVER; COLLECTION EXPENSES. No course
of dealing on the part of any Holder, nor any delay or failure on
the part of any Holder to exercise any of its rights, shall
operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice such

ARTICLE XI

CONVERSION OF DEBENTURES

11.1 CONVERSION PRIVILEGE AND CONVERSION PRICE. 
Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this
Article, at the option of the Holder thereof, any Debenture or
any portion of the principal amount of any Debenture which is
payable at Stated Maturity or any portion thereof which equals
$1,000 or any integral multiple thereof may be converted at the
principal amount thereof, or of such portion thereof, into fully
paid and non-assessable shares (calculated as to each conversion
to the nearest 1/100 of a share) of Common Stock, at the
Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect
at the time of conversion by surrender of such Debenture, with
the notice of conversion affixed thereto, duly executed by such
Holder (specifying the portion of the principal amount thereof to
be converted in the case of a partial conversion), to the Company
at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to
Section 7.12 (or at such other office or agency as the Company
shall designate to the Holders from time to time). Such
conversion right shall expire at the close of business on January
17, 2001. In case a Debenture or portion thereof is called for
redemption, such conversion right in respect of the Debenture or
portion so called shall expire at the close of business on the
Redemption Date, unless the Company defaults in making the
payment due upon redemption.

The price at which shares of Common Stock shall be
delivered upon conversion (herein called the "Conversion Price")
shall be initially $10.00 in principal amount per share of Common
Stock. The Conversion Price shall be adjusted in certain
instances as provided in Section 11.4.

11.2 EXERCISE OF CONVERSION PRIVILEGE. In order to
exercise the conversion privilege, the Holder of any Debenture to
be converted shall surrender such Debenture, duly endorsed or
assigned to the Company or in blank, at any office or agency of
the Company maintained pursuant to Section 7.12, accompanied by
written notice to the Company in the form provided in the
Debenture (or such other notice as is acceptable to the Company)
at such office or agency that the Holder elects to convert such
Debenture or, if less than the entire principal amount thereof is
to be converted, the portion thereof to be converted. 

Within five days after the conversion of all or any part
of the unpaid principal amount of any Debenture, the Company will
pay to the Holder converting such Debenture all interest accrued
on such converted amount to and including the date of conversion,
without any adjustment of such interest in respect of any
dividend or other distribution payable on Common Stock issued
upon such conversion.

Debentures shall be deemed to have been converted
immediately prior to the close of business on the day of
surrender of such Debentures for conversion in accordance with
the foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of the
Holders of such Debentures as Holders shall cease, and the Person
or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the Holder or
Holders of such Common Stock as and after such time. As promptly
as practicable on or after the conversion date, the Company shall
issue and shall deliver at such office or agency a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion, together with payment in lieu of any
fraction of a share, as provided in Section 11.3.

In the case of any Debenture which is converted in part
only, upon such conversion the Company shall execute and and
deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a
new Debenture or Debentures of authorized denominations in
aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of
the principal amount of such Debenture.

So long as any rights pursuant to the Company's Rights
Agreement (the "Rights Agreement"), dated as of October 3, 1986,
between the Company and the First National Bank of Boston, as
amended, have not expired, been redeemed or otherwise terminated,
the Holder of any Debenture surrendered for conversion will be
entitled to receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion (the "Conversion Shares"), a number
of rights to be determined as follows: (i) if such conversion
occurs on or prior to the 

Distribution Date (as referred to in the Rights Agreement
pursuant to which the rights were issued), the same number of
rights to which a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the number of Conversion Shares is entitled at the time
of such conversion in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the Rights Agreement and applicable to the rights; and (ii) if
such conversion occurs after the Distribution Date, the same
number of rights to which a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which the principal amount of the Debenture so
converted was convertible immediately prior to the Distribution
Date would have been entitled on the Distribution Date in
accordance with the terms and provisions of the Rights Agreement
and applicable to the rights. The Conversion Price of the
Debentures will not be subject to adjustment on account of the
declaration, distribution or exercise of the rights. If the
Rights Agreement shall terminate in accordance with its terms and
the Company shall adopt a successor plan with substantially
similar terms which provide that the Common Stock issuable
hereunder is entitled to the benefits of such plan, the
provisions of this paragraph shall apply to such successor plan
as if it were the Rights Agreement.

11.3. FRACTIONS OF SHARES. No fractional shares of
Common Stock or scrip representing fractions of shares shall be
issued upon conversion of Debentures. If more than one Debenture
shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same
Holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon
conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures (or specified
portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional
share of Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable upon
conversion of any Debenture or Debentures (or specified portions
thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of
such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the
Closing Price at the close of business on the day of conversion
(or, if such day is not a Trading Day on the Trading Day
immediately preceding such day).

11.4. ADJUSTMENT OF CONVERSION PRICE. The Conversion
Price shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:

(a) In case the Company shall (i) pay a dividend
or make a distribution in shares of its Capital Stock
(whether shares of Common Stock or of Capital Stock of
any other class), (ii) subdivide its outstanding Common
Stock, or (iii) combine its outstanding Common Stock
into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so
that the Holder of any Debenture 

thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled
to receive the number of shares of Capital Stock of the
Company which such Holder would have owned or have been
entitled to receive after the happening of any of the 
events described above had such
Debenture been converted immediately prior to the 
happening of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to
this subsection (a) shall become effective immediately
after the record date in the case of a dividend and
shall become effective immediately after the effective
date in the case of a subdivision or combination. If, 
as a result of an adjustment made
pursuant to this subsection (a), the Holder of any
Debenture thereafter surrendered for conversion shall
become entitled to receive shares of two or more classes
of Capital Stock of the Company, the Board of Directors
(whose determination shall be conclusive and be
evidenced by a Board Resolution), shall determine the
allocation of the adjusted conversion price between or
among shares of such classes of Capital Stock.

(b) Except for distributions under the Rights
Agreement (or a successor plan) which shall be governed
by Section 11.2 of this Agreement, in case the Company
shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its
Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring
within 45 days after the record date mentioned below) to
subscribe for or purchase Common Stock at a price per
share less than the Current Market Price per share of
Common Stock (as defined in subsection (d) below) at the
record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior thereto
shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price
determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the date of issuance of such rights
or warrants by a fraction of which the numerator shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on
the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the
number of shares which the aggregate offering price of
the total number of shares so offered would purchase at
such Current Market Price, and of which the denominator
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or
warrants plus the number of additional shares of Common
Stock offered for subscription or purchase. Such
adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such
rights or warrants are issued, and 

shall become effective immediately after such record
date. In determining whether any rights or warrants
entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares
of Common Stock at less than such Current Market Price,
and in determining the aggregate offering price of such
shares, there shall be taken into account any
consideration received by the Company for such rights or
warrants, the value of such consideration, if other than
cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors (whose
determination shall be conclusive and be evidenced by a
Board Resolution).

(c) In case the Company shall distribute to all
holders of its Common Stock evidences of its
indebtedness or assets (excluding cash dividends or
distributions paid from retained earnings of the
Company) or rights or warrants to subscribe or purchase
(excluding those referred to in subsection (b) above),
then in each such case the Conversion Price shall be
adjusted so that the same shall equal the price
determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the date of such distribution by a
fraction of which the numerator shall be the Current
Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the record
date mentioned below less the then Fair Market Value (as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company,
whose determination shall be conclusive), of the portion
of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so
distributed or of such rights or warrants applicable to
one share of Common Stock, and the denominator shall be
the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock. 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after
the record date for the determination of shareholders
entitled to receive such distribution.

(d) For the purpose of any computation under
subsection (b) and (c) above, the Current Market Price
per share of Common Stock (the "Current Market Price")
at any date shall be deemed to be the average of the
last reported sale prices for the twenty consecutive
days (which are Trading Days as defined below) next
preceding the day in question. The last reported sale
price for each day shall be (i) the last reported sale
price of Common Stock on the National Market System of
NASDAQ, or any similar system of automated dissemination
of quotations of securities prices then in common use,
if so quoted, or (ii) if not quoted as described in
clause (i), the mean between the high bid and low asked
quotations for Common Stock as reported by the National
Quotation Bureau Incorporated if at least two securities
dealers have inserted both bid 

and asked quotations for such class of stock on at least
5 of the 10 preceding days, or (iii) if the Common Stock
is listed or admitted for trading on any national
securities exchange, the last sale price, or the closing
bid price if no sale occurred, of such class of stock on
the principal securities exchange on which such class of
stock is listed. If the Common Stock is quoted on a
national securities or central market system, in lieu of
a market or quotation system described above, the
closing price shall be determined in the manner set
forth in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence if bid
and asked quotations are reported but actual
transactions are not, and in the manner set forth in
clause (iii) of the preceding sentence if actual
transactions are reported. If none of the conditions
set forth above is met, the closing price of Common
Stock on any day or the average of such closing prices
for any period shall be the Fair Market Value of such
class of stock as determined by a member firm of the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. selected by the Company. As
used herein the term "Trading Days" with respect to
Common Stock means (i) if the Common Stock is quoted on
the National Market System of the NASDAQ or any similar
system of automated dissemination of quotations of
securities prices, days on which trades may be made on
such system or (ii) if the Common Stock is listed or
admitted for trading on any national securities
exchange, days on which such national securities
exchange is open for business.

(e) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be
required unless such adjustment would require an
increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price;
provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason
of this subsection (e) are not required to be made shall
be carried forward and taken into account in any
subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this
Article XI shall be made to the nearest cent or to the
nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be. 
Anything in this Section 11.4 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make
such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to
those required by this Section 11.4, as it in its
discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that
any stock dividends, subdivision of shares, distribution
of rights to purchase stock or securities, or
distribution of securities convertible into or
exchangeable for stock hereafter made by the Company to
its stockholders shall not be taxable.

(f) In any case in which this Section 11.4
provides that an adjustment shall become effective
immediately after a record date for any event, the
Company may defer until the occurrence of such event
(i) issuing to the Holder of any Debenture converted
after such date and before the occurrence of such event
the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such 
event over and above the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to
such adjustment and (ii) paying to such holder any
amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to
Section 11.3.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 11.4, no adjustment to the Conversion Price
shall result in zero or in a negative number or shall
reduce the conversion price below the then par value per
share of the Common Stock, and any such purported
adjustment shall instead reduce the Conversion Price to
such par value (unless the Common Stock then has no par
value in which case such purported adjustment shall
instead reduce the conversion price to $.01 per share). 
The Company hereby covenants not to take any action (i)
to increase the par value per share of the Common Stock
or (ii) that would or does result in any adjustment in
the Conversion Price that, if made without giving effect
to the previous sentence, would cause the Conversion
Price to be less than the then par value per share of
the Common Stock; provided, that the covenant in this
sentence shall be suspended if within 10 days of
determining in good faith that such action would result
in such adjustment (but not later than the Business Day
following the effectiveness of such adjustment), the
Company gives a notice under Section 14.3 and effects
the redemption referred to in such notice on the
Redemption Date referred to therein, but shall be
retroactively reinstated if such notice or redemption
does not occur.

11.5 NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENTS OF CONVERSION PRICE. 
Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as herein provided:

(a) the Company shall compute the adjusted
Conversion Price in accordance with Section 11.4 and shall
prepare a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer or
the Treasurer of the Company setting forth the adjusted
Conversion Price and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon
which such adjustment is based, and such certificate shall
forthwith be filed at each office or agency maintained for the 

purpose of conversion of Debentures pursuant to Section 11.1; and

(b) a notice stating that the Conversion Price has
been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price
shall forthwith be prepared, and as soon as practicable after it
is prepared, such notice shall be mailed by the Company to all
Holders at their last addresses as they shall appear in the
Debenture Register.

11.6 NOTICE OF CERTAIN CORPORATE ACTIONS. In case:

(a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any
other distribution) on its Common Stock payable otherwise than in
cash out of retained earnings; or

(b) the Company shall authorize the granting to
the holders of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to
subscribe for or purchase any shares of Capital Stock of any
class or of any other rights (excluding shares of Capital Stock
or options for Capital Stock issued pursuant to a benefit plan
for employees, officers or directors of the Company); or

(c) of any reclassification of the Common Stock
(other than a subdivision or combination of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock), or of any consolidation, merger or share
exchange to which the Company is a party and for which approval
of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or
transfer of the properties and assets of the Company
substantially as an entirety; or

(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up of the Company; then the Company shall
cause to be filed at each office or agency maintained pursuant to
Section 11.1, and shall cause to be mailed to all Holders at
their last addresses as they shall appear in the Debenture
Register, at least 21 days (or 10 days in any case specified in
clause (a) or (b) above) prior to the applicable record,
effective or expiration date hereinafter specified, a notice
stating (y) the date on which a record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution or granting of rights,
options or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date
as of which the holders of Common Stock of record who will be
entitled to such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants are
to be determined, or (z) the date on which such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become
effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders
of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of Common Stock for 

securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Neither the
failure to give any such notice or any defect therein shall
affect the legality or validity of any action described in
clauses (a) through (d) of this Section 11.6.

11.7 COMPANY TO RESERVE COMMON STOCK; LISTING. The
Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from
preemptive rights, out of the authorized but unissued Common
Stock or out of the Common Stock held in treasury, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of Debentures, the full
number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the
conversion of all outstanding Debentures. If and so long as any
shares of the Common Stock are listed on any national securities
exchange (as defined in the Exchange Act), the Company will, at
its expense, obtain and maintain the approval for listing on each
such exchange upon official notice of issuance of all shares of
the Common Stock receivable upon the conversion of the Debentures
at the time outstanding and maintain the listing of such shares
after their issuance; and the Company will so list on such
national securities exchange, will register under the Exchange
Act (and any similar state statute then in effect), and will
maintain such listing of, any other securities that at any time
are issuable upon conversion of the Debentures, if and at the
time that any securities of the same class shall be listed on
such national securities exchange by the Company.

11.8 TAXES ON CONVERSIONS. The Company will pay any
and all taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or
delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Debentures
pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to
pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a
name other than that of the Holder of the Debenture or Debentures
to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made
unless and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the
Company the amount of any such tax, or has established to the
satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.

11.9 COVENANT AS TO COMMON STOCK. The Company
covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued
upon conversion of Debentures will upon issue be validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and, except as provided in Section
11.8, the Company will pay all taxes, liens and charges with
respect to the issue thereof.

11.10 CANCELLATION OF CONVERTED DEBENTURES. All
Debentures delivered for conversion shall be delivered to the
Company to be cancelled by or at the direction of the Company.

11.11 PROVISIONS IN CASE OF RECLASSIFICATION,
CONSOLIDATION, MERGER OR SALE OF ASSETS. In case of any
reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Debentures, consolidation of the
Company with, or merger of the Company into, any other Person,
any merger or consolidation of another Person into the Company
(other than a merger which does not result in any
reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of
outstanding shares of Common Stock) or any conveyance, sale or
transfer of the properties and assets of the Company
substantially as an entirety, the Company or the Person formed by
such consolidation or resulting from such merger or which
acquires such assets of the Company, as the case may be, shall
execute and deliver to the Holders a written instrument providing
that the Holder of each Debenture then outstanding shall have the
right thereafter, during the period such Debenture shall be
convertible as specified in Section 11.1, to convert such
Debenture only into the kind and amount of securities, cash and
other property, if any, receivable upon such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale or transfer by a holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Debenture
could have been converted immediately prior to such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale or
transfer, assuming such holder of Common Stock (i) is not a
Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the
Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such
sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (a "Constituent
Person"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person, and
(ii) failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the
kind or amount of securities, cash or other property receivable
upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance,
sale or transfer (provided that if the kind or amount of
securities, cash and other property receivable upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale or
transfer is not the same for each share of Common Stock held
immediately prior to such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale or transfer by other than a Constituent Person or an
Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election
shall not have been exercised ("non-electing share"), then for
the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of securities,
cash and other property receivable upon such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale or transfer by each
non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so
receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). 
Such written instrument shall provide for adjustments which, for
events 

subsequent to the effective date of such written instrument,
shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the
adjustments provided for in this Article. The above provisions
of this Section shall similarly apply to successive
reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or transfers.

ARTICLE XII

REGISTRATION AND TRANSFER OF RESTRICTED SHARES

12.1 SHELF REGISTRATION. (a) Timing of Filing,
Effectiveness and Period of Usability. The Company shall prepare
and file within 30 days of the Closing Date, and thereafter shall
use its best efforts to cause to be declared effective as soon as
possible but in any event within 90 days of the Closing Date, a
"shelf" Registration Statement (the "Initial Shelf Registration")
on any appropriate form pursuant to Rule 415 (or similar rule
that may be adopted by the Commission) under the Securities Act
for all the Restricted Shares, which form shall be available for
the sale of the Restricted Shares in accordance with the intended
method or methods of distribution thereof. The Company agrees to
use its best efforts to keep the Registration Statement
continuously effective and usable for resale of Restricted Shares
until three years from the Closing Date or such shorter period
which will terminate when all the Restricted Shares covered by
such Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to such
Registration Statement or when all Restricted Shares otherwise
have been sold pursuant to Rule 144 or are freely tradeable (the
"Effectiveness Period"); provided, however, that the Company
shall have no obligation to maintain such Registration Statement
current and usable (although the Company shall be obligated to
maintain its effectiveness) at any time when the Conversion Price
is greater than the Current Market Price, unless any of the
Debentures have been previously converted pursuant to Article XI. 
The Company shall not permit any securities other than the
Restricted Shares (and any shares issuable upon conversion of the
Pari Passu Debentures) to be included in a Shelf Registration. 
Each Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees, and each subsequent
Holder by its acceptance of a Debenture will be deemed to have
covenanted and agreed, that it will provide, upon the request of
the Company from time to time, the information required pursuant
to Item 507 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act for use in
any Registration Statement relating to the Restricted Shares,
including, without limitation, the name of the beneficial and
record owner of the Debenture and the principal amount of
Debentures and Pari Passu Debentures held by such beneficial
owner.

(b) Subsequent Shelf Registrations. If the Initial
Shelf Registration or any Subsequent Shelf Registration ceases to
be effective for any reason at any time during the Effectiveness
Period (other than because of the sale of all of the securities
registered thereunder), the Company shall use its best efforts to
obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness thereof, and in any event shall within 45 days of
such cessation of effectiveness amend the Shelf Registration in a
manner reasonably expected to obtain the withdrawal of the order
suspending the effectiveness thereof, or file an additional
"shelf" Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415 covering all
of the Restricted Shares (a "Subsequent Shelf Registration"). If
a Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, the Company shall use
its best efforts to cause the Subsequent Shelf Registration to be
declared effective as soon as practicable after such filing and
to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective for a
period equal to the number of days in the Effectiveness Period
less the aggregate number of days during which the Initial Shelf
Registration or any Subsequent Shelf Registration was previously
continuously effective. As used herein the term "Shelf
Registration" means the Initial Shelf Registration and any
Subsequent Shelf Registration.

(c) Additional Interest for Liquidity. (1) In addition
to the interest required to be paid pursuant to the first
paragraph of the Debentures and clauses (2) and (3), if a Shelf
Registration is not effective for at least 270 days (whether or
not consecutive) during the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on July 18, 1995, then from July 18, 1995 through and
including January 17, 1996 interest shall accrue with respect to
the Debentures at the rate of one-sixteenth of one percent
(.0625%) per annum, which interest shall be payable by the
Company in cash directly to the Holders thereof on January 18,
1996, in the manner and subject to the same terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, as nearly as may be as though the
interest rate provided in the first paragraph of the Debentures
had been increased by one sixteenth of one percent (.0625%) per
annum.

(2) In addition to the interest required to be paid
pursuant to the first paragraph of the Debentures and clauses (1)
and (3), if a Shelf Registration is not effective for at least
540 days (whether or not consecutive) during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on July 18, 1996, then
from July 18, 1996 through and including January 17, 1997
interest shall accrue with respect to the Debentures at the rate
of one-sixteenth of one percent (.0625%) per annum, which
interest shall be payable by the Company in cash directly 

to the Holders thereof on January 18, 1997, in the manner and
subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, as nearly as may be as though the interest rate
provided in the first paragraph of the Debentures had been
increased by one sixteenth of one percent (.0625%) per annum.

(3) In addition to the interest required to be paid
pursuant to the first paragraph of the Debentures and clauses (1)
and (2), if a Shelf Registration is not effective for at least
810 days (whether or not consecutive) during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on July 18, 1997, then
from July 18, 1997 through and including January 17, 1998
interest shall accrue with respect to the Debentures at the rate
of one-sixteenth of one percent (.0625%) per annum, which
interest shall be payable by the Company in cash directly to the
Holders thereof on January 18, 1998, in the manner and subject to
the same terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, as
nearly as may be as though the interest rate provided in the
first paragraph of the Debentures had been increased by one
sixteenth of one percent (.0625%) per annum.

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any day on
which the Shelf Registration is required to be usable pursuant to
Section 12.1 but is not so usable shall be deemed to be a day on
which the Shelf Registration was not effective for purposes of
computing the time periods in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this
Section (c).

(d) Expenses. The Company will pay all Registration
Expenses in connection with registrations pursuant to this
Section 12.1.

and (if requested by any such Person) confirm such advice in

(2) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration 
Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for

such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Restricted Shares by such seller;

(d) register or qualify such Restricted Shares covered
by such registration statement under such other securities or

time when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act within the appropriate period
mentioned in clause (a) of this Section 12.2, of the Company
becoming aware that the Prospectus included in such Registration
Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing, and
within five days prepare and furnish to all sellers a reasonable
number of copies of an amended or supplemental Prospectus as may
be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers
of such Restricted Shares, such Prospectus shall not include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances then existing provided that the Company shall have
no obligation to do so prior to the conversion of any of the
Debentures at any time when the Conversion Price is greater than
the Current Market Price;

(g) otherwise comply with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission, and make available to its security
holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement covering
the period of at least twelve months, but not more than eighteen
months, beginning with the first month after the effective date
of the registration statement, which earnings statement shall
satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and
Rule 158 thereunder;

(h) list such Restricted Shares on any securities
exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed, if such

transfer agent and registrar for such Restricted Shares covered
by such Registration Statement not later than the effective date

(i) cooperate with the sellers of Restricted Shares and
the managing underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely

(1) make such representations and warranties to the holders of
such Restricted Shares and the underwriters in form, substance
and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in
underwritten offerings and confirm the same if and when
requested; (2) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and
updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and
substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the managing
underwriters and the holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Restricted Shares being sold) addressed to each selling
holder and the underwriters, if any, covering the matters
customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten
offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested
by such holders and underwriters; (3) if an underwriting
agreement is entered into, the same shall set forth
indemnification provisions and procedures no less favorable than
those set forth in Section 12.3 hereof (or such other provisions
and procedures acceptable to the holders of a majority of the
Restricted Shares being sold) with respect to all parties to be
indemnified pursuant to such Section; and (4) the Company shall
deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably
requested by the holders of a majority of the Restricted Shares
being sold and the managing underwriters, if any, to evidence
compliance with clause (1) above and with any customary
conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or other
agreement entered into by the Company. The above shall be done
at each closing under such underwriting or similar agreement or
as and to the extent required thereunder;

(k) obtain a "cold comfort" letter or letters from the
Company's independent public accountants in customary form and
covering matters of the type customarily covered by "cold
comfort" letters as the sellers of more than 50% of such
Restricted Shares shall reasonably request; 

(l) make available for inspection by any seller of such
Restricted Shares covered by such Registration Statement, by any
underwriter participating in any disposition to be effected
pursuant to such Registration Statement and by any attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by any such seller or any such
underwriter, all pertinent financial and other records, pertinent
corporate documents and properties of the Company as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due
diligence responsibility, and cause all of the Company's
officers, directors and employees to supply all 

information reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter,
attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such
Registration Statement;

(m) use its best efforts to cause the Restricted Shares
covered by the Registration Statement to be rated with the
appropriate rating agencies, if so requested by Purchasers or the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Restricted Shares; and 

(n) obtain a CUSIP number for all Restricted Shares
(unless already obtained), not later than the Effective Date.

The Company may require each seller of Restricted Shares
as to which any registration is being effected to furnish the
Company such information regarding such seller from time to time
as may be required by the Securities Act.

Each holder of Restricted Shares agrees by acquisition
of such Restricted Shares that, upon receipt of any notice from
the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described
in clause (f) of this Section 12.2, such holder will forthwith
discontinue disposition of Restricted Shares pursuant to the
Registration Statement covering such Restricted Shares until such
holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by clause (f) of this Section 12.2, and,
if so directed by the Company, such holder will deliver to the
Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than
permanent file copies then in such holder's possession, of the
Prospectus covering such Restricted Shares current at the time of
receipt of the Company's notice.

12.3 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Indemnification by the
Company. In the event of any registration of any securities of
the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 12.1,
the Company agrees to (i) indemnify and hold harmless, to the
extent permitted by law, the seller of any Restricted Shares
covered by such registration statement, its directors and
officers and employees and agents and general and limited
partners (and the directors and officers thereof), each other
Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale
of such securities and their officers, directors and partners and
each other Person, if any, who controls such seller or any such
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any
and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several,
and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and
legal expenses) to which such seller, any such director or
officer or employee or agent or general or limited partner or any
such underwriter, officer, director, partner or controlling
person may become subject 

under the Securities Act, common law or otherwise, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or
proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
(aa) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which
such securities were registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary, final or summary Prospectus contained therein, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, or (bb) any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and (ii) reimburse such seller and each such
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner,
underwriter, officer, director, partner and controlling person
for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them
in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, liability, action or proceeding; provided, that the
Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding
in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in such Registration Statement or amendment
or supplement thereto or in any such preliminary, final or
summary Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company through an
instrument duly executed by such seller or any underwriter
specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation
thereof; and provided, further, that the Company will not be
required to indemnify any Person who participates as an
underwriter in the offering or sale of Restricted Shares or any
other Person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the
meaning of the Securities Act to the extent that any such loss,
claim, damage or liability for which indemnification is claimed
results from such underwriter's failure to send or give a copy of
the final Prospectus to the Person asserting an untrue statement
or an alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at
or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, if such
statement or omission was corrected in such final Prospectus and
the Company has previously furnished copies thereof to such
underwriter. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
such seller or any such director, officer, employee, agent,
general or limited partner, underwriter, officer, director,
partner or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of
such securities by such seller. This indemnity will be in
addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

(b) Indemnification by the Sellers. The Company may
require, as a condition to including any Restricted Shares in any
Registration Statement filed in accordance with this 

Article XII, that the Company shall have received an undertaking
reasonably satisfactory to it from the prospective seller of such
Restricted Shares or any underwriter, to indemnify and hold
harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth
in this Section 12.3(b)) the Company, any directors, officers,
employees, agents and other controlling persons thereof, and all
other prospective sellers with respect to any statement or
alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission from such
Registration Statement, any preliminary, final or summary
Prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement, if
such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company through an instrument duly
executed by such seller or underwriter specifically stating that
it is for use in the preparation of such Registration Statement,
preliminary, final or summary Prospectus or amendment or
supplement, or a document incorporated by reference into any of
the foregoing. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the Company or any of the prospective sellers or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents or controlling
persons and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such
seller.

(c) Notices of Claims. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party hereunder of written notice of the commencement
of any action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for
indemnification may be made pursuant to this Section 12.3, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the
latter of the commencement of such action; provided, that the
failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided
herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its
obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this Section 12.3
except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such
action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such
indemnified party's judgment a conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying parties exists in respect of such
claim, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in
and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified, to the extent that it may
wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
party and after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such
indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred in connection with the defense thereof; provided,
however, that such indemnified party shall have the right to
employ separate 

counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the
expense of such indemnified party unless (a) the indemnifying
party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (b) the
indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of
such action or proceeding and have failed to employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party in any such
action or proceeding, (c) such indemnified party shall have been
advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses
available to such indemnified party which are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying party or other
indemnified party or (d) a conflict or potential conflict exists
(based on advice of counsel to any such indemnified party)
between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in
which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying
party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the
expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such action or
proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party, it being
understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in
connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but
substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the
same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or
circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with
appropriate local counsel) at any time for such indemnified party
and any other indemnifying parties, which firm shall be
designated in writing by such indemnifying parties). Any such
fees and expenses payable by the indemnifying party shall be paid
to the indemnified party entitled thereto as incurred by such
indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable
for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected
without its written consent, but if settled with its written
consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any
such action or proceeding, the indemnifying party agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and
against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or
judgment. No indemnifying party will consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for
in this Section 12.3 is unavailable to an indemnified party under
Section 12.3(a) or Section 12.3(b) hereof (other than by reason
of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to
therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of 

indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, (i) in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault
of the Company on the one hand and each seller of Restricted
Shares on the other in connection with the statements or
omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or
liabilities, as well as the other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied
by the indemnifying party or the particular seller and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or
omission. The Company and the holders of Restricted Shares agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant
to this subsection (d) were to be determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not
take account of the equitable consideration referred to in the
first sentence of this subsection (d). The amount paid by an
indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection
(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending against any action or claim that is
the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the
provisions of this subsection (d), each seller of Restricted
Shares shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the amount by which the proceeds received by such seller from
sales of Restricted Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that
such seller has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall
be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(e) Rule 144 and Rule 144A Information. For so long as
the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
13 or 15 of the Exchange Act, the Company covenants that it will
file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities
Act and Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder. If the
Company is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section
13 or 15 of the Exchange Act, the Company also covenants that it
will provide the information required pursuant to Rule 144(c)(2)
and Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act upon the request of
any holder of Debentures 

or Restricted Shares which continue to be "restricted securities"
within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act and
it will take such further action as any holder of such Debenture
or Restricted Shares may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable such holder to sell its
Debentures or Restricted Shares without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided
by (a) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such rule may be
amended from time to time, (b) Rule 144A under the Securities
Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (c) any
similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission. 
Upon the request of any holder of Debentures or Restricted
Shares, the Company will deliver to such holder a written
statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

(f) Other Indemnification. Indemnification similar to
that specified in the preceding subdivisions of this Section 12.3
(with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Company
and each seller of Restricted Shares with respect to any required
registration or other qualification of securities under any
federal or state law or regulation or governmental authority
other than the Securities Act.

12.4 UNDERWRITTEN REGISTRATIONS. If any of the
Restricted Shares covered by a registration pursuant to Section
12.1 are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment
banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will
administer the offering will be selected by the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of such Restricted Shares
included in such offering; provided that such investment bankers
and managers must be reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

No Person may participate in any underwritten
registration hereunder unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such
Person's Restricted Shares on the basis provided in any
underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled
hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
underwriting agreements and other documents required under the
terms of such underwriting arrangements.

on such Subordinated Indebtedness); and

repayed in full as provided in clause (1) above, any payment or
distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character,
whether in cash, property or securities (excluding Permitted
Junior Securities), by set-off or otherwise, to which the Holders
would be entitled but for the provisions of this Article
(including any payment or other distribution which may be
received from the holders of Subordinated Indebtedness as a
result of any payment on such Subordinated Indebtedness) shall be
paid by the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making
such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a
receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, directly to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or
representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture
under which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior
Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably according to the
aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of the Senior
Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary
to make payment in full in cash or as acceptable to each holder
of Senior Indebtedness, in any other manner, of all Senior
Indebtedness remaining unpaid, after giving effect to any
concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness; and

foregoing provisions of this Section, the Holder of any Debenture
shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of the
Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or
securities, in respect of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on the Debentures before all Senior Indebtedness is paid
in full, then and in such event such payment or distribution
(excluding Permitted Junior Securities) (including any payment or
other distribution which may be received from the holders of
Subordinated Indebtedness as a result of any payment on such
Subordinated Indebtedness) shall be paid over or delivered
forthwith directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their
representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees
under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of
such Senior Indebtedness have been issued for application to the
payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the
extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full in cash
or, as acceptable to each holder of Senior Indebtedness, any
other manner, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or
distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness.

the Company with or into, another Person or the liquidation or
dissolution of the Company following the conveyance, transfer or
lease of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety
to another Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in
Article XVI shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding up,
liquidation, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of
creditors or marshaling of assets and liabilities of the Company
for the purposes of this Section if the Person formed by such
consolidation or the surviving entity of such merger or the
Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease such
properties and assets substantially as an entirety, as the case
may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger,
conveyance, transfer or lease, comply with the conditions set
forth in Article XVI.

13.3 SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT WHEN SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS IN
DEFAULT. (a) Unless Section 13.2 shall be applicable, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of a Payment Default, no
payment (other than any payments previously made pursuant to
Section 15.1 of this Agreement) or distribution of any assets of
the Company of any kind or character (excluding Permitted Junior
Securities) shall be made by the Company on account of principal
of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Debentures, or on
account of the purchase, redemption, defeasance (whether under
Section 15.1) or other acquisition of or in respect of the
Debentures unless and until such Payment Default shall have been
cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist or the Senior
Indebtedness shall have been discharged or paid in full in cash

Senior Indebtedness, after which the Company shall (subject to
the other provisions of this Article XIII) resume making any and
all required payments in respect of the Debentures, including any
missed payments.

(b) Unless Section 13.2 shall be applicable, upon
(1) the occurrence and during the continuance of a Non-payment
Default and (2) receipt by the Holders and the Company from a
representative of the holder of any Senior Indebtedness
(collectively a "Senior Representative") or the holder of any
Senior Indebtedness of written notice of such Non-payment
Default, no payment (other than any payments previously made
pursuant to Section 15.1 of this Agreement) or distribution of
any assets of the Company of any kind or character (excluding
Permitted Junior Securities) shall be made by the Company on
account of any principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the
Debentures, or on account of the purchase, redemption, defeasance
(whether under Section 15.1) or other acquisition of or in
respect of Debentures for a period ("Payment Blockage Period")
commencing on the date of receipt by the Holders of 

such notice and continuing until the earliest of (subject to any
blockage of payments that may then or thereafter be in effect
under subsection (a) of this Section 13.3) (x) 179 days after
receipt of such written notice by the Holders (provided that any
Senior Indebtedness as to which notice was given shall
theretofore have not been accelerated), (y) the date on which
such Non-payment Default is cured or waived or ceases to exist or
on which the Senior Indebtedness related thereto is discharged or
paid in full in cash, or in any other manner as acceptable to the
applicable holder of Senior Indebtedness or (z) the date on which
such Payment Blockage Period shall have been terminated by
written notice to the Company or the Holders from the Senior

Debentures, including any missed payments. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall a Payment
Blockage Period under this paragraph (b) extend beyond 179 days
from the date of the receipt by the Holders of the notice
referred to in clause (2) of this paragraph (b) (the "Initial
Blockage Period"). Any number of notices of Non-payment Defaults
may be given during the Initial Blockage Period; provided that
during any period of 365 consecutive days only one Payment
Blockage Period under this paragraph (b) may commence and the
duration of such period may not exceed 179 days. No Non-payment
Default with respect to Senior Indebtedness that existed or was
continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment
Blockage Period will be, or can be, made the basis for the
commencement of a second Payment Blockage Period, whether or not
within a period of 365 consecutive days, unless such Non-payment
Default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less
than 90 consecutive days. The Company shall deliver a notice to
the Holders promptly after the date on which any Non-payment
Default is cured or waived or ceases to exist or on which the
Senior Indebtedness related thereto is discharged or paid in full
in cash, or in any other manner as acceptable to each holder of
Senior Indebtedness.

(c) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall make any payment to the Holder of any Debenture
prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, then and
in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered
forthwith to a Senior Representative of the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall
direct.

13.4 SUBROGATION TO RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF SENIOR
INDEBTEDNESS. After the payment in full, in cash or, as
acceptable to each holder of Senior Indebtedness, in any other
manner of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Debentures
shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness to receive payments and distributions of cash,
property and securities applicable to the Senior Indebtedness
until the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
Debentures shall be paid in full. For purposes of such
subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of
Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which
the Holders of the Debentures would be entitled except for the
provisions of this Article, and no payments over pursuant to the
provisions of this Article to the holders of Senior Indebtedness
by Holders of the Debentures, shall, as among the Company, their
creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the
Holders of the Debentures, be deemed to be a payment or
distribution by the Company to or on account of the Senior
Indebtedness.

13.5 PROVISIONS SOLELY TO DEFINE RELATIVE RIGHTS. The
provisions of this Article are intended solely for the purpose of
defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Debentures on
the one hand and the holders of Senior Indebtedness on the other
hand. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this
Agreement or in the Debentures is intended to or shall
(a) impair, as among the Company and the Holders of the
Debentures, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the Debentures the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Debentures as
and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with
their terms; or (b) affect the relative rights of the Holders of
the Debentures and creditors of the Company other than the rights
of the Holders of the Debentures in relation to the rights of the
holders of Senior Indebtedness; or (c) prevent the Holder of any
Debenture from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by
applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the
rights under this Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness
(1) in any case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other
winding up, assignment for the benefit of creditors or other
marshaling of assets and liabilities of the Company referred to
in Section 13.2, to receive, pursuant to and in accordance with
such Section, cash, property and securities otherwise payable or
deliverable to such Holder, or (2) under the conditions specified
in Section 13.3, to prevent any payment prohibited by such
Section or enforce their rights pursuant to Section 13.3(c).

13.6 NO WAIVER OF SUBORDINATION PROVISIONS. (a) No
right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness
to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in
any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on
the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good
faith, by any such holder, or by any non-compliance by the Company 
with the terms, provisions and
covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof
any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Subsection
(a) of this Section, the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at
any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice
to the Holders of the Debentures, without incurring
responsibility to the Holders of the Debentures and without
impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article
or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Debentures to
the holders of Senior Indebtedness, amend, extend, refinance,
replace, restate, supplement or otherwise modify the Credit
Agreement, so long as the aggregate principal amount of Debt
outstanding pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (computed as provided in
such Section) at any time does not exceed $110,000,000, and,
including, without limitation, may also do any one or more of the
following: (1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or
extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior
Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any
agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding;
(2) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property
pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness;
(3) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection or
payment of Senior Indebtedness; and (4) exercise or refrain from
exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person;
provided, however, that in no event shall any such actions limit
the right of the Holders of the Debentures to take any action to
accelerate the maturity of the Debentures pursuant to Article IX
of this Agreement or to pursue any rights or remedies hereunder
or under applicable laws if the taking of such action does not
otherwise violate the terms of this Article, subject to the
rights under this Article, of the holders of Senior Indebtedness
to receive the cash, property or securities receivable upon the
exercise of such rights or remedies.

13.7 NOTICES. The Company shall provide the Holders
with prompt notice of any event known to the Company which would
prohibit the making of any payment of money to the Holders in
respect of the Debentures pursuant to the provisions of this
Article.

13.8 RELIANCE ON JUDICIAL ORDERS OR CERTIFICATES. Upon
any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to
in this Article, the Holders of the Debentures shall be entitled
to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of
competent jurisdiction in which such insolvency, bankruptcy,
receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding
up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a certificate of
the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee,
custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other
person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the
Holders of Debentures or a certificate of a Senior
Representative, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons
entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the
holders of Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the
Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or
amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent
thereto or to this Article, provided that the foregoing shall
apply only if such court has been fully apprised of the
provisions of this Article.

13.9 NO SUSPENSION OF REMEDIES. Nothing contained in
this Article shall limit the right of the Holders of Debentures
to take any action to accelerate the maturity of the Debentures
pursuant to Article IX of this Agreement or to pursue any rights
or remedies hereunder or under applicable law, subject to the
rights under this Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness
to receive the cash, property or securities receivable upon the
exercise of such rights or remedies.

13.10 REINSTATEMENT. The provisions of this Article
shall continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be,
if at any time any payment of the Senior Indebtedness is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any bank which is
party to the Credit Agreement or any other holder of Senior
Indebtedness upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of
the Company or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been
made.

13.11 AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLE XIII. No change,
modification or amendment of any provision of this Article shall
be effective against any holder of Senior Indebtedness that did
not consent to such change, modification or amendment.

ARTICLE XIV

REDEMPTION OF DEBENTURES

14.1. RIGHT OF REDEMPTION. The Debentures may be
redeemed at the election of the Company, as a whole or from time
to time in part, at any time on or after January 18, 1998, 

at the Redemption Prices specified in the form of Debenture
hereinafter set forth, together with accrued interest to the
Redemption Date.

14.2. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE. Redemption of
Debentures at the election of the Company or otherwise, as
permitted or required by any provision of this Agreement, shall
be made in accordance with such provision and this Article.

14.3. ELECTION TO REDEEM; NOTICE TO HOLDERS. The
election of the Company to redeem any Debentures pursuant to
Section 14.1 shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution. In case
of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all
of the Debentures, the Company shall, at least 30 days prior to
the Redemption Date fixed by the Company, notify the Holders of
such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Debentures to
be redeemed.

14.4. SELECTION BY THE COMPANY OF DEBENTURES TO BE
REDEEMED. If less than all the Debentures are to be redeemed,
the particular Debentures to be redeemed shall be selected not
more than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Company,
from the Debentures not previously called for redemption, by such
method as the Company shall deem fair and appropriate and which
may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal
to $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal
amount of Debentures of a denomination larger than $1,000.

If any Debenture selected for partial redemption is
converted in part before termination of the conversion right with
respect to the portion of the Debenture so selected, the
converted portion of such Debenture shall be deemed (so far as
may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Debentures
which have been converted during a selection of Debentures to be
redeemed shall be treated by the Company as outstanding for the
purpose of such selection.

The Company shall promptly notify the Holders in writing
of the Debentures selected for redemption and, in the case of any
Debentures selected for partial redemption, the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed.

For all purposes of this Agreement, unless the context
otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of
Debentures shall relate, in the case of any Debentures redeemed
or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal
amount of such Debentures which has been or is to be redeemed.

14.5. NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. Notice of redemption shall
be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less
than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to
each Holder to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the
Debenture Register.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date,

(2) the Redemption Price,

(3) if less than all the Debentures are
to be redeemed, the identification (and, in
the case of partial redemption of any Debentures, the 
principal amounts) of the
particular Debentures to be redeemed,

(4) that on the Redemption Date the
Redemption Price will become due and payable
upon each such Debenture to be redeemed and
that interest thereon will cease to accrue on
and after said date,

(5) the Conversion Price, the date on
which the right to convert the Debentures to
be redeemed will terminate and the place or
places where such Debentures may be
surrendered for conversion, and

(6) the place or places where such
Debentures are to be surrendered for payment
of the Redemption Price.

Notice of redemption of Debentures to be redeemed at the
election of the Company shall be given by the Company.

14.6. DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE. On or prior to any
Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent
(which for purposes of this Article shall not be the Company) an
amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and
accrued interest on, all the Debentures which are to be redeemed
on that date other than any Debentures called for redemption on
that date which have been converted prior to the date of such
deposit.

If any Debenture called for redemption is converted, any
money deposited with the Paying Agent for the redemption of such
Debenture shall be paid to the Company upon request by the
Company.

14.7. DEBENTURES PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE. Notice of
redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Debentures so to
be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable
at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after
such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the
Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Debentures shall
cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Debenture for
redemption in accordance with said notice, such Debenture shall
be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with
accrued interest to the Redemption Date.

If any Debenture called for redemption shall not be so
paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and
premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the
Redemption Date at the rate borne by the Debenture.

14.8. DEBENTURES REDEEMED IN PART. Any Debenture which
is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at an office
or agency of the Company designated by the Company in its notice
of redemption for that purpose (with, if the Company so requires,
due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder thereof
or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company
shall execute and deliver to the Holder of such Debenture without
service charge, a new Debenture or Debentures, of any authorized
denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal
amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the
principal of the Debenture so surrendered.

ARTICLE XV

SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE

15.1 COMPANY'S OPTION TO EFFECT DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT
DEFEASANCE. The Company may, at its option by Board Resolution,
at any time, with respect to the Debentures, elect to have either
Section 15.2 or Section 15.3 be applied to all of the outstanding
Debentures (the "Defeased Debentures"), upon compliance with the
conditions set forth below in this Article XV.

15.2 DEFEASANCE AND DISCHARGE. Upon the Company's
exercise under Section 15.1 of the option applicable to this
Section 15.2, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged
from its obligations with respect to the Defeased Debentures on
the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied
(hereinafter, "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such 

Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid
and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the
Defeased Debentures, which shall thereafter be deemed to be
"outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 15.5 and the other
Sections of this Agreement referred to in (a) and (b) below, and
to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Debentures
and this Agreement insofar as such Debentures are concerned (and
the Company shall execute proper instruments acknowledging
satisfaction and discharge of this Agreement), except for the
following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or
discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of Defeased
Debentures to receive solely from the trust fund described in
Section 15.4 and as more fully set forth in such Section,
payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and
interest on such Debentures when such payments are due, (b) the
Company's obligations with respect to any surviving rights of
conversion, registration of transfer or exchange of Debentures
herein expressly provided for. Subject to compliance with this
Article XV, the Company may exercise its option under this
Section 15.2 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option
under Section 15.3 with respect to the Debentures.

15.3 COVENANT DEFEASANCE. Upon the Company's exercise
under Section 15.1 of the option applicable to this Section 15.3,
the Company shall be released from its obligations under any
covenant or provision contained in Article VIII with respect to
the Defeased Debentures on and after the date the conditions set
forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"),
and the Defeased Debentures shall thereafter be deemed to be not
"outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent
or declaration or act of the Holders (and the consequences of any
thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to
be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder. For
this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect
to the Defeased Debentures, the Company may omit to comply with
and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or
limitation set forth in such Article, whether directly or
indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to such
Article or by reason of any reference in such Article to any
other provision herein or in any other document and such omission
to comply shall not constitute a default or an Event of Default
under Section 9.1(c) or (d), but, except as specified above and
in the following sentence, the remainder of this Agreement and
such Defeased Debentures shall be unaffected thereby.

15.4 CONDITIONS TO DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE. 
The following shall be the conditions to application of either
Section 15.2 or Section 15.3 to the Defeased Debentures:

(1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited
or caused to be deposited with the Paying Agent (which for
purposes of this Article shall not be the Company) as trust funds
in trust for the purpose of making the following payments,
specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to,
the benefit of the Holders of such Debentures, (a) money in an
amount, or (b) U.S. Government Obligations which through the
scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in
accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day
before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (c) a
combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
written certification thereof delivered to the Paying Agent, to
pay and discharge and which shall be applied by the Paying Agent
to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on the Defeased Debentures on the Stated Maturity of
such principal or installment of principal or interest on the day
on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and of such Debentures; provided that the
Paying Agent shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such
money or the proceeds of such U.S. Government Obligations to said
payments with respect to the Debentures. For this purpose, "U.S.
Government Obligations" means securities that are (i) direct
obligations of the United States of America for the timely
payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged or
(ii) obligations of a Person controlled or supervised by and
acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of
America the timely payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed
as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of
America, which, in either case, are not callable or redeemable at
the option of the issuer thereof, and shall also include a
depository receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section
3(a)(2) of the Securities Act), as custodian with respect to any
such U.S. Government Obligation or a specific payment of
principal of or interest on any such U.S. Government Obligation
held by such custodian for the account of the holder of such
depository receipt, provided that (except as required by law)
such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the
amount payable to the holder of such depository receipt from any
amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S.
Government Obligation or the specific payment of principal of or
interest on the U.S. Government Obligation evidenced by such
depository receipt.

(2) The Company has paid or caused to be paid all other
sums payable hereunder by the Company.

(3) No default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as
subsections 9.1(f) and (g) are concerned, at any time during the
period ending on the day after the expiration of the applicable
preference period set forth in Paragraph (8) below after the date
of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall
not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period).

(4) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not
result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default
under, this Agreement or any other material agreement or
instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is
bound.

(5) In the case of an election under Section 15.2,
either:
(A) all Debentures issued and delivered
(other than (i) Debentures which have been
destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been
replaced or paid as provided in Section 5.4
and (ii) Debentures for whose payment money has 
theretofore been deposited
in trust or segregated and held in trust by
the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement
and thereafter repaid to the Company or
discharged from such trust, as provided in
Section 15.5) have been delivered to the
Company for cancellation; or

(B) all such Debentures not theretofore
delivered to the Company for cancellation

(i) have become due and payable, or

(ii) will become due and payable at their 
Stated Maturity within one year, or

(iii) are to be called for redemption 
within one year under arrangements by 
the Company following the giving of a 
notice of redemption by the Company, or

(iv) are delivered to the Company for 
conversion in accordance with Article XI.

(6) In the case of an election under Section 15.2, the
Company shall have delivered to the Holders an Opinion of Counsel
stating that (x) the Company has received from, or there has been
published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (y) since
the date hereof, there has been a change in the applicable
Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and
based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the
outstanding Debentures will not recognize income, gain or loss
for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Defeasance
and will be subject to United States Federal income tax on the
same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Defeasance had not occurred.

(7) In the case of an election under Section 15.3, the
Company shall have delivered to the Holders an Opinion of Counsel
to the effect that the Holders of the outstanding Debentures will
not recognize income, gain or loss for United States Federal
income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and
will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred.

(8) The Company shall have delivered to the Holders, an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that after the day after the
expiry of an applicable preference period (the "applicable
preference period") after the deposit, the trust funds
established pursuant to this Article will not be subject to the
effect of any applicable Bankruptcy Laws. (For the limited
purpose of the Opinion of Counsel referred to in this clause (8),
such Opinion may contain an assumption that the conclusions
contained in a customary solvency letter by a nationally
recognized appraisal firm, dated as of the date of the deposit
and taking into account such deposit, are accurate as of such
date, provided that such solvency letter is also addressed and
delivered to the Holders.)

(9) The Company shall have delivered to the Holders an
Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit made by the
Company pursuant to its election under Section 15.2 or 15.3 was
not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders
over the other creditors of the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the
Company or others.

(10) The Company shall have delivered to the Holders an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent (other than conditions requiring
the passage of time) provided for relating to either 

the Defeasance under Section 15.2 or the Covenant Defeasance
under Section 15.3 (as the case may be) have been complied with
as contemplated by this Article XV. Opinions required to be
delivered under this Section may have qualifications customary
for opinions of the type required.

15.5 APPLICATION OF TRUST MONEY. All money deposited
with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Article XV shall be held
in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of
the Debentures and this Agreement, to the payment to the Persons
entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and
interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the
Paying Agent.

The Company shall pay and indemnify the Paying Agent
against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed
against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to
this Article XV or the principal and interest received in respect
thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law
is for the account of the Holders of the Defeased Debentures.

Anything in this Article XV to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Paying Agent shall deliver or pay to the
Company from time to time upon the written request of the Company
any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided
in this Article XV which, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
written certification thereof delivered to the Paying Agent, are
in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to
be deposited to effect an equivalent Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance.

15.6 REINSTATEMENT. If the Paying Agent is unable to
apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with
Section 15.2 or 15.3, as the case may be, by reason of any order
or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the
Company's obligations under this Agreement and the Debentures
shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred
pursuant to Section 15.2 or 15.3, as the case may be, until such
time as the Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or
U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 15.2 or
15.3, as the case may be; provided, however, that if the Company
makes any payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on
any Debenture following the reinstatement of its obligations, the
Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such
Debenture to receive such payment from the money held by the
Paying Agent.

ARTICLE XVI

CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, CONVEYANCE, SALE, TRANSFER OR LEASE

16.1 COMPANY MAY CONSOLIDATE, ETC., ONLY ON CERTAIN
TERMS. The Company shall not consolidate with or merge into any
other Person or convey, sell, transfer or lease its properties
and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, and the
Company shall not permit any Person to consolidate with or merge
into the Company or convey, sell, transfer or lease its

substantially as an entirety to any Person, the
Person formed by such consolidation or into which
the Company is merged or the Person which acquires
by conveyance, sale or transfer, or which leases,
the properties and assets of the Company
substantially as an entirety shall be a corporation, 
partnership or trust, shall be
organized and validly existing under the laws of
the United States of America, any State thereof or
the District of Columbia and shall expressly
assume, by a counterpart to this Agreement or an
agreement, executed and delivered to the Company,
in form satisfactory to the Company, the due and

by the Company or such Subsidiary at the time of
such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event 
which, after notice or lapse of time
or both, would become an Event of Default, shall
have happened and be continuing;

(3) if, as a result of any such consolidation
or merger or such conveyance, transfer or lease,
properties or assets of the Company would become
subject to a mortgage, pledge, lien, security
interest or other encumbrance which would not be
permitted by this Agreement, the Company or such
successor corporation or Person, as the case may
be, shall take such steps as shall be necessary
effectively to secure the Debentures (and if the
Company selects, any Debt ranking pari passu with 
the Debentures) equally and ratably with all Debt
secured thereby; and 

(4) the Company has delivered to the Holders
an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each stating that such consolidation, merger,
conveyance, transfer or lease and, if a counterpart
to this Agreement or an agreement is required in
connection with such transaction, such counterpart
or agreement complies with this Article and that
all conditions precedent herein provided for
relating to such transaction have been complied
with.

16.2 Successor Substituted.

Upon any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of
the Company into, any other Person or any conveyance, sale,
transfer or lease of the properties and assets of the Company
substantially as an entirety in accordance with Section 16.1, the
successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the
Company is merged or to which such conveyance, sale, transfer or
lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may
exercise every right and power of, the Company under this
Agreement with the same effect as if such successor Person had
been named as the Company herein, and thereafter, except in the
case of a lease, the predecessor Person shall be relieved of all
obligations and covenants under this Agreement and the
Debentures.

right of payment to the Debentures (to at least 
the same extent as the Debentures are 
subordinated to Senior Indebtedness) and which by 
its terms, upon the happening of any event, or 
otherwise (other than as a result of a default or 
event of default), does not mature and is not 
required to be redeemed, and is not redeemable at 
the option of the holder, in whole or in part,
