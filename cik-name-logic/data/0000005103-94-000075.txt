The Securities of this series are not redeemable prior to maturity.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the

percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time

American General Corporation
2929 Allen Parkway
Houston, Texas 77019

Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel for American General Corporation, a Texas
corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the proposed issuance and sale
by the Company of $100,000,000 principal amount of 7.70% Notes Due 1999 (the
"Notes") to be issued under an Indenture dated as of April 15, 1986, as
supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 31, 1987 (as
so supplemented, the "Indenture"), between you and The Bank of New York, as
trustee (the "Trustee"), pursuant to registration statements on Form S-3 (File
Nos. 33-19075 and 33-30693) (the "Registration Statements"), filed by the
Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 24, 1989, with
respect to $350,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Company's debt
securities.

For the purposes of this opinion, we have examined such certificates,
instruments and documents and reviewed such questions of law as we considered
necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.

Based on the foregoing examination and review, we hereby advise you
that, in our opinion, the Notes, when duly executed on your behalf and
authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered pursuant to the
Indenture, against payment of the authorized consideration to be received by
you therefor, will be duly authorized and validly issued and will constitute
valid and binding obligations of the Company entitling the holders of the
Notes to the benefits of the Indenture (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and similar laws and judicial decisions
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in
effect and to general equity principles).

We hereby consent to the incorporation by reference of this opinion as
an exhibit to the Registration Statements and to the references to us under
the "Legal Opinions" caption in the related Prospectus dated August 30, 1989
and Prospectus Supplement dated October 13, 1994. In giving this consent, we
do not hereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent
