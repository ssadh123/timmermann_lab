ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On October 9, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Corporation (Panhandle) and 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Panhandle entered into an Agreement and Plan of 
Merger with Associated Natural Gas Corporation (ANGC) that provides for the 
merger of the Panhandle subsidiary with and into ANGC. Under the terms 
of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of ANGC common stock will be 
converted into the right to receive between 1.5725 and 1.8750 shares of 
Panhandle common stock, depending on the average daily price of Panhandle 
common stock during a specified 15 day period prior to completion of the Merger.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following unaudited pro forma condensed financial information reflects
adjustments to the historical consolidated balance sheets and statements of
income of Panhandle and ANGC to give effect to the merger, using the pooling of
interests method of accounting for a business combination.

ANGC's consolidated financial statements are based on a fiscal year end of
September 30 as compared with Panhandle's fiscal year end of December 31. As a
result, the unaudited pro forma financial information combines different
calendar periods. The unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet as of
September 30, 1994 assumes that the merger occurred as of that date and reflects
the combination of the historical balance sheet of Panhandle as of September 30,
1994 with the historical balance sheet of ANGC as of June 30, 1994. The pro
forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma condensed financial information
give effect to the issuance of 25.8 million shares of Panhandle common stock as
of September 30, 1994, assuming an Exchange Ratio of 1.7105 (the Exchange Ratio
resulting from an average daily price of the Panhandle common stock of $22.80,
which is the midpoint of the price range of $20.80 and $24.80 for Panhandle
common stock used to determine the maximum and minimum Exchange Ratios of 1.8750
and 1.5725, respectively). The historical balance sheets of ANGC have been
restated to reflect ANGC's merger with Grand Valley Gas Company (Grand Valley) 
that was effective July 1, 1994 and was accounted for as a pooling of interests.

The unaudited pro forma condensed statements of income for the nine months
ended September 30, 1994 and September 30, 1993, and for the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 assume that the merger occurred as of 
January 1, 1991, and combine the historical results of operations of 
Panhandle for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and 
September 30, 1993, and the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 
1991 with the historical results of operations of ANGC for the nine 
months ended June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1993, and the years ended 
September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The historical results 
of operations for ANGC have been restated to reflect ANGC's merger 
with Grand Valley.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed financial information has been
prepared from, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Panhandle, included in
Panhandle's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1993 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1994,
and ANGC's historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, 
included herein . The following unaudited pro forma condensed statements of 
income are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would 
have occurred had the merger occurred on January 1, 1991, nor are they 
necessarily indicative of future operating results of the combined companies.

PANHANDLE EASTERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

On October 9, 1994, Panhandle and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Panhandle entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with ANGC that
provides for the merger of the Panhandle subsidiary with and into ANGC. Under
the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of ANGC common stock
will be converted into the right to receive between 1.5725 and 1.8750 shares of
Panhandle common stock, depending on the average daily price of Panhandle common
stock during a specified 15 day period prior to completion of the merger. The
business combination is to be accounted for using the pooling of interests
method of accounting for business combinations. Panhandle's fiscal year ends
December 31 and ANGC's fiscal year ends September 30. As disclosed in ANGC's
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this
Form 8-K, ANGC's historical amounts have been restated to reflect ANGC's merger
with Grand Valley that was effective July 1, 1994 and was accounted for as a
pooling of interests. Certain historical amounts presented in Panhandle's and
ANGC's Form 10-K's for their 1993 fiscal years and ANGC's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the third fiscal quarter of 1994 have been reclassified to
conform to the current reporting presentation.

2. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

(a) The adjustments to stockholders' equity as of September 30, 1994 give
effect to the issuance of 25.8 million shares of Panhandle common stock in
exchange for 15.1 million shares of ANGC common stock outstanding as of June 30,
1994 and give effect to the retirement of the ANGC common stock, assuming an
Exchange Ratio of 1.7105 (the Exchange Ratio resulting from an average daily
price of the Panhandle common stock of $22.80, which is the midpoint of the
price range of $20.80 and $24.80 for Panhandle common stock used to determine
the maximum and minimum Exchange Ratios of 1.8750 and 1.5725, respectively).

(b) Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical financial
information of Panhandle to conform with ANGC's presentation.

3. PRO FORMA EARNINGS PER SHARE

The pro forma average common shares outstanding have been computed by
adjusting the historical average common shares outstanding for Panhandle by the
pro forma effect of the shares assumed to be issued in exchange for the
outstanding ANGC common stock.

4. MERGER EXPENSES

The unaudited pro forma condensed financial information excludes
nonrecurring expenses incurred as a direct result of the merger transaction.
These expenses, which primarily consist of financial advisory, legal, accounting
and other professional fees, are expected to total approximately $10 million and
will be included in the consolidated statements of income of Panhandle and ANGC,
as appropriate, in the periods incurred.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Stockholders
Associated Natural Gas Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying supplemental consolidated balance sheets
of Associated Natural Gas Corporation (ANGC) and subsidiaries as of September
30, 1993 and 1992, and the related supplemental consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 30, 1993. These supplemental consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of ANGC's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these supplemental consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial
statements of Grand Valley Gas Company (Grand Valley). Grand Valley was merged
into a subsidiary of ANGC effective July 1, 1994. As described in note 1 to the
supplemental consolidated financial statements, the merger has been accounted
for as a pooling of interests and the supplemental financial statements give
retroactive effect to the merger. Grand Valley's assets constitute 11.4 percent
in 1993 and 7.5 percent in 1992 and Grand Valley's revenues constitute 18.1
percent in 1993, 17.5 percent in 1992 and 14.3 percent in 1991 of the related
consolidated totals. The Grand Valley financial statements were audited by other
auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion insofar as it
relates to the amounts included for Grand Valley, is based solely on the report
of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The supplemental consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect
to the merger with Grand Valley effective July 1, 1994. Generally accepted
accounting principles proscribe giving effect to a consummated business
combination accounted for by the pooling-of-interests method in financial
statements that do not include the date of consummation. These financial
statements do not extend through the date of consummation. However, they will
become the historical consolidated financial statements of ANGC and subsidiaries
after financial statements covering the date of consummation of the business
combination are issued.

In our opinion, the supplemental consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Associated Natural Gas Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1993 and
1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended September 30, 1993, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles applicable after financial statements
are issued for a period which includes the date of the business combination.

ASSOCIATED NATURAL GAS CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 1993, 1992 AND 1991

(1) ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Associated Natural Gas Corporation (the "Company") is engaged in the
business of purchasing, gathering, processing, transporting and marketing
natural gas, natural gas liquids ("NGLs") and crude oil to industrial end users,
local distribution companies, liquid petroleum gas wholesalers and retailers and
refiners. The Company currently owns and operates a significant complex of crude
oil, NGLs and natural gas gathering, processing/fractionation and transportation
facilities situated in major oil and natural gas-producing basins in the Rocky
Mountain, Mid Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States.

On June 30, 1994, the Company filed Articles of Merger, to be effective
July 1, 1994, in connection with the Merger between its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Associated Natural Gas, Inc. (ANGI) and Grand Valley Gas Company (Grand Valley),
with ANGI as the surviving entity. Grand Valley is a natural gas marketing
company with sales principally in the Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains,
Western Canada and California regions. Under the terms of the merger, the
Company exchanged 1,637,467 shares of its common stock for 100% of Grand
Valley's outstanding common stock. The acquisition has been accounted for under
the pooling of interests method and, accordingly, the Company's consolidated
financial statements have been restated to include the accounts of Grand Valley
for all periods presented. Grand Valley's consolidated financial statements
reported prior to the merger reflected a year end of May 31 as compared to the
Company's fiscal year end of September 30. As a result, the restated
consolidated balance sheets reflect the combination of the historical balance
sheets of the Company as of September 30 and the historical balance sheets of
Grand Valley as of May 31. The restated consolidated statements of operations
reflect the combination of Grand Valley's annual results of operations through
May 31 and the Company's annual results of operations through September 30.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents consist of the following:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
1993 1992
---------- ----------
<S> <C> <C>
Cash............................................... $21,277,579 $ 9,272,274

=========== ===========
</TABLE>

The portion of the cash balances in commodity futures margin accounts that
represents the minimum margin requirements for open futures positions is
reported as restricted cash.

(c) Natural Gas, Crude Oil and Petroleum Product Inventories

Inventories, consisting principally of natural gas (including pipeline
imbalances), crude oil and NGLs in pipeline and storage facilities, are recorded
at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method.

ASSOCIATED NATURAL GAS CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

(d) Property, Plant and Equipment

Natural gas and crude oil pipelines and natural gas processing facilities
are being depreciated using the straight-line method over a period between
fifteen and twenty-five years. Beginning in April 1992, the Company revised its
estimate of the useful lives of its natural gas processing facilities and its
larger diameter natural gas and crude oil pipelines. This revision resulted in
an increase in net income of approximately $2,000,000 ($.16 per share) for the
fiscal year ended September 30, 1992. Other equipment is depreciated using a
straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three to five years.

Included in the cost of the facilities are the direct salaries and related
overhead for the construction of natural gas and crude oil pipelines and natural
gas processing/fractionation facilities. The amounts capitalized are
approximately $4,316,000, $5,487,000 and $3,897,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991
respectively.

(e) Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Goodwill and other intangibles include the difference between the cost of
acquiring natural gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities and
amounts assigned to their tangible assets. Such amounts are generally being
amortized on a straight-line basis over fifteen years.

(f) Notes Receivable from Related Parties

During the year ended September 30, 1993, Grand Valley loaned $499,000 to
three officers and one key employee of Grand Valley in connection with the
exercise of certain stock options. The notes bear interest at an annual rate of
nine percent, are due at the earlier of 90 days after termination of employment
or January 15, 1995 and are secured by shares of the Company's common stock
owned by the officers and employee. The notes receivable are included in other
current assets on the accompanying balance sheet at September 30, 1993.

(g) Interest Costs

Interest cost is capitalized during the construction period of the
facilities. The Company incurred interest cost of approximately $13,713,000,
$12,770,000 and $8,961,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, of which
approximately $558,000, $330,000 and $415,000 was capitalized in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.

(h) Earnings Per Common Share

Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net earnings available to
common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
(14,627,681, 14,111,316 and 12,595,415 for the years ended September 30, 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively). Outstanding options to purchase common stock did
not have a material dilutive effect on the calculation of earnings per share for
any period presented.

(i) Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on the accrual basis for the sale of natural
gas and petroleum products and transportation revenue as natural gas and
petroleum products are delivered.

(j) Hedging Arrangements

The Company manages the risk associated with fluctuations in the price of
natural gas, NGLs and crude oil primarily through futures contracts and energy
swaps. Gains and losses from futures hedging transactions and energy swaps are
recognized in the period the corresponding sales or purchases are recorded.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

The Company has a Hedge Committee that reviews the Company's hedged
positions on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with the Company's hedging
policies, including the maximum amount of risk to be assumed in conjunction with
such hedging activity. The Company has adopted hedging policies whereby its net
futures positions subject to price risk are not to exceed a net of 100 (1 BCF),
100 (100,000 barrels) and 50 (50,000 barrels) contracts or positions for natural
gas, crude oil and propane, respectively, without the prior approval of the
Hedge Committee.

At September 30, 1993, the Company had 710 natural gas, 627 crude oil and
87 propane futures contracts outstanding, and when offset against long-term
commitments and physical inventory of crude oil, the Company's exposure to the
risk of price fluctuations is reduced to 36, 0 and 0 contracts or positions,
respectively. In addition, the Company is also exposed to credit risk in the
unlikely event the counterparty in all third party agreements were not able to
perform their contractual obligations.

(k) Reclassification

Certain amounts have been reclassified for comparability with the 1993
presentation.

(3) ACQUISITIONS

Centennial

Effective August 12, 1991 Grand Valley acquired all of the outstanding
shares of common stock of Centennial Natural Gas Corporation (Centennial) for
cash and notes totalling approximately $3.9 million. At the acquisition date,
Centennial held interests in four natural gas processing and/or gathering
facilities with aggregate throughput capacity of approximately 35 million cubic
feet per day. In conjunction with the acquisition, Grand Valley entered into
employment agreements with existing employees and consultants of Centennial, and
issued 7,500 shares and granted options to acquire up to an additional 31,500
common shares at an exercise price of $.05 per share to these individuals.
Deferred compensation expense of approximately $1,242,000 was recorded in
connection with the granting of these options. The expense related to the
deferred compensation is being recognized ratably as the employees and
consultants vest in the options and as restrictions lapse through 1995.

Burton Flats

Effective March 1, 1992 Grand Valley acquired for approximately $4.7
million the Burton Flats gas processing plant and associated gathering system
located in New Mexico. This system consists of 51 miles of pipeline and a 15,000
MCF per day natural gas processing facility.

Glenpool

Effective October 1, 1992, the Company purchased for approximately $8.0
million GPM Gas Corporation's Creek natural gas processing plant and associated
low pressure natural gas gathering system (the "Glenpool" system) located in
Creek, Muskogee, Okfuskee, Okmulgee, McIntosh, Tulsa and Wagoner Counties,
Oklahoma. This system consisted of a 25,000 MCF per day natural gas processing
plant and approximately 985 miles of natural gas gathering pipeline connected to
approximately 528 wells.

Osage

Effective December 1, 1992, the Company purchased for approximately $4.0
million, GPM Gas Corporation's Osage natural gas processing plant and associated

Evergreen

In June, 1993, the Company acquired for approximately $2.8 million a
natural gas gathering system located in the San Juan Basin in Rio Arriba County,
New Mexico from Evergreen Resources, Inc. This natural gas gathering system,
which was completed by the Company, consists of approximately 26 miles of
natural gas gathering pipeline delivering coal seam natural gas production into
an interstate pipeline.

Bayou South

In July 1993, the Company completed the purchase for approximately $3.0
million, Bayou South Gas Gathering Company's Haynesville/Dykesville natural gas
gathering assets and related facilities in Arkansas and Louisiana. This system
consisted of approximately 60 miles of natural gas gathering pipeline connected
to approximately 16 wells.

All of the Company's acquisitions have been accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations for each
acquisition have been included with those of the Company since the effective
date of the acquisition.

(c) Effective June 1, 1992, the Company entered into a $100 million Revolving
Credit Agreement ("Agreement") with certain commercial lending institutions and
Continental Bank N.A., as agent. The Agreement is a three-year unsecured
revolving credit facility which converts into a four-year senior unsecured term
loan. Upon conversion to a term loan, the loan is amortized in 16 equal
quarterly payments beginning August 1, 1995 with a maturity date of May 1, 1999.
The outstanding principal under the Agreement bears interest at an applicable
margin above the adjusted Eurodollar Rate or Base Rate (3.87% at September 30,

1993). A non-use fee, currently 3/8 of one percent per annum, is charged on the
unused portion of the Facility. At September 30, 1993, the unused committed
amount under the Agreement was approximately $54.3 million. Subsequent to
September 30, 1993, the Company borrowed $50 million under the Agreement to
finance certain acquisitions. The outstanding balance under the Agreement at
December 7, 1993 was $95 million. The Company's ability to borrow under the
Agreement is subject to certain covenants including covenants regarding tangible
net worth; ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current
liabilities; consolidated historical operating cash flow (as defined);
restricted payments (including dividends); permitted indebtedness and liens;
environmental provisions and information requirements. At September 30, 1993,
the Company was in compliance with the terms of its debt agreements.

(d) In December 1992, Grand Valley sold $10 million of convertible senior
subordinated notes in a private placement transaction. The notes bear interest
at a rate of 9% with interest payments due semiannually. Annual principal
payments of $1,250,000 begin on December 15, 1997 and continue through December
15, 2004. The notes are convertible at the option of the purchasers into an
aggregate of 240,964 shares of the Company's common stock. This conversion right
also contains various antidilution provisions, including an adjustment to the
conversion price of the Company's common stock if the Company issues shares at
less than the then current market price.

Grand Valley has a revolving credit agreement with First National Bank of
Boston that provides for a maximum commitment of $15 million. The line of credit
provides working capital funding capacity of $15 million and interim funding
capacity for capital expenditures of $10 million. Loans under the $10 million
commitment bear interest at the bank's base rate plus 3/4 percent. Loans under
the $5 million commitment bear interest at the bank's base rate plus one
percent. The bank's base rate at May 31, 1993 was 6%.

On November 15, 1993, the Company entered into a $20 million Line of Credit
("Line") with Continental Bank, N.A. that is due on March 31, 1994. The Line
bears interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus seven eighths of one percent or the
reference rate. At December 7, 1993, there were no outstanding borrowings under

(5) INCOME TAXES

Effective October 1, 1992 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" which prescribes the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Prior to that date, the Company accounted
for income taxes using Financial Accounting Standard No. 96, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." The change from Statement No. 96 to Statement No. 109 had no
income statement impact. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income
taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by
applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing
assets and liabilities. Under

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Statement 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Revenue
Reconciliation Act of 1993, as signed into law on August 10, 1993, increased to
35% the corporate tax rate on income in excess of $10 million. The effect of
this tax increase is included in the reconciliation below.

Income tax expense (benefit) consists of:

future income taxes, if any, through September 30, 2005. The Company also has an
alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $13,785,000, which
may be carried forward indefinitely.

During the year ended May 31, 1993, Grand Valley realized an income tax
benefit of approximately $2.7 million upon the lapsing of repurchase
restrictions on shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of certain
nonqualified stock options. The benefit has been recorded as a reduction in
income taxes payable and an increase in additional paid-in capital.

(6) LEASES

The Company leases office space, trucks and trailers under non-cancelable
operating leases expiring at various dates through 2003. Future minimum lease
payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of September 30, 1993 are

("Incentive Plan"). The Incentive Plan empowers the Company from time-to-time
during a period of ten years to grant to officers and other managerial,
administrative or professional employees of the Company awards of restricted

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

The Incentive Plan provides for an initial authorization of 925,000 shares
of common stock for issuance thereunder, plus an additional authorization of
one-half percent of the outstanding shares of common stock as of each succeeding
annual anniversary of the effective date of the Incentive Plan, to be divided
among the various Incentive Plan components as the Company shall determine,
except that a maximum of 500,000 shares shall be cumulatively available for
grant as incentive stock options (tax qualified options) during the life of the
Incentive Plan. Any unused portion of the shares added each anniversary date
shall be carried forward for grant and issuance in subsequent plan years and up
to one hundred percent of the subsequent year's added shares (based upon the
current plan year's allocation) may be borrowed for use in the current plan
year. Such maximum numbers as applied to the various components of the Incentive
Plan are subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of a reorganization,
stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, or
other recapitalization of the Company.

The Company also has a non-qualified stock option plan for directors that
authorizes the issuance of up to 50,000 shares of common stock.

ASSOCIATED NATURAL GAS CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

June 30, 1994
(Unaudited)

(1) Unaudited Interim Financial Information

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all
adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to reflect a
fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations of
Associated Natural Gas Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company) for the
interim periods presented. All adjustments, in the opinion of management, are
of a normal recurring nature.

Certain amounts have been reclassified for comparability with the 1994
presentation.

(2) Nature of Business

The Company is engaged in the business of purchasing, gathering,
transporting, processing and marketing natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs)
and crude oil to industrial end users, local distribution companies, liquid
petroleum gas wholesalers and retailers and refiners. The Company currently
owns and operates a significant complex of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas
gathering, processing/fractionation and transportation facilities situated in
major oil and natural gas-producing basins in the Rocky Mountain, Mid Continent
and Gulf Coast Regions of the United States.

(3) Merger with Grand Valley Gas Company

On June 30, 1994, the Company filed Articles of Merger, to be effective
July 1, 1994, in connection with the Merger between its wholly-owned subidiary,
Associated Natural Gas, Inc. (ANGI) and Grand Valley Gas Company (Grand
Valley), with ANGI as the surviving entity. The acquisition has been accounted
for under the pooling of interests method and, accordingly, the Company's
consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the accounts of
Grand Valley for all periods presented. Grand Valley is a natural gas marketing
company with sales principally in the Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains,
Western Canada and California regions. Under the terms of the merger, the
Company exchanged 1,637,467 shares of its common stock for 100% of Grand
Valley's outstanding common stock.

Grand Valley's consolidated financial statements reported prior to the
merger reflected a year end of May 31 as compared to the Company's fiscal year
end of September 30. As a result, the consolidated statements of operations
reflect the combination of Grand Valley's and the Company's quarterly results
through May 31, and June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Consequently, Grand
Valley's separate results of operations for the month of June 1994 and for the
three months ended August 31, 1993 are not reflected in the consolidated
statements of operations and have been charged directly to retained earnings as
of June 30, 1994. Grand Valley's net revenues, operating loss, and net loss
were approximately $104,683,000, ($264,000) and ($299,000), respectively, for
these four months.

<PAGE> 33
The table below sets forth the composition of unaudited combined net
revenues and net earnings (loss) for the pre-merger periods and combines the
Company's results of operations for the quarters ended December, March and June
with Grand Valley's results of operations for the quarters ended November,
February and May for the fiscal periods presented.

(4) Acquisitions

Effective November 1, 1993, the Company purchased four natural gas
gathering/transportation pipeline systems and certain contractual gas storage
rights from the former noteholders of Endevco, Inc. (Endevco) pursuant to
Endevco's Plan of Reorganization. The total purchase price consisted of
approximately $20.5 million in cash and 264,089 shares of the Company's common
stock. The acquisition included the 465 mile Mississippi Fuels intrastate gas
transportation system; the 63 mile Ada gas gathering system in Louisiana; the 7
mile Chalybeat Springs gas transportation system in Louisiana and Arkansas; the
12 mile Leaf River gas transportation system in Mississippi and storage rights
for up to 300,000 MMBTU in the Hattiesburg gas storage facility in Mississippi.
The Company transferred the assets of the Mississippi Fuels gas transportation
system to AIM Pipeline Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Associated Natural
Gas Corporation.

On November 9, 1993, the Company acquired from Dynamic Energy Resources, 
Inc. (Dynamic) the right, title and interest in a Gas Sale and Purchase
Agreement and related transportation rights by and between Dynamic and Oklahoma
Natural Gas Company. In addition, the Company and Dynamic entered into a gas
purchase and processing agreement whereby the Company processes Dynamic's gas,
through the Company's Milfay and/or Glenpool natural gas processing plants,
pursuant to a percentage-of-proceeds contract.

33
<PAGE> 34
On November 12, 1993, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
ATTCO NGL Pipeline Company, purchased for $22.5 million cash all of the
outstanding common stock of Dean Pipeline Company (Dean), an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Tenneco, Inc. The assets of Dean consist of approximately
264 miles of mainline NGLs transportation pipeline with approximately 54 miles
of supply laterals traversing the Gulf Coast of Texas. The pipeline has a
throughput capacity of 21,000 barrels per day and interconnects with
underground storage and fractionation facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Dean
has been merged into ATTCO NGL Pipeline Company.

Effective December 1, 1993, the Company purchased JN Exploration and
Production Limited Partnership's natural gas gathering/transportation system
located in Mississippi. This system consists of approximately 49 miles of
natural gas gathering pipeline connected to approximatley 19 wells and is
interconnected with the Company's AIM Pipeline gas transportation system
acquired from Endevco.

Effective February 1, 1994, the Company, through its wholly-owned
subsidiary ATTCO Pipeline Company, purchased Shell Pipeline Corporation's
Hope-Houston crude oil pipeline system in south Texas. This system consists of
approximately 165 miles of crude oil gathering and trunkline pipeline with an
interconnection to an Exxon pipeline. This pipeline moves approximately 9,000
barrels a day of crude oil through this system at its published tariff.

Effective March 1, 1994, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
Associated Louisiana Intrastate Pipeline Company, purchased from Gulf States
Pipeline Corporation the remaining outside owned 50% interest in the
Minden/Terryville natural gas pipeline system located in Louisiana. This system
is a 42 mile transmission pipeline with a throughput capacity of approximately
75,000 MCF per day that delivers residue gas from the tailgate of the Company's
Minden, Louisiana natural gas processing plant to two interstate and one
intrastate natural gas pipelines.

(5) Stock Transactions

On November 1, 1993, the Company issued 264,089 shares of common stock (at
a price of $37.919) as partial consideration for the acquisition of four
natural gas gathering/transportation systems from the former noteholders of
Endevco. On February 15, 1994, the Company granted 28,895 shares of four-year
vesting restricted common stock to key employees. Such shares on the date of
grant had a value of $36.25 per share.

During the nine months ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, the Company received
$540,304 and $892,505 respectively, under option agreements with employees for
the acquisition of 28,024 and 43,574 shares, respectively, of common stock at
various prices. On June 7, 1994, the Company declared a $.03 per share cash
dividend on its common stock payable on July 15, 1994 to the common
shareholders of record on June 30, 1994.

At the Company's annual stockholders' meeting, held February 10, 1994, the
stockholders approved a proposal for the Company to increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from 20 to 40 million and to reduce the par
value from $.10 to $.05 per share.

$239,130,000 163,000,000
============ ===========
</TABLE>

(a) On May 8, 1991, the Company completed a private placement of $100
million of senior unsecured notes with institutional investors. The 9.55% notes
are payable in four annual installments of $13,750,000 commencing April 30,
1996. The 9.90% notes are payable in four annual installments of $11,250,000
commencing April 30, 2000. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 30 and
October 31 of each year.

(b) On December 31, 1985, the Company issued to The Prudential Insurance
Company of America senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $12,000,000
bearing interest at 12.75% payable semiannually. The senior notes are unsecured
and are payable in three annual installments of $4,000,000 which commenced
December 31, 1993.

(c) On January 13, 1994 the Company closed on an amendment effective
December 31, 1993 to its Revolving Credit Agreement (Revolver) dated June 1,
1992 with certain commercial lending institutions and Continental Bank N.A., as
agent. The amendment expanded the committed amount of the Revolver from $100
million to $150 million subject to certain limitations based upon the total
debt of the Company. The Revolver will become a three-year unsecured term loan,
with quarterly principal payments equal to one twelfth of the balance
outstanding on May 1, 1996, due commencing on August 1, 1996 with a maturity
date of May 1, 1999. The outstanding principal under the facility and term loan
bears interest at the Revolver's applicable margin, currently .625%, above the
adjusted Eurodollar (LIBOR) Rate or at Base (Prime) Rate. The 30 day LIBOR rate
and Prime rate were 4.5625% and 7.25% at June 30, 1994, respectively. A non-use
fee, currently 1/4 of one percent per annum, is charged on the unused portion of
the facility. The Revolver contains certain covenants, including covenants
regarding net worth; current ratio; fixed charge coverage ratio; dividends; 
loans, advances and investments; permitted indebtedness; environmental 
provisions and information requirements. At June 30, 1994, the Company was in 
compliance with the terms of its debt agreements.

(d) On April 5, 1994, the Company closed on the sale of $40,000,000 of its
senior unsecured notes to Connecticut General Life Insurance Company. The notes
were sold at par, bear interest at the rate of 6.30% per annum and mature at
various dates beginning April 15, 1999 and ending April 15, 2003. The notes are
unsecured and contain certain terms and conditions which are substantially
equivalent to those in the Company's existing long-term indebtedness. Proceeds
from these notes were used by the Company to reduce its outstanding indebtedness
under its Revolver.

(e) In December 1992, ANGI's wholly-owned subsidiary, Grand Valley,
sold $10 million of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement
transaction. The notes as amended and assumed as part of the

35
<PAGE> 36
merger bear interest at a rate of 9% with interest payments due semiannually.
Annual principal payments of $1,250,000 begin on December 15, 1997 and continue
through December 15, 2004. The notes are convertible at the option of the
purchasers into an aggregate of 240,964 shares of the Company's common stock.
This conversion right also contains various antidilution provisions, including
an adjustment to the conversion price of the Company's common stock if the
Company issues shares at less than the then current market price.

On February 10, 1994 the Company entered into a $20 million Line of Credit
with Continental Bank, N.A. which expires on December 30, 1994. Interest on
borrowings is based on a quoted rate furnished by the bank for daily periods of
up to one week. The Company utilizes this facility for its intra-month working
capital needs.

The Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Grand Valley, has a
revolving credit agreement with First National Bank of Boston that provides for
a maximum commitment of $20 million. The line of credit provides working
capital funding capacity of $15 million and interim funding capacity for capital
expenditures of $5 million. Loans under the $15 million commitment bear
interest at the bank's base rate plus 3/4 percent. Loans under the $5 million 
commitment bear interest at the bank's base rate plus one percent. The bank's 
base rate at June 30, 1994 was 7.25% percent.

(7) Earnings Per Common Share

Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net earnings available
to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
The outstanding options to purchase common stock and the convertible senior
subordinated notes did not have a material dilutive effect on the calculation
of earnings per share for any period presented.

(8) Seasonality

The Company experiences significant seasonal changes in volumes, prices
and certain expenses; therefore, the results of operations for the three and
nine month periods ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Grand Valley Gas Company and Subsidiaries:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Grand Valley Gas Company
(a Utah corporation) and subsidiaries as of May 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 1993 (not presented
separately herein). These financial statements are the responsibility of Grand
Valley Gas Company and subsidiaries' management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above (not presented
separately herein) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Grand Valley Gas Company and subsidiaries as of May 31, 1993 and
1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended May 31, 1993 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.
