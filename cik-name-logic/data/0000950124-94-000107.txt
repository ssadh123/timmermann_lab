The Registrant held a special meeting (the "Special Meeting") of its
stockholders on December 31, 1993, at which the stockholders approved (i) the
terms of a transaction (the "Debt Conversion Transaction") whereby $75,000,000
in principal amount of indebtedness plus accrued, unpaid interest owed by the
Registrant and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Everest & Jennings, Inc. ("E&J
Inc."), to BIL (Far East Holdings) Limited or its affiliates (collectively
"BIL") is converted into shares of a new Series C Convertible Preferred Stock
and into shares of Common Stock and (ii) amendments to the Registrant's
Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized Common shares
from 25,000,000 to 120,000,000 (the "Common Stock Amendment") and to increase
the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock from 11,000,000 to
31,000,000 (the "Preferred Stock Amendment") (collectively the
"Recapitalization Proposals").

SUMMARY OF DEBT CONVERSION TRANSACTION

As of September 30, 1993, the Registrant, E&J Inc., Jennings Investment Co.
(a wholly-owned subsidiary of E&J Inc.) and BIL entered into a Debt Conversion
Agreement to provide for the conversion (the "Debt Conversion Transaction") of
approximately $75 million in principal and accrued, unpaid interest (the
"Converted BIL Debt"), owed by the Registrant and E&J Inc. to BIL. Pursuant to
the Debt Conversion Agreement, (a) the Registrant and E&J Inc. issued to BIL a
Convertible Promissory Note -- Common Stock (the "Common Stock Note") in the
initial principal amount of $45 million and a Convertible Promissory Note --
Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock Note") in the original principal amount
of $20 million; (b) BIL agreed to lend to E&J Inc. $5.7 million to allow E&J
Inc. the ability to repay the outstanding balance of cash advances owed by E&J
Inc. to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited ("HSBC") under
the terms of a Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of September 30, 1992, as
amended (the "Revolving Credit Agreement"), between E&J Inc. and HSBC; (c)
Brierley Investments Limited, an affiliate of BIL, agreed to guarantee a letter
of credit facility ("Letter of Credit Facility") between E&J Inc. and HSBC (or
an alternative commercial lending institution) in an amount not exceeding $6
million through and including June 30, 1995; (d) BIL, as guarantor of the
obligations of E&J Inc. under the Revolving Credit Agreement, agreed to an
amendment of the Revolving Credit Agreement whereby cash advances of up to $10
million were made available for E&J Inc.'s working capital needs; (e) the
Registrant and E&J Inc. agreed to indemnify (the "Indemnification Obligation")
BIL from and against any and all losses arising out of BIL's guarantee of the
Letter of Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Agreement; (f) BIL agreed to
lend to the Registrant and E&J Inc. up to $12.5 million pursuant to the terms
of a Revolving Promissory Note; (g) BIL and the Registrant and E&J Inc. entered
into a Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement") pursuant to which the
Registrant and E&J Inc. granted a security interest in all of their assets to
BIL to secure on a pari passu basis the obligations of the Registrant and E&J
Inc. to 

<PAGE> 3
BIL under the Common Stock Note, the Preferred Stock Note, the
Revolving Promissory Note and the Indemnification Obligation; and (h) the
Registrant and BIL entered into a Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to
which the Registrant granted to BIL registration rights with respect to shares
of Common Stock held as of the date of the Registration Rights Agreement and
shares of Common Stock obtained by BIL as a result of the conversion of the
Common Stock Note and Series C Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Promissory Stock Note.

BIL has agreed, upon stockholder approval of the Debt Conversion
Transaction and the Recapitalization Proposals, to advance to E&J Inc. $10
million to pay HSBC the cash advance made by it to E&J Inc. under the Revolving
Credit Agreement. Such advance by BIL to E&J Inc. will result in an increase
in the principal amount of the Common Stock Note from $45 million to $55
million.

The Common Stock Note matures on March 31, 1994, bears interest at the rate
of 8% per annum from and after March 31, 1994, and is secured by a lien on and
security interest in all assets of the Registrant and E&J Inc. on a pari passu
basis with the repayment and other obligations of the Registrant and E&J Inc.
under the Preferred Stock Note, the Revolving Promissory Note and the
Indemnification Obligation. The Common Stock Note is subordinated to all debt
borrowed by the Registrant or E&J Inc. from, or the payment of which has been
guaranteed by the Registrant or E&J Inc. to, HSBC, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, Congress Financial Corporation and any other financial institution
constituting a principal lender to the Registrant and/or E&J Inc.

The Common Stock Note is convertible into a number of shares of Common
stock equal to the outstanding principal balance of that Note at conversion
divided by a stated conversion price ($1.00 per share, subject to antidilution
adjustment). The Common Stock Note automatically will convert in full upon
satisfaction of all of the following conditions: (a) ratification of the Debt
Conversion Transaction by the stockholders of the Registrant; (b) approval and
adoption of the Common Stock Amendment and the Preferred Stock Amendment by the
stockholders of the Registrant; (c) the filing and effectiveness of an
amendment to the Registrant's Certificate of Incorporation to effect the Common
Stock Amendment and the Preferred Stock Amendment; (d) adoption by the Board of
Directors of resolutions to designate the Series C Preferred Stock and the
filing and effectiveness of a Certificate of Designations of the Series C
Preferred Stock (the "Series C Certificate of Designations"); (e) reservation
of a sufficient number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock for issuance on
conversion of the Preferred Stock Note; (f) reservation of a sufficient number
of Common shares for issuance on conversion of the Common Stock Note and the
Series C Preferred Stock issued on conversion of the Preferred Stock Note; and
(g) approval for listing on the American Stock Exchange of the Common shares
issuable on conversion of the Common Stock Note and the Series C Preferred
Stock issued on conversion of the Preferred Stock Note. The Common Stock Note
is not convertible until each of the foregoing conditions has been satisfied.

purchase or sinking fund provisions, terms of conversion, voting rights and
preemptive rights for each series of Preferred Stock.
