SALES AGENCY AGREEMENT
----------------------

August 19, 1994

KIDDER, PEABODY & CO. INCORPORATED, 
10 Hanover Square
New York, N.Y. 10005

Gentlemen:

Zenith Electronics Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), 
confirms its agreement with Kidder, Peabody & Co. Incorporated (the "Agent"), 
as follows:

1. Description of Securities. The Company proposes to issue and sell 
through the Agent, as exclusive sales agent, up to 600,000 shares (the "Maximum 
Amount") of common stock, $1.00 par value, for the per share purchase price as 
set forth in Section 3 hereof (the "Stock").

2. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company 
represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Agent that:

(a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 33-
52541) with respect to the Stock, including a form of prospectus, has been 
carefully prepared by the Company in conformity with the requirements of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and the rules and regulations ("Rules and 
Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") 
thereunder and filed with the Commission and has become effective. Such 
registration statement and prospectus may have been amended or 
supplemented prior to the date of this Agreement. Any such amendment or 
supplement was so prepared and filed, and any such amendment filed after the 
effective date of such registration statement has become effective. No stop 
order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement has been 
issued, and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened 
by the Commission. Copies of such registration statement and prospectus, any 
such amendment or supplement and all documents incorporated by reference 
therein that were filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this 
Agreement have been delivered to the Agent. Such registration statement, as 
it may have heretofore been amended, is referred to herein as the 
"Registration Statement," and the final form of prospectus included in the 
Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented from time to time, is 
referred to herein as the "Prospectus." Any reference herein to the 
Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement 
thereto shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated (or 
deemed to be incorporated) by reference therein, and any reference herein to 
the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the 
Registration Statement or Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include 
the filing after the execution hereof of any document with the Commission 
deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.

(b) Each part of the Registration Statement, when such part 
became or becomes effective, and the Prospectus and any amendment or 
supplement thereto, on the date of filing thereof with the Commission and at 
each Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), conformed or will conform in all 
material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Rules and 
Regulations; each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became 
or becomes effective, did not or will not contain an untrue statement of a 
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or 
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and the Prospectus 
and any amendment or supplement thereto, on the date of filing thereof with 
the Commission and at each Closing Date, did not or will not include an untrue 
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make 
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were 
made, not misleading; except that the foregoing shall not apply to statements 
in or omissions from any such document in reliance upon, and in conformity 
with, written information furnished to the Company by the Agent, specifically 
for use in the preparation thereof.

(c) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration 
Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, when 
they became or become effective under the Act or were or are filed with the 
Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange 
Act"), as the case may be, conformed or will conform in all material respects
with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the 
rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

(d) The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
together with the related notes and schedules, set forth or incorporated by 
reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus fairly present the 
financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows of the 
Company and its subsidiaries as of the dates indicated or for the periods 
therein specified in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
consistently applied throughout the periods involved (except as otherwise 
stated therein).

(e) The Company and each of its subsidiaries has been duly 
incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of 
its jurisdiction of incorporation, has full power and authority (corporate and 
other) to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and 
Prospectus and is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which
it owns or leases real property or in which the conduct of its business 
requires such qualification except where the failure to be so qualified, 
considering all such cases in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse 
effect on the business, properties, financial position or results of operations 
of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole; and all of the 
outstanding shares of capital stock of each such subsidiary have been duly 
authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and 
(except for directors' qualifying shares and except as otherwise stated 
in the Registration Statement) are owned beneficially by the Company subject 
to no security interest, other encumbrance or adverse claim.

(f) The outstanding shares of common stock of the Company and 
the Stock have been duly authorized and are, or when issued as contemplated 
hereby will be, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and conform, or 
when so issued will conform, to the description thereof in the Prospectus. The 
stockholders of the Company have no preemptive rights with respect to the 
Stock.

(g) Except as contemplated in the Prospectus, subsequent to the 
respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement 
and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has 
incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, or entered into 
any transactions, not in the ordinary course of business, that are material 
to the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, and there has not 
been on a consolidated basis, any material change in the capital stock, or any 
material increase in the short-term debt or long-term debt of the Company and 
its subsidiaries (other than advances under the credit agreement dated as of 
May 21, 1993, as it may be amended from time to time (the "Credit 
Agreement") to be used in the ordinary course of the Company's business), or 
any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective 
material adverse change, in the condition (financial or other), business, 
prospects, net worth or results of operations of the Company and its 
subsidiaries considered as a whole.

(h) Except as set forth in the Prospectus, there is not pending or, to 
the knowledge of the Company, threatened any action, suit or proceeding to 
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, before or by any court 
or governmental agency or body, that could reasonably be expected to result in 
any material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), business, 
prospects, net worth or results of operations of the Company and its 
subsidiaries considered as a whole or that could reasonably be expected to 
materially and adversely affect the properties or assets thereof considered as 
a whole.

(i) There are no contracts or documents of the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries that are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration 
Statement or to any of the documents incorporated by reference therein by the 
Act or the Exchange Act or by the rules and regulations of the Commission 
thereunder that have not been so filed.

(j) The performance of this Agreement, and the consummation of 
the transactions contemplated herein or therein will not result in a breach or 
violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, 
any statute, any agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or 
by which it is bound or to which any of the property of the Company is subject, 
the Company's charter or by-laws, or any order, rule or regulation of any court 
or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of
its properties; no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing 
with, any court or governmental agency or body is required for the 
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement, in connection with the issuance or sale of the Stock by the 
Company, except such as may be required by the listing of the Stock on the 
New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") or the Chicago Stock Exchange ("CSE") or 
under the Act or state securities or blue sky laws; and the Company has full 
power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Stock as contemplated 
by this Agreement, free of any preemptive rights.

3. Sale and Delivery of Securities. On the basis of the representations, 
warranties and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and 
conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell exclusively 
through Agent, and Agent agrees to sell, as exclusive sales agent for the 
Company, on a best efforts basis, up to the Maximum Amount of Stock on the 
terms set forth herein.

The Stock, up to the Maximum Amount, is to be sold between August 19, 1994 
and September 19, 1994 (the "Sale Period") at a per share price or prices to be
agreed upon in writing (or orally, promptly confirmed by telecopy) between the 
Company and the Agent immediately prior to effecting any sale of Stock (such 
per share purchase price with respect to any shares of Stock being sold is 
referred to herein as the "Per Share Purchase Price"). Subject to the terms 
and conditions hereof, the Agent shall use its best efforts to sell the Maximum 
Amount for the Per Share Purchase Price during the Sale Period. The Agent 
shall not sell the shares of Stock through or in connection with an "at the 
market offering" (as defined in Rule 415(a)(4)(iv) under the Act) on behalf 
of the Company including, without limitation, by means of ordinary brokers' 
transactions on any national securities exchange, including the NYSE, on 
which such shares of Stock are listed (provided, however, that the foregoing 
restriction shall not apply to up to 39,256 shares of Stock (i.e., the number
of shares registered under the Registration Statement and remaining within
the limitation specified in Rule 415(a)(4)(ii)), which shares may be 
purchased by the Agent for its own account and resold by Agent through 
transactions on a national securities exchange). Agent will notify the Company
of the identity of any purchaser that is purchasing more than 1% of the 
Company's outstanding shares of common stock during the Sale Period, and the 
Company shall reserve the right to refuse to sell Stock to such purchaser 
if such purchaser beneficially owns more than 5% of the Company's outstanding 
common stock. The Company acknowledges that Agent may act in the capacity 
of an agent for any purchaser of Stock.

The compensation to the Agent for any sales of Stock shall equal $0.1875 per 
share, multiplied by the number of shares of Stock sold (the "Sales 
Commission"). The net proceeds (the "Net Proceeds") to the Company shall 
equal (I) the number of shares of Stock sold, multiplied by the Per Share 
Purchase Price, minus (ii) the Sales Commission.

Settlement for sales of Stock will occur on the fifth business day following 
the date on which such sales are made (any such date being referred to as a " 
Closing Date"). Settlement for all shares shall be effective via the 
Depository Trust Corporation on a delivery-versus-payment basis.

At each such settlement, the Company shall affirm in writing each 
representation, warranty, covenant and other agreement contained in this 
Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees with Agent that within two (2) 
business days of a sale of Stock, the Company will file a Prospectus 
Supplement under Rule 424(b)(3) promulgated under the Act, which Prospectus 
Supplement will set forth the number of such shares of Stock sold through 
the Agent, the Net Proceeds to the Company and the compensation payable by 
the Company to the Agent with respect to such sales (all as provided in 
writing by the Agent for inclusion in each such Prospectus Supplement). The 
obligations of the Agent to sell the Stock shall be subject to the continuing
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein, to the 
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the continuing 
satisfaction of the additional conditions specified in Section 5(a) through 
(i) of this Agreement.

4. Covenants. The Company covenants and agrees with Agent that:

(a) During the period in which a prospectus relating to the Stock is 
required to be delivered under the Act, the Company will notify the Agent 
promptly of the time when any subsequent amendment to the Registration 
Statement has become effective or any subsequent supplement to the 
Prospectus has been filed and of any request by the Commission for any 
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for 
additional information; it will prepare and file with the Commission, promptly 
upon the Agent's request, any amendments or supplements to the Registration 
Statement or Prospectus that, in the Agent's reasonable opinion, may be 
necessary or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Stock by the 
Agent; it will file no amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or 
Prospectus (other than any prospectus supplement relating to the offering of 
other securities registered under the Registration Statement or any document 
required to be filed under the Exchange Act that upon filing is deemed to be 
incorporated by reference therein) to which the Agent shall reasonably object 
by notice to the Company after having been furnished a copy a reasonable 
time prior to the filing; and it will furnish to the Agent at or prior to the 
filing thereof a copy of any such prospectus supplement or any document that 
upon filing is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration 
Statement or Prospectus.

(b) The Company will advise the Agent, promptly after it shall 
receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance by the Commission 
of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, 
of the suspension of the qualification of the Stock for offering or sale in any 
jurisdiction, or of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any 
such purpose; and it will promptly use its best efforts to prevent the 
issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such a stop order 
should be issued. 

(c) Within the time during which a prospectus relating to the Stock 
is required to be delivered under the Act, the Company will comply as far as it 
is able with all requirements imposed upon it by the Act and by the Rules and 
Regulations, as from time to time in force, so far as necessary to permit the 
continuance of sales of or dealings in the Stock as contemplated by the 
provisions hereof and the Prospectus. If during such period any event occurs 
as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would 
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact 
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances 
then existing, not misleading, or if during such period it is necessary to 
amend or supplement the Registration Statement or Prospectus to comply with the 
Act, the Company will promptly notify the Agent and will amend or supplement 
the Registration Statement or Prospectus (at the expense of the Company) so 
as to correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance. 

(d) The Company will use its best efforts to qualify the Stock for 
sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as you reasonably 
designate and to continue such qualifications in effect so long as required 
for the distribution of the Stock, except that the Company shall not be 
required in connection therewith to qualify as a foreign corporation or 
to execute a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction. 

(e) The Company will furnish to the Agent copies of the Registration 
Statement, the Prospectus (including all documents incorporated by reference 
therein) and all amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement or 
Prospectus that are filed with the Commission during the period in which a 
prospectus relating to the Stock is required to be delivered under the Act 
(including all documents filed with the Commission during such period that are 
deemed to be incorporated by reference therein), in each case as soon as 
available and in such quantities as you may from time to time reasonably 
request, and will also furnish copies of the Prospectus to the NYSE in 
accordance with Rule 153 of the Rules and Regulations.

(f) The Company will make generally available to its security 
holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than 15 months after 
the end of the Company's current fiscal quarter, an earnings statement (which 
need not be audited) covering a 12-month period beginning after the date of 
effectiveness of the Registration Statement that shall satisfy the provisions 
of Section 11(a) of the Act.

(g) The Company, whether or not the transactions contemplated 
hereunder are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, will pay all 
expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder (including 
any exchange fees), will pay the expenses of printing all documents 
relating to the offering, and will reimburse the Agent for any expenses 
(including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by it in connection with 
the matters referred to in Section 4(d) hereof and the preparation of 
memoranda relating thereto and for any filing fee of the National Association 
of Securities Dealers, Inc. relating to the Stock. The Company shall not in 
any event be liable to the Agent for loss of anticipated profits from the 
transactions covered by this Agreement.

(h) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the 
Stock as set forth in the Prospectus.

(i) The Company will not, directly or indirectly, offer or sell, any 
shares of common stock (other than the Stock) or securities convertible into or 
exchangeable for, or any rights to purchase or acquire, common stock during 
the period ending on the final Closing Date for the sale of Stock hereunder (a) 
without giving you three business days' prior written notice specifying the 
nature of the proposed sale and the date of such proposed sale, or (b) if, 
following the receipt of such notice, you object to such sale in writing prior 
to the date specified in such notice as the date of such proposed sale; 
provided, however, that you may not object to or prohibit the Company from 
(i) issuing and/or selling shares of its common stock or warrants, options 
or other rights exercisable or convertible into shares of its common stock 
to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) issuing and/or selling 
shares of common stock pursuant to any employee stock option plan, stock 
ownership plan or dividend reinvestment plan of the Company now or 
hereinafter in effect, (iii) issuing and/or selling shares of common stock 
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for or rights to acquire 
common stock pursuant to a private placement, including, without limitation, 
pursuant to Rule 144A of the Act, (iv) issuing and selling common stock 
pursuant to its contractual obligations as in effect on the date hereof 
under the Zenith Stockholders Rights Plan, (v) issuing and contributing 
shares of common stock to the Zenith Hourly and Salaried Employees Profit 
Sharing and Retirement Plans, and (vi) issuing common stock issuable upon 
conversion of securities or the exercise of warrants, options or other rights 
in effect or outstanding on the date hereof.

(j) The Company will, at any time during the term of this 
Agreement, as supplemented from time to time, advise the Agent immediately 
after it shall have received notice or obtained knowledge thereof, of any 
information or fact that would alter or affect any opinion, certificate, letter 
and other document provided to the Agent pursuant to Section 5 herein.

5. Conditions of Agent's Obligations. The obligations of the Agent to sell 
the Stock as provided herein shall be subject to the accuracy, as of the date 
hereof, and as of each Closing Date contemplated under this Agreement, of the 
representations and warranties of the Company herein, to the performance by 
the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional 
conditions:

(a) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration 
Statement shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall 
have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Company or the Agent, 
threatened by the Commission, and any request of the Commission for 
additional information (to be included in the Registration Statement or the 
Prospectus or otherwise) shall have been complied with to your satisfaction.

(b) The Agent shall not have advised the Company that the 
Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement 
thereto, contains an untrue statement of fact that in your opinion is material, 
or omits to state a fact that in the Agent's opinion is material and is 
required to be stated therein or is necessary to make the statements therein 
not misleading.

(c) Except as contemplated in the Prospectus, subsequent to the 
respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement 
and the Prospectus, there shall not have been, on a consolidated basis, any 
material change in the capital stock or any material increase in short-term or 
long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries (other than advances under 
the Credit Agreement to be used in the ordinary course of the Company's 
business), or any material adverse change, or any development involving a 
prospective material adverse change, in the condition (financial or other), 
business, prospects, net worth or results of operations of the Company and its 
subsidiaries considered as a whole, or any change in the rating assigned to any 
securities of the Company by Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's or 
any similar national rating agency, that, in the Agent's judgment, makes it 
impractical or inadvisable to offer or deliver the Stock on the terms and in 
the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

(d) The Agent shall have received at the date of the commencement of 
the Sale Period hereunder (the "Commencement Date") and on the final Closing 
Date hereunder opinions of John Borst, Jr., Esq., general counsel for the 
Company or, if Mr. Borst is unavailable, David S. Levin, Esq., Secretary of 
the Company, dated as of the Commencement Date and dated as of the final 
Closing Date, respectively, to the effect that:

(i) The Company and each of its subsidiaries has been duly 
incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the 
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, has full corporate power and 
authority to conduct its business as described in the Registration 
Statement and Prospectus and is duly qualified to do business in each 
jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real property or in which the 
conduct of its business requires such qualification except where the 
failure to be so qualified, considering all such cases in the aggregate, 
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, 
business, properties, or results of operations of the Company and its 
subsidiaries considered as a whole; and all of the outstanding shares of 
capital stock of each of the Company's subsidiaries have been duly 
authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and 
(except for director's qualifying shares and except as otherwise stated in 
the Registration Statement) are owned beneficially by the Company 
subject to no security interest, other encumbrance or adverse claim;

(ii) All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the 
Company have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid 
and non-assessable; the shares of Stock have been duly and validly 
authorized, and, when issued and delivered to and paid for by the 
purchasers thereof pursuant to the Agreement, will be fully paid and 
nonassessable and conform to the description thereof in the Prospectus; 
and the stockholders of the Company have no preemptive rights with 
respect to the Stock;

(iii) To the best knowledge of such counsel no stop order 
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been 
issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or 
threatened by the Commission;

(iv) The Registration Statement, when it became effective, 
and the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, on the 
date of filing thereof with the Commission (and, if applicable, at each 
Closing Date on or prior to the date of the opinion), complied (in each 
case other than the financial statements, financial data, statistical data 
and supporting schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein 
as to which such counsel need express no opinion) as to form in all 
material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Rules and 
Regulations; and the documents incorporated by reference in the 
Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement 
thereto (other than the financial statements, financial data, statistical 
data and supporting schedules contained or incorporated by reference 
therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they 
became effective under the Act or were filed with the Commission under 
the Exchange Act, or at the time such document was amended subsequent 
to such filing, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material 
respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as 
applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;

(v) The description in the Registration Statement and 
Prospectus of statutes, legal and governmental proceedings, contracts 
and other documents are accurate and fairly present the information 
required to be shown; and such counsel do not know of any statutes or 
legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the 
Prospectus that are not described as required, or of any contracts or 
documents of a character required to be described in the Registration 
Statement or Prospectus (or required to be filed under the Exchange Act 
if upon such filing they would be incorporated by reference therein) or to 
be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described 
and filed as required; and

(vi) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and 
delivered by the Company; the performance of this Agreement and the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein by the Company 
will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions 
of, or constitute a default under, any statute, any agreement or 
instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by 
which it is bound or to which any of the property of the Company is 
subject, the Company's charter or by-laws, or any order, rule or 
regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency 
or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties; 
and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any 
court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation 
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with 
the issuance or sale of the Stock by the Company, except such as have 
been obtained under the Act and such as may be required by the listing 
of the Stock on the NYSE and the CSE or under state securities or blue 
sky laws in connection with the sale and distribution of the Stock by the 
Agent.

Such counsel shall also state that such counsel has participated in 
conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and 
representatives of the independent public accountants of the Company 
and representatives of Agent at which the contents of the Registration 
Statement, the Prospectus and any amendment thereof or supplement 
thereto and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel 
has not independently checked the accuracy or completeness of, or 
otherwise verified, and accordingly need not pass upon, and need not 
assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of 
the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the 
Prospectus or any amendment thereof or any supplement thereto, and 
that on the basis thereof and relying as to materiality to a large extent 
upon the judgment of officers and other representatives of the 
Company, nothing has come to such counsel's attention which causes 
such counsel to believe that either the Registration Statement (other 
than financial statements, financial data, statistical data and supporting 
schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which 
such counsel need express no belief) when Post-Effective Amendment 
No. 1 to the Registration Statement (which was filed on May 18, 1994 
and declared effective on May 19, 1994 ("Post-Effective Amendment 
No. 1")) became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material 
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or 
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the 
Prospectus, including any supplement thereto (other than financial 
statements, financial data, statistical data and supporting schedules 
included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel 
need express no belief), as of their respective dates included, or as of 
the date of such opinion includes, an untrue statement of a material fact 
or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make 
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which 
they were made, not misleading.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters 
involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the States 
of Illinois, the General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware, or the 
United States, to the extent he deems proper and specified in such 
opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom he 
believes to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for Agent and 
(B) as to matters of fact, to the extent he deems proper, on certificates 
of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References 
to the Prospectus in this subsection include any supplements thereto.

(e) The Agent shall have received at the Commencement Date and on the 
final Closing Date hereunder opinions of Sidley & Austin, counsel for the 
Company, dated as of the Commencement Date and dated as of the final 
Closing Date, respectively, to the effect that:

(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an 
existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of 
Delaware;

(ii) All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the 
Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully 
paid and nonassessable; the shares of Stock have been duly and validly 
authorized, and, when issued and delivered to and paid for by the 
purchasers thereof pursuant to the Agreement, will be fully paid and 
nonassessable, conform to the description thereof in the Prospectus, 
and the stockholders of the Company are not entitled to preemptive 
rights with respect to the Stock;

(iii) The Registration Statement has become effective under 
the Act; (if applicable-the filing of the Prospectus Supplements pursuant 
to Rule 424(b) have been made in the manner and within the time period 
required by Rule 424(b)); to the knowledge of such counsel no stop 
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has 
been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or 
threatened by the Commission; the Registration Statement and the 
Prospectus at the time Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the 
Registration Statement became effective (if applicable-and the 
Prospectus Supplements) (in each case other than the financial 
statements, financial data, statistical data and supporting schedules 
contained or incorporated by reference therein as to which such counsel 
need express no opinion) complied as to the form in all material respects 
with the requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations; the 
documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or 
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than 
financial statements, financial data, statistical data and supporting 
schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein as to which 
such counsel need express no opinion) at the time of their filing with the 
Commission under the Exchange Act or at the time they were amended 
subsequent to filing, as the case may be, complied as to form in all 
material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, 
as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission 
thereunder;

(iv) The Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and 
delivered by the Company; and

(v) No consent, approval, authorization or order of any court 
or governmental agency or body is required for the valid authorization, 
issuance, sale and delivery of the Stock as contemplated by this 
Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such 
as may be required by the listing of the Stock on the NYSE and the CSE 
or under the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.

Such counsel shall also state that such counsel has participated in 
conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and 
representatives of the independent public accountants of the Company 
and representatives of Agent at which the contents of the Registration 
Statement, the Prospectuses and any amendment thereof or supplement 
thereto and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel 
has not independently checked the accuracy or completeness of, or 
otherwise verified, and accordingly need not pass upon, and need not 
assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of 
the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the 
Prospectus or any amendment thereof or any supplement thereto, and 
that on the basis thereof and relying as to materiality to a large extent 
upon the judgment of officers and other representatives of the 
Company, nothing has come to such counsel's attention which causes 
such counsel to believe that either the Registration Statement (other 
than financial statements, financial data, statistical data and supporting 
schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which 
such counsel need express no belief) when Post-Effective Amendment 
No. 1 became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact 
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or 
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the 
Prospectus, including any supplement thereto (other than financial 
statements, financial data, statistical data and supporting schedules 
included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel 
need express no belief), as of their respective dates included, or as of 
the date of such opinion includes, an untrue statement of a material fact 
or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make 
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which 
they were made, not misleading.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters 
involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the States 
of Illinois and New York, the General Corporation Laws of the State of 
Delaware, or the United States, to the extent they deem proper and 
specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good 
standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to 
counsel for Agent and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem 
proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public 
officials. References to the Prospectus in this subsection include any 
supplements thereto.

(f) The Agent shall have received from Latham & Watkins, counsel 
for the Agent, such opinion or opinions, dated as of the Commencement Date 
and dated as of the final Closing Date contemplated by this Agreement with 
respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Stock, the 
Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Agent 
reasonably may request, and such counsel shall have received such papers 
and information as they request to enable them to pass upon such matters.

(g) At or prior to (i) the Commencement Date and (ii) the date of 
the filing by the Company of any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or any Annual 
Report on Form 10-K or any other report containing financial information
which report is incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (collectively, 
the "Periodic Reports") (or at a later date that is (A) no more than five 
days after the date of such filing and (B) at or prior to any Closing Date 
occurring on or after the date of such filing), the Agent shall have received 
a letter from Arthur Andersen & Co., dated the date of delivery thereof, 
substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex I (with appropriate 
modifications and references relating to such Periodic Reports).

(h) The Agent shall have received from the Company a certificate, 
or certificates, signed by two authorized officers, including the principal 
financial or accounting officer (unless such officer is unavailable), of the 
Company, dated as of the Commencement Date and dated as of the final 
Closing Date contemplated by this Agreement, to the effect that, to the 
best of their knowledge based upon reasonable investigation:

(i) The representations and warranties of the Company in 
this Agreement are true and correct, as if made at and as of the 
Commencement Date or the Closing Date for such Pricing Period (as 
the case may be), and the Company has complied with all the 
agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be 
performed or satisfied at or prior to the Commencement Date and 
each such Closing Date (as the case may be);

(ii) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the 
Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceeding for that 
purpose has been instituted or is threatened, by the Commission; and

(iii) Since the date of this Agreement there has occurred no 
event required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the 
Registration Statement or Prospectus that has not been so set forth 
and there has been no document required to be filed under the 
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission 
thereunder that upon such filing would be deemed to be incorporated 
by reference in the Prospectus that has not been so filed.

(i) The Company shall have furnished to you such further 
certificates and documents as you shall have reasonably requested.

All such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents will be in 
compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in the form set 
forth herein or, if not set forth herein, satisfactory in form and substance 
to the Agent. The Company will furnish the Agent with such conformed copies 
of such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents as the Agent 
shall reasonably request.

6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company will indemnify 
and hold harmless the Agent against any losses, claims, damages or 
liabilities, joint or several, to which Agent may become subject, under the Act 
or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or 
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement 
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration 
Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or 
supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged 
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or 
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse 
Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection 
with investigating or defending against such loss, claim, damage, liability or 
action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall 
not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage 
or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged 
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance 
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the 
Agent specifically for use in the preparation thereof.

(b) The Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any 
losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, 
under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or 
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an 
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in 
any part of the Registration Statement when such part became effective, or in 
the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any 
amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the 
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be 
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in 
each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement 
or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made therein 
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to 
the Company by the Agent, specifically for use in the preparation thereof, 
and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably 
incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending against 
any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or 
(b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party 
shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying 
party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the 
commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party 
shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified 
party otherwise than under such subsection (except and only to the extent 
that such omission so to notify results directly in actual prejudice to the 
Company). In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified 
party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, 
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent 
that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly 
notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such 
indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified 
party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the 
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the 
defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified 
party under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently 
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other 
than reasonable costs of investigation.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable or 
insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) 
above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or 
payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages 
or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above, (i) in such 
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the 
Company on the one hand and the Agent on the other from the offering of the 
Stock or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted 
by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only 
the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative 
fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agent on the other in 
connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, 
claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable 
considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one 
hand and the Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion 
as the total proceeds from the offering of the Stock (before deducting 
expenses) received by the Company bear to the total compensation or profit 
(before deducting expenses) received or realized by the Agent from the sale 
of the Stock on behalf of the Company. The relative fault shall be determined 
by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue 
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a 
material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Agent and 
the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity 
to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the 
Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant 
to this subsection (d) were to be determined by pro rata allocations or by any 
other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable 
considerations referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d). 
The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, 
damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection 
(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred 
by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending against 
any action or claim that is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding 
the provisions of this subsection (d), the Agent shall not be required to 
contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total actual sales 
price at which the Stock sold by the Agent exceeds the amount of any damages 
that Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or 
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty 
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of 
such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition 
to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the 
same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Agent 
within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Agent under this 
Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability that the Agent may otherwise 
have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director 
of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in 
the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company), to 
each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to 
each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.

7. Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All 
representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein or in 
certificates delivered pursuant hereto, and the agreements of the Agent 
contained in Section 6 hereof, shall remain operative and in full force and 
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent or 
any controlling persons, or the Company or any of its officers, directors or 
any controlling persons, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the 
Stock.

8. [This section is reserved.]

9. Termination. 

(a) The Agent shall have the right by giving notice as hereinafter specified 
at any time at or prior to any Closing Date, to terminate this Agreement if (i) 
the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the 
Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, 
(ii) any other condition of the Agent's obligations hereunder is not fulfilled, 
(iii) trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange 
shall have been wholly suspended, (iv) a banking moratorium shall have been 
declared by Federal or New York authorities, or (v) an outbreak of major 
hostilities in which the United States is involved, a declaration of war by 
Congress, any other substantial national or international calamity or any other 
event or occurrence of a similar character shall have occurred since the 
execution of this Agreement that, in your judgment, makes it impractical or 
inadvisable to proceed with the completion of the sale of and payment for the 
Stock to be sold by the Agent on behalf of the Company. Any such 
termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party 
except that the provisions of Section 4(g) and Section 6 hereof shall at 
all times be effective. If the Agent elects to terminate this Agreement as 
provided in this Section, the Agent shall provide the required notice 
promptly by telephone, telex or telecopy, confirmed by letter.

(b) Unless otherwise agreed to between Agent and the Company, this 
Agreement shall terminate as of the end of the Sale Period. Any termination 
shall be without liability of any party to any other party except that the 
provisions of Section 4(g) and Section 6 hereof shall at all times be effective.

10. Notices. All notices or communications hereunder shall be in writing 
and if sent to the Agent shall be mailed, delivered, telexed or telecopied and

such purpose.

11. Parties. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding 
upon the Company and the Agent and their respective successors and the 
controlling persons, officers and directors referred to in Section 6 
hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

12. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed 
in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York without regard 
to the principles of conflicts of laws.

If the foregoing correctly sets forth the understanding between the Company 
and the Agent, please so indicate in the space provided below for that 
purpose, whereupon this letter shall constitute a binding agreement between 
the Company and the Agent. Alternatively, the execution of this Agreement 
by the Company and its acceptance by or on behalf of the Agent may be 
evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic or other written communications.

Very truly yours,
