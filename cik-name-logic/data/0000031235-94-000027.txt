EXHIBIT 1 - FINANCIAL DATA

BUSINESS

Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak or the Company) is engaged primarily in 
developing, manufacturing, and marketing imaging and information systems.

In conjunction with the Company's announced intention to refocus its attention 
on its consumer and commercial imaging businesses, the Company has changed its 
segments for financial reporting purposes, effective with the second quarter 
of 1994. The Consumer Imaging business unit, which was previously reported in 
the former Imaging segment, is now reported as a separate segment. The new 
Commercial Imaging segment includes the other business units from the former 
Imaging segment, the business units from the former Information segment, 
digital and applied imaging operations and the Health Sciences business unit, 
which was previously included in the Health segment. Data for prior periods 
have been restated to conform with the 1994 presentation.

Kodak's sales, earnings and identifiable assets by industry segment for the 
past three years are shown in Segment Information on page 42.
- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONSUMER IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of consumer imaging segment products, including intersegment sales, for 
the past three years were:

(in millions) 1993 1992 1991 

$5,292 $5,414 $5,135 

The products of the consumer imaging segment are used for capturing, recording 
or displaying a consumer originated image. For example, traditional amateur 
photography requires, at a minimum, a camera, film, and photofinishing. 
Photofinishing requires equipment and supplies, including chemicals and paper 
for prints.

Kodak manufactures and markets various components of imaging systems. For 
amateur photography, Kodak supplies films, photographic papers, processing 
services, photographic chemicals, cameras and projectors. Recent imaging 
products developed by Kodak include new generations of films, cameras, 
photographic papers and single-use cameras.

Marketing and Competition. Kodak's consumer imaging products and services are 
distributed through a variety of channels. Individual products are often used 
in substantial quantities in more than one market. Most sales of the consumer 
imaging segment are made through dealers. Independent retail outlets handling 
Kodak amateur products total many thousands. In a few areas abroad, Kodak 
products are marketed by independent national distributors.

Kodak's advertising programs actively promote its products and services in its 
various markets, and its principal trademarks, trade dress, and corporate 
symbol are widely used and recognized.

Kodak's consumer imaging products and services compete with similar products 
and services of others. Competition in traditional imaging markets is strong 
throughout the world. Many large and small companies offer similar products 
and services that compete with Kodak's business. Kodak's products are 
continually improved to meet the changing needs and preferences of its 
customers.

Raw Materials. The raw materials used by the consumer imaging segment are 
many and varied and generally available. Silver is one of the essential 
materials in photographic film and paper manufacturing. Digital electronics 
are becoming more integral in all products' offerings.

- - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMERCIAL IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of commercial imaging segment products for the past three years were:

(in millions) 1993 1992 1991

$7,382 $7,592 $7,301

The commercial imaging segment consists of businesses that serve the imaging 
and information needs of commercial customers. Products in this segment are 
used to capture, store, process and display images and information in a 
variety of forms.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

Kodak products for the commercial imaging segment include films, photographic 
papers, photographic plates, chemicals, processing equipment and audiovisual 
equipment, as well as copiers, graphic arts films, microfilm products, 
applications software, printers and other business equipment and service 
agreements to support these products. These products serve professional 
photofinishers, professional photographers, customers in the health care 
industry, customers in motion picture, television, commercial printing and 
publishing, office automation and government markets. Recent commercial 
imaging products developed by Kodak include commercial imaging applications 
for the recently introduced photo CD system.

Marketing and Competition. Kodak's commercial imaging products and services 
are distributed through a variety of channels. The Company also sells and 
leases business equipment directly to users. Most sales of the commercial 
imaging segment, however, are made through dealers.

Kodak's commercial imaging products and services compete with similar products 
and services of other small and large companies. Strong competition exists 
throughout the world. Many large and small companies offer similar products 
and services that compete with Kodak's business. Kodak's products are 
continually improved to meet the changing needs and preferences of its 
customers.

Raw Materials. The raw materials used by the commercial imaging segment are 
many and varied and generally available. Silver is one of the essential 
materials in photographic film and paper manufacturing. Electronic components 
represent a significant portion of the cost of the materials used in the 
manufacture of business equipment.

- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - HEALTH BUSINESSES

On May 3, 1994, the Company announced its intent to divest the following 
non-imaging health businesses: the pharmaceutical and consumer health 
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and 
do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division. These businesses are being reported as discontinued operations with 
results for prior periods restated. On June 23, 1994, the Company announced 
Sanofi agreed to acquire the pharmaceutical business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. 
for $1.675 billion in cash and its interest in the "Over-the-Counter" alliance 
with Sterling Winthrop Inc. On October 1, 1994, the Company completed this 
sale. On August 29, 1994, the Company announced SmithKline Beecham plc agreed 
to acquire the consumer health business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. for $2.925 
billion in cash. On November 2, 1994, the Company completed this sale. On 
September 6, 1994, the Company announced Johnson & Johnson agreed to acquire 
the Clinical Diagnostics Division for $1.008 billion in cash. On November 30, 
1994, the Company completed this sale. On September 26, 1994, the Company 
announced Reckitt & Colman plc agreed to acquire the worldwide household
business of L&F Products for $1.55 billion in cash. On October 14, 1994, the
Company announced Forstmann Little & Co. agreed to acquire the do-it-yourself
products business of L&F Products for $700 million in cash. On November 30,
1994, the Company completed this sale. In addition, as part of the divestiture,
the Company is actively negotiating with potential buyers for its pharmaceutical
research and development facility and its NanoSystems unit, and anticipates
closing dates for these transactions in 1995.

Sales of health businesses products for the past three years were:

(in millions) 1993 1992 1991

$3,694 $3,553 $3,524

Kodak manufactures and markets various health products. Pharmaceutical 
products include medicines prescribed by physicians or made specifically for 
use in hospitals. Pharmaceutical products also include bulk pharmaceuticals, 
intermediates and other life-science chemicals sold primarily to other 
manufacturers. Sterling Winthrop Inc., a subsidiary of Kodak, and Elf Sanofi, 
a company within the Elf Aquitaine Group, have formed an alliance of joint 
ventures for the development and marketing of pharmaceutical and 
over-the-counter medicines. Consumer health products include medicines sold 
without prescription and promoted directly to the consumer. Kodak supplies 
clinical diagnostics equipment and consumables. The health businesses also 
include household, do-it-yourself and personal care products such as 
disinfectants, all purpose cleaners, floor-care products, rodenticides, 
septicides, wood stains, concrete and wood protectors, deodorants and 
hair-care products.

Marketing and Competition. Products of the health businesses are distributed 
through a variety of channels including dealers, independent distributors, 
wholesalers, jobbers, hospitals, retail drug stores, mass merchandisers, 
variety outlets, department stores, and food stores. The health care markets 
in the U.S. and in some countries outside the U.S. are experiencing changes 
resulting from concerns for escalating costs for health care, leading to 
competitor and customer consolidation. The businesses products are subject to 
competition from both large and small companies, many of which are highly 
regarded and well established, with substantial resources for research, 
product development and promotional activities.

<PAGE>

<PAGE> 6

Competition in the health businesses particularly with respect to 
pharmaceutical, consumer health and household products, is characterized by 
the effort to develop and introduce new or improved products. Many of Kodak's 
competitors are engaged in research activities which may lead to the 
development of new products constituting additional competition for Kodak's 
products.

Raw materials. Raw materials essential to the health businesses are purchased 
for the most part in the open market and are generally available. 

The health businesses engage in research and development, located principally 
in United States locations in Montvale, New Jersey and Upper Providence 
Township, Pennsylvania. In 1993, $437 million (1992 - $431 million; 1991 - 
$366 million) was expended for research and development.
- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - CHEMICALS SEGMENT

On December 31, 1993, the Company distributed all of the outstanding shares of 
common stock of Eastman Chemical Company (Eastman), which represents 
substantially all of the Company's worldwide chemical business, as a dividend 
to the Company's shareowners (the spin-off) in a ratio of one share of Eastman 
common stock for every four shares of Kodak common stock. As a result of the 
spin-off, Eastman became an independent publicly held company listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange and its operation ceased to be owned by the Company. 
In connection with the spin-off, Eastman assumed $1.8 billion of new 
borrowings, the proceeds from which will be used by the Company as part of a 
plan to retire certain of its indebtedness. The chemicals segment has been 
reported as discontinued operations and results for prior periods have been 
restated.

Sales of chemicals segment products, including intersegment sales, for the 
past three years were:

(in millions) 1993 1992 1991

$3,976 $3,927 $3,740

The products of the chemicals segment include a wide variety of chemicals, 
plastics, and fibers. The manufacturing processes are diverse and highly 
integrated with intermediate products being sold to the trade, as well as 
being used in further internal manufacturing. The segment is also a major 
supplier of chemicals and plastics used in the manufacture of Kodak 
photographic products. Subsequent to the spin-off, it is expected that the 
Company will continue to purchase products from Eastman. The prices, terms 
and conditions of future sales have been negotiated between the Company and 
Eastman and are intended to reflect current market conditions.

The major sales products of the chemicals segment include:

- - - acids, alcohols, solvents, and plasticizers used by paint, chemical, and
plastic manufacturers,
- - - polyethylene and polypropylene plastics used in applications such as plastic
film and automotive parts,
- - - cellulose-based plastics used by molders of plastic tool handles, brushes,
eyeglass frames, and toys,
- - - cellulose-based fibers, such as acetate yarn and filter materials,
- - - polyester plastics used in food and beverage packaging, and 
- - - specialty and fine chemicals used in health, nutrition, pharmaceutical, and
photographic applications.

Marketing and Competition. The chemicals segment markets products through a 
worldwide sales organization. The majority of the sales are direct, however, 
some are through other channels. Products are shipped to customers directly 
from the chemicals segment plants as well as from distribution centers.

The chemicals segment products are marketed and categorized as industrial or 
performance. The performance products include chemicals and plastics sold to 
customers in growth markets, as well as products sold on the basis of unique 
performance attributes. The industrial products are chemical, plastic and 
fiber products sold to industrial customers, usually in large volumes, 
primarily on the basis of price, product quality and consistency, and 
reliability of supply.

In the chemicals segment, competition is present from a number of large 
chemical manufacturers with similar products; however, the competitive 
environment varies among the various product markets.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7 

Raw Materials. The raw materials used by the chemicals segment are many and 
varied and generally available. The major raw materials are propane, ethane, 
chemical wood pulp, paraxylene and coal. Many are derived from petroleum 
products, the prices of which have fluctuated in recent years.

The chemicals segment engages in research and development, located principally 
in United States locations in Kingsport, Tennessee and Longview, Texas. In 
1993, $180 million (1992 - $168 million; 1991 - $157 million) was expended for 
research and development.
- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Through the years, Kodak has engaged in extensive and productive efforts in 
research and development. In 1993, $864 million (1992 - $988 million; 1991 - 
$971 million) was expended for research and development in continuing 
operations. Research and development groups for continuing operations are 
located principally in United States locations in Rochester, New York; outside 
the U.S., research and development groups are located in England, France, 
Japan and Germany. These groups, in close cooperation with manufacturing 
units and marketing organizations, are constantly developing new products and 
applications to serve both existing and new markets.

It has been Kodak's general practice to protect its investment in research and 
development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents where 
feasible. The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to 
use its inventions but at the same time is accompanied by a liberal 
patent-licensing policy. While in the aggregate Kodak's patents are 
considered to be of material importance in the operation of its business, it 
does not consider that the patents relating to any single product or process 
are of material significance when judged from the standpoint of its total 
business.
- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning 
environmental matters. Some of the U.S. federal environmental legislation 
having an impact on Kodak includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Air Act, and the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the 
Superfund law).

Kodak continues to engage in a program for environmental protection and 
control. During 1993, expenditures for pollution prevention and waste 
treatment for continuing operations at various manufacturing facilities 
totaled $134 million. These costs included $100 million of recurring costs 
associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in on-going 
operations, $32 million of capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous 
substances or pollutants, and $2 million of mandated expenditures to remediate 
previously contaminated sites. These expenditures have been accounted for in 
accordance with the Company's accounting policy for environmental costs. The 
Company expects these recurring and remediation costs to increase slightly and 
capital to increase significantly in the near future. While these costs will 
continue to be significant cash outflows for the Company, it is not expected 
that these costs will have a materially different impact on the Company's 
financial position, results of operations or competitive position.

The Company has reviewed a draft RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA) pertaining to 
the Company's Kodak Park site in Rochester, New York. The Company has 
completed a broad-based assessment of the site in response to the RFA. While 
future expenditures associated with any remediation activities could be 
significant, it is not possible to reasonably estimate those expenditures 
until additional studies are performed.

The Company accrues for remediation costs that relate to an existing condition 
caused by past operations when it is probable that these costs will be 
incurred and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for 
remediation costs of $84 million in its financial statements at December 31, 
1993, compared with $90 million at December 31, 1992. 

The Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted in 1990. The Company may be 
required to incur significant costs, primarily capital in nature, over a 
period of several years to comply with the provisions of this Act. The 
expenditures that may be required cannot be currently reasonably estimated 
since either implementing regulations have not been issued or compliance plans 
have not been finalized.

EMPLOYMENT

At the end of 1993, Kodak's continuing operations employed 91,800 people, of 
whom 49,100 were employed in the United States.

The Company posted sales from continuing operations of $12,670 million in 
1993. Earnings from continuing operations before extraordinary item and 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle for the year were 
$644 million ($1.95 per share) compared with earnings of $845 million ($2.60 
per share) in 1992. Earnings from continuing operations before extraordinary 
item and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle were 
significantly reduced by restructuring costs in both years. The restructuring 
costs for continuing operations were $495 million ($353 million or $1.08 per 
share after-tax) in 1993 compared with $219 million ($140 million or $.43 per 
share after-tax) in 1992. Earnings from continuing operations, before 
deducting restructuring costs in both years, increased one percent in 1993 
when compared with 1992. Earnings benefited from increased unit volumes, 
lower marketing and administrative activity, lower research and development 
activity, manufacturing productivity gains and lower interest expense; but 
were adversely affected by cost escalation, lower effective selling prices, 
higher retiree health care costs associated with the change in accounting for 
certain postretirement benefits, smaller gains from the sales of investments, 
and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes. Net earnings 
for 1993 were reduced by an extraordinary charge of $14 million after-tax ($.04 
per share) related to the early extinguishment of debt.

Net earnings for 1993 benefited by $23 million ($.07 per share) from 
discontinued operations compared with a benefit of $149 million ($.46 per 
share) in 1992. Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 
1993 were $220 million compared with earnings of $292 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1992, which benefited by approximately $75 million ($.23 per share) 
from gains on the sales of investments including the sale of Eastman Kodak 
Credit Corporation (EKCC). Earnings from discontinued operations for 1993 
were lower when compared with 1992, as the benefits from higher unit volumes 
and higher effective selling prices were more than offset by cost escalation, 
higher retiree health care costs associated with the change in accounting for 
certain postretirement benefits, a provision for environmental costs, 
transaction costs associated with the spin-off of the Company's worldwide 
chemical business, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes, 
and restructuring costs of $55 million ($34 million or $.10 per share 
after-tax). The loss from discontinued operations of $18 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1993 compared with earnings of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 
1992 was primarily attributable to the provision for environmental costs and 
the transaction costs associated with the spin-off. 

The 1993 net loss was due to an after-tax charge of $2.17 billion ($6.60 per 
share) associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (SFAS) No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits 
Other Than Pensions, and SFAS No. 112, Employers' Accounting for 
Postemployment Benefits effective as of January 1, 1993. Net earnings for 
1992 benefited by $152 million ($.47 per share) from the adoption of SFAS No. 
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, effective as of January 1, 1992.

On May 3, 1994, the Company announced its intent to divest the following 
non-imaging health businesses: the pharmaceutical and consumer health 
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and 
do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division. These businesses are reported as discontinued operations with 
results for prior periods restated. On June 23, 1994, the Company announced 
Sanofi agreed to acquire the pharmaceutical business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. 
for $1.675 billion in cash and its interest in the "Over-the-Counter" alliance 
with Sterling Winthrop Inc. On October 1, 1994, the Company completed this 
sale. On August 29, 1994, the Company announced SmithKline Beecham plc agreed 
to acquire the consumer health business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. for $2.925 
billion in cash. On November 2, 1994, the Company completed this sale. On 
September 6, 1994, the Company announced Johnson & Johnson agreed to acquire
the Clinical Diagnostics Division for $1.008 billion in cash. On November 30, 
1994, the Company completed this sale. On September 26, 1994, the Company 
announced Reckitt & Colman plc agreed to acquire the worldwide household
products business of L&F Products for $1.55 billion in cash. On October 14,
1994, the Company announced Forstmann Little & Co. agreed to acquire the
do-it-yourself products business of L&F Products for $700 million in cash. 
On November 30, 1994, the Company completed this sale. In addition, as part of
the divestiture, the Company is actively negotiating with potential buyers for
its pharmaceutical research and development facility and its NanoSystems unit,
and anticipates closing dates for these transactions in 1995.

On December 31, 1993, the Company spun-off its worldwide chemical business, 
which consisted of Eastman Chemical Company operations. Results for Eastman 
Chemical Company operations are being reported as discontinued operations and 
results for prior periods have been restated. 

Earnings from discontinued operations include allocations of interest and 
taxes to the Chemicals segment and Health businesses and transaction costs 
associated with the spin-off.

The Company posted sales from continuing operations of $12,992 million in 
1992. Earnings from continuing operations for the year were $845 million 
($2.60 per share) compared with $12 million ($.04 per share) in 1991. Net 
earnings for 1992 included $149 million ($.46 per share) from discontinued 
operations compared with $5 million ($.01 per share) in 1991. Net earnings for 
1992 also benefited by $152 million ($.47 per share) from the cumulative 
effect of adopting SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and were 
adversely affected by the effects of restructuring costs for continuing 
operations of $219 million ($140 million or $.43 per share after-tax). Net 
earnings for 1991 were significantly reduced by the effects of restructuring 
costs for continuing operations of $1,448 million ($934 million or $2.88 per 
share after-tax). Excluding the effects of restructuring costs from both 1992 
and 1991, earnings from continuing operations for 1992 increased from the 
prior year as the favorable effects of manufacturing productivity, higher 
volumes, gains from the sales of investments including the sale of EKCC, and 
the favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes more than offset cost 
escalation and higher marketing and administrative costs. Earnings from 
continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 1992 were $292 million compared 
with a net loss of $326 million in the fourth quarter of 1991. Earnings for 
the fourth quarter of 1992 benefited by approximately $75 million ($.23 per 
share) from gains on the sales of investments including the sale of EKCC. The 
net loss in the fourth quarter of 1991 was due to the effects of restructuring 
costs of $911 million ($596 million or $1.84 per share after-tax). Earnings 
from discontinued operations were higher in 1992, when compared with 1991, as 
the benefits of higher unit volumes and higher effective selling prices were 
only partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, higher administrative 
costs and increased research and development expenditures.

SALES

Worldwide sales from continuing operations for 1993 were down two percent when 
compared with 1992, as slight increases in unit volumes were more than offset 
by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower 
effective selling prices. The Consumer Imaging and Commercial Imaging 
segments both recorded a slight decline when compared with last year. 
Currency changes against the U.S. dollar unfavorably affected 1993 sales from 
continuing operations by approximately $490 million before reflecting the 
impact of the Company's hedging program. 

Sales from continuing operations for 1992 increased moderately compared with 
1991 as both segments posted sales increases primarily as the result of higher 
unit volumes. Consumer Imaging achieved moderate gains while slight increases 
were reported for Commercial Imaging. Currency changes against the U.S. 
dollar favorably affected 1992 sales by approximately $150 million before 
reflecting the impact of the Company's hedging program.

In the Consumer Imaging segment, sales to customers inside the U.S. in 1993 
were essentially level when compared with sales for 1992, as slight increases 
in unit volumes were only partially offset by lower effective selling prices. 
Outside the U.S., sales decreased in 1993, as moderate increases in unit 
volumes were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency 
rate changes and lower effective selling prices. Worldwide volume gains were 
led by Kodacolor 35mm films, single-use cameras and Ektacolor papers. 

For the Consumer Imaging segment, 1992 sales to customers inside the U.S. 
increased moderately when compared with sales for 1991 primarily due to higher 
unit volumes. Outside the U.S., sales registered a slight increase in 1992, 
as slight increases in unit volumes and the favorable effects of foreign 
currency rate changes were only partially offset by lower effective selling 
prices. Worldwide sales increases in 1992 were led by Kodacolor films and 
Ektacolor papers.

In the Commercial Imaging segment, 1993 sales comparisons for customers in the 
U.S. and outside the U.S. were adversely affected by lower effective selling 
prices and the inclusion in 1992 of revenues from divested units. In 
addition, outside the U.S., volume increases for continuing businesses were 
more than offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes.

Commercial Imaging segment sales in 1992 to customers in the U.S. were 
essentially level with 1991. Outside the U.S., sales recorded a moderate 
increase when compared with 1991, primarily due to higher unit volumes.

In the Chemicals segment, whose results are reported as discontinued 
operations, slight increases in 1993 sales to customers in the U.S. when 
compared with 1992 were due to higher unit volumes. Outside the U.S., a 
slight decline in 1993 sales when compared with 1992 resulted from the 
unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower effective 
selling prices, partially offset by higher unit volumes. Worldwide sales of 
specialty chemicals recorded a moderate increase while industrial chemicals 
declined slightly when compared with 1992. 

For the Chemicals segment, moderate increases in 1992 sales to customers in 
the U.S. and slight increases in sales outside the U.S. when compared with 
1991 were due to higher unit volumes. Worldwide sales of specialty chemicals 
recorded a solid increase in 1992, while industrial chemicals were level.

In the Health businesses, whose results are reported as discontinued 
operations, 1993 sales to customers inside the U.S. were level when compared 
with 1992. Outside the U.S., good increases for the year resulted from 
significant increases in unit volumes and higher effective selling prices, 
which were partially offset by the effects of unfavorable foreign currency 
rate changes. All business units posted worldwide volume gains for the year. 

Health businesses sales in 1992 to customers inside the U.S. recorded good 
increases when compared with 1991, primarily due to volume gains. Sales 
comparisons between 1992 and 1991 for customers outside the U.S. were 
adversely affected by the inclusion of two additional months of Sterling 
Winthrop Inc. sales in 1991 to align company reporting periods. In addition, 
certain sales by former Sterling Winthrop Inc. units are no longer 
consolidated because of the alliance with Elf Sanofi. On a comparable basis, 
sales outside the U.S. in 1992 would have registered solid gains when compared 
with 1991 results. Worldwide sales increases in 1992 were led by consumer 
health and pharmaceutical products.

EARNINGS

Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Consumer Imaging and 
Commercial Imaging segments were adversely affected by restructuring costs of 
$495 million in 1993, $219 million in 1992 and $1,448 million in 1991. The 
operating earnings for the Health businesses and Chemicals segment, whose 
results are reported as discontinued operations, were adversely affected by 
Health restructuring costs of $43 million in 1993, $1 million in 1992 and $157 
million in 1991 and Chemicals restructuring costs of $12 million in 1993. In 
addition, operating earnings in 1993 for all segments were adversely affected 
by higher retiree health care costs associated with the change in accounting 
for certain postretirement benefits. The 1993 restructuring costs represent 
the cost of separation benefits for a cost reduction program expected to 
reduce worldwide employment by 10,000 and the cost of closing a facility in 
Germany that manufactures a component for the Company's ink jet printing 
business. The restructuring costs in 1992 and 1991 included costs of an early 
retirement plan, the restructuring of non-U.S. sensitized manufacturing and 
photofinishing operations and worldwide pharmaceutical businesses, and the 
Company's exit from non-strategic businesses.

Consumer Imaging segment operating earnings were adversely affected by 
restructuring costs in 1993 and 1992 of $141 million and $58 million, 
respectively. Consumer Imaging segment operating earnings, before deducting 
restructuring costs in both years, decreased in 1993 when compared with 1992, 
as the benefits from increased unit volumes, lower marketing and 
administrative activity and manufacturing productivity gains were more than 
offset by lower effective selling prices, cost escalation and the unfavorable 
effects of foreign currency rate changes.

Consumer Imaging segment operating earnings were adversely affected by 
restructuring costs in 1992 and 1991 of $58 million and $555 million, 
respectively. Consumer Imaging segment operating earnings, before deducting 
restructuring costs in both years, were essentially level in 1992 when 
compared with 1991, as the favorable effects of manufacturing productivity 
gains and increased unit volumes were offset by cost escalation and increased 
marketing and administrative costs.
<PAGE>

<PAGE> 16

The Commercial Imaging segment operating earnings were adversely affected by 
restructuring costs in 1993 and 1992 of $354 million and $161 million, 
respectively. Commercial Imaging segment operating earnings, before deducting 
restructuring costs in both years, improved sharply in 1993 when compared with 
1992, as the benefits from manufacturing productivity gains, lower marketing 
and administrative activity and lower research and development activity were 
only partially offset by cost escalation, the unfavorable effects of foreign 
currency rate changes and lower effective selling prices.

The Commercial Imaging segment operating earnings in 1992 and loss in 1991 
were adversely affected by restructuring costs in 1992 and 1991 of $161 
million and $893 million, respectively. Commercial Imaging segment operating 
earnings increased substantially in 1992 when compared with 1991, before 
deducting restructuring costs in both years, as the benefits from 
manufacturing productivity gains and lower research and development activity 
more than offset cost escalation.

Chemicals segment operating earnings, which are reported as discontinued 
operations, were adversely affected by restructuring costs in 1993 of $12 
million. Chemicals segment operating earnings, before deducting the 1993 
restructuring costs, decreased when compared with 1992, as the benefits from 
increased unit volumes were more than offset by cost escalation, provision for 
the estimated cost of environmental remediation and plant closure costs, lower 
effective selling prices, charges for the planned exit from the Kodel 
polyester staple fiber business and the unfavorable effects of foreign 
currency rate changes.

Chemicals segment operating earnings decreased in 1992 when compared with 
1991, as higher manufacturing costs and increased administrative costs were 
only partially offset by increased unit volumes and higher effective selling 
prices.

Health businesses operating earnings, which are reported as discontinued 
operations, were adversely affected by restructuring costs in 1993 and 1992 of 
$43 million and $1 million, respectively. Health businesses operating 
earnings, before deducting restructuring costs in both years, were excellent 
in 1993 when compared with 1992, as the benefits of increased unit volumes, 
higher effective selling prices, lower marketing and administrative activity 
and lower research and development activity more than offset cost escalation 
and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes.

Health businesses operating earnings were adversely affected by restructuring 
costs in 1992 and 1991 of $1 million and $157 million, respectively. On a 
fully comparable basis and before deducting restructuring costs in both years, 
Health businesses operating earnings decreased significantly in 1992 when 
compared with 1991, as the favorable effects of higher effective selling 
prices and increased unit volumes were more than offset by cost escalation, 
higher marketing costs and increased research and development expenditures.

Research and development expenditures for continuing operations amounted to 
$864 million in 1993, compared with $988 million in 1992 and $971 million in 
1991. Research and development expenditures in 1993 were significantly below 
1992 as the benefits from lower activity levels were only partially offset by 
cost escalation. Research and development expenditures were higher in 1992 
when compared with 1991 as cost escalation was only partially offset by lower 
activity levels. Amortization of goodwill for continuing operations amounted 
to $29 million in 1993, $23 million in 1992 and $22 million in 1991. 
Advertising and sales promotion expenses for continuing operations were
$646 million in 1993, $725 million in 1992 and $604 million in 1991. Other
marketing and administrative expenses for continuing operations totaled
$2,774 million in 1993, $3,000 million in 1992 and $2,917 million in 1991.
Decreases in advertising and sales promotion, and other marketing and
administrative expenses in 1993 resulted from the benefit of lower activity
levels and the favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes on locally
incurred international costs, partially offset by cost escalation. Increases
in advertising and sales promotion, and other marketing and administrative 
expenses for 1992 when compared with 1991 resulted from cost escalation, 
increased activity and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate 
changes. The comparison with 1991 benefited from divestitures in 1992.

Earnings from equity interests and other revenues were $203 million in 1993, 
$342 million in 1992 and $229 million in 1991. The results for 1992 were 
higher than 1993 and 1991 due to gains from the sales of investments in 1992, 
including the sale of EKCC. 

Interest expense of $175 million in 1993 was lower than the $247 million 
incurred in 1992 and $291 million incurred in 1991 as a result of lower 
effective interest rates. The Company has a program in place to manage 
interest rate risk associated with its current and anticipated borrowings. In 
connection with this program, the Company has entered into various 
combinations of interest rate swaps, options, currency swaps and similar 
arrangements. The effect of this program has been to reduce the aggregate 
average interest rate on the Company's borrowings.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 17

The Company has a program in place to manage foreign currency risk. The 
Company has entered into foreign currency contracts to hedge transactions in 
non-U.S. dollar denominated receivables and payables. The Company has also 
entered into foreign currency contracts to hedge sales from foreign units 
denominated in currencies other than local currencies and probable anticipated 
export sales. The net effect of this program was a gain of $65 million in 
1993, a loss of $66 million in 1992 and a loss of $7 million in 1991.

Other charges increased in 1993 when compared with 1992, as the net loss in 
1993 from foreign exchange transactions and the translation of net monetary 
items in highly inflationary economies was greater than in 1992. Other 
charges decreased in 1992 when compared with 1991 as the net loss in 1992 from 
foreign exchange transactions and the translation of net monetary items in 
highly inflationary economies was less than the net loss in 1991 from foreign 
exchange transactions and the translation of net monetary assets and 
liabilities.

CASH DIVIDENDS

Total cash dividends of approximately $650 million ($.50 per share each 
quarter) were declared in each of the past three years. 

- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINANCIAL POSITION

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased to $1,966 million at 
year-end 1993 from $547 million at year-end 1992. In connection with the 
spin-off of the worldwide chemical business, the Company borrowed $1.8 billion 
in December 1993, which subsequently was assumed by the worldwide chemical 
business on December 31, 1993. The proceeds from the borrowings, which were 
retained by Kodak, are invested primarily in United States Government 
securities and time deposits and will eventually be used to retire other 
borrowings. At December 31, 1992, $1.8 billion of the Company's long-term 
borrowings were included in the net assets of discontinued operations to 
reflect the debt assumed by the worldwide chemical business. Interest expense 
and capitalized interest in 1993 related to such debt of $126 million and $23 
million, respectively, were allocated to discontinued operations in 1993. In 
addition, $126 million and $143 million of Health long-term borrowings at 
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, were included in net assets of 
discontinued operations. Interest expense of $462 million and capitalized 
interest of $28 million were allocated to the Health businesses reported as 
discontinued operations in 1993.

The Company announced on March 2, 1994 that it has elected to redeem the zero 
coupon convertible subordinated debentures due 2011 on April 1, 1994. The 
redemption price is $312.14 per debenture. Each debenture may be converted 
into the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of 6.944 shares per 
debenture at any time before the close of business on April 1, 1994. 
Approximately $1.15 billion would be required to redeem all of the outstanding 
debentures. This redemption will not have a material impact on the Company's 
results of operations for 1994.

Approximately three-fourths of the restructuring costs recorded by the Company 
in 1993 represented the cost of separation benefits for personnel leaving 
under a workforce reduction program. Most of these benefits will be paid 
during 1994 from operating cash flows. The remainder of the 1993 
restructuring costs is associated with the closure of a facility in Germany. 
Most of these costs represent non-cash write-offs of assets. Most of the 
costs associated with the early retirement plan announced in 1991 are being 
funded from the Company's pension plan assets and, therefore, did not 
significantly affect the Company's cash flows during the past three years. 
The Company does not anticipate that such costs will affect its cash flows in 
the near future. 

The Company has access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring in 
October 1995, which it has not used.

Projected operating cash flows are expected to be adequate to support normal 
business operations, planned capital expenditures and dividend payments in 
1994.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

During 1993, expenditures for pollution prevention and waste treatment for 
continuing operations at various manufacturing facilities totaled $134 million.
These costs included $100 million of recurring costs associated with managing 
hazardous substances and pollution in on-going operations, $32 million of 
capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances or pollutants, 
and $2 million of mandated expenditures to remediate previously contaminated 
sites. The Company expects these recurring and remediation costs to increase 
slightly and capital to increase significantly in the near future. While 
these costs will continue to be significant cash outflows for the Company, it 
is not expected that these costs will have a materially different impact on 
the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company has reviewed a draft Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) 
Facility Assessment (RFA) pertaining to the Company's Kodak Park site in 
Rochester, New York. The Company has completed a broad-based assessment of 
the site in response to the RFA. While future expenditures associated with 
any remediation activities could be significant, it is not possible to 
reasonably estimate those expenditures until additional studies are performed.

The Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted in 1990. The Company may be 
required to incur significant costs, primarily capital in nature, over a 
period of several years to comply with the provisions of this Act. The 
expenditures that may be required cannot currently be reasonably estimated 
since either implementing regulations have not been issued or compliance plans 
have not been finalized.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity 
Securities, must be adopted in the first quarter of 1994. This standard 
requires that companies classify securities that it holds as held-to-maturity 
securities, trading securities or available-for-sale securities. Debt 
securities classified as held-to-maturity will be reported at amortized cost. 
Debt and equity securities classified as trading will be reported at fair 
value, with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings. Debt 
and equity securities classified as available-for-sale will be reported at 
fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses excluded from earnings 
and reported in a separate component of shareowners' equity until realized. 
The Company does not believe that this standard will have a material effect on 
the Company's financial position or results of operations when adopted.

EXHIBIT 2. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY FOR THE
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of
Eastman Kodak Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in 
the index appearing under Item 5, 2 and 3 on page 2 of this Current Report on 
Form 8-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
Eastman Kodak Company and subsidiary companies at December 31, 1993 and 1992, 
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted 
our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, 
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that 
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in the Other Postemployment Costs note, the Company changed its 
method of accounting for certain postretirement benefits and other 
postemployment benefits in 1993. As discussed in the Income Taxes note, the 
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes in 1992.

Eastman Kodak Company and Subsidiary Companies
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastman Kodak 
Company and its majority owned subsidiary companies. Intercompany 
transactions are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of the 
earnings of subsidiaries applicable to minority interests. 

TRANSLATION OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES

Effective January 1, 1992, the local currency is the "functional currency" of 
most subsidiary companies outside the U.S., however, the U.S. dollar will 
continue to be used for reporting operations in highly inflationary economies. 
This change did not have a material effect on the Company's statement of 
financial position as of January 1, 1992.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at cost, which is not in excess of market. The cost of 
most U.S. inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. 
The cost of other inventories is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO), 
or average cost method.

GOODWILL

The excess of the Company's costs of its consolidated investments over the 
value ascribed to the equity in such companies at the time of acquisition is 
amortized over appropriate future periods benefited not exceeding 40 years.

INVESTMENTS

Included in long-term receivables and other noncurrent assets are investments 
in joint ventures which are managed as integral parts of the Company's segment 
operations and are accounted for on an equity basis. The Company's share of 
the earnings of these joint ventures is included in the earnings from 
operations for the related segments.

SALES

Sales represent revenue from sales of products and services, equipment 
rentals, and other operating fees.

DEPRECIATION

Depreciation expense is provided based on historical cost and the estimated 
useful lives of the assets. The Company generally uses the straight-line 
method for calculating the provision for depreciation. For assets in the 
United States acquired prior to January 1, 1992, the provision for 
depreciation is generally calculated using accelerated methods.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or 
capitalized as appropriate. Remediation costs that relate to an existing 
condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that these 
costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated.

PROPERTY RETIREMENTS

Properties are recorded at historical cost, reduced by accumulated 
depreciation. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of 
such assets and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the 
accounts. Any profit or loss on retirement, or other disposition, is 
reflected in earnings.

INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1992, deferred income taxes reflect the impact of 
temporary differences between the assets and liabilities recognized for 
financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for tax purposes. 
Deferred taxes are based on tax laws as currently enacted.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain 1992 and 1991 financial statement and related footnote amounts have 
been reclassified to conform to the 1993 presentation.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On May 3, 1994, the Company announced its intent to divest the following 
non-imaging health businesses: the pharmaceutical and consumer health 
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and 
do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division. These businesses are reported as discontinued operations with 
results for prior periods restated. On June 23, 1994, the Company announced 
Sanofi agreed to acquire the pharmaceutical business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. 
for $1.675 billion in cash and its interest in the "Over-the-Counter" alliance 
with Sterling Winthrop Inc. Sanofi's interest in the "Over the Counter" 
alliance will be transferred to Sterling Winthrop Inc. On October 1, 1994, the 
Company completed this sale. On August 29, 1994, the Company announced 
SmithKline Beecham plc agreed to acquire the consumer health business of 
Sterling Winthrop Inc. for $2.925 billion in cash. On November 2, 1994, the 
Company completed this sale. On September 6, 1994, the Company announced 
Johnson & Johnson agreed to acquire the Clinical Diagnostics Division for
$1.008 billion in cash. On November 30, 1994, the Company completed this sale.
On September 26, 1994, the Company announced Reckitt & Colman plc agreed to
acquire the worldwide household products business of L&F Products for
$1.55 billion in cash. On October 14, 1994, the Company announced Forstmann
Little & Co. agreed to acquire the do-it-yourself products business of L&F
Products for $700 million in cash. On November 30, 1994, the Company completed
this sale. In addition, as part of the divestiture, the Company is actively
negotiating with potential buyers for its pharmaceutical research and
development facility and its NanoSystems unit, and anticipates closing dates for
these transactions in 1995.

As of June 30, 1994, the Company concluded that measurement dates had occurred 
for the non-imaging health businesses. Accordingly, the financial statement 
information related to these businesses has been presented on one line in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, "net assets of discontinued 
operations", and in the "discontinued operations" line of the Consolidated 
Statement of Earnings. The amounts presented for prior periods have been 
restated for comparability. The "net assets of discontinued operations" 
represents the assets intended to be sold offset by the liabilities 
anticipated to be assumed by buyers of these businesses. The amounts 
presented in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for prior periods have 
been restated to reflect the allocation of interest expense to discontinued 
operations. The allocation of interest expense was performed by reference to 
the interest expense on indebtedness that is anticipated to be repaid from the 
net proceeds received from the sales.

The Company currently anticipates an overall gain on the sales of the health 
businesses including income from operations during the phase-out period which 
is estimated to end on or about December 31, 1994. Consequently, all gains 
estimated at this time will be recognized by the Company as such transactions 
close.

Summarized results of the Health businesses, including an allocation of 
interest expense, are as follows:

(in millions) 1993 1992 1991

Sales $3,694 $3,553 $3,524

------ ------ ------
Earnings (loss) before cumulative effect

Interest expense included in earnings (loss) before income taxes was 
$462 million for 1993, $460 million for 1992 and $460 million for 1991.

Net assets of the Health businesses as reported in the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position are comprised of the following:

====== ======

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 29

Total net assets of the Health businesses at December 31, 1993 and December 31, 
1992 reflect the expected settlement of intercompany balances.

The effective tax rates for the discontinued health operations were 24% and 
27% for 1993 and 1992, respectively. The 1991 effective tax rate for these 
operations is not meaningful since there is a tax charge on a pre-tax loss. 
The differences between the provision for income taxes and income taxes 
computed using the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% in 1993 and 
34% in 1992 and 1991 were primarily due to the allocation of tax effects of 
non-deductible goodwill and foreign tax benefits to discontinued operations.

On June 15, 1993, the Company announced a plan to spin-off its Eastman 
Chemical Company operations, which was completed on December 31, 1993.

Summarized results of the Chemicals segment, including allocations of interest 
expense, income taxes and transaction costs associated with the spin-off are 
as follows:

(in millions) 1993 1992 1991

Sales $3,695 $3,638 $3,468

Net assets of the Chemicals segment at December 31, 1992 are presented below. 
As a result of the spin-off, these assets are not included in the Company's 
1993 consolidated statement of financial position.

====== 

Total net assets of the Chemicals segment at December 31, 1992 reflects the 
expected settlement of intercompany balances and an allocation of long-term 
borrowings as of the date of the spin-off. 

The effective tax rates for discontinued chemicals operations were 28%, 30% 
and 28% for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The differences between the 
provision for income taxes and income taxes computed using the U.S. federal 
statutory income tax rate of 35% in 1993 and 34% in 1992 and 1991 were 
primarily due to the allocation of foreign and state tax benefits to 
discontinued chemicals operations.

<PAGE> 30
CASH FLOW INFORMATION

For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, the Company 
considers marketable securities with maturities of three months or less at the 
time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Cash paid for interest and income taxes, including amounts paid attributable 
to discontinued operations, is as follows:

(in millions) 1993 1992 1991

Interest, net of portion capitalized 
of $86, $94 and $112 $792 $766 $869
Income taxes 497 388 434

Certain assets have been acquired through non-cash acquisitions and are not 
reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Except for $157 million 
of cash transferred with the Chemicals segment, the spin-off of the worldwide

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

Marketable securities (principally U.S. Government securities and time 
deposits) are shown at cost which approximates market value.

- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RECEIVABLES

The Company has entered into an agreement whereby it sells an undivided 
interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable up to a maximum of 
$100 million. As collections reduce accounts receivable balances in the pool, 
the Company may sell participating interests in new receivables to bring the 
amount sold up to the $100 million maximum. The uncollected balance of 
receivables sold amounted to $100 million at each balance sheet date. The 
Company retains collection and administrative responsibilities on the 
participating interests sold as agent for the purchaser.

During 1993 the Company sold $75 million of lease receivables for 
approximately $85 million.

The 6 3/8% debentures due in 2001 are convertible at the option of the holder 
at any time prior to maturity for the Company's common stock at $41.52 per 
share.

The zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due in 2011 ($3,680 
million face value, 6.75% yield to maturity) are convertible at the option of 
the holder at any time prior to maturity for the Company's common stock at a 
conversion rate of 6.944 shares per debenture. At the option of the holder, 
the debentures must be purchased by the Company on October 15, 1994, 1995, 
1996, 2001 and 2006, at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original 
issue discount.

The Company has an unused $2.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring in
October 1995 which is available to support the Company's commercial paper 
borrowings. If unused, it has a commitment fee of $6.3 million per year. 
Interest on amounts borrowed under this facility is at rates based on spreads 
above certain reference rates.

The amounts of long-term borrowings maturing in the four years after 1994, 
excluding amounts expected to be assumed by discontinued operations, are 
$861 million in 1995, $0 million in 1996, $335 million in 1997 and
$1,100 million in 1998. 

The Company has swapped $135 million of the 7 7/8% notes into yen denominated 
debt and $46 million of the Sterling Winthrop Inc. 8 7/8% notes into deutsche 
mark denominated debt. As a result of these agreements, the effective 
interest rates on the 7 7/8% notes and 8 7/8% notes have been reduced.

The Company has a program in place to manage interest rate risk associated 
with its current and anticipated borrowings. In connection with this program, 
the Company has entered into various combinations of interest rate swaps, 
options, currency swaps and similar arrangements. At December 31, 1993 and 
1992, the Company had the following interest rate swap agreements with 
aggregate notional principal amounts of $4.7 billion and $4.1 billion, 
respectively.

In addition, the Company has entered into interest rate options linked to 
$2.5 billion of its fixed rate callable debt at each balance sheet date. The 
notional principal amounts associated with these options were $2.8 billion and 
$3.1 billion at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The effect of these 
options, which are exercisable through 1998, is to change the underlying debt 
from callable to non-callable and to reduce the aggregate average effective 
interest rate on this debt.

During 1988, the Company issued debt warrants that give the holders the option 
between 1995 and 2004 to require the Company to issue an additional $300 
million of 9.5% debt maturing in 2018. The premium received for these 
warrants is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the 
counterparties to these agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate 
nonperformance. Also, while these agreements are part of the Company's 
overall interest rate management program, the fair value of these instruments 
will vary with changes in prevailing interest rates. The fair values of these 
interest rate agreements are included in the note on Fair Values of Financial 
Instruments.

The Company has issued letters of credit in lieu of making security deposits 
to insure the payment of possible Workers' Compensation claims.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has entered into agreements with several companies to provide the 
Company with products and services to be used in its normal operations. The 
minimum payments for these agreements are approximately $123 million in 1994, 
$107 million in 1995, $97 million in 1996, $100 million in 1997, $98 million in 
1998 and $155 million in 1999 and beyond.

The Company has also guaranteed debt and other obligations under agreements 
with certain affiliated companies and customers. At December 31, 1993, these 
guarantees totaled approximately $220 million. The Company does not expect 
that these guarantees will have a material impact on the Company's future 
financial position or results of operations.

The Company has entered into a Master Lease agreement whereby the Company 
leases equipment with the right to buy the equipment anytime at fair market 
value. The lease term is one year and is renewable annually. The total 
amount of assets under this lease is approximately $300 million at each 
balance sheet date.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The recorded amounts of other investments as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 
shown below include $81 million and $70 million, respectively, of equity 
investments in a number of entities for which it is not practicable to 
estimate fair value, since quoted market prices do not exist for any of these 
investments.

The fair values of long-term borrowings were estimated based on quoted market 
prices or by obtaining quotes from brokers. 

As discussed above, the Company is a party to various interest rate option and 
swap agreements and foreign currency contracts which are included in other 
instruments below. The fair values of other instruments were estimated by 
obtaining quotes from brokers, where practicable, or by estimating the amounts 
the Company would receive or pay to terminate the instruments at the reporting 
date.

The recorded amounts of certain financial instruments, such as cash and 
marketable securities and short-term borrowings, approximate their fair values

There are approximately 27 million shares reserved for the conversion of the
6 3/8% convertible subordinated debentures and zero coupon convertible 
subordinated debentures issued by the Company. There are also 100 million 
shares of $10 par value preferred stock authorized, none of which has been 
issued. 

Retained earnings of subsidiary companies outside the U.S. are considered to 
be reinvested indefinitely. If remitted, they would be substantially free of 
additional tax. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability 
for temporary differences related to these retained earnings.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Fully diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings adjusted 
for after-tax interest expense associated with convertible securities by the 
average number of common shares outstanding, common stock equivalents related 
to dilutive stock options, and common shares issuable upon conversion of such 
convertible securities. The effects of such potentially dilutive convertible 
securities were not dilutive in 1993 and 1991. The number of common shares 
used to compute earnings per share amounts was as follows:

INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The 
adoption of this standard changed the Company's method of accounting for 
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method. The standard 
was adopted on a prospective basis and amounts presented for prior years were 
not restated. The cumulative effect of adopting the standard as of January 1, 
1992 was a $100 million credit to earnings from continuing operations and a 
$52 million credit to earnings from discontinued operations. 

The components of earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income 
taxes and the related provision (benefit) for United States and other income 
taxes were as follows:

$526 million, which was partially offset by the settlement of a litigation 
judgment of $324 million.

CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS

The Company has entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts. 
The notional amounts for these contracts were $615 million at December 31, 1993 
and $783 million at December 31, 1992. Most of these contracts hedge 
transactions in non-U.S. dollar denominated receivables and payables. 
Exchange gains and losses on these hedge contracts are offset against losses 
and gains on the underlying receivables and payables.

The Company has entered into foreign currency options and option combinations 
to hedge probable anticipated export sales transactions during the next two 
years. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on those options and option 
combinations that are designated and effective as hedges of such probable 
anticipated, but not firmly committed, foreign currency transactions are 
deferred and recognized in income in the same periods as the hedged 
transactions. The net unrealized loss deferred on such options as of 
December 31, 1993 totaled $69 million compared with a net unrealized gain of 
$20 million as of December 31, 1992. These amounts represent the gain or loss 
that would have been recognized had these options been liquidated at market 
value in their respective years.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the 
other parties to the foreign currency option contracts. However, the Company 
does not anticipate nonperformance.

The net effect from foreign exchange transactions was a gain of $35 million for 
1993 compared with a loss of $25 million for 1992 and a gain of $49 million for 
1991.

- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESTRUCTURING COSTS

The Company recorded restructuring costs for continuing operations in 1993 of 
$495 million. Approximately three-fourths of these costs represented the cost 
of separation benefits for a cost reduction program expected to reduce 
worldwide employment by approximately 9,000 personnel, most of whom are 
expected to leave by the end of 1994. The remainder of the restructuring 
costs is associated with closing a facility in Germany that manufactures a 
component for the Company's ink jet printer business. This closure is 
expected to be completed during 1994. The accrual balance for these programs 
is $356 million at December 31, 1993.

The Company recorded restructuring costs for continuing operations of 
$219 million in 1992 and $1,448 million in 1991. Approximately three-fourths 
of these costs were for an early retirement program. The balance for this 
program is $375 million at December 31, 1993, which will be paid out to early 
retirees and their survivors over time. Most of the costs associated with 
this program are being funded from the Company's pension plan assets and, 
therefore, did not affect the Company's cash flows during the past three 
years. The Company does not anticipate that such costs will significantly 
affect the cash flows in the near future.

The remainder of the 1992 and 1991 restructuring costs is related to the 
Company's exit from non-strategic businesses and the restructuring of the 
Company's non-U.S. sensitized manufacturing and photofinishing businesses. 
The accrual balance remaining at December 31, 1993 for these programs is 
$27 million, which relates primarily to noncancelable lease commitments and 
other contractual obligations associated with divested operations to be paid 
out over the remaining terms of the contracts.

RETIREMENT PLANS

Total worldwide pension expense, including discontinued operations, was 
$104 million in 1993. This compares with pension expense of $56 million in 
1992 and pension income of $8 million in 1991. Discontinued chemicals 
operations was allocated pension expense of $10 million and $6 million in 1993 
and 1992, respectively, and pension income of $7 million in 1991.

The Company has defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all of 
its U.S. employees. The benefits are based on years of service and generally 
on the employees' final average compensation as defined in the plans. The 
Company makes contributions to the plans as permitted by government laws and 
regulations. Retirement plan benefits are paid to eligible employees by 
insurance companies or from trust funds. The Company has retained the 
obligation for pension benefits for personnel who retired from Eastman 
Chemical Company through December 31, 1993.

Pension expense for the principal U.S. plan, including discontinued 
operations, includes the following components:

The assumptions used to develop the projected benefit obligation for U.S. 
plans were as follows:
December 31,
1993 1992

Discount rate 7 1/4% 8 1/2% 
Salary increase rate 4 5 
Long-term rate of return on plan assets 9 1/2 10 1/2

The Company also sponsors other U.S. plans. At December 31, 1993, the 
projected benefit obligations for these plans totaled $217 million (1992 - 
$208 million) of which $145 million (1992 - $144 million) was included as a 
liability in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The obligation for the Company's unfunded plans of $126 million in 1993 and 
$132 million in 1992 has been recorded as a long-term liability. 

Calculations indicate that the total of the pension funds and accruals for 
non-U.S. plans less pension prepayments and deferred charges exceeds the 
actuarially computed value of vested benefits under such plans as of the 
beginning of 1993 and 1992.

OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT COSTS

The Company provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible 
retirees and health care benefits for eligible survivors of retirees. In 
general, these benefits are provided to retirees eligible to retire under the 
Company's principal U.S. pension plan. Prior to January 1, 1993, the Company 
has recognized expense for the cost of such plans when it paid premiums, 
claims and other costs. The expense for such plans, excluding discontinued 
chemicals operations, was $244 million in 1993, $100 million in 1992 and 
$78 million in 1991.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions on January 1, 1993. As a result, the Company now 
accrues, during the years employees render service, the expected costs of 
providing postretirement health and life insurance benefits to such employees. 
The obligation owed to current and retired employees, including discontinued 
operations, as of January 1, 1993 was recognized on that date as a cumulative 
effect of a change in accounting principle of $2.1 billion after-tax. The 
Company has retained the obligation for other postretirement benefits for 
personnel who retired from Eastman Chemical Company through December 31, 1993. 
The annual after-tax effect of the expense recognized, excluding discontinued 
chemicals operations, using the accrual method required by SFAS No. 106 is 
approximately $108 million ($.33 per share) higher than the annual expense that 
would be recognized on a cash basis. Since the Company plans to continue to 
fund these benefit costs on a pay-as-you-go-basis, the adoption of SFAS No. 
106 will not affect cash flows.

The 1993 net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the principal U.S. 
plans, excluding discontinued chemicals operations, includes the following 
components:

(in millions) 

Service cost $ 29
Interest cost 215
------
Net periodic postretirement
benefit cost $ 244
======

Presented below are the total obligation and amount recognized, excluding 
discontinued chemicals operations, in the consolidated statement of financial 
position for the principal U.S. plans at December 31, 1993:

(in millions) 

Accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation
Retirees $2,677
Fully eligible active plan
participants 61
Other active plan participants 826
------
3,564
Unrecognized net loss (548)
------
Accrued postretirement benefit cost $3,016
======

To estimate these costs, health care costs were assumed to increase 11% in 
1994 with the rate of increase declining ratably to 5% by 2002 and thereafter. 
The discount rate and salary increase rate were assumed to be 8.5% and 5.0%, 
respectively, as of January 1, 1993. The discount rate and salary increase 
rate are assumed to be 7.25% and 4.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 1993. 
If the health care cost trend rates were increased by one percentage point, 
the accumulated postretirement benefit health care 
obligation, excluding discontinued chemicals operations, as of December 31, 
1993 would increase by approximately $265 million while the net periodic 
postretirement health care benefit cost for the year then ended would increase 
by approximately $20 million.

A few of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries have supplemental health benefit 
plans for certain retirees. The cost of these programs is not significant to 
the Company.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112, Employers' 
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits. Adoption of SFAS No. 112 requires the 
Company to recognize the obligation to provide certain benefits to former or 
inactive employees before retirement. The obligation including discontinued 
operations as of January 1, 1993 has been recognized as a cumulative charge of 
$190 million ($117 million after-tax). The amount applicable to discontinued 
chemicals operations was $47 million ($29 million after-tax). Adoption of SFAS 
No. 112 did not have a material effect on the Company's earnings before 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

In conjunction with the Company's announced intention to refocus its attention 
on its consumer and commercial imaging businesses, the Company has changed its 
segments for financial reporting purposes, effective with the second quarter 
of 1994. The Consumer Imaging business unit, which was previously reported in 
the former Imaging segment, is now reported as a separate segment. The new 
Commercial Imaging segment includes the other business units from the former 
Imaging segment, the business units from the former Information segment, 
digital and applied imaging operations and the Health Sciences business unit, 
which was previously included in the Health segment. Data for prior periods 
have been restated to conform with the 1994 presentation.

The products of each segment are manufactured and marketed in the U.S. and in 
other parts of the world. The Consumer Imaging segment includes amateur 
films, photographic papers, chemicals and equipment for photographic imaging. 
The Commercial Imaging segment includes motion picture, professional and 
graphic arts films, microfilms, copiers, printers and other equipment for 
information management. Sales between segments are made on a basis intended 
to reflect the market value of the products.

Sales are reported in the geographic area where they originate. Transfers 
among geographic areas are made on a basis intended to reflect the market 
value of the products, recognizing prevailing market prices and distributor 
discounts. The parent company's equity in the net assets of subsidiaries 
outside the U.S. was as follows:

STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

The 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan provides for a variety of awards 
to key employees. Some of these awards are based upon performance criteria 
relating to the Company established by the Executive Compensation and 
Development Committee of the Board of Directors.

The 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan provides that options can be 
granted through January 31, 1995, to key employees for the purchase of up to 
16,000,000 shares of Kodak common stock at an option price not less than 50 
percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the stock option's 
grant. No options below fair market value have been granted to date. Options 
with dividend equivalents were awarded during 1993, 1992 and 1991 under the 
1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan. Accruals under this plan amounted 
to $5 million in 1993, $5 million in 1992 and $4 million in 1991. The 1990 
Plan also provides for the granting of Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) either 
in tandem with options or freestanding. SARs allow optionees to receive a 
payment equal to the appreciation in market value of a stated number of shares 
of Kodak common stock from the SARs exercise price to the market value on the 
date of its exercise. Exercise of a tandem SAR requires the optionee to 
surrender the related option. At December 31, 1993, there were 195,750 tandem 
SARs and 344,539 freestanding SARs outstanding at option prices ranging from 
$30.25 to $43.18.

The 1985 Stock Option Plan provided that options could be granted through 1989 
to key employees for the purchase of up to 6,000,000 (prior to giving effect 
to the 3-for-2 partial stock split in 1987) shares of Kodak common stock at an 
option price not less than the per share fair market value at the time the 
option was granted. Options granted have maximum durations of 7 or 10 years 
from the date of grant but may expire sooner if the optionee's employment 
terminates. The 1985 Plan also provided for the granting of SARs either in 
tandem with options or freestanding. At December 31, 1993, there were 610,975 
tandem SARs and 69,050 freestanding SARs outstanding at option prices ranging 
from $33.79 to $39.53.

Summarized option data as of December 31, 1993 are as follows:

</TABLE>

As a result of the spin-off of the Company's worldwide chemical business all 
outstanding stock options were adjusted as to option price and number of 
shares granted.

At December 31, 1993, 13,512,298 of the options outstanding were exercisable.

EASTMAN KODAK CREDIT CORPORATION

The primary business purpose of Eastman Kodak Credit Corporation (EKCC), 
formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was to enhance the 
marketing capabilities of the Company by providing long-term product financing 
to Kodak customers. 

Summarized financial information for EKCC is as follows:

Earnings before taxes 25 21 
Net earnings 18 14 

The Company sold its investment in EKCC on December 31, 1992 to General 
Electric Capital. The divestiture was the primary reason for the decrease in 
consolidated assets and liabilities from year-end 1991, when EKCC had total 
assets of $951 million and total indebtedness of $865 million.
- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEGAL MATTERS

The Company is in discussion with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
and the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of 
Justice concerning the EPA/NEIC (National Enforcement Investigations Center) 
investigation of the Company's Kodak Park site in Rochester, New York. As a 
result of the investigation, the Company expects to incur a civil fine of at 
least $100,000 for violations of federal environmental laws and regulations.

The Company is participating in the EPA's Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) 
Section 8(e) Compliance Audit Program. As a participant, the Company has 
agreed to audit its files for materials which under current EPA guidelines 
would be subject to notification under Section 8(e) of TSCA and to pay 
stipulated penalties for each report submitted under this program. The 
Company anticipates that its liability under the Program will be $1,000,000.

In addition to the foregoing environmental actions, the Company has been 
designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the 
Superfund law), or under similar state laws, for environmental assessment and 
cleanup costs as the result of the Company's alleged arrangements for disposal 
of hazardous substances at fewer than twenty Superfund sites. With respect to 
each of these sites, the Company's actual or potential allocated share of 
responsibility is small. Furthermore, numerous other PRPs have similarly been 
designated at these sites and, although the law imposes joint and several 
liability on PRPs, as a practical matter costs are shared with other PRPs. 
Settlements and costs paid by the Company in Superfund matters to date have 
not been material. Future costs are also not expected to be material to the 
Company's financial condition or results of operations.

The Company and its subsidiary companies are involved in lawsuits, claims, 
investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, commercial, 
environmental, and health and safety matters, which are being handled and 
defended in the ordinary course of business. There are no such matters 
pending that the Company and its General Counsel expect to be material in 
relation to the Company's business, financial condition or results of 
operations.
- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Company redeemed the zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due 
2011 on April 1, 1994, and during the second quarter, redeemed the 6 3/8% 
convertible subordinated debentures due 2001.

During the second quarter of 1994, the Company terminated the Master Lease 
agreement by purchasing approximately $300 million of equipment it has been 
leasing. Also during the second quarter of 1994, the Company terminated a 
Sale of Receivables program.

On August 12, 1994, the Company purchased from Actava Group Inc. its 50% 
interest in Qualex Inc. for $150 million, $50 million to Actava at the closing 
and the remaining $100 million without interest in two installments over the 
next twelve months.

On October 3, 1994, the Company announced a tender offer for up to $4.8 
billion of its outstanding long-term borrowings. On October 20, 1994, the 
Company announced that $2.7 billion of the possible $4.8 billion was tendered 
during the tender offer period which ended on that date. In connection with 
the debt paydown program, the Company incurred pre-tax losses related to the 
tender offer of approximately $160 million which will result in an 
extraordinary charge in the fourth quarter of 1994. The Company has also 
unwound substantially all of the interest rate derivatives associated with its 
debt issues. The Company incurred pre-tax losses related to the unwind of the 
derivatives of approximately $160 million in September, which has been 
deferred, and approximately $60 million in October. These losses will be 
charged to extraordinary and other charges in the fourth quarter of 1994 along 
with the losses on the debt.

KODAK COMPLETES DIVESTITURE OF
TWO MORE NON-IMAGING BUSINESSES

Clinical Diagnostics Div. Sold to Johnson & Johnson;
L&F Products 'DIY' Businesses to Forstmann Little

Rochester, N.Y., Dec. 1 - Eastman Kodak Company today announced the completion 
of two more transactions in its divestiture program; the sale of its Clinical 
Diagnostics Division to Johnson & Johnson, and the sale of the "do-it-yourself" 
businesses of its L&F Products subsidiary to Forstmann Little.

The closing date for each transaction was Nov. 30.

Johnson & Johnson purchased the worldwide assets of Kodak's Clinical
Diagnostics business for $1.008 billion in cash. Forstmann Little, a New York
City-based investment partnership, paid $700 million to obtain L&F Products'
"DIY" businesses.

L&F Products household products business, which Kodak has agreed to sell to
Reckitt & Colman, is the only large transaction pending completion in Kodak's 
divestiture program.

Separately, Kodak will sell its pharmaceutical research and development 
center, located near Philadelphia, Pa., and its NanoSystems unit. NanoSystems 
is a technology development unit established to commercialize pharmaceutical 
products based on Kodak's patented small particle technology.

part of the Seller or Kodak except to the extent that
the breach of such promise, covenant or warranty would

warranty made by Seller and Kodak in Article III of the
Agreement and/or a breach of Article V of the
Agreement. Purchaser agrees that any claim in respect
of such a breach or alleged breach shall be brought as
a claim for indemnification in accordance with the
