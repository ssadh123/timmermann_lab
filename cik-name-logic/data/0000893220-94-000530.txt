The Owner Trustee does hereby constitute the Indenture Trustee
the true and lawful attorney of the Owner Trustee, irrevocably, with full power
(in the name of the Owner Trustee or otherwise) to ask, require, demand,
receive, compound and give acquittance for any and all moneys and claims for
moneys due and to become due to the Owner Trustee (other than Excluded

executed on behalf of the Owner Trustee, the Equipment Note shall be valid
nevertheless.

(d) At any time and from time to time after the execution

above and authenticated by or on behalf of the Indenture Trustee as provided in
clause (d) above. Such signatures shall be conclusive evidence that such
Equipment Note has been duly executed under this Indenture.

(f) The Owner Trustee shall issue and execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Equipment Notes for
original issuance upon payment to the Indenture Trustee of an amount equal to

Section 2.02. Payment from Indenture Estate Only. All
payments to be made under the Equipment Notes and this Indenture shall be made
only from the income and the proceeds from the Indenture Estate and only to the
extent that the Indenture Trustee shall have received sufficient income or

Section 2.03. Method of Payment. (a) The principal of and
Premium, if any, and interest on each Equipment Note will be payable in U.S.

Equipment Note to the contrary, the Indenture Trustee will pay, or cause to be
paid, if so requested by any Holder by written notice to the Owner Trustee and
<PAGE> 13
I-8

the Indenture Trustee, all amounts payable by the Owner Trustee hereunder to
such Holder or a nominee therefor either (i) by transferring by wire in
immediately available funds to an account maintained by such Holder with a bank
in the United States the amount to be distributed to such Holder or (ii) by
mailing a check denominated in U.S. dollars to such Holder at such address as
such Holder shall have specified in such notice, in any case without any
presentment or surrender of any Equipment Note, except that the Holder shall
surrender such Equipment Note to the Indenture Trustee upon payment in full of

payable to such Holder hereunder or under the Equipment Note.

(b) Whenever the date scheduled for any payment to be
made hereunder (including, without limitation, any payment made under Section
5.04) or under any Equipment Note shall not be a Business Day, then such
payment need not be made on such scheduled date but may be made on the next
succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such
scheduled date and (provided such payment is made on such next succeeding
Business Day) no interest shall accrue on the amount of such payment from and
after such scheduled date to the time of such payment on such next succeeding
Business Day.

(c) Any interest payable on any Equipment Note that is not
punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein
called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder
thereof on the relevant Record Date by virtue of his having been the Holder
thereof on such date; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Indenture
Trustee, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:

(1) The Indenture Trustee may elect to make payment of any
Defaulted Interest to the Holders as determined at the close of
business on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted
Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner: the Indenture
Trustee shall notify the Paying Agent in writing of the amount of
Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Equipment Note and the
date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Indenture
Trustee shall make arrangements to set aside an amount of money equal
to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such
Defaulted Interest, prior to the date of the proposed payment, to be
held in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled to such
Defaulted Interest as this clause provides and shall fix a special
record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be
not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of
the proposed payment. The Indenture Trustee shall promptly notify the
Owner Trustee and the Registrar (with a copy to the Company) of such
special record date and shall cause notice of the proposed payment of
such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor to be
mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Holder at his address as
it appears in the Register, not less than 10 days prior to such
special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted
Interest and the special record date therefor having been mailed, as
<PAGE> 14

aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Holders on
such special record date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to
the following clause (2).

(2) In the event that the Indenture Trustee shall not have
elected to make payment of Defaulted Interest pursuant to the
foregoing clause (1), the Indenture Trustee may make, or cause to be
made, payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which
the Equipment Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be
required by such exchange, if such manner of payment shall be deemed
practicable by the Indenture Trustee.

Section 2.04. Application of Payments to Principal Amount and
Interest. In the case of each Equipment Note, each payment of principal
thereof and Premium, if any, and interest thereon shall be applied,

of such Equipment Note then due thereunder, and

(C) third, to the payment of any Premium then due thereon.

Section 2.05. Termination of Interest in Indenture Estate. A
Holder shall have no further interest in, or other right with respect to, the
Indenture Estate when and if the principal amount of and interest on all
Equipment Notes held by such Holder and all other sums payable to such Holder
hereunder and under such Equipment Notes and under the other Operative
Agreements shall have been paid in full.

Section 2.06. Transfer of Equipment Notes. The Indenture
Trustee shall maintain at its corporate trust administration office in
Wilmington, Delaware, or in the city in which the corporate trust office of a
successor Indenture Trustee is located, a register for the purpose of
registering transfers and exchanges of Equipment Notes. A Holder intending to
transfer such Equipment Note to a new payee, or to exchange any Equipment Note
or Equipment Notes held by it for an Equipment Note or Equipment Notes of a
different denomination or denominations, may surrender such Equipment Note or
Equipment Notes to the Indenture Trustee at such principal corporate trust
administration office of the Indenture Trustee, together with a written request
from such Holder for the issuance of a new Equipment Note or Equipment Notes,
specifying the denomination or denominations (each of which shall be not less
than $1,000,000 or such smaller denomination as may be necessary due to the
original issuance of Equipment Notes of the applicable maturity in an aggregate
principal amount not evenly divisible by $1,000,000) of the same, and, in the
case of a surrender for registration of transfer, the name and address of the
transferee or transferees.
<PAGE> 15
I-10

Promptly upon receipt of such documents, the Owner Trustee will issue, and the
Indenture Trustee will authenticate, a new Equipment Note or Equipment Notes in
the same aggregate principal amount and dated the same date or dates and of the
same Series as, with the same payment schedule, in the form set forth in
Exhibit A, in the same maturity and bearing the same interest rate as the
Equipment Note or Equipment Notes surrendered, in such denomination or
denominations and payable to such payee or payees as shall be specified in the
written request from such Holder. All Equipment Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Equipment Notes shall be the valid
obligations of the Owner Trustee evidencing the same respective obligations,
and entitled to the same security and benefits under this Indenture, as the
Equipment Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
The Indenture Trustee shall make a notation on each new Equipment Note or
Equipment Notes of the amount of all payments or prepayments of principal and
interest previously made on the old Equipment Note or Equipment Notes with
respect to which such new Equipment Note or Equipment Notes is or are issued.
From time to time, the Indenture Trustee will provide the Owner Trustee and
Lessee with such information as it may request as to the registered Holders of
Equipment Notes. The Owner Trustee shall not be required to exchange any
surrendered Equipment Notes as above provided during the ten-day period
preceding the due date of any payment on such Equipment Notes.

Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of
an Equipment Note, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee may deem and
treat the registered holder of such Equipment Note as the absolute owner and
Holder of such Equipment Note for the purpose of receiving payment of all
amounts payable with respect to such Equipment Note and for all other purposes
and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

The Indenture Trustee will promptly notify the Owner Trustee
and Lessee of each request for a registration of transfer of an Equipment Note.
The Indenture Trustee will promptly cancel and destroy all Equipment Notes
surrendered for transfer pursuant to this Section 2.06.

Section 2.07. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Equipment
Notes. If any Equipment Note shall become mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen, the Owner Trustee shall, upon the written request of the Holder of such
Equipment Note, issue, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver
in replacement thereof, a new Equipment Note in the form set forth in Exhibit
A, payable to the same Holder in the same principal amount, of the same Series,
of the same maturity, with the same payment schedule, bearing the same interest
rate and dated the same date as the Equipment Note so mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen. If the Equipment Note being replaced has become mutilated,
such Equipment Note shall be surrendered to the Indenture Trustee and forwarded
to the Owner Trustee by the Indenture Trustee. If the Equipment Note being
replaced has been destroyed, lost or stolen, the Holder of such Equipment Note
shall furnish to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee such security or
indemnity as may be required by them to save the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee harmless and evidence satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and
the
<PAGE> 16
I-11

Indenture Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Equipment Note and
of the ownership thereof.

Section 2.08. Payment of Transfer Taxes. Upon the transfer
of any Equipment Note or Equipment Notes pursuant to Section 2.06, the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may require from the party requesting such new
Equipment Note or Equipment Notes payment of a sum to reimburse the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee for, or to provide funds for the payment of,
any tax or other governmental charge in connection therewith.

Section 2.09. Cancellation. The Registrar and any Paying
Agent shall forward to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation all Equipment
Notes surrendered to them for replacement, registration of transfer, exchange
or payment (including through redemption). The Indenture Trustee shall cancel
all Equipment Notes surrendered for replacement, registration of transfer,
exchange, payment or cancellation and shall destroy cancelled Equipment Notes.

Section 2.10. Registrar and Paying Agent; Ownership of
Equipment Notes. (a) The Indenture Trustee shall maintain, or cause to be
maintained, an office or agency where the Equipment Notes may be presented for
registration of transfer or for exchange (in such capacity, the "Registrar")
and an office or agency where (subject to Sections 2.03 and 2.06) the Equipment
Notes may be presented for payment (in such capacity, the "Paying Agent"). The
Registrar shall keep a register (the "Register") with respect to the Equipment
Notes and to their transfer and exchange. The Indenture Trustee may appoint
one or more co-registrars ("Co-Registrars") and one or more additional Paying
Agents for the Equipment Notes, and the Indenture Trustee may terminate the
appointment of any Co-Registrar or additional Paying Agent at any time upon
written notice to such Co-Registrar or Paying Agent. The term "Registrar"
includes any Co-Registrar. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional
Paying Agent.

The Indenture Trustee shall initially act as Registrar and 
Paying Agent for the Equipment Notes.

(b) Ownership of the Equipment Notes shall be proved solely
by the Register. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of any
Equipment Note, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Registrar and the Company may deem and treat the Person in whose name any
Equipment Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Equipment Note for
the purpose of receiving paying of principal of and Premium, if any, and
(subject to Section 2.03(c)) interest on such Equipment Note and for all other
purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Equipment Note shall be overdue, and
none of the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Registrar, the Company nor the Owner Participant shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

(b) Within a reasonable period of time after the end of each
calendar year but not later than the latest date permitted by law, the
Indenture Trustee shall furnish to each Person who at any time during such
calendar year was a Holder of record a statement containing the sum of the
amounts determined pursuant to clauses (a)(i) and (a)(ii) with respect to the
Indenture Estate for such calendar year or, in the event such Person was a
Holder of record during a portion of such calendar year, for the applicable
portion of such year, and such other items as are readily available to the
Indenture Trustee and which a Holder shall reasonably request as necessary for
the purpose of such Holder's preparation of its Federal income tax returns.

aggregate redemption price equal to (1) an amount equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
such Equipment Notes as at such Redemption Date (after deducting
therefrom the principal installment, if any, due on the Redemption
Date) by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be one and the
denominator of which shall be the number of Items of Equipment related

prior the date of such redemption and (2) the aggregate amount of

All notices of redemption shall state:
<PAGE> 23

(1) the Redemption Date,

(2) the redemption price (other than the amount of Premium,

ARTICLE V

REMEDIES OF THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE
UPON AN EVENT OF ACCELERATION

Section 5.01. Events of Acceleration. The following events
shall constitute "Events of Acceleration" under this Indenture (whether any
such event shall be voluntary or involuntary or come about or be effected by
operation of law or pursuant to or in compliance with any judgment, decree or
order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or
governmental body):

(a) an Event of Default, other than an Event of Default
arising by reason of nonpayment of, or failure to perform with respect
to, any Excluded Payment when due (subject to the cure rights of the
Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee under Section 5.04);

(b) the Owner Trustee shall default in making any payment
when due of principal of, Premium, if any, or interest on any
Equipment Note and such default shall continue for more than 10 days
after the same shall have become due and payable;

(c) any failure by the Owner Trustee, in its individual
capacity or as Owner Trustee, to observe or perform any covenant or
obligation required of it under the Indenture, or any failure by the
Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant to observe or perform any
covenant or obligation required of either of them pursuant to Section
7(c), 7(f), 7(g), 8(b)(vii) or 8(f) of the Participation Agreement,
or, to the extent that the interest of the Indenture Trustee or any
Holder of Outstanding Equipment Notes is materially and adversely
affected by such failure, in Sections 4.01(a), 5.01 and 10.01 of the
Trust Agreement if, but only if, such failure is not remedied within a
period of 30 days after there has been given to the Owner Trustee
(with a copy to the Owner Participant) or the Owner Participant, as
the case may be, by registered or certified mail, a written notice
specifying such failure and requiring it to be remedied and stating
that such notice is a "Notice of Acceleration" hereunder, by the
Indenture Trustee or by the Holders of at least 25% in principal
amount of Equipment Notes (with a copy to the Indenture Trustee);
provided, however, that the Owner Trustee shall be given an additional
150 days to correct such failure if the Owner Trustee is diligently
proceeding to correct such failure at the end of the original 30-day
period and reasonably expects to correct such failure within such
additional period; and provided further that no Event of Acceleration
shall arise under this Section 5.01(c) solely as a result of a failure
by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant to observe or perform
any covenant contained in Section 7(c) or 8(f) of the Participation
Agreement if Lessee shall have taken all action necessary to
<PAGE> 25
I-20

discharge all Lessor's Liens referred to in such Sections and shall
have held the Indenture Trustee and the Indenture Estate harmless from
all claims, losses and expenses arising from the failure of the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant to observe and perform any such
covenant;

(d) any failure by the Owner Trustee, in its individual
capacity or as trustee, to observe or perform any other covenant or
obligation of the Owner Trustee contained in the Participation
Agreement, or any failure by the Owner Participant to observe or
perform any other covenant or obligation of the Owner Participant
contained in the Participation Agreement which failure, in any case
and either individually or together with other then existing failures,
shall have a material adverse effect on the rights and interests of
the Indenture Trustee or the Holders and is not remedied within a
period of 30 days after there has been given to the Owner Trustee and
the Owner Participant by registered or certified mail, a written
notice specifying such failure and requiring it to be remedied and
stating that such notice is a "Notice of Acceleration" hereunder, by
the Indenture Trustee or by the Holders of at least 25% in principal
amount of Outstanding Equipment Notes; provided, however, that the
Owner Trustee shall be given an additional 150 days to correct such
failure if the Owner Trustee is diligently proceeding to correct such
failure at the end of the original 30- day period and reasonably
expects to correct such failure within such additional period;

(e) any material representation or warranty made by the
Owner Trustee, in its individual capacity or as Owner Trustee, or by
the Owner Participant under the Participation Agreement, or by the
Owner Trustee hereunder, or by the Owner Trustee, in its individual
capacity or as Owner Trustee, or by the Owner Participant in any
document or certificate furnished to the Indenture Trustee in
connection herewith or therewith or pursuant hereto or thereto, shall
prove at any time to have been incorrect in any material respect as of
the date made and such incorrectness shall continue unremedied for a
period of 30 days after there has been given, by registered or
certified mail, to the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant by the
Indenture Trustee, or to the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant and
the Indenture Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal
amount of Outstanding Equipment Notes, a written notice specifying
such incorrectness and requiring it to be remedied and stating that
such notice is a "Notice of Acceleration" hereunder; provided,
however, that the Owner Trustee shall be given an additional 150 days
to cure such inaccuracy if the Owner Trustee is diligently pursuing
such cure at the end of the original 30-day period and reasonably
expects such cure can be effected within such additional period;

(f) either the Indenture Estate or the Owner Trustee with
respect thereto (and not in its individual capacity) or the Owner
Participant shall (i) file, or consent by answer or otherwise to the
filing against it of a petition for relief or reorganization or
arrangement or any other petition in bankruptcy, for liquidation or to
take
<PAGE> 26
I-21

advantage of any bankruptcy or insolvency law of any jurisdiction,
(ii) make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors or (iii)
consent to the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other
officer with similar powers of itself or any substantial part of its
property; provided that no Event of Acceleration shall arise under
this Section 5.01(f) solely in the case of the Owner Participant if
the Owner Participant provides an Opinion of Counsel, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee, to the effect that
such bankruptcy or insolvency of the Owner Participant shall not
adversely affect the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Estate or any
Holder; or

(g) a court or governmental authority of competent
jurisdiction shall enter an order appointing, without consent by the
Indenture Estate or the Owner Trustee with respect thereto (and not in
its individual capacity) or the Owner Participant, as the case may be,
a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers
with respect to it or with respect to any substantial part of its
property, or constituting an order for relief or approving a petition
for relief or reorganization or any other petition in bankruptcy or
for liquidation or to take advantage of any bankruptcy or insolvency
law of any jurisdiction, or ordering the dissolution, winding-up or
liquidation of the Indenture Estate or the Owner Trustee with respect
thereto (and not in its individual capacity) or the Owner Participant,
as the case may be, and any such order or petition is not dismissed or
stayed within 90 days after the earlier of the entering of any such
order or the approval of any such petition; provided that no Event of
Acceleration shall arise under this Section 5.01(g) solely in the case
of the Owner Participant if the Owner Participant provides an Opinion
of Counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Indenture
Trustee, to the effect that such bankruptcy or insolvency of the Owner
Participant shall not adversely affect the Indenture Trustee, the
Indenture Estate or any Holder;

provided that any such Event of Acceleration shall be deemed to exist and
continue so long as, but only as long as, it shall not have been remedied.

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the
bankruptcy, reorganization, compromise, arrangement, insolvency, readjustment
of debt, dissolution or liquidation of the Owner Trustee, in its individual
capacity, shall not be an Event of Acceleration so long as the Owner
Participant is diligently seeking to, and does replace the then existing Owner
Trustee within sixty (60) days after the date of such Event of Acceleration,
provided, however, the Owner Participant shall not be entitled to cure such an
Event of Acceleration by replacing the then existing Owner Trustee, if the
Indenture Trustee's rights in the Indenture Estate would, in the reasonable
judgment of the Indenture Trustee, be impaired by the Owner Participant's
replacing the then existing Owner Trustee.

Section 5.02. Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. The
Indenture Trustee shall provide notice to the Owner Participant within one
Business Day of any failure
<PAGE> 27
I-22

by Lessee to make any payment of Basic Rent. If an Event of Acceleration
occurs and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, and upon the direction of
Holders of 25% aggregate principal amount of Equipment Notes Outstanding,
subject to Section 5.04, declare by notice to the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant the unpaid principal amount of all Equipment Notes then outstanding
and accrued interest thereon to be due and payable. At any time after the
Indenture Trustee has declared the unpaid principal amount of all Equipment
Notes then outstanding to be due and payable and prior to the sale of any of
the Indenture Estate pursuant to this Article V, a Majority in Interest, by
written notice to the Owner Trustee, Lessee and the Indenture Trustee, may
rescind and annul such declaration and thereby annul its consequences if: (1)
there has been paid to or deposited with the Indenture Trustee an amount
sufficient to pay all overdue installments of interest on the Equipment Notes,
and the principal of and premium, if any, on any Equipment Notes that have
become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, (2) the
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, and (3) all other
Indenture Defaults and Events of Acceleration, other than nonpayment of
principal or interest on the Equipment Notes that have become due solely
because of such acceleration, have been cured or waived.

Section 5.03. Other Remedies Available to Indenture Trustee.
(a) After an Event of Acceleration shall have occurred and so long as such
Event of Acceleration shall be continuing, then and in every such case the
Indenture Trustee, as trustee of an express trust and as assignee hereunder of
the Lease or as legal title holder hereunder of each Item of Equipment or
otherwise, may, and when required pursuant to the provisions of Article VI
shall, exercise, subject to Sections 5.04 and 5.05, any or all of the rights
and powers and pursue any and all of the remedies accorded to the Owner Trustee
pursuant to Section 15 of the Lease and this Article V, may recover judgment in
its own name as Indenture Trustee against the Indenture Estate and may take
possession of all or any part of the Indenture Estate and may exclude the Owner
Trustee and the Owner Participant and all persons claiming under any of them
wholly or partly therefrom.

(b) Subject to Sections 5.04 and 5.05, the Indenture Trustee
may, if at the time such action may be lawful and always subject to compliance
with any mandatory legal requirements, either with or without taking
possession, and either before or after taking possession, and either with or
without instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and having first given
notice of such sale by registered mail to the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant (with a copy to Lessee) once at least 30 days prior to the date of
such sale and any other notice which may be required by law, sell and dispose
of the Indenture Estate, or any part thereof or interest therein, at public
auction to the highest bidder, in one lot as an entirety or in separate lots,
and either for cash or on credit and on such terms as the Indenture Trustee may
determine, and at any place (whether or not it be the location of the Indenture
Estate or any part thereof) and time designated in the notice above referred
to; provided, however, that notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, the Indenture Trustee shall not sell any of the Indenture Estate
unless a declaration of acceleration has been made pursuant to Section 5.02.
Any such sale or sales may be adjourned from time to time
<PAGE> 28
I-23

by announcement at the time and place appointed for such sale or sales, or for
any such adjourned sale or sales, without further notice, and the Indenture
Trustee and the Holder or Holders of any Equipment Notes, or any interest
therein, may bid and become the purchaser at any such sale. The Indenture
Trustee may exercise such right without possession or production of the
Equipment Notes or proof of ownership thereof, and as representative of the
Holders may exercise such right without notice to the Holders or including the
Holders as parties to any suit or proceeding relating to foreclosure of any
property in the Indenture Estate. The Owner Trustee hereby irrevocably
constitutes the Indenture Trustee the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the
Owner Trustee (in the name of the Owner Trustee or otherwise) for the purpose
of effectuating any sale, assignment, transfer or delivery for enforcement of
the Lien created under this Indenture, whether pursuant to foreclosure or power
of sale or otherwise, to execute and deliver all such bills of sale,
assignments and other instruments as the Indenture Trustee may consider
necessary or appropriate, with full power of substitution, the Owner Trustee
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney or any substitute shall
lawfully do by virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Indenture
Trustee or any purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall ratify and confirm any such
sale, assignment, transfer or delivery, by executing and delivering to the
Indenture Trustee or such purchaser all bills of sale or other title documents,
assignments, releases and other proper instruments to effect such ratification
and confirmation as may be designated in any such request. The Indenture
Trustee agrees that the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee shall each have
the rights of a "debtor" under Section 9-505(2) of the Uniform Commercial Code
and shall be entitled to receive the notice referred to therein.

(c) Subject to Sections 5.04 and 5.05, if an Event of
Acceleration has occurred and is continuing, the Owner Trustee shall, at the
request of the Indenture Trustee, promptly execute and deliver to the Indenture
Trustee such instruments of title or other documents as the Indenture Trustee
may deem necessary or advisable to enable the Indenture Trustee or an agent or
representative designated by the Indenture Trustee, at such time or times and
place or places as the Indenture Trustee may specify, to obtain possession of
all or any part of the Indenture Estate. If the Owner Trustee shall for any
reason fail to execute and deliver such instruments and documents after such
request by the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled, in a
proceeding to which the Owner Trustee shall be a necessary party, to a judgment
for specific performance of the covenants contained in the foregoing sentence,
conferring upon the Indenture Trustee the right to immediate possession and
requiring the Owner Trustee to execute and deliver such instruments and
documents to the Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee shall also be
entitled to pursue all or any part of the Indenture Estate wherever it may be
found and may enter any of the premises of the Owner Trustee or any other
Person wherever the Indenture Estate may be or be supposed to be and search for
the Indenture Estate and take possession of any Item of Equipment pursuant to
this Section 5.03(c). The Indenture Trustee may, but shall not be obligated
to, from time to time, at the expense of the Indenture Estate, make all such
expenditures for maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations,
additions and improvements to and of the Indenture Estate as it may deem
proper. In each such case, the Indenture Trustee
<PAGE> 29
I-24

shall have the right to use, operate, store, lease, control or manage the
Indenture Estate, and to exercise all rights and powers of the Owner Trustee
relating to the Indenture Estate, as the Indenture Trustee shall deem
appropriate, including the right to enter into any and all such agreements with
respect to the use, operation, storage, leasing, control or management of the
Indenture Estate or any part thereof; and the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to collect and receive directly all tolls, rents (including Rent),
issues, profits, products, revenues and other income of the Indenture Estate
and every part thereof, without prejudice, however, to the right of the
Indenture Trustee under any provision of this Indenture to collect and receive
all cash held by, or required to be deposited with, the Indenture Trustee
hereunder. In accordance with the terms of this Section 5.03(c), such tolls,
rents (including Rent), issues, profits, products, revenues and other income
shall be applied to pay the expenses of using, operating, storing, leasing,
controlling or managing the Indenture Estate, and of all maintenance,
insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and improvements
thereto, and to make all payments which the Indenture Trustee may be required
or may elect to make, if any, for taxes, assessments, insurance or other proper
charges upon the Indenture Estate or any part thereof (including the employment
of engineers and accountants to examine, inspect and make reports upon the
properties and books and records of the Owner Trustee and, to the extent
permitted by the Lease, of Lessee), and all other payments which the Indenture
Trustee may be required or authorized to make under any provision of this
Indenture, including this Section 5.03(c), as well as just and reasonable
compensation for the services of the Indenture Trustee, and of all persons
properly engaged and employed by the Indenture Trustee.

If an Event of Acceleration occurs and is continuing and the
Indenture Trustee shall have obtained possession of an Item of Equipment, the
Indenture Trustee shall not be obligated to use or operate such Item of
Equipment or cause such Item of Equipment to be used or operated directly or
indirectly by itself or through agents or other representatives or to lease,
license or otherwise permit or provide for the use or operation of such Item of
Equipment by any other Person unless (i) the Indenture Trustee shall have been
able to obtain insurance in kinds, at rates and in amounts satisfactory to it
in its discretion to protect the Indenture Estate and the Indenture Trustee, as
trustee and individually, against any and all liability for loss or damage to
such Item of Equipment and for public liability and property damage resulting
from use or operation of such Item of Equipment and (ii) funds are available in
the Indenture Estate to pay for all such insurance or, in lieu of such
insurance, the Indenture Trustee is furnished with indemnification from the
Holders or any other Person upon terms and in amounts satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee in its discretion to protect the Indenture Estate and the
Indenture Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any and all such
liabilities.

(d) Subject to Sections 5.04 and 5.05, the Indenture Trustee
may proceed to protect and enforce this Indenture and the Equipment Notes by
suit or suits or proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether
for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or
in execution or aid of any power herein granted, or for
<PAGE> 30
I-25

foreclosure hereunder, or for the appointment of a receiver or receivers for
the Indenture Estate or any part thereof, or for the recovery of judgment for
the indebtedness secured by the Lien created under this Indenture or for the
enforcement of any other legal or equitable remedy available under applicable
law.

Section 5.04. Right to Cure; Option to Purchase; Etc. (a)
Right to Cure. If Lessee shall fail to make any payment of Basic Rent under
the Lease after the same shall become due, and if such failure of Lessee to
make payment of Basic Rent shall not constitute the fourth or subsequent
consecutive such failure or the seventh or subsequent cumulative such failure,
then so long as no Event of Acceleration with respect to the Equipment Notes
which is not an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing the
Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee may (but need not) pay to the Indenture
Trustee, at any time prior to the expiration of a period of 10 Business Days
(the "10-Business-Day Period") after the expiration of the 10-day grace period
provided in the Lease (prior to the expiration of which 10-Business-Day Period
the Indenture Trustee shall not declare the Lease in default or exercise any of
the rights, powers or remedies), an amount equal to the full amount of such
payment of Basic Rent (or, if less, the aggregate of all amounts then due and
payable hereunder or to be paid from such payment of Basic Rent to any Person
other than the Owner Trustee as certified by the Owner Participant to the
Indenture Trustee and agreed by the Indenture Trustee), together with any
interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment thereof, and such
payment by the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to cure
any Event of Acceleration that arose from such failure of Lessee (but such cure
shall not relieve Lessee of any of its obligations). If Lessee shall fail to
perform or observe any covenant, condition or agreement to be performed or
observed by it under the Lease, and if (but only if) the performance or
observance thereof can be effected by the payment of money alone (it being
understood that actions such as the obtaining of insurance and the procurement
of maintenance services can be so effected), then as long as no other Event of
Acceleration with respect to the Equipment Notes which is not an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Owner Participant or the
Owner Trustee may (but need not) pay to the Indenture Trustee (or to such other
person as may be entitled to receive the same), at any time prior to the
expiration of a period of 30 days (the "30-Day Period") after the expiration of
the grace period provided with respect to such failure on the part of Lessee in
the Lease (prior to the expiration of which 30-Day Period the Indenture Trustee
shall not declare such Lease in default or exercise any of the rights, powers
or remedies pursuant to the Lease or this Indenture), all sums necessary to
effect the performance or observance of such covenant or agreement of Lessee,
together with any interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment
thereof, and such payment by the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee shall
be deemed to cure any Event of Acceleration with respect to the Equipment Notes
that arose from such failure of Lessee (but such cure shall not relieve Lessee
of any of its obligations). Upon any payment of Basic Rent by any Owner
Participant or Owner Trustee in accordance with the second sentence of this
Section 5.04, or upon any payment of any other sums by any Owner Participant or
Owner Trustee in accordance with the third sentence of this Section 5.04, such
Owner Participant or Owner Trustee shall, to the
<PAGE> 31
I-26

extent of their respective payments, be subrogated, in the case of any such
payment in accordance with such second sentence, to the rights of the Indenture
Trustee, as assignee under this Indenture of the Owner Trustee, or, in the case
of any such payment in accordance with such third sentence, to the rights of
the Indenture Trustee or such other Person, as the case may be, which actually
received such payment, to receive such payment of Basic Rent or such other
payment, as the case may be (and any interest due thereon on account of the
delayed payment thereof), and shall be entitled to receive such payment upon
its receipt by the Indenture Trustee or such other Person, as aforesaid (but in
each case only if all amounts of principal of, and Premium, if any, and
interest at the time due and payable on, the Equipment Notes together with
interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment thereof shall have been
paid in full); provided that neither the Owner Participant nor the Owner
Trustee shall attempt to recover any such amount paid by it on behalf of
Lessee pursuant to this Section 5.04 except by demanding of Lessee payment of
such amount or by commencing an action against Lessee to require the payment of
such amount pursuant to the Lease.

The Indenture Trustee shall provide notice to the Owner
Participant and the Owner Trustee of any failure of Lessee to make any payment
of Basic Rent under the Lease and any failure by Lessee to perform or observe
any covenant, condition or agreement to be performed or observed by it under
such Lease known by it promptly after such failure; provided that neither the
10-Day Period nor the 30-Day Period shall commence until such notice has been
given. For all purposes of this Indenture, neither the Indenture Trustee nor
the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have knowledge of any fact unless one of
its Responsible Officers shall have actual knowledge.

(b) Option to Purchase Equipment Notes. In the event
that (i) at any time one or more Events of Acceleration shall have occurred and
any such Event of Acceleration shall have continued for a period of 90 days or
more (but less than a period of one year), during which time the Equipment
Notes shall not have been accelerated pursuant to Section 5.02, or (ii) (x) the
Equipment Notes shall have been accelerated pursuant to Section 5.02 or (y) at
any time one or more Events of Acceleration shall have occurred and any such
Event of Acceleration shall have continued for a period of one year or more,
during which time the Equipment Notes shall not have been accelerated pursuant
to Section 5.02, the Owner Trustee may, at its option, give notice to the
Indenture Trustee that the Owner Trustee will redeem all Equipment Notes then
Outstanding, which redemption shall be pursuant to clause (D) of Section 4.02
and concurrently with such notice, the Owner Trustee will deposit with the
Indenture Trustee, whether or not an Event of Acceleration is then continuing,
an amount sufficient to redeem at the applicable redemption price all Equipment
Notes then Outstanding (including, in the case of a redemption pursuant to
clause (i) of this Section 5.04(b), the estimated Premium) and to pay the
Indenture Trustee all amounts then due it hereunder, which funds shall be held
by the Indenture Trustee as provided in Section 7.04(a). Upon the receipt of
such funds, the Indenture Trustee will terminate any foreclosure proceedings
then in progress. If such notice is given, the Owner Trustee further agrees
that it will deposit or
<PAGE> 32
I-27

cause to be deposited with the Indenture Trustee, on or prior to the Business
Day preceding the applicable Redemption Date, whether or not an Event of
Acceleration is then continuing, funds sufficient, when added to the funds
already held by the Indenture Trustee for such purpose, to redeem at the
applicable redemption price (including the Premium, if any, actually payable in
respect thereof) on such Redemption Date all Equipment then Outstanding and to
pay the Indenture Trustee all amounts then due it hereunder.

(c) Exercise of Remedies Under Lease. Anything in this
Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the Indenture Trustee shall not be
entitled to exercise any remedy hereunder as a result of an Event of
Acceleration which arises solely by reason of one or more events or
circumstances which constitute an Event of Default unless the Indenture Trustee
as security assignee of the Owner Trustee shall have exercised or concurrently
be exercising one or more of the remedies provided for in Section 15 of the
Lease, provided that the requirement to exercise such remedies under the Lease
shall not apply in circumstances where the Indenture Trustee is, and has been
for a continuous period in excess of 60 days, involuntarily stayed or
prohibited by applicable law or court order from exercising such remedies under
the Lease (provided that the foregoing proviso shall not be given effect in the
following situations: (A) Lessee's agreement with the approval of the relevant
court to perform the Lease in accordance with Section 1168(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code or an extension with the consent of the Indenture Trustee of the 60-day
period specified therein pursuant to Section 1168(b) of the Bankruptcy Code,
(B) Lessee's assumption with the approval of the relevant court of the Lease
pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or (C) the Indenture Trustee's
own failure to give any requisite notice to any Person), it being understood
that references in this sentence to particular sections of the Bankruptcy Code
as in effect on the date hereof shall include any substantially similar
successor provisions.

Section 5.05. Rights of Lessee. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Indenture, including, without limitation, Section 5.03, so
long as no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
neither the Indenture Trustee nor the Owner Trustee shall take any action
contrary to, or disturb, Lessee's, sublessee's or user's rights under the
Lease, except in accordance with the provisions of the Lease, including,
without limitation, (i) the right to receive all monies due and payable to it
in accordance with the provisions of the Lease and (ii) Lessee's, sublessee's
or user's rights to possession and use of, and of quiet enjoyment of, the Items
of Equipment.

Section 5.06. Waiver of Existing Defaults. A Majority in
Interest by notice to the Indenture Trustee on behalf of all Holders may waive
any past default hereunder and its consequences, except a default: (i) in the
payment of the principal of, Premium, if any, or interest on any Equipment
Note, or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article
IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each
Equipment Note affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to
exist, and any Event of Acceleration arising therefrom shall be deemed to have
been cured for every
<PAGE> 33
I-28

purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Section 5.07. Remedies Cumulative. Each and every right,
power and remedy herein given to the Indenture Trustee specifically or
otherwise in this Indenture shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to
every other right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now or
hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and each and every right,
power and remedy whether specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be
exercised from time to time and as often and in such order as may be deemed
expedient by the Indenture Trustee, and the exercise or the beginning of the
exercise of any power or remedy shall not be construed to be a waiver of the
right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other right, power or
remedy. No delay or omission by the Indenture Trustee in the exercise of any
right, remedy or power or in the pursuance of any remedy shall impair any such
right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the
part of the Owner Trustee or Lessee or to be an acquiescence therein.

Section 5.08. Waiver of Owner Trustee. To the extent now or
at any time hereafter enforceable under applicable law, the Owner Trustee
covenants that it will not at any time insist upon or plead, or in any manner
whatsoever claim or take any benefit or advantage of or from any law now or
hereafter in force providing for the valuation or appraisement of the Indenture
Estate or any part thereof, prior to any sale or sales thereof to be made
pursuant to any provision herein contained, or prior to any applicable decree,
judgment or order of any court of competent jurisdiction; nor, after such sale
or sales, claim or exercise any right under any statute now or hereafter made
or enacted by any state or otherwise to redeem the property so sold or any part
thereof, and hereby expressly waives for itself and on behalf of each and every
Person, except decree or judgment creditors of the Owner Trustee acquiring any
interest in or title to the Indenture Estate or any part thereof subsequent to
the date of this Indenture, all benefit and advantage of any such law or laws,
and covenants that it will not invoke or use any such law or laws, but will
suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law or
laws had been made or enacted. Nothing in this Section 5.08 shall be deemed to
be a waiver by the Owner Trustee of its rights under Section 5.04.

The Indenture Trustee may maintain such a pleading, or, in any
manner whatsoever, claim or take any benefit or advantage of or from any law
now or hereafter in force even if it does not possess any of the Equipment
Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission
by the Indenture Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy
accruing upon an Event of Acceleration under this Indenture shall not impair
the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in such Event of
Acceleration.

Section 5.09. Control by Majority. (a) A Majority in
Interest may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the
<PAGE> 34
I-29

Indenture Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it by this
Indenture. However, the Indenture Trustee may refuse to follow any direction
that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that is unduly prejudicial to the
rights of the Holders so affected, or that may subject the Indenture Trustee to
personal liability.

(b) The Owner Trustee may pursuant to the direction and
instruction of the Owner Participant by delivery of written notice (in the form
of an Officer's Certificate) to the Indenture Trustee set a record date to
determine the Holders entitled to give any consent, request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, waiver or other act. Such record date shall
be the record date specified in such notice which shall be a date not more than
30 days prior to the first solicitation of Holders in connection therewith. If
such a record date is fixed, such consent, request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, waiver or other act may be given before or after such record
date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record
date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether
Holders holding the requisite proportion of certificates have authorized or
agreed or consented to such consent, request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, waiver or other act, and for that purpose the Equipment Notes
outstanding shall be computed as of such record date; provided that no such
consent, request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, waiver or other act
by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall
become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than
one year after the record date.

Section 5.10. Limitation on Suits by Holders of Equipment
Notes. A Holder of an Equipment Note may pursue a remedy under this Indenture
or thereunder only if:

(1) such Holder gives to the Indenture Trustee written
notice of a continuing Event of Acceleration under this Indenture;

(2) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Equipment Notes outstanding make a written request to
the Indenture Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Indenture Trustee
indemnity satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee against any loss,
liability or expense to be, or which may be incurred by the Indenture
Trustee in pursuing the remedy;

(4) the Indenture Trustee does not comply with the
request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of
indemnity; and

(5) during such 60-day period a Majority in Interest does
not give the Indenture Trustee a direction inconsistent with the
request.
<PAGE> 35
I-30

A Holder of an Equipment Note may not use this Indenture to
prejudice the rights of another Holder thereof or to obtain a preference or
priority over another Holder.

Section 5.11. Rights of Holders of Equipment Notes to Receive
Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of
any Holder to receive payment of principal of, Premium, if any, and interest on
its Equipment Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such
Equipment Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or
after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the
consent of such Holder.

Section 5.12. Indenture Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
The Indenture Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Indenture Trustee and of any Holder allowed in any judicial proceedings
relating to any obligor on the Equipment Notes, its creditors, or its property.

Section 5.13. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this
Indenture agree, and each Holder of an Equipment Note by its acceptance thereof
shall be deemed to have agreed, that in any suit for the enforcement of any
right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Indenture
Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Indenture Trustee, a court in
its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and the court in its discretion may
assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any
party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of
the claims or defense made by the party litigant. This Section 5.13 does not
apply to a suit instituted by the Indenture Trustee, a suit instituted by a
Holder for the enforcement of the payment of principal of or Premium, if any,
or interest on such Equipment Note, on or after the respective due dates
expressed in such Equipment Note, or a suit by a Holder or Holders of more than
10% in aggregate principal amount of Equipment Notes.

ARTICLE VI

DUTIES OF THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE

Section 6.01. Action upon Event of Acceleration. If any
payments of Interim Interest or Basic Rent or payments of the principal or
interest or Premium, if any, on the Equipment Notes due and payable on any
Interest Payment Date shall not have been paid in full on such Interest Payment
Date, the Indenture Trustee shall give telephonic notice within one Business
Day (followed by prompt written notice) to the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Participant and Lessee specifying the amount and nature of such deficiency in
payment. In the event the Indenture Trustee shall have "actual knowledge" of
an Event of Acceleration or an Indenture Default, the Indenture Trustee shall
give prompt notice of such Event of
<PAGE> 36
I-31

Acceleration or Indenture Default or condition to Lessee, the Owner Trustee,
the Owner Participant and each Holder by telegram, telex, or telephone (to be
promptly confirmed in writing). In the event the Owner Trustee shall have
"actual knowledge" of an Event of Acceleration or an Indenture Default, the
Owner Trustee shall give notice of such Event of Acceleration or Indenture
Default in the same manner to Lessee, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Participant and each Holder. Subject to the terms of Section 6.03, the
Indenture Trustee shall take such action, or refrain from taking such action,
with respect to such Event of Acceleration or Indenture Default as the
Indenture Trustee shall be instructed in writing by a Majority in Interest. If
the Indenture Trustee shall not have received instructions as above provided
within 20 days after the mailing of notice of such Event of Acceleration or
such Indenture Default to the Holders by the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Event of Acceleration or Indenture
Default as it shall determine to be advisable in the best interests of the
Holders. Any provision of this Section 6.01 to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Indenture Trustee shall not declare the Lease to be in default solely in
respect of (i) Lessee's failure to make any payment of Basic Rent after the
same shall have become due, unless the 10-Day Period within which, pursuant to
Section 5.04(a), the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee are entitled to
cure such failure shall have expired, or (ii) Lessee's failure to perform or
observe any of the covenants, conditions and agreements referred to in the
second sentence of Section 5.04(a) within the grace period referred to in that
sentence, unless the 10-Day Period within which, pursuant to Section 5.04(a),
the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee is entitled to cure such failure
shall have expired. For all purposes of this Indenture, in the absence of
"actual knowledge", neither the Owner Trustee nor the Indenture Trustee shall
be deemed to have knowledge of an Event of Acceleration (except, in the case of
the Indenture Trustee, the failure of Lessee to pay any installment of Basic
Rent that is required to be paid directly to the Indenture Trustee within the
10 days after the same shall become due or the failure of Lessee to maintain
insurance as required under Section 11 of the Lease if the Indenture Trustee
shall receive notice thereof from an insurer or insurance broker) unless
notified in writing by Lessee, the Owner Trustee, one or more Holders or the
Owner Participant; and "actual knowledge" (as used in the foregoing clause) of
the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee shall mean actual knowledge of an
officer in the Corporate Trust Administration of the Owner Trustee or the
Corporate Trust Division of the Indenture Trust Division of the Indenture
Trustee, as the case may be, without any duty to make any investigation with
regard thereto.

Section 6.02. Action upon Instructions. Subject to the terms
of Sections 6.01 and 6.03, upon the written instructions at any time and from
time to time of a Majority in Interest, the Indenture Trustee shall take such
of the following actions as may be specified in such instructions (subject to
the rights of the other parties thereto, except to the extent assigned
hereunder): (i) subject to and solely to the extent permitted by the terms
hereof and of the Lease, give such notice, direction or consent, or exercise
such right, remedy or power hereunder or under the Lease or in respect of any
part or all of the Indenture Estate or take such other action as shall be
specified in such instructions; and (ii) after an Event of
<PAGE> 37
I-32

Acceleration shall have occurred and so long as such Event of Acceleration
shall be continuing, approve as satisfactory to it all matters required by the
terms of the Lease to be satisfactory to the Owner Trustee, it being understood
that without the written instructions of a Majority in Interest the Indenture
Trustee shall not take any action described in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

Upon (i) the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease
Term with respect to any Item of Equipment under the Lease and after payment in
full of the principal of and interest and premium, if any, on all Equipment
Notes issued in respect of such Item of Equipment, or (ii) the refinancing of
the Equipment Notes pursuant to Section 19 of the Participation Agreement; the
Indenture Trustee shall in each case, upon the written request of the Owner
Trustee and receipt by the Indenture Trustee of funds necessary to prepay the
Equipment Notes required in connection with such termination or refinancing or
to consummate such purchase, execute and deliver to, or as directed in writing
by, the Owner Trustee an appropriate instrument (in due form for recording)
furnished by the Owner Trustee or Lessee releasing such property from the Lien
of this Indenture.

Section 6.03. Indemnification. (a) The Indenture Trustee
shall not be required to take any action or refrain from taking any action
under Section 6.01 (other than the first two sentences thereof), Section 6.02
or Article V if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment
of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk is not reasonably
assured to it. The Indenture Trustee shall not be required to take any action
under Section 6.01 or 6.02 or Article V, nor shall any other provision of this
Indenture be deemed to impose a duty on the Indenture Trustee to take any
action, if the Indenture Trustee shall have been advised in writing by
independent counsel that such action is contrary to the terms hereof or of the
Lease or the Participation Agreement, or is otherwise contrary to law.

(b) Each Holder may, but shall not be required to,
participate in any indemnification of the Indenture Trustee given pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section 6.03. Each Holder so participating shall be
entitled to reimbursement for such participation in accordance with Article
III.

Section 6.04. No Duties Except as Specified in Indenture or
Instructions. The Indenture Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to
manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the Items of
Equipment or any other part of the Indenture Estate, or to otherwise take or
refrain from taking any action under, or in connection with, this Indenture,
the Lease, or the Participation Agreement, except as expressly provided by the
terms of this Indenture or as expressly provided in written instructions
received pursuant to the terms of Section 6.01 or 6.02; and no implied duties
or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Indenture Trustee.
Each of the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee nevertheless agrees, in its
individual capacity, that it will, at its own cost and expense, promptly take
such action as may be necessary duly to discharge any liens or encumbrances on
any part of the Indenture Estate, or on any properties of the Owner Trustee
<PAGE> 38
I-33

assigned, pledged or mortgaged as part of the Indenture Estate, which result
from claims against it in its individual capacity not related to the ownership
of the Items of Equipment (in the case of the Owner Trustee), administration of
the Indenture Estate (in the case of the Indenture Trustee) or any other
transaction under this Indenture or the Trust Agreement or any document
included in the Indenture Estate.

Section 6.05. No Action Except Under Lease, Indenture or
Instructions. The Indenture Trustee agrees that it will not manage, control,
use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the Items of Equipment or other
property constituting part of the Indenture Estate except (i) as required by
the terms of the Lease and the Participation Agreement, (ii) in accordance with
the powers granted to, or the authority conferred upon, the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to this Indenture, or (iii) in accordance with the express terms
hereof or with written instructions pursuant to Section 6.01 or 6.02.

Section 6.06. Withholding Taxes. The Indenture Trustee, as
agent for the Owner Trustee, shall exclude and withhold from each payment of
principal, Premium, if any, and interest and other amounts due hereunder or
under the Equipment Notes any and all withholding taxes applicable thereto as
required by law. The Indenture Trustee agrees to act as such withholding agent
and, in connection therewith, whenever any present or future taxes or similar
charges are required to be withheld with respect to any amounts payable in
respect of the Equipment Notes, to withhold such amounts and timely pay the
same to the appropriate authority in the name of and on behalf of the Holders,
that it will file any necessary withholding tax returns or statements when due,
and that, as promptly as possible after the payment thereof, it will deliver to
each Holder appropriate documentation showing the payment thereof, together
with such additional documentary evidence as such Holders may reasonably
request from time to time.

Section 6.07. Lessee's Right of Quiet Enjoyment.
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Indenture to the contrary, so
long as Lessee is in compliance with its obligations under the Lease (including
applicable grace periods) and no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing unremedied, the Indenture Trustee will comply with Section 6 of the
Lease to the same extent as if it were the Lessor under the Lease. Each Holder
of an Equipment Note, by its acceptance thereof, consents in all respects to
the terms of the Lease and agrees to the provisions of this Section 6.07.

ARTICLE VII

THE OWNER TRUSTEE AND THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE

Section 7.01. Acceptance of Trusts and Duties. The Indenture
Trustee accepts the trusts hereby created and applicable to it and agrees to
perform the same but only upon the terms of this Indenture and agrees to
receive and disburse all moneys received by it constituting part of the
Indenture Estate in accordance with the terms hereof. The Indenture Trustee in
its individual capacity shall not be answerable or accountable under any
circumstances, except for its own willful misconduct or gross negligence (or
simple negligence in (i) the handling of funds or (ii) providing the notice to
the Owner Participant required pursuant to Section 6.01) or breach of any of
its representations or warranties set forth herein or in the Participation
Agreement, or the performance of its obligations under the last sentence of
Section 6.04; and the Owner Trustee shall not be liable for any action or
inaction of the Indenture Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable
for any action or inaction of the Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee shall not
be deemed a trustee for, or agent of, the Holders for any purpose.

Section 7.02. Absence of Duties. Except in accordance with
written instructions or requests furnished pursuant to Section 6.01 or 6.02 and
except as provided in, and without limiting the generality of, Section 6.04,
the Indenture Trustee shall have no duty to ascertain or inquire as to the
performance or observance of any covenants, conditions or agreements on the
part of Lessee, including (i) to see to any registration of the Items of
Equipment or any recording or filing of the Lease, or of this Indenture or any
other document, or to see to the maintenance of any such registration,
recording or filing, (ii) to see to any insurance on the Items of Equipment or
to effect or maintain any such insurance, whether or not Lessee shall be in
default with respect thereto, (iii) to confirm, verify or inquire into the
failure to receive any financial statements of Lessee or (iv) to inspect the
Items of Equipment at any time or ascertain or inquire as to the performance or
observance of any of Lessee's covenants under the Lease with respect to the
Items of Equipment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture Trustee will
furnish to any Holder so long as such Holder or its nominees shall hold any of
the Equipment Notes, promptly upon receipt thereof, duplicates or copies of all
reports, notices, requests, demands, certificates, financial statements and
other instruments furnished to the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture, to
the extent that the same shall not have been furnished to the Indenture Trustee
and the Holders pursuant to the Lease.

Section 7.03. No Representations or Warranties as to the
Equipment or Documents. NEITHER THE OWNER TRUSTEE NOR THE OWNER TRUSTEE IN ITS
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY NOR THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE MAKES OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE
MADE (i) ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE VALUE,
CONDITION, DESIGN, OPERATION, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR USE OF THE ITEMS
OF EQUIPMENT OR AS
<PAGE> 40
I-35

TO THEIR TITLE THERETO, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO
THE ITEMS OF EQUIPMENT WHATSOEVER, except that the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity hereby represents and warrants that on the Funding Date
with respect to any Item of Equipment the Owner Trustee received whatever title
was conveyed to it by Lessee and that the Items of Equipment shall be free of
Lessor's Liens attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, or
(ii) any representation or warranty as to the validity, legality or
enforceability of this Indenture, the Trust Agreement, the Participation
Agreement, the Equipment Notes, the Lease, any Lease Supplement, or any
Indenture Supplement or any other document or instrument or as to the
correctness of any statement contained in any thereof (except as to the
representations and warranties made by the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity as set forth in Section 8 of the Participation Agreement), except that
(x) the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee each in its individual capacity
hereby represents and warrants that each of said specified documents to which
it is a party has been or will be duly executed and delivered by one of its
officers who is and will be duly authorized to execute and deliver such
document on its behalf, and (y) the Owner Trustee hereby in its individual
capacity represents and warrants that State Street Bank and Trust Company of
Connecticut, National Association, a national banking association, has the full
power, authority and legal right under the laws of the United States of America
to enter into and perform, in its individual capacity or as Owner Trustee, as
the case may be, the Trust Agreement and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of the Trust Agreement by the Owner Participant,
pursuant thereto, this Indenture, the Participation Agreement and the Lease,
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Trust
Agreement by the Owner Participant, the execution, delivery and performance of
each of such documents have been duly authorized on the part of State Street
Bank and Trust Company of Connecticut, National Association and of the Owner
Trustee, as the case may be.

Section 7.04. No Segregation of Moneys; No Interest;
Investments. (a) Subject to Section 7.04(b), no moneys received by the
Indenture Trustee hereunder need be segregated in any manner except to the
extent required by law, and any such moneys may be deposited under such general
conditions for the holdings of trust funds as may be prescribed by law
applicable to the Indenture Trustee, and, except as otherwise agreed by the
Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, neither the Owner
Trustee nor the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any interest thereon.

(b) Any amounts held by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to
the express terms of this Indenture or the Lease and not required to be
distributed as herein provided shall be invested and reinvested by the
Indenture Trustee from time to time in Permitted Investments at the written
direction and at the risk and expense of Lessee, except that in the absence of
any such direction, such amounts need not be invested and reinvested and except
that after a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such
amounts shall be so invested and reinvested by the Indenture Trustee in
Indenture Investments and the Indenture Trustee shall hold any such Indenture
Investments until maturity. Any net income
<PAGE> 41
I-36

or gain realized as a result of any such investments or reinvestment shall be
held as part of the Indenture Estate and shall be applied by the Indenture
Trustee at the same times, on the same conditions and in the same manner as the
amounts in respect of which such income or gain was realized are required to be
distributed in accordance with the provisions hereof or of the Lease pursuant
to which such amounts were required to be held and if no Lease Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing any excess shall be paid to Lessee. Any
such Permitted Investments or Indenture Investments may be sold or otherwise
reduced to cash (without regard to maturity date) by the Indenture Trustee
whenever necessary to make any application as required by such provisions. The
Indenture Trustee shall have no liability for any loss resulting from any such
investment or reinvestment other than by reason of the willful misconduct or
gross negligence of the Indenture Trustee.

Section 7.05. Reliance; Agents; Advice of Counsel. The
Indenture Trustee shall incur no liability to anyone acting upon any signature,
instrument, notice, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report,
opinion, bond or other document or paper believed by it to be genuine and
believed by it to be signed by the proper party or parties. The Indenture
Trustee may accept a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of any
party to the Participation Agreement, certified by the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary of such party as duly adopted and in full force and effect,
as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted by said Board
and that the same is in full force and effect. As to any fact or matter the
manner of ascertainment of which is not specifically described herein, the
Indenture Trustee may for all purposes hereof rely on a certificate, signed by
an officer of Lessee, as to such fact or matter, and such certificate shall
constitute full protection to the Indenture Trustee for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith in reliance thereon. The Indenture
Trustee shall furnish to the Owner Trustee upon request such information and
copies of such documents as the Indenture Trustee may have and as are necessary
for the Owner Trustee to perform its duties under Article II. The Indenture
Trustee shall assume, and shall be fully protected in assuming, that the Owner
Trustee is authorized by the Trust Agreement to enter into this Indenture and
to take all action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions
hereof, and shall not inquire into the authorization of the Owner Trustee with
respect thereto. In the administration of the trusts hereunder, the Indenture
Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereof and perform its powers
and duties hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys and may, at the

such predecessor Indenture Trustee shall execute and deliver an instrument
transferring to such Indenture Trustee, upon the trusts herein expressed

such predecessor Indenture Trustee, and such Indenture Trustee shall duly

recording or other action (specifying the same) necessary to

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which
is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Section 1. Definitions. All capitalized terms used herein
shall have the respective meanings set forth in Appendix A hereto for all
purposes of this Lease. All references in this Lease to Sections and Exhibits
refer, unless otherwise specified, to Sections of and Exhibits to this Lease.

Section 2. Acceptance and Leasing of Items of Equipment.
Lessor hereby agrees (subject to satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Section 4 of the Participation Agreement),
simultaneously with the delivery of legal title to each Item of Equipment from
Lessor to the Indenture Trustee and acceptance thereof by the Indenture
Trustee, to accept delivery of such Item of Equipment from the Indenture
Trustee and concurrently to lease such Item of Equipment to Lessee hereunder,
and Lessee hereby agrees (subject to satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Section 5 of the Participation Agreement) to lease from
Lessor hereunder such Item of Equipment, as evidenced by the execution and
delivery by Lessor and Lessee, respectively, of a Certificate of Acceptance and
a Lease Supplement covering such Item of Equipment. Lessor hereby authorizes
one or more employees of Lessee, designated by Lessee, to act on behalf of
Lessor as its authorized representative or representatives to accept delivery
of such Item of Equipment in accordance with Sections 2 and 3 of the
Participation Agreement. Lessee hereby agrees that such acceptance of delivery
by such authorized representative or representatives on behalf of Lessor shall,
without further act, irrevocably constitute acceptance by Lessee of such Item
of Equipment for all purposes of this Lease.

Section 3. Term and Rent. (a) Interim Lease Term and Basic
Lease Term. The Interim Lease Term for each Item of Equipment shall commence
on the Delivery Date of such Item of Equipment and shall terminate at midnight
on the day preceding the Basic Lease Commencement Date. The Basic Lease Term
for each Item of Equipment shall commence at 12:01 a.m. on the Basic Lease
Commencement Date and shall terminate on the Basic Lease Termination Date for
such Item of Equipment.

(b) Interim Rent and Basic Rent. Lessee hereby agrees to
pay Lessor Interim Rent on July 2, 1995. Lessee also agrees to pay Lessor
Basic Rent for each Item of Equipment throughout the Basic Lease Term in
consecutive semi-annual installments payable on each Rent Payment Date, in an
amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Cost of such Item of
Equipment by the percentage set forth opposite such Rent Payment Date under the
caption "Basic Rent" (and under the sub-caption "Advance Rent" or "Arrears
Rent", as applicable) on Exhibit C.

Anything contained herein or in the Participation Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, each installment of Basic Rent (both before and
after any adjustment
<PAGE> 7
3

pursuant to Section 3(e)) shall be, under any circumstances and in any event,
in an amount at least sufficient for Lessor to pay in full as of its due date
each payment of principal of and interest on the Equipment Notes, in addition
to any other amounts required to be paid by Lessor pursuant to the Indenture
or the Equipment Notes on such due date. In addition, the EBO Payment Amount
payable on the initial EBO Payment Date shall be, under any circumstances and
in any event, not less than the amount required to be paid pursuant to Section
4.02(E) of the Indenture in connection with a redemption of the Equipment Notes
to be redeemed pursuant to such Section 4.02(E).

(c) Supplemental Rent. Lessee also agrees to pay to
Lessor, or to whomsoever shall be entitled thereto, any and all Supplemental
Rent promptly as the same shall become due and owing, and in the event of any
failure on the part of Lessee to pay any Supplemental Rent, Lessor shall have
all rights, powers and remedies provided for herein, by law, in equity or
otherwise as in the case of nonpayment of Basic Rent. In addition, Lessee will
pay, as Supplemental Rent (i) on demand, an amount equal to interest at the
Overdue Rate on any part of any installment of Interim Rent or Basic Rent not
paid when due for the period for which the same shall be overdue and on any
payment of Supplemental Rent not paid when due or demanded, as the case may be,
for the period until the same shall be paid in full, (ii) on July 2, 1995, an
amount equal to the Deficiency Amount for such date if and to the extent not
paid by Lessor on either such date pursuant to Section 26, (iii) on demand, on
an After-Tax Basis, an amount equal to any and all losses in respect of the
principal of any Permitted Investment, (iv) any payments then due and owing
under Section 15 or 16 of the Participation Agreement and (v) all Premium
payable with respect to the Equipment Notes. Anything contained herein or in
the Participation Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, each installment
of Supplemental Rent described in clause (ii) of the second sentence of this
Section 3(c) shall be, under any circumstances and in any event, in an amount
at least sufficient, when added to the Interim Rent payable on such date, for
Lessor to pay in full as of July 2, 1995 each payment of principal and interest
on the Equipment Notes required to be paid by Lessor pursuant to the Indenture
on such date.

(d) Payment to Indenture Trustee. All Rent (whether
Interim Rent, Basic Rent or Supplemental Rent) shall be paid in funds
consisting of lawful currency of the United States of America, which shall be
immediately available funds not later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on
the date of payment. All Rent payable to Lessor hereunder (other than Excluded
Payments) shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor at its office at 35 North Sixth
Street, Reading, Pennsylvania 19603 Attention: Corporate Trust Department
(Conrail 1994 Pass Through Trust); provided that, so long as the Indenture
shall not have terminated pursuant to the terms thereof, Lessor hereby directs,
and Lessee agrees, that all Rent (other than Excluded Payments) payable to
Lessor and assigned to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture shall be
paid by wire transfer directly to the Indenture Trustee for credit to such
account as the Indenture Trustee shall specify at the offices of the Indenture
Trustee at Rodney Square North, Wilmington, Delaware 19890, relating to Conrail
1994-A Pass Through Trust, Attention: Corporate Trust Department or at such
other location in the
<PAGE> 8
4

United States as the Indenture Trustee may otherwise direct upon not less than
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lessee.

(e) Adjustments to Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value,
Termination Value, Etc. In the event that:

(i) the Funding Date is other than as was assumed by the
Owner Participant, as such assumptions are specified in Schedule I;

(ii) the Equipment Notes are redeemed upon a refinancing
as contemplated by Section 19 of the Participation Agreement; and/or

(iii) the Transaction Costs payable pursuant to Section 13
of the Participation Agreement are less than or greater than the
amount set forth on Schedule I,

then all amounts of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value, EBO Value, amount of
leverage and Termination Value shall be adjusted (upwards or downwards, as the
case may be) to preserve the Net Economic Return which the Owner Participant
would have realized had such assumptions been correct; provided that (A) all
adjustments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value, EBO Value, amount of leverage
and Termination Value pursuant to Section 3(e)(ii) shall be made in accordance
with any applicable temporary or final regulations under Section 467 of the
Code; (B) consistent with the preservation of Owner Participant's Net Economic
Return, all adjustments shall minimize the net present value of the amounts
payable as Basic Rent through the EBO Date plus EBO Value discounted at the
Certificate Rate; (C) all such adjustments shall be subject to the second
paragraph of Section 3(b); and (D) EBO Value cannot be less than the estimated
fair market value of the Items of Equipment as set forth in the Appraisal.

Except to the extent permitted in the next sentence of this
paragraph, any such adjustment in respect of clause (i) or (iii) of the first
paragraph of this Section 3(e) shall be made prior to any calculation of any
amount payable as Stipulated Loss Value, and all adjustments referred to in
this sentence shall be made prior to or on the Basic Lease Commencement Date,
and shall be effective as promptly thereafter as practicable. Any such
adjustment in respect of a refinancing shall be made and shall be effective
with such refinancing.

Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 3(e) shall initially
be computed by the Owner Participant. The results of such computation by the
Owner Participant shall promptly be delivered to Lessee and Babcock. Within 10
Business Days after the receipt of the results of any such adjustment, Lessee
may request that a Lease Intermediary Firm verify, after consultation with the
Owner Participant and Lessee, the accuracy of such adjustment in accordance
with this Section 3(e), and the Owner Participant and Lessee hereby agree to
<PAGE> 9
5

provide the Lease Intermediary Firm with all information and materials as shall
be necessary in connection therewith. Any information provided to the Lease
Intermediary Firm by any Person shall be and remain the exclusive property of
such Person and shall be deemed by the parties to be (and the Lease
Intermediary Firm will confirm in writing that it will treat such information
as) the private, proprietary and confidential property of such Person, and no
Person other than such Person and the Lease Intermediary Firm shall be entitled
thereto, and all such materials shall be returned to such Person. If the Lease
Intermediary Firm confirms that such adjustment is in accordance with this
Section 3(e), it shall so certify to Lessee and the Owner Participant, and such
certification shall be final, binding and conclusive on Lessee, the Owner
Participant and Lessor. If the Lease Intermediary Firm concludes that such
adjustment is not in accordance with this Section 3(e), it shall so certify to
Lessee and the Owner Participant, and the Owner Participant shall again compute
the required adjustment. Such further adjustment shall again be subject to the
provisions of this Section 3(e). The final determination of any adjustment
hereunder shall be set forth in an amendment to this Lease, executed and
delivered by Lessor and Lessee and consented to by the Owner Participant;
provided, however, that failure to execute and deliver such amendment shall not
affect the validity and effectiveness of any such adjustment. The reasonable
fees, costs and expenses of the Lease Intermediary Firm in verifying an
adjustment pursuant to this Section 3(e) shall be paid by Lessee within 30 days
after demand, except that the Owner Participant shall pay such reasonable fees,
costs and expenses if such adjustment is required to be computed because of an
error of the Owner Participant resulting in a net present value (calculated at
a discount rate equal to the Certificate Rate) of the adjusted Basic Rent that
is five or more basis points higher than the net present value (discounted at
such rate) of the Basic Rent as determined by the Lease Intermediary Firm.

Section 4. Lessor's Representations, Warranties and
Covenants. (a) Representations and Warranties. LESSOR, IN ITS INDIVIDUAL
CAPACITY OR AS TRUSTEE, (i) HAS NOT SELECTED ANY ITEM OF EQUIPMENT, (ii) IS NOT
A MANUFACTURER OF OR DEALER IN ANY ITEM OF EQUIPMENT AND HAS NOT INSPECTED THE
ITEMS OF EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO DELIVERY TO AND ACCEPTANCE BY LESSEE AND (iii) HAS
NOT MADE AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (AND LESSEE WAIVES, AS BETWEEN ITSELF AND LESSOR, AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, ANY AND ALL RIGHTS OR CLAIMS), AS TO THE
TITLE, VALUE, CONDITION, DESIGN, OPERATION, MERCHANTABILITY, COMPLIANCE WITH
SPECIFICATIONS, CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE OR FITNESS FOR USE OF ANY ITEM OF
EQUIPMENT OR ANY PART THEREOF OR AS TO THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, AS TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY INFRINGEMENT OF ANY
PATENT, TRADEMARK OR COPYRIGHT OR AS TO THE ABSENCE OF OBLIGATIONS BASED ON
LIABILITY IN TORT, STRICT OR OTHERWISE, OR AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIAL OR
WORKMANSHIP OF ANY ITEM OF EQUIPMENT OR ANY PART THEREOF OR ANY OTHER
<PAGE> 10
6

REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ITEM OF EQUIPMENT OR ANY PART THEREOF. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 4(a)
HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED AND ARE INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE EXCLUSION OF WARRANTY,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (OTHER THAN THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY
MADE IN THE OPERATIVE DOCUMENTS), BY LESSOR IN ANY CAPACITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ITEM OF EQUIPMENT, OR ANY PART THEREOF, WHETHER ARISING PURSUANT TO THE UNIFORM
COMMERCIAL CODE OR ANY OTHER LAW HEREAFTER IN EFFECT OR OTHERWISE.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessor warrants that, on the Delivery Date of
each Item of Equipment, Lessor shall have received such title to such Item of
Equipment as was conveyed to it and such Item of Equipment will be free of
Lessor's Liens attributable to it in its individual capacity. Lessor shall not
have any responsibility or liability to Lessee (except as specifically provided
in the Operative Documents) or any other Person with respect to (i) any
liability, loss or damage caused or alleged to be caused directly or indirectly
by the delivery, operation, servicing, maintenance, repair, improvement or
replacement of any Item of Equipment or by an inadequacy thereof or deficiency
or defect therein or by any other circumstances in connection therewith, (ii)
the use, operation or performance of any Item of Equipment or any risks
relating thereto, (iii) any interruption of service, loss of business or
anticipated profits or consequential damages, or (iv) the delivery, operation,
servicing, maintenance, repair, improvement or replacement of any Item of
Equipment.

(b) Covenants. Lessor covenants that, so long as no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, it shall not take or
cause to be taken any action contrary to Lessee's or any permitted sublessee's
or user's rights under this Lease, including, without limitation, the right to
possession, use and quiet enjoyment of each Item of Equipment.

Section 5. Return of Items of Equipment. (a) Return
Condition. At the time of return of any Item of Equipment, whether at the
expiration of the Term applicable to such Item of Equipment or at the end of
any storage period pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 5 or otherwise
(the "Return Date"), such Item of Equipment shall be free and clear of all
Liens (except Permitted Liens adequately bonded by Lessee and Lessor's Liens),
shall be in the condition required by Section 7(a).

(b) Redelivery. On or before the Return Date, Lessee
shall use its best efforts to assemble and transport all Items of Equipment
then subject to this Lease (other than Items of Equipment as to which Section
10 or 20 shall then be applicable), at Lessee's sole cost and expense, to
either (i) one location on Lessee's lines of railroad or to any one connecting
carrier for shipment at an interconnection point on Lessee's lines of railroad
(such location being hereinafter called the "Redelivery Location") as Lessor
may designate in the Return Notice (as defined below) or (ii) into storage in
accordance with subsection (c) of this Section 5. With respect to each Return
Date, Lessor shall, by written notice to Lessee given no less than 90 days
prior to such Return Date (the "Return Notice"), select either clause (i)
<PAGE> 11
7

or (ii) of the preceding sentence; provided, however, that if such selection
involves a combination of clauses (i) and (ii), Lessor shall designate no fewer
than 33% of the total Items of Equipment scheduled for return on such Return
Date for each such clause. Any Item of Equipment delivered to the Redelivery
Location or into storage pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 5 shall be
deemed redelivered hereunder.

(c) Storage. Lessee shall store, at Lessee's sole cost
and expense, such Items of Equipment as Lessor shall designate pursuant to a
Return Notice on storage tracks owned or leased by Lessee and selected by
Lessee for a period of 60 days (the "Free Storage Period") commencing, as to
each such Item of Equipment, on the date on which such Item of Equipment shall
be placed in storage. During the Free Storage Period, such storage shall be at
Lessee's expense and risk of loss.

Upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice, Lessee shall
transport the stored Items of Equipment to the Redelivery Location designated
by Lessor, the movement of such Items of Equipment during any storage period to
be at the expense and risk of Lessee; provided, however, that Lessee shall not
be obligated, at its expense, to move such Items of Equipment at the request of
Lessor more than once. Upon the commencement of the transport of any stored
Items of Equipment pursuant to the preceding sentence, the storage period with
respect to such Items of Equipment shall for all purposes be deemed to have
terminated.

During any such storage period, Lessee will permit Lessor or
any person designated by it, including the authorized representative or
representatives of any prospective purchaser or lessee of the stored Items of
Equipment, to inspect the same during normal business hours upon reasonable
notice by Lessor; provided, however, that Lessee shall not be liable, except in
the case of negligence of Lessee or of any of its employees or agents, (i) for
any injury to, or the death of, any person exercising, whether on behalf of
Lessor or any prospective purchaser or lessee, the right of inspection granted
by this sentence, or (ii) for any damage to property caused by such inspection.

(d) Per Diem Rental. In the event that any Item of
Equipment shall not be redelivered pursuant to Section 5(b)(i) or stored in the
manner provided by Section 5(b)(ii), the Term of this Lease shall be extended
with respect to such Item of Equipment for any period necessary to effect such
redelivery or storage; and Lessee shall pay to Lessor, for each day that such
redelivery shall not be effected after the applicable Return Date or for each
day that such storage shall not be effected within 60 days after the applicable
Return Date, an amount equal to the daily equivalent of 50% of the arithmetic
average of the Basic Rent payable with respect to such Item of Equipment during
the Basic Lease Term.

(e) Event of Loss During Storage. In the event that any
Item of Equipment shall suffer an Event of Loss during the Free Storage Period
applicable to such Item of Equipment or prior to redelivery of such Item of
Equipment after expiration of the
<PAGE> 12
8

Free Storage Period, Lessee shall pay Lessor the Stipulated Loss Value thereof
as provided in Section 10; provided, however, that Lessee shall have no
obligation to pay Lessor the Stipulated Loss Value for an Item of Equipment
which suffers an Event of Loss while being inspected by Lessor or a prospective
purchaser or lessee to the extent such Event of Loss shall be the proximate
result of the negligence of Lessor or such prospective purchaser or lessee.

(f) Event of Loss Generally. If, despite its best
efforts, Lessee has not delivered any Item of Equipment into Lessor's
possession or into storage within 270 days after the applicable Return Date, at
its option, Lessee may declare an Event of Loss with respect to such Item of
Equipment and pay to Lessor either (i) if such Item of Equipment was to have
been returned at the Basic Lease Termination Date, the then fair market sales
value (determined by Independent Appraisal) (but in no event less than the
Stipulated Loss Value for such Item of Equipment as of the Basic Lease
Termination Date) or (ii) if the Item of Equipment was to have been returned at
the end of a Renewal Term, the then fair market sales value for such Item of
Equipment. Upon payment of such amount, Lessor's right, title and interest in
such Item of Equipment will be transferred to Lessee in accordance with Section
10(a).

Section 6. Liens. Lessee will not directly or indirectly
create, incur, assume, permit or suffer to exist any Lien on or with respect to
any Item of Equipment, title thereto or any interest therein or in this Lease
except (i) the respective rights of Lessor and Lessee as herein provided, the
Lien created under the Indenture and the rights of the Owner Participant, the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee under the Trust Agreement, the
Indenture and the Participation Agreement, (ii) the rights of others under
agreements or arrangements to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of
Section 7(c), (iii) Lessor's Liens and Trustee's Liens, (iv) Liens for Taxes
either not yet due or being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings,
(v) materialmen's, mechanics', workmen's, repairmen's, employees' or other like
Liens arising in the ordinary course of business for amounts the payment of
which is either not yet delinquent or is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and (vi) Liens arising out of judgments or awards
against Lessee with respect to which an appeal or proceeding for review is
being prosecuted in good faith. Lessee shall notify Lessor promptly of the
imposition of any such Lien not excepted above, shall pay promptly, if there
exists a material risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of any Item of Equipment
or any interest therein as a result of the imposition of such Lien, or shall
pay or adequately bond against, such Lien within 45 days and shall at Lessee's
own cost and expense cause the same to be discharged, dismissed or removed
promptly, and in any event within 90 days after Lessee first obtains knowledge
of the existence of any such Lien; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Lessee shall have the right to contest any such Lien described in
clause (iv), (v) or (vi) above in good faith by appropriate proceedings,
diligently prosecuted or appealed provided such contest shall not result in any
risk of criminal liability to the Indenture Trustee, Lessor or the Owner
Participant or any material risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of any Item of
Equipment or any interest therein.
<PAGE> 13
9

Lessee shall protect, save and keep harmless the Owner Participant, Lessor, the
Owner Trust Estate, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Estate, the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders from time to time of the Equipment Notes and their
respective successors and assigns from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, suits, costs,
expenses and disbursements (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements)
of whatsoever kind and nature that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
at any time (whether before, during or after the Term applicable to any Item of
Equipment) against the Owner Participant, Lessor, the Indenture Estate, the
Owner Trust Estate, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee or any Holder in
any way relating to or arising out of any such Liens that are not Permitted
Liens.

Section 7. Maintenance; Operation; Possession; Identification
Marks. (a) Maintenance. Lessee, at its own expense and in a manner
comparable to that of other Class I line haul railroads, will maintain, repair
and service each Item of Equipment in the same manner as employed by Lessee for
similar items of equipment owned or leased by it at such time so that such Item
of Equipment will remain (i) in good operating condition (ordinary wear and
tear excepted), (ii) in compliance with any and all Applicable Law and (iii) in
a condition suitable for interchange.

(b) Operation. Each Item of Equipment will be used in
the general operation of Lessee's (or, if permitted under Section 7(c), any
sublessee's) freight rail business, on Lessee's railroad system, on railroad
lines over which Lessee (or any sublessee) has trackage rights and on railroad
lines of other railroads, predominantly in the United States and Canada in the
usual interchange of traffic or in through or run-through service; provided,
however, that Lessee (or any sublessee) (i) will use each Item of Equipment
only in the manner for which it was designed and intended and (ii) will not use
or operate any such Item of Equipment in any manner contrary to Applicable Law.

(c) Possession. Except as otherwise permitted by Section
7(b) or herein in this Section 7(c), Lessee will not, without the prior written
consent of Lessor, sublease or otherwise in any manner deliver, transfer or
relinquish possession of any Item of Equipment; provided that, so long as no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee may, without the
prior written consent of Lessor, sublease any Item of Equipment to any entity
which is incorporated in the United States of America (or any State thereof or
the District of Columbia) or Canada, for use upon lines of railroad owned or
operated by Lessee or such entity or by a railroad company incorporated in the
United States or Canada or over which Lessee, such entity or such railroad
company has trackage rights or rights for operation of its trains, and upon the
lines of railroad of connecting and other carriers in the usual interchange of
traffic or in through or run-through service, but any such sublease shall be
subject and subordinate to all the terms and conditions of this Lease and the
Lien of the Indenture and only for a term which shall not extend beyond the
Term applicable to such Item of Equipment; provided, however, that any such
sublease shall by its terms require that the sublessee comply with Section
7(b). Lessee will notify Lessor, and furnish copies, of
<PAGE> 14
10

any sublease having a term in excess of one year. No such sublease shall
relieve Lessee of its obligations under any Operative Document, which shall be
and remain those of a principal and not a surety.

(d) Identification Marks. Lessee will cause each Item of
Equipment to be numbered with the identification number set forth in Schedule
II. Lessee will not change the identification number of any Item of Equipment
unless and until (i) a statement of new number or numbers to be substituted
therefor shall have been filed with the Indenture Trustee and Lessor and duly
filed and deposited by Lessee in all public offices where this Lease and the
Indenture shall have been filed and deposited and (ii) Lessee shall have
furnished the Indenture Trustee and Lessor an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such statement has been so filed and deposited, and that no other filing,
deposit or giving of notice with or to any Federal, Canadian, District of
Columbia, State, provincial or local government or agency of any thereof is
necessary to protect the rights of the Indenture Trustee and Lessor in such
Item of Equipment.

Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph,
Lessee will not allow the name of any person, association or corporation to be
placed on any Item of Equipment as a designation that might be interpreted as a
claim of ownership; provided, however, that an Item of Equipment may be
lettered with the names or initials or other insignia customarily used by
Lessee or its Affiliates.

Section 8. Replacement of Parts; Alterations, Modifications
and Additions. (a) Required Changes. In the event that, during the Term
applicable to any Item of Equipment and prior to the redelivery of such Item of
Equipment pursuant to Section 5, Applicable Law requires any alteration,
replacement, addition or modification of or to any Part or any Item of
Equipment, Lessee will comply therewith at its own expense; provided, however,
that if Lessee determines that any such alteration, addition, replacement or
modification is economically impractical, Lessee shall have the right, at its
option, on at least 30 days' irrevocable notice to Lessor and the Indenture
Trustee, to terminate this Lease with respect to such Item of Equipment, and to
purchase such Item of Equipment on the next succeeding Rent Payment Date at an
amount equal to the greater of (i) the then applicable Termination Value or
(ii) the then fair market sales value (determined without regard to such
alteration, addition, replacement or modification), plus (x) all other
Supplemental Rent due and owning on such Rent Payment Date and (y) the Basic
Rent due and payable on such Rent Payment Date (other than Basic Rent for such
Items of Equipment specified in Exhibit C to be payable on such Rent Payment
Date in advance for the period commencing on such Rent Payment Date); provided
further, however, that Lessee agrees, on behalf of Lessor, to give an
irrevocable written notice of redemption to the Indenture Trustee with respect
to that portion of the Equipment Notes Outstanding to be redeemed pursuant to
Section 4.02(F) of the Indenture in connection with such termination. Any such
alteration, replacement, addition or modification, or any alteration,
replacement, addition or modification made by Lessee which is not readily
removable shall constitute accessions to the relevant Item of
<PAGE> 15
11

Equipment and full ownership thereof, free from any Lien, shall immediately
vest in Lessor, and shall become subject to the Lien of the Indenture.

(b) Voluntary Changes. Lessee shall be entitled from
time to time to install, at its expense, additions or improvements to any Item
of Equipment which do not impair the value, utility, or remaining useful life
of such Item of Equipment. If the additions and improvements are readily
removable without causing damage and not otherwise required by Applicable Law,
they may be removed and retained by Lessee before such Item of Equipment is
returned to Lessor. Lessee will repair all damage resulting from the
installation or removal of any such additions or improvements, and will not be
required to remove any addition or improvement if its retention will not impair
the value, utility or remaining useful life of the affected Item of Equipment
in the possession of Lessor. If the additions and improvements are not readily
removable without causing damage, such additions and improvements shall become
the property of Lessor, and subject to the Lien of the Indenture, at the time
such additions or improvements are made.

Section 9. Voluntary Termination for Obsolescence or Surplus.
(a) Right of Termination. In the event that Lessee shall determine that any
Items of Equipment shall have become obsolete or surplus to Lessee's
requirements and shall have delivered to Lessor and the Indenture Trustee an
Officer's Certificate to such effect, Lessee shall have the right, at its
option, on at least 90 days' prior revocable written notice to Lessor and the
Indenture Trustee (which notice shall become irrevocable on the 30th day
following the date of such notice to terminate this Lease) (provided, that if
less than all Items of Equipment are selected by Lessee, then Lessee's
selection of boxcars shall be on a random basis and Lessee's selection of
hoppers shall be on a random basis as among Trainsets (with no selective
remixing of Trainsets by Lessee with the intention of improving its position or
biasing its selection of Items of Equipment in contemplation of an option under
this Lease)), on any Rent Payment Date (a "Termination Date") specified in such
notice; provided, however, that Lessee agrees, on behalf of Lessor, to give an
irrevocable written notice of redemption to the Indenture Trustee with respect
to that portion of the Equipment Notes Outstanding to be redeemed pursuant to
Section 4.02(B) of the Indenture in connection with such termination; and
provided further that (a) the Termination Date shall occur during the Basic
Lease Term on or after the fifth anniversary of the Basic Lease Commencement
Date and (b) such Termination Date shall occur on a Rent Payment Date at least
60 days after Lessee, on behalf of Lessor, gives the notice to the Indenture
Trustee referred to in the second proviso of this sentence to redeem Equipment
Notes Outstanding in the manner specified in Section 4.02(B) of the Indenture.

(b) Sale of Items of Equipment. Lessee, as exclusive
agent for Lessor, shall, from the date of Lessee's notice given pursuant to
Section 9(a) until the relevant Termination Date, use reasonable efforts in a
commercially reasonable manner to obtain cash bids for the purchase on such
Termination Date of the Items of Equipment as to which this Lease is to be so
terminated. No later than five Business Days prior to such Termination
<PAGE> 16
12

Date, Lessee shall provide to Lessor in writing the amount and terms of each
bid received by Lessee and the name and address of the Person submitting each
such bid. In the event Lessor receives any bid, Lessor shall promptly, and in
any event at least five Business Days prior to such Termination Date, provide
to Lessee in writing the amount and terms of such bid and the name and address
of the Person submitting such bid. Unless such Items of Equipment are to be
retained by Lessor in accordance with Section 9(d), on such Termination Date,

(A) Lessee shall (subject to receipt by Lessor and the
other Persons entitled thereto of the amount specified in the
immediately succeeding paragraph of this Section 9(b)) deliver such
Items of Equipment to the highest net cash bidder (or such other
purchaser acceptable to Lessor and Lessee); and

(B) Lessor shall simultaneously therewith (i) if the
Indenture shall then not be in effect, sell such Items of Equipment
for cash to such bidder on an "as is, where is and with all faults"
basis and without recourse or warranty (except as to the absence of
Lessor's Liens), or (ii) if the Indenture shall then be in effect,
request the Indenture Trustee to transfer legal title to such Items of
Equipment for cash to such bidder (or such other purchaser) on an "as
is, where is and with all faults" basis and without recourse or
warranty (except as to the absence of Trustee's Liens).

The total cash sales price realized at such sale shall be paid
to Lessor or to the Persons entitled to receive the same and, in addition, on
the Termination Date, Lessee shall pay to Lessor or to the Persons entitled
thereto an amount equal to the sum of:

(x) the excess, if any, of (A) the Termination Value for
such Items of Equipment over (B) the cash sales proceeds paid to
Lessor, plus

(y) all other Supplemental Rent (including any Premium) 
due and owing on the Termination Date, plus

(z) the Basic Rent due and payable on the relevant
Termination Date (other than Basic Rent for such Items of Equipment
specified in Exhibit C to be payable on such Termination Date in
advance for the period commencing on such Termination Date).

(c) Certain Obligations Upon Sale of Items of Equipment.
Lessee, in acting as Lessor's agent in selling the Items of Equipment with
respect to a termination described in Section 9(a), shall have no liability to
Lessor for failure to obtain the best price, shall act in its sole discretion
and shall be under no duty to solicit bids publicly or in any particular
market. Lessee's sole interest in acting as agent shall be to sell such Items
of Equipment at a price that reduces or eliminates Lessee's obligation to pay
the items set forth in the second paragraph of Section 9(b).
<PAGE> 17
13

(d) Retention of Items of Equipment by Lessor.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) to the contrary, Lessor may, by
irrevocable written notice to Lessee and the Indenture Trustee at any time
within 45 days after receipt of Lessee's notice of termination elect to retain
any Item of Equipment designated by Lessee pursuant to Section 9(a) as being
obsolete or surplus, in which event Lessor shall on such Termination Date (i)
pay to the Indenture Trustee an amount equal to the aggregate redemption price
specified in Section 4.02(B) of the Indenture and (ii) deliver to Lessee with
respect to any such Item of Equipment an unconditional release of all
obligations of Lessee to pay (1) the Termination Value (other than Premium) in
respect thereof, (2) all Basic Rent payable in advance on Rent Payment Dates
occurring on or after such Termination Date and (3) all Basic Rent payable in
arrears on Rent Payment Dates occurring after such Termination Date. Subject
to receipt by the Indenture Trustee on the Termination Date of the amount
specified in clause (i) of this subsection (d) and receipt by Lessee on the
Termination Date of the release specified in clause (ii) of this subsection
(d), (1) Lessee (x) shall deliver such Item of Equipment to Lessor in the same
manner and condition as if delivery were being made to Lessor at the end of the
Term applicable thereto pursuant to Section 5, and (y) shall pay to Lessor or
to the Persons entitled thereto (including the Holders) all Supplemental Rent
(other than the Termination Value of such Item of Equipment) due and owing on
such Termination Date, the amount of Premium, if any, on the Equipment Notes to
be redeemed on such Termination Date and any Basic Rent due and payable (other
than Basic Rent for such Items of Equipment specified in Exhibit C to be
payable on such Termination Date in advance for the period commencing on such
Termination Date) on or prior to such Termination Date and (2) Lessor shall
request the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to Lessor an appropriate
instrument conveying legal title to such Item of Equipment to Lessor and
releasing such Item of Equipment from the Lien of the Indenture and Trustee's
Liens.

Section 10. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc. (a) Event
of Loss. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to any Item of
Equipment, Lessee shall promptly (and, in any event, within 60 days after such
determination) give Lessor and the Indenture Trustee written notice of such
Event of Loss and on the Rent Payment Date next succeeding the 30th day
following the giving of such notice (the "Loss Payment Date"), Lessee shall pay
to Lessor or to the Persons entitled thereto,

(A) the Stipulated Loss Value for such Item of Equipment
on such Loss Payment Date, plus

(B) all other Supplemental Rent due and owing on such
Loss Payment Date, plus

(C) the Basic Rent due and payable on such Loss Payment
Date (other than Basic Rent for such Items of Equipment specified in
Exhibit C to be payable on such Loss Payment Date in advance for the
period commencing on such Loss Payment Date).
<PAGE> 18
14

In the event of payment in full of the Stipulated Loss Value
for such Item of Equipment and all other amounts payable pursuant to the
foregoing paragraph, (1) the obligation of Lessee to pay any Basic Rent for
such Item of Equipment on any Rent Payment Date occurring subsequent to the
Loss Payment Date for that Item of Equipment shall terminate, (2) the Term for
such Item of Equipment shall end and (3) Lessor shall transfer such Item of
Equipment to Lessee, on an "as is, where is and with all faults" basis and
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), and if the
Indenture shall then be in effect, request the Indenture Trustee to transfer to
Lessee legal title to such Item of Equipment without recourse or warranty
(except as to Trustee's Liens).

(b) Application of Payments from Governmental Authorities
for Requisition of Title or Use. Any payments (including insurance proceeds
the application of which is provided for in Section 11) received at any time by
Lessor or by Lessee from any governmental authority or other Person with
respect to an Event of Loss shall, after reimbursement of Lessor for costs and
expenses, be applied in reduction of Lessee's obligation to pay the Stipulated
Loss Value required to be paid by Lessee pursuant to Section 10(a), if not
already paid by Lessee, or, if already paid by Lessee, shall be applied to
reimburse Lessee for its payment of such Stipulated Loss Value, and the
balance, if any, of such payments remaining thereafter shall be paid over to,
and retained by Lessee and Lessor, as their interests may appear.

(c) Application of Payments During Existence of Event of
Default. Any amount referred to in this Section 10 that is payable to Lessee
shall not be paid to Lessee, or if it has been previously paid directly to
Lessee, shall not be retained by Lessee, if at the time of such payment an
Event of Default of the Lease shall have occurred and be continuing, but shall
be paid to and held by Lessor as security for the obligations of Lessee under
this Lease, and at such time as there shall not be continuing any such Event of
Default, such amount shall be paid to Lessee.

Section 11. Insurance. Lessee will at all times prior to the
redelivery of all Items of Equipment to Lessor in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5, as part of an insurance program including appropriate
risk retention and self-insurance, and at its own expense, cause to be carried
and maintained casualty insurance and public liability insurance in respect of
the Items of Equipment in amounts and against such risks as are customarily
insured against by Lessee in respect of similar equipment owned or leased by
it. All insurance policies required hereunder shall name Lessor (both in its
individual and trust capacities), the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee
(both in its individual and trust capacities) and the Pass Through Trustee
(both in its individual and trust capacities) as additional insureds, or loss
payees, as their interests may appear.

Any of Lessor, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee
and the Pass Through Trustee shall have the right to carry insurance on the
Items of Equipment for its own benefit and, unless required to be maintained by
Lessee hereunder, at their respective
<PAGE> 19
15

expense; provided, however, that any insurance maintained by Lessor, the Owner
Participant or the Indenture Trustee shall not adversely affect Lessee's rights
to maintain insurance as to the Items of Equipment. Lessee agrees to abide by
the terms and conditions of each policy of insurance obtained in compliance
with this Section 11.

Section 12. Inspection. At all reasonable times during the
Term applicable to any Item of Equipment, including any applicable storage
period provided in Section 5, upon reasonable notice, Lessor, the Owner
Participant and the Indenture Trustee or their authorized representatives may,
at their own expense and risk and at no cost to Lessee, inspect all Items of
Equipment and the books and records of Lessee relating thereto at the locations
thereof on Lessee's premises where such Items of Equipment or such books and
records are then located. No inspection pursuant to Section 5 or this Section
12 shall interfere with the use, operation or maintenance of any Item of
Equipment or the normal conduct of Lessee's business, and Lessee shall not be
required to undertake or incur any additional liabilities in connection
therewith. Lessor, the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee shall have
no duty to make any such inspection and shall not incur any liability or
obligation by reason of not making any such inspection.

Section 13. Assignment, Etc. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 11(d) of the Participation Agreement or Section 7(c), Lessee will not,
without prior written consent of Lessor, assign any of its rights hereunder or
any Item of Equipment. Except as elsewhere herein provided or as expressly
permitted by the provisions of the Trust Agreement, the Indenture or the
Participation Agreement, Lessor agrees that it will not assign or convey its
right, title and interest in and to this Lease or any Item of Equipment. The
terms and provisions of this Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of Lessor and Lessee and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 14. Events of Default. The following events shall
constitute "Events of Default":

(a) Lessee shall fail to make any payment of Basic Rent,
Termination Value, Stipulated Loss Value or Premium or any other
amount of Supplemental Rent contemplated pursuant to the provisions of
any Operative Document to constitute the source of any payment of
principal of, or interest or Premium on, any Equipment Note on the
date such payment by Lessee shall become due and such failure shall be
continuing at the end of the 10th calendar day after such payment
shall become due;

(b) Lessee shall fail to perform or observe any other
material covenant, condition or agreement to be performed or observed
by it hereunder (other than those referred to in paragraph (a) of this
Section 14) or under any other Operative Document (other than the Tax
Indemnity Agreement) or any document or certificate furnished by it to
Lessor or the Owner Participant and Lessee shall not have cured such
failure on or prior to the 30th day after Lessee shall have received
notice of such
<PAGE> 20
16

failure from Lessor; provided, however, that Lessee shall be given an
additional 150 days to correct such failure if Lessee is diligently
proceeding to correct such failure at the end of the original 30-day
period and reasonably expects to correct such failure within such
additional period;

(c) any material representation or warranty made by
Lessee herein or in any other Operative Document (other than in the
Tax Indemnity Agreement) shall prove at any time to be incorrect as of
the date made in any material respect, and such inaccuracy shall
continue to be material and unremedied for a period of 30 days after
receipt by Lessee of written notice from Lessor of such inaccuracy;
provided that Lessee shall be given an additional 30 days to cure such
inaccuracy if Lessee is diligently pursuing such cure at the end of
the original 30-day period and reasonably expects such cure can be
effected within such additional period;

(d) Lessee shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy
or a voluntary petition or an answer seeking reorganization in a case
or proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law (as
now or hereafter in effect) or an answer admitting the material
allegations of a petition filed against Lessee in any such case or
proceeding; or Lessee shall by voluntary petition, answer or consent
seek relief under the provisions of any now existing or future
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law providing for the
liquidation, reorganization or winding-up of corporations, or
providing for an agreement, composition, extension or adjustment with
its creditors; or

(e) a receiver, trustee, liquidator or custodian of
Lessee or of a substantial part of its property shall be appointed by
court order and such order shall remain in effect for more than 60
days; or Lessee shall be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent and such
order shall remain in effect for more than 60 days; or a petition
shall be filed against Lessee under any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or
liquidation law of any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in
effect, and shall not be dismissed within 60 days after such filing;
or an order for relief shall be entered against Lessee; or Lessee
shall make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or
Lessee shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally
as they become due, or shall be unable to pay or shall be generally
not paying its debts as they become due.

Section 15. Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default and at any time thereafter so long as the same shall be continuing,
Lessor may, at its option, declare this Lease to be in default by a written
notice to Lessee (except that no such declaration shall be required in the case
of an Event of Default pursuant to Paragraph (d) or (e) of Section 14); and at
any time thereafter and so long as such Event of Default is continuing, Lessor
may do and Lessee will comply with one or more of the following with respect to
all or any Items of Equipment as Lessor in its sole discretion shall elect, to
the
<PAGE> 21
17

extent permitted by, and subject to compliance with any requirements of,
Applicable Laws then in effect:

(a) cause Lessee, upon the written demand of Lessor and
at Lessee's expense, to return promptly, and Lessee shall return
promptly, all or such part of such Items of Equipment as Lessor may so
demand to Lessor or its order in the manner and condition required by,
and otherwise in accordance with all the provisions of, Section 5, as
if such Items of Equipment were being returned at the end of the Term
applicable thereto, and Lessee shall have complied with all the
obligations therein stated; or Lessor, at its option, may remove the
same from possession and use of Lessee, wherever found, subject to all
requirements of due process of law;

(b) sell all or any Items of Equipment at public or
private sale, as Lessor may determine, or otherwise dispose of, hold,
use, operate, lease to others (whether for a period greater or less
than the balance of what would have been the Term applicable to such
Item of Equipment in the absence of the termination of Lessee's rights
to such Item of Equipment) or keep idle all or any part of such Items
of Equipment all on such terms and conditions and at such place or
places as Lessor, in its sole discretion, may determine (provided,
however, that Lessor may store Items of Equipment on Lessee's premises
only to the date to which Lessor would have been entitled had such
Items of Equipment remained subject to the Lease at the end of the
Term), all free and clear of any rights of Lessee and of any claim of
Lessee in equity, at law or by statute, whether for loss or damage
under the Operative Documents except as hereinafter set forth in this
Section 15 and without any duty to account to Lessee with respect to
such action or inaction or for any proceeds with respect thereto,
except to the extent required by paragraph (d) below if Lessor elects
to exercise its rights under such paragraph in lieu of its rights
under paragraph (c) below;

(c) whether or not Lessor shall have exercised, or shall
thereafter at any time exercise, any of its options, rights or
remedies under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) above with respect to
all or any Items of Equipment, Lessor, by written notice to Lessee
specifying a payment date which shall be a Rent Payment Date occurring
not earlier than 30 days from the date of such notice, may demand that
Lessee pay to Lessor, and Lessee shall pay Lessor, on the payment date
specified in such notice, as liquidated damages for loss of a bargain
and not as a penalty (in lieu of the Basic Rent payable after such
Rent Payment Date), all unpaid Basic Rent due on or prior to such Rent
Payment Date, plus the Basic Rent due and payable on such Rent Payment
Date (other than Basic Rent for such Items of Equipment specified in
Exhibit C to be payable on such date in advance for the period
commencing on such date), plus all other amounts owing, including
Supplemental Rent, plus whichever of the following amounts Lessor, in
its sole discretion, shall specify in such notice: (i) an amount
equal to the excess, if any, by which the aggregate Basic Rent for
such Items of
<PAGE> 22
18

Equipment for the remainder of the Term applicable thereto, after
discounting such aggregate Basic Rent to present worth as of such Rent
Payment Date at the original Certificate Rate, over the fair market
rental value of such Items of Equipment (taking into account the
actual condition of the Equipment) for the remainder of the Term
applicable thereto, after discounting such fair market rental value
semi-annually (effective on the Rent Payment Dates) to present worth
as of such Rent Payment Date at the original Certificate Rate; or (ii)
an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Stipulated Loss Value
for such Items of Equipment computed as of such Rent Payment Date,
over the fair market sales value of such Items of Equipment (taking
into account the actual condition of such Items of Equipment) as of
such Rent Payment Date;

(d) in the event Lessor, pursuant to paragraph (b) above,
shall have sold all or any part of any Items of Equipment, Lessor, in
lieu of exercising its rights under paragraph (c) above with respect
to such Items of Equipment, may, if it shall so elect, demand that
Lessee pay to Lessor, and Lessee shall pay to Lessor, on the date of
such sale, as liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and not as a
penalty (in lieu of the Basic Rent payable after the date of such
sale), the sum of (i) any unpaid Basic Rent due on or prior to the
date of sale, plus, if the date of sale is not a Rent Payment Date,
the daily equivalent of Basic Rent for each day from and including the
Rent Payment Date immediately preceding the date of such sale to but
excluding the date of such sale, plus (ii) if the date of such sale is
a Rent Payment Date, the Basic Rent due and payable on that date
(other than Basic Rent for such Items of Equipment specified in
Exhibit C to be payable on such Date in advance for the period
commencing on such Date) plus all other amounts owing, including
Supplemental Rent, plus (iii) the excess of the Stipulated Loss Value
for such Items of Equipment, computed as of the Rent Payment Date
immediately preceding the date of such sale, over the amount of any
net cash sales proceeds (net of the fair market value of any non-cash
proceeds) to Lessor (after deducting the reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Lessor), together with interest on such amount at
the Overdue Rate for the period, if any, from such Rent Payment Date
to and including the date of actual payment of Stipulated Loss Value
to Lessor; and

(e) Lessor may demand of Lessee, and Lessee shall pay to
Lessor, the sum of (i) Stipulated Loss Value, plus (ii) Supplemental
Rent, plus (iii) any unpaid Basic Rent due on or prior to the date of
payment, plus, if the date of such payment is not a Rent Payment Date,
the daily equivalent of Basic Rent for each day from and including the
Rent Payment Date immediately preceding the date of such sale but
excluding the date of such sale, plus (iv) if the date of such payment
is a Rent Payment Date, the Basic Rent due and payable on that Date
(other than Basic Rent for such Items of Equipment specified in
Exhibit C to be payable on such Date in advance for the period
commencing on such Date), in exchange for which Lessor shall convey to
Lessee title to such Items of Equipment; and
<PAGE> 23
19

(f) Lessor may rescind this Lease as to all Items of
Equipment, or may exercise any other right or remedy which may be
available to it under Applicable Law or proceed by appropriate court
action to enforce the terms hereof or to recover damages for the
breach hereof.

In addition, Lessee shall be liable for any and all
Supplemental Rent payable hereunder before, during or after the exercise of any
of the foregoing remedies and, on an After-Tax Basis, except as otherwise
provided above, for all reasonable legal fees and other reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default or the
exercise of Lessor's remedies with respect thereto, including all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the return of any Items of
Equipment in accordance with the terms of Section 5, including, without
limitation, any costs and expenses incurred by the Owner Participant, Lessor or
the Indenture Trustee in connection with any retaking of such Items of
Equipment in accordance with Section 15(a) or in placing such Items of
Equipment in the condition required by such Section. For the purpose of
paragraph (c) above, the "fair market rental value" or the "fair market sales
value" of any Items of Equipment shall be determined by an Independent
Appraisal. At any sale of any Items of Equipment pursuant to this Section 15,
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Participant may bid for and purchase
such property. Except as otherwise expressly provided above, no remedy
referred to in this Section 15 is intended to be exclusive, but each shall be
cumulative and in addition to any other remedy referred to above or otherwise
available to Lessor at law or in equity; and the exercise or beginning of
exercise by Lessor of any one or more of such remedies shall not preclude the
simultaneous or later exercise by Lessor of any or all of such other remedies.
No express or implied waiver by Lessor of any Event of Default shall in any way
be, or be construed to be, a waiver of any future or subsequent Event of
Default.

Section 16. Further Assurances. Lessee at its own expense
will promptly and duly execute and deliver to Lessor such further documents and
assurances and take such further action as Lessor may from time to time
reasonably request in order to effectively carry out the intent and purpose of
this Lease and to establish and protect the rights and remedies created or
intended to be created in favor of Lessor hereunder.

Section 17. Notices. All notices required or permitted by
the terms of this Lease shall be in writing. Any written notice shall become
effective when delivered. Any written notice shall be mailed, certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, with proper first class postage
prepaid, sent by telex, telegram or telecopy (with such telex, telegram or
telecopy to be confirmed in writing), by overnight delivery service or
delivered by hand. Any written notice shall be addressed (i) if to Lessee, at
2001 Market Street, Two Commerce Square, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19101-1425,
Attention: Director-Financing, or at such other address as Lessee shall from
time to time designate in writing to Lessor and to the Indenture Trustee, (ii)
if to Lessor, at 35 North Sixth Street, Reading, Pennsylvania 19603, Attention:
Corporate Trust Department, or at such other address as Lessor shall
<PAGE> 24
20

from time to time designate in writing to Lessee and to the Indenture Trustee,
with a copy to the Owner Participant, (iii) if to the Owner Participant,
addressed to the Owner Participant at 60 Wall Street, New York, New York 10260,
Attention: Document Administration, or at such other address as the Owner
Participant shall from time to time designate in writing to Lessor and to
Lessee, and (iv) if to the Indenture Trustee, at Rodney Square North,
Wilmington, DE 19890, Attention: Corporate Trust Department, or at such other
address as the Indenture Trustee shall from time to time designate in writing
to Lessor and Lessee, with a copy to the Owner Participant.

Section 18. Net Lease, Etc. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 18 and in Section 26, this is a net lease, and Lessee's obligation
to pay all Rent payable hereunder and to perform its other obligations under
the Operative Documents shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and shall not be affected by any circumstance of any character
including, without limitation, (i) an unconditional obligation to pay Rent
until this Lease terminates in accordance with its terms except that, and
provided that no Event of Default under Section 14(a) of this Lease exists, in
the case of an interference with Lessee's right of quiet enjoyment by Lessor or
someone claiming through or against Lessor (other than the Indenture Trustee,
any Holder, any trustee or holder of indebtedness from any refinancing or any
Person claiming through or against any of the foregoing) (which interference
results in Lessee's inability to use any Items of Equipment in accordance with
the terms of this Lease), then upon the expiration of ten Business Days after
Lessor and the Owner Participant have received from any authorized employee or
agent of Lessee telephonic notice (which shall be promptly confirmed in writing
by Lessee) of such interference describing such interference in such detail as
is reasonably available to Lessee, Lessee shall have the right to abate that
portion of the Rent allocable to the Items of Equipment the use of which was so
interfered with in excess of the amount necessary to make all payments with
respect to the Equipment Notes Outstanding until the interference is
eliminated; provided, however, that exercise of any rights, including
inspection rights, by Lessor or the Owner Participant under the Operative
Documents shall not constitute such an interference; (ii) any unavailability of
any Item of Equipment, after its delivery and acceptance by Lessee hereunder,
for any reason, including, without limitation, any lack or invalidity of title
or any other defect in the title, condition, design, operation, merchantability
or fitness for use of any Item of Equipment; or (iii) except as provided in
clause (i) above, any loss or destruction of, or damage to, any Item of
Equipment or interruption or cessation in the use or possession thereof by
Lessee for any reason whatsoever and of whatever duration.

If for any reason whatsoever this Lease shall be terminated in
whole or in part by operation of law or otherwise except as specifically
provided herein, Lessee nonetheless agrees to pay to Lessor or to the Indenture
Trustee, as the case may be, an amount equal to each Rent payment under Section
3 at the time such payment would have become due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof had this Lease not been terminated in whole or in part.
Lessee hereby waives, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, any and all
rights
<PAGE> 25
21

which it may now have or which at any time hereafter may be conferred upon it,
by statute or otherwise, to terminate, cancel, quit or surrender this Lease or
to abate Rent except in accordance with the express terms hereof. Except to
the extent of any payment in excess of that required to be made hereunder, each
payment of Rent made by Lessee shall be final, and Lessee will not seek to
recover all or any part of such payment from the Indenture Trustee, and any
Holder, Lessor or the Owner Participant for any reason whatsoever.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 18 to the contrary, Lessee
shall not be impaired in the exercise of any right it may have to assert and
sue upon any claim it may have against Lessor or the Owner Participant in a
separate action.

Section 19. Renewal Options. (a) Renewal Options. So long
as no Event of Default pursuant to Section 14(a), 14(d) or 14(e) of this Lease
shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of the 90-day notice
described in Section 19(b)(i) and subject to receipt by Lessor of an
Independent Appraisal at least 180 days prior to the Basic Lease Termination
Date, Lessee shall have the option to extend the lease hereunder with respect
to any or all Items of Equipment for up to four (4) successive periods of at
least one year each selected by Lessee, with the first such period commencing
at the end of the Basic Lease Term and the remaining such periods running
consecutively from the end of the first such (or, as the case may be,
preceding) Fixed Rate Renewal Term (any such renewal term, a "Fixed Rate
Renewal Term"). The rental rate during any Fixed Rate Renewal Term shall equal
(i) the lesser of the then fair market value or fifty percent (50%) of the
average annual Basic Rent during the Basic Lease Term (or over any shorter
averaging period used to satisfy the "initial period" requirement of Section
4.08(2) of Rev. Proc. 75-28) if Lessee elects to extend the Lease for all or a
portion of the Equipment for the full Maximum Renewal Period or (ii) fifty
percent (50%) of such average Basic Rent over such Basic Lease Term if Lessee
elects to extend the Lease for all or a portion of the Equipment for less than
the full Maximum Renewal Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate
term of all Fixed Rate Renewal Terms shall not exceed the Maximum Renewal
Period.

In addition, and so long as no Event of Default pursuant to
Section 14(a), 14(d) or 14(e) of this Lease shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time of the 90-day notice described in Section 19(b)(ii),
Lessee shall have the option to extend the lease hereunder with respect to any
or all Items of Equipment for one or more additional periods of at least one
year each, with the first such period commencing at the end of the final Fixed
Rate Renewal Term and the remaining such periods running consecutively from the
end of the first such (or, as the case may be, preceding) FMV Renewal Term, at
the then fair market rental value (any such renewal term, a "FMV Renewal
Term").

(b) Exercise of Option. (i) Not less than 120 days
prior to the end of the Basic Lease Term or any Fixed Rate Renewal Term, as the
case may be, Lessee shall give Lessor irrevocable written notice as to whether
Lessee intends to return all or a portion of the Equipment or to exercise a
purchase or renewal option. Lessee may exercise its option to extend this
Lease as provided in the first paragraph of Section 19(a) by irrevocable
written
<PAGE> 26
22

notice delivered to Lessor not less than 90 days prior to the Basic Lease
Termination Date or Fixed Rate Renewal Term, as the case may be.

(ii) Not less than 120 days prior to the end of the final
Fixed Rate Renewal Term or any FMV Renewal Term, as the case may be, Lessee
shall give Lessor irrevocable written notice as to whether Lessee intends to
return all or a portion of the Equipment or to exercise a purchase or renewal
option. Lessee may exercise its option to extend this Lease as provided in the
second paragraph of Section 19(a) by irrevocable written notice delivered to
Lessor not less than 90 days prior to the end of the final Fixed Rate Renewal
Term or FMV Renewal Term, as the case may be.

(iii) If Lessor and Lessee shall be unable to agree upon
the fair market rental value of the relevant Items of Equipment 365 days prior
to the date on which this Lease would otherwise expire, then such fair market
rental shall be determined by Independent Appraisal; provided, however, that
such Independent Appraisal shall be provided not later than 180 days before the
date on which the Lease with respect to the related Items of Equipment would
otherwise expire.

(c) Stipulated Loss Value. (i) The amounts payable as
Stipulated Loss Value during any Fixed Rate Renewal Term upon an Event of Loss
of any Item of Equipment shall equal an amount derived on a straight-line basis
from (x) the greater of (A) Stipulated Loss Value in effect on the last day of
the Basic Lease Term or of the first such (or, as the case may be, preceding)
Fixed Rate Renewal Term or (B) the fair market sales value of such Item of
Equipment on the last day of the Basic Lease Term or of the first such (or, as
the case may be, preceding) Fixed Rate Renewal Term and (y) the fair market
sales value at the end of such Fixed Rate Renewal Term.

(ii) The amounts payable as Stipulated Loss Value during
any FMV Renewal Term upon an Event of Loss of any Item of Equipment shall equal
an amount derived on a straight-line basis from (x) the greater of (A)
Stipulated Loss Value in effect on the last day of the final Fixed Rate Renewal
Term or of the first such (or, as the case may be, preceding) FMV Renewal Term,
as the case may be, or (B) the fair market sales value of such item of
Equipment on the last day of the final Fixed Rate Renewal Term or of the first
such (or, as the case may be, preceding) such FMV Renewal Term, as the case may
be, and (y) the fair market sales value at the end of such FMV Renewal Term.

(d) Evidence of Renewal. In the event this Lease is
extended pursuant to this Section 19, such extension shall be evidenced by a
separate lease extension agreement executed and delivered by Lessor and Lessee.

(e) New Leases. Upon the Final Payment Date with respect
to any Item of Equipment, so long as no Event of Acceleration has occurred and
is continuing, the Lease shall terminate with respect to such Item of Equipment
and Lessee and Lessor shall be
<PAGE> 27
23

deemed to have entered into a new lease arrangement with respect to such Items
of Equipment upon terms and conditions identical to the terms of this Lease
(provided that no provisions relating to the Indenture Trustee and the
Indenture shall be deemed to have been included); provided, however, that if
either Lessee or Lessor requests that a new lease be entered into with respect
to such Items of Equipment then Lessee and Lessor shall promptly execute and
deliver a new lease with respect to such Items of Equipment upon terms and
conditions identical to the terms of this Lease (provided that no provisions
relating to the Indenture Trustee and the Indenture shall be included).

Section 20. Purchase Options. (a) EBO Purchase Option.
Lessee shall have the option, on 30 days' irrevocable notice, to purchase on
the applicable EBO Date any or all Items of Equipment then subject to this
Lease (provided, that if less than all Items of Equipment are selected by
Lessee, then Lessee's selection of boxcars shall be on a random basis and
Lessee's selection of hoppers shall be on a random basis as among Trainsets
(with no selective remixing of Trainsets by Lessee with the intention of
improving its position or biasing its selection of Items of Equipment in
contemplation of an option under this Lease)) at the percentage of the purchase
price specified in Exhibit E (with payment of such purchase price being made in
installments on the EBO Payment Dates and in the EBO Payment Amounts), but in
no event less than the Termination Value for such Items of Equipment on such
EBO Date, provided that, if Lessee shall so purchase all Items of Equipment
then subject to the Lease and shall have assumed all obligations of Lessor
under the Indenture in form and substance satisfactory to Lessor and pursuant
to Section 20 of the Participation Agreement and Article 10 of the Indenture,
the purchase price payable shall be reduced by the principal amount of the
Equipment Notes Outstanding after giving effect to the application of the Basic
Rent payable on such date.

(b) FMV Purchase Option. Lessee shall have the option to
purchase any or all Items of Equipment then subject to this Lease (provided,
that if less than all Items of Equipment are selected by Lessee, then Lessee's
selection of boxcars shall be on a random basis and Lessee's selection of
hoppers shall be on a random basis as among Trainsets (with no selective
remixing of Trainsets by Lessee with the intention of improving its position or
biasing its selection of Items of Equipment in contemplation of an option under
this Lease)) (i) on the applicable Basic Lease Termination Date, at a purchase
price equal to the then fair market sales value of such Items of Equipment and
(ii) at the expiration of any Renewal Term applicable to such Items of
Equipment, at a purchase price equal to the fair market sales value on such
date of such Items of Equipment (the "FMV Purchase Option"). In addition,
Lessee shall pay in any case all Basic Rent unpaid on the date of purchase
other than, in the case of the first sentence of this paragraph, Basic Rent for
any Items of Equipment being purchased which is stated to be payable in advance
on such date in Exhibit C, together with all Supplemental Rent due and payable
on such date plus any other Supplemental Rent then owing with respect to such
Items of Equipment, plus sales tax payable in connection with the purchase of
such Items of Equipment.
<PAGE> 28
24

Anything contained in this Lease, the Participation Agreement
or the Tax Indemnity Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, any amount
payable under this Section 20 will, under any circumstances and in any event,
be an amount which, together with all other amounts required to be paid by
Lessee under this Lease on each EBO Date, will be at least sufficient to pay in
full the aggregate redemption price payable with respect to such Items of
Equipment pursuant to Section 4.02(E) of the Indenture.

(c) Exercise of Option. (i) Assuming the 120-day notice
described in the first paragraph of Section 19(b) shall have been given, Lessee
may exercise its option to purchase all or a portion of the Equipment as
provided in clause (i) of Section 20(b) by irrevocable written notice delivered
to Lessor not less than 90 days prior to the Basic Lease Termination Date.

(ii) Assuming the 120-day notice described in the first or
second paragraph, as the case may be, of Section 19(b) shall have been given,
Lessee may exercise its option to purchase all or a portion of the Equipment as
provided in clause (ii) of Section 20(b) by irrevocable written notice
delivered to Lessor not less than 90 days prior to the end of any Renewal Term.

If Lessor and Lessee shall be unable to agree upon the fair
market sales value of the relevant Items of Equipment at least 365 days prior
to the date on which such option is exercisable, then such fair market sales
value shall be determined by Independent Appraisal; provided, however, that
such Independent Appraisal shall be provided not later than 180 days before the
date on which the Lease with respect to the related Items of Equipment would
otherwise expire.

(d) Evidence of Transfer. If Lessee shall have so
elected to purchase any Items of Equipment, Lessor shall transfer, without
recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), such Items of Equipment to
Lessee or its assignee or nominee against payment by Lessee of the purchase
price (or, with respect to the EBO Option, the portion thereof payable on the
applicable EBO Date in accordance with Exhibit E) therefor in immediately
available funds, provided that, if the Indenture shall then be in effect,
Lessor shall request the Indenture Trustee to transfer, without recourse or
warranty (except as to Trustee's Liens), legal title to such Items of Equipment
to Lessee or its assignee or nominee, unless Lessee shall have assumed all
obligations of Lessor under the Indenture and the Guaranties in form and
substance satisfactory to Lessor and pursuant to Section 20 of the
Participation Agreement and Article 10 of the Indenture, in which event Lessor
shall convey to Lessee all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to all
Items of Equipment subject to the Lien created under the Indenture and the
rights of the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture.

Section 21. Successor Owner Trustee. Lessee agrees that, in
the case of the appointment of any successor Owner Trustee pursuant to the
terms of the Trust Agreement,
<PAGE> 29
25

such successor Owner Trustee shall, upon written notice by such successor Owner
Trustee to Lessee, succeed to all the rights, powers and title of Lessor
hereunder and shall be deemed to be Lessor and the beneficial owner of Items of
Equipment for all purposes without the necessity of any consent or approval by
Lessee and without in any way altering the terms of this Lease or Lessee's
obligations hereunder. Lessee further agrees that in the case of the
appointment of any additional trustee to act as co-trustee or as a separate
trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, such additional trustee
shall, upon written notice by Lessor to Lessee, acquire such rights, power and
title of Lessor hereunder as are specified in the instruments appointing such
additional trustee, without in any way altering the terms of this Lease or
Lessee's obligations hereunder. One such appointment and designation of a
successor or additional Owner Trustee shall not exhaust the right to appoint
and designate further successor or additional Owner Trustees pursuant to the
Trust Agreement, but such right may be exercised repeatedly as long as this
Lease shall be in effect.

Section 22. Security for Lessor's Obligation to Equipment
Note Holders. In order to secure all amounts payable by and all obligations to
be performed by Lessor under the Indenture, Lessor has agreed in the Indenture,
among other things, to assign to the Indenture Trustee certain rights under
this Lease and to grant a security interest in favor of the Indenture Trustee
in all Items of Equipment, subject to the reservations and conditions therein
set forth. To the extent, if any, that this Lease constitutes chattel paper
(as such term is defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any
applicable jurisdiction), no security interest in this Lease may be created
through the transfer or possession of any counterpart hereof other than the
original counterpart, which shall be identified as the counterpart containing
the receipt therefor executed by the Indenture Trustee on the signature page
thereof.

Section 23. Investment of Security Funds. So long as the
Indenture is in effect, any monies required to be paid to or retained by Lessor
which are not required to be paid to Lessee pursuant to Section 10 solely
because an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, shall, until
paid to Lessee as provided in Section 10 or applied as provided herein or in
the Trust Agreement and the Indenture, be invested in Permitted Investments by
Lessor (unless the Indenture shall not have terminated pursuant to its terms,
in which case, by the Indenture Trustee as provided in Section 7.04 of the
Indenture) from time to time as directed in writing by Lessee. There shall be
promptly remitted to Lessee any gain (including interest received) realized as
the result of any such investment (net of any fees, commissions and other
expenses, if any, incurred in connection with such investment) unless an Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

Section 24. Lessor's Right to Perform for Lessee. If Lessee
fails to make any payment of Rent required to be made by it hereunder or fails
to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, Lessor may
after expiration of any applicable cure period, on behalf of Lessee and upon 10
days' prior written notice to Lessee, itself make such payment or perform or
comply with such agreement in a commercially reasonable
<PAGE> 30
26

manner. Lessee's obligation to reimburse Lessor for any such cure shall be
limited to the amount of any such payment and the amount of Lessor's reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection with such cure, together with
interest thereon, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, at the Overdue
Rate, all of which shall be deemed Supplemental Rent, due and payable by Lessee
upon demand. This Section 24 is not intended in any way as between the Owner
Participant and Lessor, on the one hand, and the Indenture Trustee and the
Holders on the other hand, to expand or otherwise vary the cure rights of the
Owner Participant and Lessor in the Indenture. Lessor shall be under no
obligation to Lessee or any other Person to perform any such act or make any
such payment.

Section 25. Concerning Lessor. Meridian Trust Company is
entering into this Lease solely in its capacity as Owner Trustee under the
Trust Agreement and not in its individual capacity (except as expressly
provided in Section 4(a)) and in no case shall Meridian Trust Company (or any
entity acting as successor or additional Owner Trustee under the Trust
Agreement) be personally liable for or on account of any of the statements,
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of Lessor hereunder;
provided, however, that Meridian Trust Company (or any successor or additional
Owner Trustee) shall be personally liable hereunder for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct or for its breach of any representation or
warranty made in its individual capacity in Section 4. If a successor Owner
Trustee is appointed in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, such
successor Owner Trustee shall, without any further act, succeed to all the
rights, duties, immunities and obligations of Lessor hereunder and the
predecessor Owner Trustee shall be released from all further duties and
obligations hereunder.

Section 26. Repayment of Deficiency Amount. Lessor shall
give Lessee at least two Business Days' prior written notice if Lessor has
elected to pay the Deficiency Amount on July 2, 1995; provided, however, that
no delivery by Lessor of any such notice shall limit or relieve Lessee's
absolute and unconditional obligation to pay Rent under this Lease. If and to
the extent that Lessor shall not remit funds to the Indenture Trustee in an
amount equal to the Deficiency Amount on July 2, 1995, Lessee shall, to such
extent, pay as Supplemental Rent to Lessor any unpaid portion of the Deficiency
Amount payable on such date. For all purposes under this Lease and the other
Operative Documents, the sum of (x) any Deficiency Amount paid by Lessee
pursuant to this Section 26 plus (y) accrued interest on the unreimbursed
portion thereof at a rate equal to the Certificate Rate (compounded
semi-annually) from, but excluding, the date any such amount is paid by Lessee
to and including the date it is reimbursed by Lessor or pursuant to the
following sentence, shall be referred to as the "Reimbursement Amount." So
long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, upon written
demand by Lessee delivered to Lessor (with a copy to the Owner Participant)
Lessor shall have the option to promptly pay to Lessee the Reimbursement
Amount. If for any reason Lessor shall elect not so to pay to Lessee such
Reimbursement Amount, upon at least five days' prior written notice to the
Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee, Lessee shall be entitled to offset
(without duplication) against each succeeding payment (other than as limited by
the proviso to this sentence) due
<PAGE> 31
27

from Lessee to Persons other than the Indenture Trustee and Lessor in its
individual capacity (including, without limitation, Basic Rent, Supplemental
Rent payable under Sections 9, 10, 15 and 20, payments due under the Tax
Indemnity Agreement and payments due to Persons other than the Indenture
Trustee and Lessor in its individual capacity under Section 15 of the
Participation Agreement), until Lessee has been fully reimbursed for the
Reimbursement Amount; provided, however, that, in the case of any payment due
from Lessee which is distributable under the terms of the Indenture, Lessee's
right of offset shall be limited to amounts distributable to Lessor or the
Owner Participant thereunder. No such offset or aggregate combined effect of
separate offsets shall reduce the amount of any installment of Basic Rent to an
amount insufficient, together with all other amounts payable simultaneously by
Lessee, to pay in full the payments then required to be made on account of the
principal amount (and Premium, if any) of and interest on the Equipment Notes
Outstanding.

Section 27. Miscellaneous. Any provision of this Lease which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. This Lease
may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which,
subject to Section 22, when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but
all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same
instrument. No term or provision of this Lease may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by
the party against which the enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or
termination is sought. This Lease shall constitute an agreement of lease, and
nothing herein shall be construed as conveying to Lessee any right, title or
interest in any Item of Equipment except as a lessee only. The section and
paragraph headings in this Lease and the Table of Contents are for convenience
of reference only and shall not modify, define, expand or limit any of the
terms or provisions hereof and all references herein to numbered sections,
unless otherwise indicated, are to sections of this Lease. This Lease has been
delivered in the State of New York and shall in all respects be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, including
all matters of construction, validity and performance. This Lease shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns (including, but not limited to, the
Indenture Trustee) and shall also inure to the benefit of the Owner Participant
and its respective successors and assigns. Lessee shall enter into the Letter
of Representations and shall perform all of its obligations thereunder.

Lease Agreement to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

and deliver a Lease Supplement covering such Items of Equipment.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Trustee
shall not be obligated to purchase on the Closing Date any Item of Equipment
with respect to which an Event of Loss has occurred.

(b) Agreements to Participate. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and in reliance on the agreements,
representations and warranties contained herein and made pursuant hereto on the
Funding Date, but in no event later than December 31, 1994:

(i) the Indenture Trustee agrees to participate in
financing the Cost of each Item of Equipment to be paid for on the
Funding Date, on behalf of the Holders of Equipment Notes, in an
amount equal to the Indenture Trustee's Commitment for such Item of
Equipment; provided that the aggregate participation of the Indenture
Trustee in financing the Cost of all Items of Equipment hereunder
shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount of the Equipment Notes; and

(ii) the Owner Participant agrees to participate in
financing the Cost of each Item of Equipment to be paid for on the
Funding Date, by sending by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account of the Owner Trustee held by the Indenture
Trustee prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, as an investment in
the beneficial ownership of such Item of Equipment, an amount equal to
the Owner Participant's Commitment for such Item of Equipment, to be
held and applied by the Indenture Trustee to the payment of the Cost
of such Item of Equipment as provided herein (or in the event of
non-delivery of such Item of Equipment, to be returned to the Owner
Participant as provided in Section 2(e)); provided, however, that the
aggregate participation of the Owner Participant in financing the Cost
of all Items of Equipment hereunder shall in no event exceed
$15,000,000 exclusive of the Owner Participant's payments, if any, of
the Deficiency Amount. The Indenture Trustee will not apply the Owner

(c) Notice of Funding Date. Lessee agrees to give the

Business Days' telecopy notice of the Funding Date, which notice shall specify
(i) the Items of Equipment (including identification numbers) to be paid for on
the Funding Date and (ii) the aggregate amounts of the respective Commitments
of the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee with respect to such Items
of Equipment. The making available by the Indenture Trustee or the Owner
<PAGE> 9

Participant of its Commitment as required by Section 2(a) shall be deemed a
waiver of such notice.

(d) Closing. The closing hereunder in connection with
the making available of the Commitments of the Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee with respect to each Item of Equipment and the purchase by
the Pass Through Trustee of the Equipment Notes shall take place at 10:00 a.m.
New York City time on the Funding Date at the offices of Shearman & Sterling,
599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022 or such other place as the
parties shall mutually agree.

(e) Postponement of Funding Date. The Funding Date may
be postponed from time to time for any reason if Lessee gives the Owner
Participant, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through
Trustee telecopy notice (or telephonic notice confirmed in writing) of such
postponement and notice of the date to which the Funding Date has been
postponed (which shall in no event be later than December 31, 1994), such
notice of postponement to be received by each party not later than 12:00 Noon,
New York City time, on the originally scheduled Funding Date, in which case the
term "Funding Date" as used in this Agreement shall mean the postponed "Funding
Date." If the originally scheduled Funding Date is postponed for any reason,
any funds wired by the Owner Participant to the Indenture Trustee on the
originally scheduled Funding Date must be returned to the Owner Participant by
2:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date. If the Owner Participant's
Commitment is not returned to the Owner Participant by 2:00 p.m., New York City
time, Lessee shall promptly reimburse the Owner Participant for the loss of use
of its funds occasioned by failure to close, by paying to the Owner Participant
a sum equal to interest at the Certificate Rate for the period from and
including the originally scheduled Funding Date to but excluding the earlier of
(A) the day on which such funds are returned to the Owner Participant at or
before 2:00 p.m., New York City time, and (B) the postponed Funding Date if the
transaction closes on such postponed Funding Date. The Indenture Trustee shall
invest such funds in Permitted Investments, if any, as directed by Lessee.
Such funds and any investments made by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this
Section 2(d) shall be held in trust by the Indenture Trustee, solely on behalf
of the Owner Participant and not as part of the Indenture Estate. Lessee shall
be liable for any loss upon the liquidation of such investments, and shall
immediately reimburse the Owner Participant for such loss if the transaction
does not close on the postponed Funding Date, or if the transaction does close,
shall immediately apply an amount equal to such loss to the payment of the
Owner Participant's Commitment.

holders of any indebtedness or obligations of Lessee.

(c) Compliance with Other Instruments. Neither the
execution, delivery or performance by Lessee of the Operative
Documents to which Lessee is or will be a party nor the consummation
or performance by Lessee of the transactions contemplated thereby will
conflict with or result in any violation of, or constitute a default
under or create any Lien under, any term of the amended and restated
articles of incorporation or by-laws of Lessee or any agreement,
mortgage, indenture, lease or other instrument, or any Applicable Law
by which Lessee or its properties or assets are bound.

representations and warranties of the Owner Participant, the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee contained in Sections 7, 8 and 9,

other action under Applicable Law in respect of, any Federal, state or
foreign governmental authority or agency,
<PAGE> 18

affect the ability of Lessee to perform its obligations under any of
the Operative Documents.

statements of cash flows of Lessee and its subsidiaries as of the end
of each of its last three fiscal years (up to and including December
31, 1993), each prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied, fairly present the
consolidated financial position of Lessee and its subsidiaries as of
the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and
consolidated cash flows for the periods covered thereby. Except to
the extent disclosed in the Prospectus, there has been no material
adverse change in the consolidated financial condition, business or

Lessee and its subsidiaries and all other material returns in other

due pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment received
(other than assessments the payment of which is being contested in
good faith and adequate reserves for the payment of which have been
set aside by Lessee and its subsidiaries), and Lessee has no knowledge
of any actual or proposed deficiency or additional deficiency or
assessment in conjunction therewith which in any case or in the
aggregate would be materially adverse to Lessee; and the charges,

and perform each of the Operative Documents to which it is a party.
The Owner Participant has duly authorized the execution, delivery and
performance by it of each such Operative Document, and such execution,
delivery and performance do not require any corporate action on its
part which has not been taken, or any approval or consent of, or
notice to, any trustee or holder of any indebtedness or obligation of
the Owner Participant which has not been obtained. The Owner
Participant has duly executed and delivered, as of the date hereof,
this Agreement and the Trust Agreement, and, in addition as of the

authorization, execution and delivery by each other party thereto,
each such Operative Document constitutes or will constitute its legal,
valid and binding obligation, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, and the execution, delivery and performance by the Owner

attributable to the Owner Participant on such Item of Equipment or any
interest therein or on the Owner Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate.
The Owner Participant shall not directly or indirectly create, incur,
assume or suffer to exist any Lessor's Lien attributable to the Owner
Participant on any Item of Equipment, any interest therein, the Owner
Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate, and if it shall do so, it will
promptly at its own expense cause the same to be duly discharged and
removed; provided that the Owner Participant may contest any such
Lessor's Lien in good faith by appropriate proceedings so long as such
proceedings do not involve any material risk of the sale, forfeiture
or loss of any Item of Equipment or any interest therein and do not
interfere with the use, operation, quiet enjoyment or possession of
such Item of Equipment by Lessee under the Lease or materially and
adversely affect the rights of the Indenture Trustee or any Holder.

Owner Participant is a party nor the consummation or performance of
any of the transactions contemplated thereby by the Owner Participant
requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, or the
registration with, or the taking of any other action in respect of,
any Federal, state or foreign governmental authority or agency having

judicial body, or the taking of any other action under any Applicable
Law relating to such business, except such as have been made or
obtained.

Date applicable to such Item of Equipment, concurrently with the
acceptance of delivery of possession of such Item of Equipment to the
Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 9(d) of the Lease, the redemption

Holders that it will not elect to revoke or otherwise terminate the
trust(s) created by the Trust Agreement as long as the Indenture is in

RESPECT TO ANY ITEM OF EQUIPMENT, OR ANY PART THEREOF, WHETHER ARISING
PURSUANT TO THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE OR ANY OTHER LAW HEREAFTER IN

Owner Trustee (as trustee, and not in its individual capacity) represents and
warrants that the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is or will be
a party constitute or will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Owner Trustee enforceable against it as trustee in accordance with the
respective terms of such Operative Documents.

NEITHER IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY NOR AS TRUSTEE, (i) HAS NOT SELECTED THE
ITEMS OF EQUIPMENT, (ii) IS NOT A MANUFACTURER OF OR DEALER IN ANY ITEM OF
EQUIPMENT AND HAS NOT INSPECTED THE ITEMS OF EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO DELIVERY TO AND
ACCEPTANCE BY LESSEE AND (iii) HAS NOT MADE AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE
MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (AND LESSEE WAIVES, AS

ASSIGNS, ANY AND ALL RIGHTS OR CLAIMS), AS TO THE TITLE, VALUE, CONDITION,
DESIGN, OPERATION, MERCHANTABILITY, COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFICATIONS,
CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE OR FITNESS FOR USE OF ANY ITEM OF EQUIPMENT OR ANY
PART THEREOF OR AS TO THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE, AS TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY INFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENT, TRADEMARK OR

(e) Valid and Binding Obligations, in Individual
Capacity. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other
party thereto, the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity represents and
warrants that the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee, in its
individual capacity, is or will be a party according to the express terms
thereof, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Owner
Trustee, in its individual capacity in accordance with the express terms
thereof.

(f) Liens; Indemnity. On the Delivery Date the Owner
Trustee shall have received such title to the Items of Equipment being
delivered to it on the Delivery Date as was conveyed to it by Lessee and there
will be no Lessor's Lien attributable to the Owner Trustee in either capacity
on such Items of Equipment or any interest therein or on the Owner Trust Estate
or the Indenture Estate. The Owner Trustee in either capacity agrees that it
will not directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any
Lessor's Lien attributable to the Owner Trustee in either capacity on any Item
of Equipment, any interest therein, the Owner Trust Estate or the Indenture
Estate. The Owner Trustee in its individual capacity agrees that it will
promptly cause any such Lessor's Lien attributable to the Owner Trustee in
either capacity to be duly discharged and removed at its own cost and expense
and not out of the Owner Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate; provided that
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity may contest any such Lessor's Lien
in good faith (having provided adequate reserves for the payment of such
Lessor's Lien) by appropriate proceedings so long as such proceedings do not
involve any danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of any Item of Equipment or
any interest therein and do not interfere with the use, operation, quiet
enjoyment or possession of such Item of Equipment by Lessee under the Lease or
adversely affect the rights of the Indenture Trustee or any Holder. The Owner
Trustee, in its individual capacity, at its own expense and not out of the
Owner Trust Estate or Indenture Estate, shall indemnify, protect, save and hold
harmless each Holder, Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate, the Pass
Through Trustee, the Trust, and their respective assigns, successors, servants
and agents, from and against any reduction in the amount payable out of the
Owner Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate to such Holder, or any other loss,
liability, obligation, damage, penalty, claim, action, suit, disbursement, cost
or expense of whatsoever kind and nature (including legal fees and expenses)
imposed on, asserted against or incurred by such Holder, the Owner Participant,
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trust Estate, the Indenture
Estate or Lessee, as a result of the imposition or enforcement of any such
Lessor's Lien.

(g) Removal of Indenture Trustee. So long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Owner Trustee agrees that it will
not exercise its right to remove the Indenture Trustee under Section 8.02 of
the Indenture without the consent of Lessee, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld.
<PAGE> 28

agreements set forth in Section 7(d), no part of the funds used or to be used
by the Owner Trustee in connection with this transaction constitutes assets of
an ERISA Plan.

Section 9. Representations, Warranties and Agreements of
Indenture Trustee and Pass Through Trustee.

(a) The Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee in its
individual capacity (except insofar as the third sentence of Section 9(a)(i)
applies to any Operative Document other than the Indenture and this Agreement,
in which case as trustee) represents, warrants and agrees that:

(i) Organization; Authority; Legal and Binding
Obligations. The Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity is a
banking corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the full
power and authority and legal right to execute, deliver and perform
each of the Operative Documents to which it is or will be a party.
The Indenture Trustee has duly authorized each of such Operative
Documents and has duly executed and delivered, or will duly execute
and deliver, each of such Operative Documents. Such Operative
Documents, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each
other party thereto, constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Indenture Trustee, enforceable against it (in its
individual capacity or as trustee, as the case may be) in accordance
with their respective terms. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Indenture Trustee of each of the Operative Documents to which
the Indenture Trustee is or will be a party are not in violation of
its articles of incorporation or by-laws or of any indenture,
mortgage, contract or other agreement to which the Indenture Trustee
is a party or by which it is bound or of any order or judgment
applicable to the Indenture Trustee or any Applicable Law of the
United States or the State of Delaware governing the banking or trust
powers of the Indenture Trustee and by which it or its assets or
property are bound.

(ii) Lien; Indemnity. The Indenture Trustee agrees that
it will not directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to
exist any Trustee's Liens with respect to any Item of Equipment, any
interest therein, or any other portion of the Indenture Estate, and it
will promptly cause any such Trustee's Lien attributable to the
Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity to be duly discharged and
removed at its own cost and expense and not out of the Indenture
Estate; provided that the Indenture Trustee may contest any such
Trustee's Lien in good faith (having provided adequate reserves for
the payment of such Trustee's Lien) by appropriate proceedings so long
as such proceedings do not involve any danger of the sale, forfeiture
or loss of any Item of Equipment or any interest therein and do not
interfere with the use, operation, quiet enjoyment or possession of
such Item of Equipment by Lessee under the Lease or adversely affect
the rights of any Holder. The Indenture Trustee, at its own cost
<PAGE> 29
24

and expense and not out of the Indenture Estate, shall indemnify,
protect, save and hold harmless the Owner Participant, the Owner
Trustee, Lessee, the Owner Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate and each
Holder, and their respective assigns, successors, servants and agents,
from and against any reduction in the amount payable out of the
Indenture Estate to such Holder, or any other loss, liability,
obligation, damage, penalty, claim, action, suit, disbursement, cost
or expense of whatsoever kind and nature (including legal fees and
expenses) imposed on, asserted against or incurred by such Holder, the
Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the Owner Trust Estate, the
Indenture Estate or Lessee as a result of the imposition or
enforcement of any such Trustee's Lien.

(b) The Pass Through Trustee. The Pass Through Trustee
in its individual capacity (except with respect to clause (iv) below, in which
case as trustee) represents, warrants and agrees that:

(i) Organization; Authority; Legal and Binding
Obligations. The Pass Through Trustee in its individual capacity is a
banking corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the full
power and authority and legal right to execute the, deliver and
perform each of the Operative Documents to which it is or will be a
party. The Pass Through Trustee has duly authorized each of such
Operative Documents and has duly executed and delivered, or will duly
execute and deliver, each of such Operative Documents. Such Operative
Documents, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each
other party thereto, constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Pass Through Trustee, enforceable against it (in
its individual capacity or as trustee, as the case may be) in
accordance with their respective terms. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Pass Through Trustee of each of the Operative
Documents to which the Pass Through Trustee is or will be a party are
not in violation of its articles of incorporation or by-laws or of any
indenture, mortgage, contract or other agreement to which the Pass
Through Trustee is a party or by which it is bound or of any order or
judgment applicable to the Pass Through Trustee or any Applicable Law
of the United States or the State of Delaware governing the banking or
trust powers of the Pass Through Trustee and by which it or its assets
or property are bound.

(ii) Consent; Banking Law. Neither the execution,
delivery and performance by the Pass Through Trustee, in its
individual capacity or as Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, of
any of the Operative Documents to which it is a party or the purchase
by the Pass Through Trustee of the Equipment Notes to be delivered on
the Funding Date or the issuance of the Certificates pursuant to the
Pass Through Trust Agreement, nor the consummation by the Pass Through
Trustee, in its individual capacity or as Pass Through Trustee, as the
case may be, of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, nor the compliance by the Pass Through Trustee, in its
individual capacity or as Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be,
<PAGE> 30

with any of the terms and provisions hereof and thereof, (i) requires
or will require any approval of its stockholders, or any approval or
consent of or notice to any trustees or holders of any indebtedness or
obligations of it, or (ii) contravenes or will contravene any
Applicable Law of the State of Delaware regulating the Pass Through
Trustee's banking, trust or fiduciary powers or any judgment or order
applicable to or binding on the Pass Through Trustee.

(iii) Governmental Consents. Neither the execution and
delivery by the Pass Through Trustee of any of the Operative Documents
to which it is a party nor the consummation by the Pass Through
Trustee of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, or the
registration with, or the taking of any other action with respect to,
any federal or State of Delaware governmental authority or agency
regulating the Pass Through Trustee's banking, trust or fiduciary
powers;

(iv) Tax Liability. There are no Taxes payable by the
Pass Through Trustee imposed by the State of Delaware or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or by the United States of
America in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by
the Pass Through Trustee of this Agreement or any other Operative
Document to which it is a party, and there are no Taxes payable by the
Pass Through Trustee imposed by the State of Delaware or any political
subdivision thereof in connection with the acquisition, possession or
ownership by the Pass Through Trustee of any of the Equipment Notes
(other than franchise or other taxes based on or measured by any fees
or compensation received by the Pass Through Trustee for services
rendered in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Pass
Through Trust Agreement) and, prior to default and under currently
applicable law, assuming that the trust created by the Pass Through
Trust Agreement will not be taxable as a corporation, but, rather,
will be characterized as an investment trust treated as a grantor
trust under subpart E, Part I of Subchapter J of the Code, the Pass
Through Trust will not be subject to any Taxes imposed by the State of
Delaware or any political subdivision thereof;

(v) Litigation. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Pass Through Trustee, threatened, actions or
proceedings against the Pass Through Trustee, either in its individual
capacity or as Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, before any
federal, state or foreign governmental authority or agency which
individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to it, would
materially adversely affect the ability of the Pass Through Trustee,
in its individual capacity or as Pass Through Trustee, as the case may
be, to perform its obligations under the Operative Documents to which
it is a party.

Lessee agrees as follows:

(a) Filings. Lessee will take, or cause to be taken, at

reasonably requested by the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant or
the Indenture Trustee, to maintain, so long as the Indenture or the

merged or to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall

5(b) of the Lease, except that Taxes incurred in connection with the

from the exercise of any rights under Section 15 of the Lease or any
remedies under Article 5 of the Indenture or any rights under Section

<PAGE> 40
35

Participant that a prohibited transaction resulted from the
acquisition of any of the Certificates by or on behalf of an ERISA
Plan as to which (1) an Affiliate of the Owner Participant acts as
trustee or in any other capacity causing the Owner Participant to be a
party in interest with respect to such ERISA Plan and (2) such
Affiliate exercises control over such ERISA Plan's investment in such
Certificates.

(d) All Tax Obligations in This Section, Etc.
Notwithstanding any other provision anywhere contained in the Operative
Documents, it is understood that all of Lessee's obligations with respect to
taxes are set forth in this Section 15 (other than taxes taken into account in
computing the amount of any payment to be made on an After-Tax Basis) and in
the Tax Indemnity Agreement, and if Lessee shall be required under any
provision of the Operative Documents to pay any tax for which it is not
responsible under this Section 15, or any provision of the Operative Documents
that requires any payment to be made on an After-Tax Basis, or the Tax
Indemnity Agreement, it shall be entitled to prompt reimbursement of such
amount from the party whose tax liability was paid.

The amount Lessee shall be required to pay with respect to any
Tax indemnified against under this Section 15 (or under Section 16(b)) shall be
an amount sufficient to restore the Indemnitee to the same position such party
would have been in had such Tax not been incurred and shall be on an After-Tax
Basis. If, as a result of the inclusion of any payment to be made by Lessee
under this Section 15 or Section 16(b) in the taxable income of the Indemnitee
in one year and the deduction or crediting of the Tax with respect to which
such payment is made from the taxable income of such Indemnitee in the same or
a different year, or the nondeductibility of such Tax from the taxable income
of such Indemnitee, or the anticipated realization by such Indemnitee in a
different year of tax benefits resulting from the transaction giving rise to
such Tax, the payment by Lessee hereunder of an amount equal to such Tax would
be more or less than the amount which would be required to make the Indemnitee
whole, the amount of the indemnity to be paid by Lessee hereunder shall be
adjusted to an amount which (after taking into account all Federal, State,
local and foreign income tax effects on the Indemnitee, any loss of use of
money resulting from differences in timing between the inclusion of such
indemnity in the taxable income of such Indemnitee and the anticipated
realization by such Indemnitee of tax benefits resulting from the transaction
to which such indemnity is related, and the present value of any such
anticipated future tax benefits to be realized by such Indemnitee as a result
of deducting or crediting such Tax or as a result of the matters immediately
giving rise thereto) will be sufficient to place the Indemnitee in the same
position as such Indemnitee would have been in had such Tax not been imposed.

(e) Procedures. All computations for the purposes hereof
shall be based on the actual statutory rates of Tax in effect for the period or
periods affected, to the extent not inconsistent with the definition of
After-Tax Basis. Computations involving the loss of use of money or
calculations of present value shall be based on the Certificate Rate per annum,
as adjusted for applicable income tax effects and compounded semiannually on
each Rent
<PAGE> 41
36

Payment Date. All computations of amounts due an Indemnitee shall be made
reasonably by such Indemnitee, which Indemnitee shall deliver to Lessee a
written statement containing the results of such computations and a reasonably
detailed explanation of the manner in which such computations were made. Any
amount payable to an Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 15 shall be paid in
immediately available funds and in any event within 30 days after receipt of a
written demand therefor from such Indemnitee accompanied by a written statement
describing in reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity and the
computation of the amount so payable, provided that such amount need not be
paid prior to the earlier of (i) 5 days prior to the time such Taxes are due to
be paid (provided, however, that an Indemnitee shall not make payment of any
claim for Taxes until at least 30 days (so long as such non-payment is legally
permitted) following the date Lessee receives notification of such claim) or
(ii) in the case of amounts which are being contested by Lessee in good faith
or by the Indemnitee pursuant to Section 15(f), the time such contest is
finally resolved (except as otherwise provided in Section 15(f)). Within 15
days following Lessee's receipt of the computation of the amount of the
indemnity, Lessee may request that a Lease Intermediary Firm to be jointly
selected by Lessee and such Indemnitee (but not including the accounting firm
or any Affiliate thereof that regularly prepares the certified financial
statements of Lessee or such Indemnitee) determine whether such computations of
the Indemnitee are correct. The Lease Intermediary Firm shall be requested to
make its determination within 30 days. Any information provided to the Lease
Intermediary Firm by any Person shall be and remain the exclusive property of
such Person and shall be deemed by the parties to be (and the Lease
Intermediary Firm will confirm in writing that it will treat such information
as) the private, proprietary and confidential property of such Person, and no
Person other than such Person and the Lease Intermediary Firm shall be entitled
thereto, and all such materials shall be returned to such Person. The
computations of such Lease Intermediary Firm shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the parties, and Lessee shall have no right to inspect the
books, records or tax returns or other documents of the Indemnitee to verify
such computation or for any other purpose. All fees and expenses payable under
this Section 15 shall be borne by Lessee. As soon as practicable after each
payment by Lessee of any Tax indemnified against pursuant to this Section 15,
Lessee shall furnish the appropriate Indemnitee the original or a certified
copy of a receipt for Lessee's payment of such Tax, if any, or such other
evidence of payment of such Tax as is reasonably acceptable to such Indemnitee.

(f) Contest. If any proceeding (including a written
claim or written threat of such proceedings) is commenced against an Indemnitee
for any Taxes, such Indemnitee shall notify Lessee of such proceeding promptly
after obtaining knowledge thereof and within the statutory time necessary to
contest such claim; provided that (x) in any event such notice shall be given
to Lessee no later than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnitee of a written
notice of such claim and (y) such Indemnitee will not make payment in respect
of such claim for at least 30 days after giving such notice to Lessee. The
Indemnitee shall, in good faith, with due diligence and at Lessee's expense, if
timely requested in writing by Lessee no later than 30 days after receipt by
Lessee of such Indemnitee's notice to Lessee of such claim,
<PAGE> 42
37

contest in the name of such Indemnitee (or, if requested by Lessee and
permissible as a matter of law (except where such Indemnitee is contesting the
same tax based on substantially the same facts to the extent the matters are
not distinguishable) permit Lessee to contest) the validity, applicability or
amount of such Taxes by,

(i) resisting payment thereof if practical;

(ii) not paying the same except under protest if protest
is necessary and proper;

(iii) if the payment be made, using reasonable efforts to
obtain a refund thereof in appropriate administrative and judicial
proceedings; and/or

(iv) subject to the Indemnitee's overall control of any
contest which it conducts hereunder, taking such other reasonable
action as Lessee may reasonably request.

Subject to the Indemnitee's overall control of any contest
which it conducts hereunder, each Indemnitee shall take such reasonable
actions, including the execution of appropriate documents (other than an
amendment to the Operative Documents) as Lessee reasonably requests in writing
to aid Lessee in minimizing the amount of any Tax subject to indemnification
under this Section 15 in the event of an audit of Lessee's tax returns by any
taxing authority, the assertion or proposal of any adjustment to any such
return, or any related litigation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 15,
such Indemnitee shall not be required to take any action unless (A) Lessee
shall have within 30 days after notice by such Indemnitee to Lessee of such
claim, requested that such claim be contested; (B) Lessee shall have first
furnished such Indemnitee with a written opinion, reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnitee, of independent tax counsel selected by Lessee and approved by
such Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, to the
effect that a reasonable basis exists to contest such claim (and, if such claim
is being appealed, that it is more likely than not that the prior decision will
be reversed or modified); (C) Lessee shall have first agreed to pay such
Indemnitee on demand all out-of-pocket costs and expenses which such Indemnitee
may incur in connection with contesting such claim; (D) the amount of the
indemnity payment, together with the amount of all similar and related claims
on which such claim could have a significant precedential impact, could exceed
$50,000; and (E) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
unless either (1) Lessee shall have pre-paid the indemnity and expenses or made
other arrangements satisfactory to such Indemnitee or (2) in the case of a
bankruptcy Event of Default, Lessee's indemnity obligations shall have been
assumed or affirmed in the bankruptcy proceedings. The parties further agree
that an Indemnitee may at any time decline to take further action with respect
to the contest of any claim for a Tax, provided, however, that if Lessee has
properly
<PAGE> 43
38

requested such contest pursuant to this Section 15(f), such Indemnitee cannot
decline to initiate or continue such contest unless it waives its rights to any
indemnity payment by Lessee which would otherwise be payable by Lessee pursuant
to this Section 15(f) in respect of such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no contest shall be permitted hereunder unless such contest will not result in
any material danger of sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien
other than a Permitted Lien on, any Item of Equipment (unless Lessee shall have
adequately bonded such lien or otherwise made reasonable provision to protect
the interests of such Indemnitee).

(g) Refund. So long as no Indenture Default or Event of
Default or Event of Acceleration shall have occurred and be continuing, upon
receipt by an Indemnitee of a refund or credit of all or part of any Taxes
which Lessee shall have paid for or advanced to such Indemnitee or for which
Lessee shall have reimbursed or indemnified such Indemnitee, such Indemnitee
shall pay to Lessee an amount which, after consideration of the further net tax
effect, if any, on such Indemnitee as a result of the receipt of the refund or
credit (and any interest thereon) and the payment under this paragraph, is
equal to the amount of such refund or credit and any interest received or
credited by such Indemnitee on such refund; provided, however, that in no event
shall the amount paid to Lessee (exclusive of any interest received or credited
by such Indemnitee on such refund) be greater than the amount paid by Lessee to
such Indemnitee with respect to Taxes arising out of the same claim. Should an
Indenture Default or Event of Default or Event of Acceleration have occurred
and be continuing at the time an Indemnitee receives a refund or credit, such
Indemnitee shall pay the amount set forth in the preceding sentence when such
Indenture Default or Event of Default or Event of Acceleration shall have been
cured by Lessee.

(h) Reports and Returns. If any report, return or
statement is required to be filed by any Indemnitee with respect to any Tax
subject to indemnification under this Section 15, Lessee shall timely file the
same (except for any such report, return or statement which such Indemnitee
intends or is required to file), provided that such Indemnitee shall have
furnished Lessee with such information (not within the knowledge or control of
Lessee, reasonably available to such Indemnitee and reasonably necessary for
the filing of such report, return or statement) as Lessee requests in writing.
Lessee shall either (i) file such report, return or statement so as to show the
ownership of the Items of Equipment by the Owner Trustee (if such report,
return or statement requires that the owner of the Items of Equipment be
identified) and send a copy of such report, return or statement to such
Indemnitee (and, if such Indemnitee is not the Owner Trustee, to the Owner
Trustee, provided that such Indemnitee has consented in writing to Lessee's
providing a copy of such report, return or statement to the Owner Trustee) or,
if Lessee is not permitted to make such filing, (ii) notify such Indemnitee of
such prohibition and prepare and deliver such report, return or statement (or
if such report, return or statement contains information in addition to
information concerning the transactions contemplated by the Operative
Documents, the portion of such report, return or statement that relates to the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents) to such Indemnitee, in a
manner satisfactory to such Indemnitee,
<PAGE> 44
39

within a reasonable time prior to the time such report, return or statement is
required to be filed. Each Indemnitee shall timely file any report, return or
statement described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence in the manner
requested by Lessee and in accordance with Applicable Law. Any expenses
incurred by any Indemnitee with respect to the preparation, execution or
submission of any report, return or statement (or, where appropriate, that
portion of such report, return or statement which relates to the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Documents) described in clause (ii) of the second
sentence of this Section 15(h), or the filing or recording thereof, shall be
reimbursed to such Indemnitee on an After-Tax Basis by Lessee. Lessee shall
also furnish promptly, upon written request, such information in its possession
or otherwise reasonably available to it (and not in the possession of or
otherwise reasonably available to such Indemnitee) as any Indemnitee may
reasonably request to enable such Indemnitee to comply with the requirements of
any taxing authority, whether or not relating to a Tax subject to
indemnification under this Section 15. Lessee shall indemnify, defend and hold
each Indemnitee harmless from and against all interest, penalties, additions to
tax and fines arising from the insufficiency or inaccuracy of any such report,
return or statement or portion thereof prepared by Lessee or, notwithstanding
Section 15(c), directly attributable to the inaccuracy of any information
supplied to such Indemnitee by Lessee pursuant to the preceding sentence. If
any report, return or statement (other than a report, return, or statement
currently being filed, or required to be filed, by such Indemnitee without
regard to the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents) is required
to be filed with respect to any Tax, whether or not subject to indemnification
under this Section 15, other than a report, return or statement described in
the first or second sentence of this Section 15(h), Lessee will promptly notify
the appropriate Indemnitee upon Lessee's obtaining actual knowledge of such
requirement. If Lessee receives written notice from a taxing authority of any
Tax that is imposed upon an Indemnitee, whether or not indemnified against by
Lessee hereunder, Lessee will forward a copy of such notice to such Indemnitee.
If any report, return or statement (other than a report, return, or statement
currently being filed, or required to be filed, by Lessee without regard to the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents) described in the first or
second sentence of this Section 15(h) is required to be filed with respect to
any Tax subject to indemnification under this Section 15, the Indemnitee will
promptly notify Lessee upon the Indemnitee's obtaining actual knowledge of such
requirement.

(i) Nature of Lessee's Obligations. The foregoing
indemnities by Lessee shall not constitute a guarantee by Lessee or any
subsidiary or Affiliate of Lessee of the payment of any installments of
principal or interest payable under the Equipment Notes, or a guarantee of any
residual value of any Item of Equipment following the expiration of the Term.

(iii) Any tax imposed under Section 502(i) of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code as a result of any prohibited transaction
(within the meaning of Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code) under Section
502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code as a result of any
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 4975(c)(1) of
the Code) on the Owner Participant if and to the extent that such tax
or penalty first arises or otherwise accrues more than 80 days after
the date of notice from the Internal Revenue Service or the Department
of Labor to the Owner Participant that a prohibited transaction
resulted from the acquisition of any of the Certificates by or on
behalf of an ERISA Plan as to which (1) an Affiliate of the Owner
Participant acts as trustee or in any other capacity causing the Owner
Participant to be a party in interest
<PAGE> 47
42

with respect to such ERISA Plan and (2) such Affiliate exercises
control over such ERISA Plan's investment in such Certificates.

(iv) with respect to any particular Indemnified Person,

(vi) Claims imposed on an Indemnitee which become payable
by reason of any transfer by such Indemnitee, other than (A) a

the trust created by the Indenture, (B) any transfer of the situs of
the trust created by the Indenture, of all or any portion of its

option set forth in Section 20 of the Lease, or (D) any transfer
(including shares of stock in an Indemnitee) which occurs or results
from the exercise of any rights under Section 15 of the Lease or any
remedies under Article 5 of the Indenture.

(d) Insured Claims. In the case of any Claim indemnified
by Lessee hereunder which is covered by a policy of insurance maintained by
Lessee pursuant to Section 11 of the Lease or otherwise, each Indemnified
Person agrees to cooperate with the insurers in the exercise of their rights to
investigate, defend or compromise such Claim as may be required to retain the
benefits of such insurance with respect to such Claim.

(e) Claims Procedure. An Indemnified Person shall
promptly notify Lessee of any Claim as to which indemnification is sought.
Subject to the rights of insurers under policies of insurance maintained by
Lessee, Lessee shall have the right to investigate, and the right in its sole
discretion to defend or compromise any Claim for which indemnification is
sought under this Section 16, and the Indemnified Person shall cooperate with
all reasonable requests of Lessee in connection therewith; provided, however,
Lessee shall not be entitled to contest any such Claim if (1) an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or (2) such contest would involve
(i) any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of
any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on, any Item of Equipment, the Owner
Trust Estate or any part thereof, (ii) any criminal liability against such
Indemnified Person or (iii) any material risk to such Indemnified Person of
civil liability (including, without limitation, any contractual liability, not
contemplated by the Operative Documents or the transactions contemplated
thereby).
<PAGE> 48
43

In the event Lessee assumes the defense of any such contest,
any Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in such
contest and participate therein, and the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person, except that such
fees and expenses shall be for the account of Lessee if (1) an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing or (2) the defense of such contest would
involve (i) any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the
creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on, any Item of Equipment,
the Owner Trust Estate or any part thereof, (ii) any criminal liability against
such Indemnified Person or (iii) any material risk to such Indemnified Person
of civil liability (including, without limitation, any contractual liability)
not contemplated by the Operative Documents or the transactions contemplated
thereby. Such Indemnified Person shall supply Lessee with such information
requested by Lessee as in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified
Person is necessary or advisable for Lessee to control or participate in any
proceeding to the extent permitted by this Section 16. Unless Lessee is
excluded from control of a judicial proceeding involving an Indemnified Person,
such Indemnified Person shall not enter into a settlement or other compromise
with respect to any Claim without the prior written consent of Lessee, unless
such Indemnified Person waives its right to be indemnified with respect to such
Claim under this Section 16.

(f) Subrogation. When and to the extent that a Claim
indemnified by Lessee under this Section 16 is in fact completely and fully
paid by Lessee and/or an insurer under a policy of insurance maintained by
Lessee, and so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Lessee and/or such insurer, as the case may be, shall be subrogated
to the extent of such payment to the rights and remedies of the Indemnified
Person on whose behalf such Claim was paid with respect to the transaction or
event giving rise to such Claim; provided, however, that such subrogation
rights shall not permit Lessee to avail itself as against any other Indemnified
Person of any exclusion to Lessee's general indemnity obligations set forth in
this Section 16 other than such exclusions as are expressly stated herein.
Should an Indemnified Person receive any refund, in whole or in part, with
respect to any Claim paid by Lessee hereunder, it shall promptly pay over the
amount refunded, together with any interest actually received with respect to
such amount for the period between the indemnification payment and the receipt
of such refund, to Lessee. In no event shall as Indemnified Party be obligated
to pay to Lessee more than the amount received (including any such interest) by
such Indemnified Party.

(g) No Guaranty. The general indemnification provisions
of this Section 16 do not constitute a guaranty by Lessee that the principal or
interest on the Equipment Notes will be paid.

Section 17. Lessee's Right of Quiet Enjoyment.

Each party to this Agreement acknowledges notice of, and
consents in all respects to, the terms of the Lease, and expressly and
severally as to its own actions only, agrees that, notwithstanding any other
provision of any of the Operative Documents, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, it shall not take, cause to be taken or authorize
any action contrary to Lessee's, any sublessee's or any user's right of quiet
enjoyment under the Lease, including, without limitation, the right to
possession and use of each Item of Equipment.

Section 18. Limitation of Liability of Owner Trustee, Owner
Participant, Indenture Trustee and Pass Through Trustee.

(a) Owner Trustee. It is expressly understood and agreed
by and among the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Pass Through
Trustee, the Owner Participant and Lessee that except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, (i) the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a
party (except for the Trust Agreement) are executed and delivered by the Owner
Trustee not in its individual capacity but solely as trustee under the Trust
Agreement in the exercise of the power and authority conferred and vested in it
as such Owner Trustee, (ii) each of the representations, undertakings and
agreements made therein by the Owner Trustee are not personal representations,
undertakings and agreements, but are binding only on the Owner Trust Estate and
the Owner Trustee, as trustee, (iii) actions to be taken by the Owner Trustee
pursuant to its obligations thereunder may, in certain instances, be taken by
the Owner Trustee only upon specific authority of the Owner Participant, (iv)
nothing therein contained shall be construed as creating any liability of the
Owner Trustee, in its individual capacity, or any incorporator or any past,
present or future subscriber to the capital stock of, or stockholder, officer
or director of, the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity to perform any
covenant either express or implied contained therein, all such liability, if
any, being expressly waived by the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee and
Lessee and by any Person claiming by, through or under them, and (v) so far as
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity is concerned, the Indenture
Trustee, the Pass Through Trustee, the Owner Participant, Lessee, and any
Person claiming by, through or under them shall look solely to the Owner Trust
Estate and the Indenture Estate for the performance of any obligation under any
of the instruments referred to therein; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 18 shall be construed to limit in scope or substance the liability of
the Owner Trustee (A) in its individual capacity to the Owner Participant as
expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement, (B) in respect of the
representations, warranties and agreements of the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity, as expressly set forth therein (including, without
limitation, Section 8) or in any other Operative Document to which it is a
party, and (C) in its individual capacity and as Owner Trustee for the
consequences of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
<PAGE> 50
45

(b) Indenture Trustee. It is expressly understood and
agreed by and among the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Participant and Lessee that except as otherwise expressly provided therein, (i)
the Operative Documents to which the Indenture Trustee is a party are executed
and delivered by the Indenture Trustee not in its individual capacity but
solely as trustee under the Indenture in the exercise of the power and
authority conferred and vested in it as such Indenture Trustee, (ii) each of
the representations, undertakings and agreements made therein by the Indenture
Trustee are not personal representations, undertakings and agreements, but are
binding only on the Indenture Estate and the Indenture Trustee, as trustee,
(iii) nothing therein contained shall be construed as creating any liability of
the Indenture Trustee, in its individual capacity, or any incorporator or any
past, present or future subscriber to the capital stock of, or stockholder,
officer or director of, the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity to
perform any covenant either express or implied contained herein, all such
liability, if any, being expressly waived by the Owner Participant, the Owner
Trustee and Lessee and by any Person claiming by, through or under them, and
(iv) so far as the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity is concerned,
the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant, Lessee, and any Person claiming by,
through or under them shall look solely to the Indenture Estate and the Owner
Trust Estate for the performance of any obligation under any of the instruments
referred to therein; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 18 shall
be construed to limit in scope or substance the liability of the Indenture
Trustee (A) in its individual capacity to the Owner Trustee or any Holder as
expressly set forth in the Indenture, (B) in respect of the representations,
warranties and agreements of the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity,
as expressly set forth therein (including, without limitation, Section 9) or in
any other Operative Document to which it is a party, and (C) in its individual
capacity and as Indenture Trustee for the consequences of its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

(c) Owner Participant. It is expressly understood and
agreed by and among the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Participant and Lessee that the Owner Participant shall not have any
contractual obligations or duty to Lessee, the Indenture Trustee or to any
other Person under the Operative Documents with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby except those obligations or duties specifically set forth
in the respective Operative Documents to which the Owner Participant is a
party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, under no
circumstances whatsoever shall the Owner Participant as such be liable to
Lessee, the Indenture Trustee or any other Person for any action or inaction on
the part of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee in connection with the
Trust Agreement, this Agreement, the Indenture, the Lease or the administration
of the Owner Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate or otherwise, whether or not
such action or inaction is caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence
of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee unless, in the case of the Owner
Trustee, such action or inaction constituting such willful misconduct or gross
negligence was at the express direction of the Owner Participant.
<PAGE> 51
46

(d) Pass Through Trustee. It is expressly understood and
agreed by and among the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Pass Through
Trustee, the Owner Participant and Lessee that except as otherwise expressly
provided therein, (i) the Operative Documents to which the Pass Through Trustee
is a party are executed and delivered by the Pass Through Trustee not in its
individual capacity but solely as trustee under the Pass Through Trust
Agreement and the Pass Through Trust Supplement in the exercise of the power
and authority conferred and vested in it as such Pass Through Trustee, (ii)
each of the representations, undertakings and agreements made therein by the
Pass Through Trustee are not personal representations, undertakings and
agreements, but are binding only on the Pass Through Trustee, as trustee, and
(iii) nothing therein contained shall be construed as creating any liability of
the Pass Through Trustee, in its individual capacity, or any incorporator or
any past, present or future subscriber to the capital stock of, or stockholder,
officer or director of, the Pass Through Trustee in its individual capacity to
perform any covenant either express or implied contained herein, all such
liability, if any, being expressly waived by the Owner Participant, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and Lessee and by any Person claiming by,
through or under them; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 18 shall
be construed to limit in scope or substance the liability of the Pass Through
Trustee (A) in respect of the representations, warranties and agreements of the
Pass Through Trustee in its individual capacity, as expressly set forth in any
Operative Document to which it is a party, and (B) in its individual capacity
and as Pass Through Trustee for the consequences of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

(e) Certain Limitations on Reorganization. The Indenture
Trustee agrees that, if (i) the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee becomes,
or all or any of the Owner Trust Estate or the Owner Trust becomes the property
of a debtor subject to the reorganization provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or
any other applicable bankruptcy or insolvency statutes, (ii) pursuant to such
reorganization provision, the Owner Participant is held to have recourse
liability to the Indenture Trustee or the Holder of any Equipment Note directly
or indirectly on account of any amount payable as principal, interest, Premium
or any other amount payable on any Equipment Note that is provided in the
Operative Documents to be nonrecourse to the Owner Participant, and (iii) the
Indenture Trustee actually receives any Recourse Amount which reflects any
payment by the Owner Participant on account of (ii) above, then the Indenture
Trustee shall promptly refund to the Owner Participant such Recourse Amount.
For purposes of this Section 18(d), "Recourse Amount" means the amount by which
the portion of such payment by the Owner Participant on account of clause (ii)
above received by the Indenture Trustee exceeds the amount which would have
been received by the Indenture Trustee if the Owner Participant had not become
subject to the recourse liability referred to in (ii) above. Nothing contained
in this Section 18(d) shall prevent the Indenture Trustee from enforcing any
individual obligation (and retaining the proceeds thereof) of the Owner
Participant under this Agreement or any other Operative Agreement to the extent
herein or therein provided, for which the Owner Participant has expressly
agreed by the terms of this Agreement to accept individual responsibility.

Section 19. Refinancing. The parties hereto recognize that,
provided that the Lease shall then be in full force and effect and that no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee may, on any Rent
Payment Date subject to the terms and conditions of Section 4.02(C) of the
Indenture, arrange for refinancing of all, and not less than all, of the then
Outstanding Equipment Notes by the Owner Trustee on a non-recourse basis
(including the payment in full of accrued interest and Premium, if any) with
funds made available for such purpose solely through the issue and sale of U.S.
Dollar denominated, fixed rate debt securities by the Owner Trustee in a
private or public offering placed with U.S. or foreign lenders, as specified
by Lessee pursuant to which the Owner Trustee will deposit with the Indenture
Trustee from the proceeds of such refinancing sufficient funds to redeem in
full on the applicable Redemption Date all of the Equipment Notes Outstanding.
No refinancing of the Equipment Notes may be initiated, other than as provided
in this Section 19. In the event of any such refinancing, adjustments shall be
made to Basic Rent, the Termination Values, the Stipulated Loss Values, and the
debt amortization schedule shall be established, so that, subject to the
maintenance of the Net Economic Return of the Owner Participant, the net
present value of amounts payable as Basic Rent plus EBO Value shall be
minimized. No such refinancing shall cause the aggregate principal amount of
the indebtedness substituted for the Equipment Notes to exceed the aggregate
principal amount of the Outstanding Equipment Notes without the prior written
consent of the Owner Participant and the latest date of maturity of such
indebtedness shall be not later than the date of maturity of the Equipment
Notes being refinanced. The parties hereto agree that they will cooperate in
good faith in effectuating such refinancing (which, it is understood, may
result in changes in the Operative Documents and which may, in connection with
a public offering, involve an underwriting agreement); provided, however, that:
(i) such refinancing shall not, without the Owner Participant's consent, occur
on more than three (the first two of which shall be without a fee paid by
Lessee to Lessor, and the third of which shall include a fee of $20,000 paid by
Lessee to Lessor) occasions in the aggregate; (ii) each party hereto shall have
received such opinions of counsel, certificates, indemnities and other
documents in connection with each such refinancing as it may reasonably
request, each in form and substance satisfactory to such party; (iii) all
necessary authorizations, approvals and consents shall have been obtained and
be in full force and effect; (iv) such refinancing shall not create any
unindemnified tax or other risk to the Owner Participant; and (v) all such
documentation, taken as a whole, shall not result in greater obligations on or
lesser rights to the Owner Participant than existed prior to such refinancing;
and provided further that Lessee shall pay on the date of each such refinancing
all costs and expenses (on an After-Tax Basis) of each party hereto (including
the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of their respective counsel) in
connection therewith. If Lessee elects to cause the Owner Trustee to refinance
the Equipment Notes, it shall, on behalf of Lessor, give the Indenture Trustee
an irrevocable written notice of redemption with respect to the Equipment Notes
Outstanding not less than 30 days prior to the date upon which the refinancing
is to take place (the "Refinancing Date"), which notice shall specify the
Refinancing Date.

Section 20. Assumption of Owner Trustee Obligations. Subject
to compliance by Lessee with all of its obligations under each Operative
Document to which it is a party and so long as no Potential Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each of the Owner Participant,
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Pass Through Trustee and Lessee
covenants and agrees that Lessee may assume all obligations of the Owner
Participant under the Operative Documents if Lessee elects to do so pursuant to
Section 8(a) of the Lease or if Lessee elects to purchase on an EBO Date all
Items of Equipment pursuant to Section 20 of the Lease, provided that:

(A) Lessee shall have elected to assume such obligations
by giving irrevocable notice to that effect to the Owner Participant,
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee
pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Lease or concurrently with Lessee's
notice of election to purchase on an EBO Date all Items of Equipment
pursuant to Section 20 of the Lease;

(B) Lessee shall have by an agreement in writing, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant, the
Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee,
assumed the due and punctual payment of all amounts payable from time
to time under the Guaranties (but with full recourse to Lessee and
including, without limitation, all unpaid principal of, and Premium,
if any, and interest on, the Equipment Notes) in accordance with the
respective terms and provisions thereof, and the punctual performance
and observance of all the covenants and provisions of this Agreement
and the other Operative Documents to be observed or performed by the
Owner Trustee to the extent such covenants and provisions are
applicable to such assumption;

(C) concurrently with the assumption referred to in
clause (B) above, the Operative Documents shall be amended so that
Lessee shall have such obligations thereunder as are applicable to the
Owner Trustee (to the extent such obligations are applicable to such
assumption) and contained in any of the Operative Documents to which
the Owner Trustee is a party immediately prior to such amendment, and,
in the case of the Indenture, an amendment incorporating therein the
covenants under the Lease with respect to the Items of Equipment to be
performed or observed by Lessee, all such amendments to be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee;

(D) the Indenture Trustee shall have received the
favorable written opinions of counsel to Lessee and the Indenture
Trustee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee, comparable to the respective opinions delivered on
the Funding Date, but with respect to the Operative Documents as
amended in connection with such assumption, and covering such
additional matters as the Indenture Trustee shall reasonably request;
<PAGE> 54
49

(E) the Indenture Trustee's security interest in the
Items of Equipment shall not be adversely affected by purchase of the
Items of Equipment or assumption of the Owner Trustee's obligations by
Lessee; and

(F) upon compliance with the provisions of Article X of
the Indenture, the Owner Participant shall be released and discharged
from any further obligations hereunder and the Owner Trustee shall be
released and discharged from any further obligations under the
Operative Documents to the extent set forth in such Article X.

Whether or not the assumption referred to above is
accomplished, Lessee shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of the Owner
Trustee, the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee (including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of their respective counsel)
relating to the matters contemplated herein.

Section 21. Miscellaneous.

(a) Notices. Unless otherwise specifically provided
herein, all notices required or permitted by the terms hereof shall be in

FORM OF OPINION
OF SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT - LAW
OF LESSEE 

December 22, 1994

To Each of the Persons Listed
on Schedule I Attached Hereto

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION

Leveraged Lease Financing of Railcars
Conrail 1994-A Pass Through Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am Senior Vice President - Law of Consolidated Rail
Corporation ("Lessee") and in that capacity I have acted as counsel to Lessee
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Participation Agreement
dated as of December 22, 1994 (the "Participation Agreement") among Lessee,
Meridian Trust Company ("Meridian"), as Owner Trustee, J.P. Morgan Interfunding
Corp., as Owner Participant, Wilmington Trust Company ("Wilmington"), as
Indenture Trustee, and Wilmington, as Pass Through Trustee, relating to the
above-referenced pass through trust. This opinion is delivered in satisfaction
of Section 4(a)(v) of the Participation Agreement. Capitalized terms not
defined herein are used as defined in Appendix A to the Participation
Agreement.

In this regard, I have examined originals, or copies the
authenticity of which has been established to my satisfaction, of the Lease
Agreement, Lease Supplement No. 1 dated December 22, 1994 (the "Lease
Supplement"), the form of a Certificate of Acceptance, the Railcar Purchase
Agreement, the Participation Agreement, the Indenture, Indenture
<PAGE> 59
2

Supplement No. 1 (the "Indenture Supplement"), the Trust Agreement, the Bill of
Sale, the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Supplement and 
the Tax Indemnity Agreement (the "Relevant Operative Documents") and such other
agreements, corporate records, statements and records of government officials
and agencies and other instruments as were deemed necessary or advisable as a
basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact material
to such opinions, I have relied upon certifications by officers of Lessee, and
the delegates thereof, when relevant facts were not independently established.
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I have assumed (except as to
Lessee) the genuineness of all signatures and the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the parties thereto of the Lease Agreement, the Lease
Supplement, the Railcar Purchase Agreement, the Participation Agreement, the
Indenture, the Indenture Supplement, the Trust Agreement, the Pass Through
Trust Agreement and the Pass Through Trust Supplement and that each such party
has full power, authority and legal right to enter into and perform its
obligations thereunder. I have examined and relied without independent
verification on the representations and warranties by parties other than Lessee
as to factual matters contained in or made pursuant to the Relevant Operative
Documents.

Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

1. Lessee is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, is a "Class I Railroad" within the meaning of 49 C.F.R.
Part 1201, operating under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce
Commission ("ICC") pursuant to Title 49 of the U.S. Code and has the
corporate power and authority under Applicable Law to carry on its
business as currently conducted and to execute and deliver the Lease
Agreement, the Lease Supplement, the Railcar Purchase Agreement, the
Participation Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Pass
Through Trust Supplement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement and to
perform its obligations under the Lease Agreement, the Lease
Supplement, the Railcar Purchase Agreement, the Participation
Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Pass Through Trust
Supplement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement. Lessee is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the activities of Lessee require such qualification
except where the failure to so qualify would not have a material
adverse effect on Lessee or on its ability to perform each of its
obligations under each of the Operative Documents to which it is a
party.

2. The execution and delivery by Lessee of the Lease
Agreement, the Lease Supplement, the Railcar Purchase Agreement, the
Participation Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Agreement and the Pass
Through Trust Supplement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement, and the
performance by Lessee of its obligations under the Lease Agreement,
the Lease Supplement, the Railcar Purchase Agreement, the
Participation Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Pass
Through Trust Supplement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement do not
require the approval or consent
<PAGE> 60
3

of any trustee, stockholder or holders of any indebtedness or
obligations of Lessee, and neither the execution and delivery by
Lessee thereof, nor the consummation by Lessee of the transactions
contemplated thereby, nor compliance by Lessee with any of the terms
and provisions thereof will contravene any law or, any judgment,
governmental rule, regulation, license, permit or order of any
governmental authority of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the
United States of America applicable to or binding upon Lessee or any
of its properties, or contravene or result in any breach of, or
constitute any default under, or result in the creation of any Lien
(other than as permitted under the Operative Documents) upon any
property of Lessee under any indenture, mortgage, chattel mortgage,
deed of trust, conditional sales contract, bank loan or credit
agreement, corporate charter, by-laws or other agreement or instrument
to which Lessee is a party or by which Lessee or any of its properties
may be bound or affected.

3. The execution and delivery by Lessee of the Lease
Agreement, the Lease Supplement, the Railcar Purchase Agreement, the
Participation Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Pass
Through Trust Supplement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement, the issue
and sale of the Certificates, and the consummation by Lessee of any of
the transactions contemplated thereby and the operation by Lessee of
all Items of Equipment leased to Lessee under the Lease Agreement, do
not require the consent or approval of, or the giving of notice to, or
the registration with, or the taking of any other actions under
Applicable Law (except that no opinion is expressed as to approval,
notice, registration or other action required for the conduct of the
business of Lessee generally and which does not require any specific
action by Lessee in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance by it of the Lease Agreement, the Lease Supplement, the
Railcar Purchase Agreement, the Participation Agreement, the Pass
Through Trust Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Supplement or
the Tax Indemnity Agreement), other than (i) the registration of the
issuance and sale of the Series Certificates, to be issued pursuant to
the provisions of the Pass Through Trust Agreement, as supplemented,
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and under the securities
laws of any state in which the Certificates may be offered for sale if
the laws of such state require such action, which registrations have
been duly accomplished, (ii) the qualification of the Pass Through
Trust Agreement, as supplemented, under the Trust Indenture Act, which
qualifications have been duly obtained pursuant to an order of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and (iii) the registrations and
filings referred to in paragraph 5 below, as to which I express
no opinion, except as expressly set forth therein.

4. The Lease Agreement, the Lease Supplement, the Railcar
Purchase Agreement, the Participation Agreement, the Pass Through
Trust Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Supplement, the Bill of Sale 
and the Tax Indemnity Agreement have been duly authorized by all 
necessary corporate action on the part of Lessee, have been duly 
executed and delivered by Lessee, and constitute the legal, valid and 
binding obligations of Lessee enforceable against Lessee in 
accordance with their respective terms.

5. Each of the Indenture, the Indenture Supplement, the Lease
Agreement and the Lease Supplement has been duly filed with the ICC
pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Section 11303 and provided to McCarthy Tetrault
for prompt deposit thereafter with the Registrar General of Canada
pursuant to Section 90 of the Railway Act of Canada. Except for such
filings which filings have been duly made or provided for
continuation
<PAGE> 61
4
no recording or filing in the United States of America or
Canada of any of the Relevant Operative Documents, or of any financing
statement with respect thereto, is necessary or advisable in order to
establish and perfect in the United States of America and Canada the
Owner Trustee's rights and interest in, and the Indenture Trustee's
legal title for security purposes in, the Items of Equipment as
against Lessee and any third parties, or the mortgage and security
interests under the Indenture and the Indenture Supplement on the
Items of Equipment or other property in the Indenture Estate in favor
of the Indenture Trustee or the assignment of the Lease Agreement, and
the Railcar Purchase Agreement and Bill of Sale under the Indenture to
the Indenture Trustee as against Lessee, the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Participant or any third party.

6. Neither Lessee nor anyone acting on behalf of Lessee has
directly or indirectly offered by interest in the Owner Trust Estate
or the Trust Agreement for sale to anyone other than the Owner
Participant and not more than 49 other financial institutions. The
acquisition by the Owner Participant of its interest in the Owner
Trust Estate and the Trust Agreement and the acquisition by the Pass
Through Trustee of the Equipment Notes is exempt from the registration
and prospectus-delivery requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, by virtue of Section 4(2) thereof.

7. The Owner Trustee, as Lessor under the Lease Agreement,
and the Indenture and the Indenture Supplement Trustee, as assignee of
the Owner Trustee's rights under the Lease Agreement pursuant to the
Indenture and the Indenture Supplement on behalf of the Holders of
Equipment Notes, are entitled to the benefits of 11 U.S.C. Section
1168 with respect to all Items of Equipment to be subjected to the
Lease Agreement.

8. Except as disclosed in Lessee's annual report on Form 10-K
for Lessee's fiscal year ended December 31, 1993, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 1994, June 30, 1994 and
September 30, 1994, and reports on Form 8-K referenced in the
Prospectus, there are no pending or, to the best of my knowledge,
threatened actions, lawsuits or proceedings by or before any court or
administrative agency or arbitrator that are reasonably likely to,
either individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely
affect the right, power and authority of Lessee to enter into or
perform its obligations under the Relevant Operative Documents.

9. Based upon the foregoing, and on the examination and
review of the Commission's Recordation Files, and assuming the
accuracy and completeness of such Recordation Files, it is my opinion
that Lessee's Bill of Sale is valid and effective to vest in the Owner
Trustee good and marketable title to the Items of Equipment covered
thereby, free and clear of any claim, lien, security interest, charge
or other
<PAGE> 62
5

encumbrance other than rights arising under the Indenture, the
Indenture Supplement, Lease Agreement or the Lease Supplement.

Insofar as the foregoing opinion relates to the enforceability
of the Lease Agreement, the Lease Supplement, the Participation Agreement, the
Railcar Purchase Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Pass Through
Trust Supplement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement, such opinion is subject to
(a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law). The enforceability of the Lease
Agreement may also be limited by applicable laws which may affect the remedies
provided therein, but which do not in my opinion make such remedies inadequate
for the substantial realization of the rights and benefits intended to be
provided thereby.

In giving the foregoing opinions, I have relied, subject to
the assumptions and qualifications contained therein, upon the opinion of
McCarthy Tetrault delivered to you today as to the matters set forth therein
relating to certain matters of Canadian law.

No opinion is expressed herein as to any state securities laws
or any laws other than the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the
Federal laws of the United States.

I note that the "governing law" provisions of the Lease
Agreement, the Lease Supplement, the Certificate of Acceptance, the 
Participation Agreement, the Indenture, the Indenture Supplement, the
Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Supplement, the Tax 
Indemnity Agreement, the Certificates and the Equipment Notes provide that the
laws of the State of New York are to govern them. In my opinion, a court
applying Pennsylvania conflict of laws rules would give effect to such choice
of New York law; however, I express no opinion as to what law a court applying
any other state's conflict of laws rules would apply.

For purposes of my opinion in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above, I
have with your consent (i) assumed that a court would apply the substantive
laws of either Pennsylvania or New York and (ii) assumed (without examining the
laws of New York) that the substantive laws of New York governing the
interpretation and enforcement of each provision of the Lease Agreement, the
Lease Supplement, the Certificate of Acceptance, the Participation Agreement, 
the Indenture, the Indenture Supplement, the Pass Through Trust
Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Supplement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement, the
Certificates and the Equipment Notes do not differ in any material respect from
the substantive laws of Pennsylvania.

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION

as Owner Trustee, (ii) the Trust Agreement dated as of December 22, 1994 (the
"Trust Agreement") between the Owner Participant and Meridian and (iii) the Tax
Indemnity Agreement dated as of December 22, 1994 (the "Tax Indemnity
Agreement") between the Owner Participant and Lessee. Capitalized terms not
defined herein have the meanings set forth in Appendix A to the Participation
Agreement.

We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed
necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion, including
those relating to the to the authorization, execution and delivery by the Owner
Participant of the Participation Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Tax

<PAGE> 66
A-2-2

Pursuant to the requirements of Section 4(a)(vi) of the
Participation Agreement, this will advise you that, in the opinion of the
undersigned:

1. The Owner Participant has been duly incorporated, is
validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Participation
Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement and is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the activities of the Owner
Participant require such qualification, except where the failure to so
qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the Owner
Participant.

2. Assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by all of the parties thereto, each of the Participation
Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Owner Participant
enforceable against the Owner Participant in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
and by the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

3. The execution and delivery by the Owner Participant
of, and the performance by the Owner Participant of its obligations
under, the Participation Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Tax
Indemnity Agreement will not contravene (i) any provision of
applicable law, (ii) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
the Owner Participant, (iii) to the best of our knowledge, any
agreement or other instrument to which it is a party or to which its
properties may be bound, or (iv) to the best of our knowledge, any
judgment order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court
having jurisdiction over the Owner Participant; and no consent,
approval, authorization or order of, or qualification or filing with,
any governmental body or agency is required for the performance by the
Owner Participant of its obligations under the Participation
Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement.

4. The execution and delivery by the Owner Participant
of, and the performance by the Owner Participant of its obligations
under, the Participation Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Tax
Indemnity Agreement will not require the consent or approval of the
stockholders or the holders or trustee for any holders of any
indebtedness of the Owner Participant.

5. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or
qualification or filing with, any governmental body or agency is
required for the performance by the
<PAGE> 67
A-2-3

Owner Participant of its obligations under the Participation
Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement.

6. To the best of our knowledge after due inquiry, there are
no proceedings pending or threatened against or affecting the Owner
Participant in any court action or before any governmental authority
or arbitration board or tribunal that, if adversely determined,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect
on the Owner Participant or on the power or ability of the Owner
Participant to perform its obligations under the Participation
Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Tax Indemnity Agreement.

We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and the
foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the
federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation law of
the State of Delaware.

This opinion is being delivered solely for the benefit of the

FORM OF OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL
TO OWNER TRUSTEE 

December 22, 1994

To Each of the Parties Listed
on Schedule I Attached Hereto

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION

Leveraged Lease Financing of Railcars
Conrail 1994-A Pass Through Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel to Meridian Trust Company, a
Pennsylvania trust company ("Meridian"), in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Participation Agreement dated as of December 22, 1994 (the
"Participation Agreement"), by and among Consolidated Rail Corporation, as
Lessee (the "Lessee"), J.P. Morgan Interfunding Corp., a Delaware corporation,
as Owner Participant, Meridian, not in its individual capacity except as
specifically set forth therein, but solely as Owner Trustee (the "Owner
Trustee"), Wilmington Trust Company ("Wilmington"), as Indenture Trustee (the
"Indenture Trustee"), and Wilmington, as Pass Through Trustee (the "Pass
Through Trustee").

This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 4(a)(vii)
of the Participation Agreement.

Except as otherwise defined herein, terms used herein shall
have the meanings set forth in Appendix A to the Participation Agreement.

In our capacity described above, we have examined the
Participation Agreement, the Lease, Lease Supplement No. 1 dated December 22,
1994 (the "Lease Supplement"), the Railcar Purchase Agreement, the Trust
Agreement, the Indenture, Indenture Supplement No. 1 dated December 22, 1994
(the "Indenture Supplement"), the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Pass
Through Trust Supplement, the Certificate of
<PAGE> 70
A-3-2

Acceptance, and the Bill of Sale (collectively, the "Financing Documents"). We
have also examined Meridian's articles of incorporation and bylaws.

Based on the foregoing and upon an examination of such
questions of law and the review of such factual matters as we have considered
necessary or appropriate, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, and
qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:

1. Meridian is a Pennsylvania trust company duly organized
and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and has full power, authority, and legal
right to execute, deliver and perform the Participation Agreement and
the Trust Agreement and, in its capacity as Owner Trustee, each
Financing Document to which the Owner Trustee is a party.

2. Meridian has duly authorized, executed, and delivered the
Participation Agreement and the Trust Agreement, and each of the
Participation Agreement and Trust Agreement constitutes a legal,
valid, and binding obligation of Meridian, enforceable against
Meridian in accordance with its terms.

3. The Owner Trustee is duly authorized under the Trust
Agreement to execute, deliver and perform each Financing Document and
the Owner Trustee has duly executed and delivered each such Financing
Document and each such Financing Document constitutes a legal, valid,
and binding obligation of the Owner Trustee enforceable against the
Owner Trustee in accordance with its terms.

4. Insofar as the Uniform Commercial Code of Pennsylvania and
New York are applicable, the Indenture creates a security interest in
the rights of the Owner Trustee in the properties which are part of
the Indenture Estate (including all right, title, and interest of the
Owner Trustee in monies, instruments, and securities that are pledged
and delivered to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture, but
excluding Excluded Payments), and the beneficial interest of the Owner
Participant under the Trust Agreement in and to such properties is
subject, to the extent provided in the Indenture, to the Lien of the
Indenture for the benefit of the Holders from time to time of the
Equipment Notes. Except for the Indenture Trustee's taking possession
of the original counterpart of the Lease (insofar as the Lease may
constitute chattel paper (as such term is defined in the Uniform
Commercial Code of New York and Pennsylvania)) and all monies,
instruments, and securities which are part of the Owner Trust Estate,
no further action, including the filing or recording of any document,
is necessary to perfect the security interest of the Indenture Trustee
in the Indenture Estate.

5. The Trust Agreement duly creates a legal and valid trust
under Pennsylvania law; the trust created by the Trust Agreement has
been duly created and
<PAGE> 71
A-3-3

exists for the benefit of the Owner Participant as provided therein;
and the Trust Agreement creates for the benefit of the Owner
Participant the interest in the Owner Trust Estate which the Trust
Agreement by its terms purports to create, subject however to the
provisions of, and the Liens created by, the Indenture and the Lease.

6. Neither the execution or delivery by Meridian or the Owner
Trustee, as the case may be, of the Financing Documents nor the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated thereby by
Meridian or the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, requires the
consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, or the registration
with, or the taking of any other action with respect to, any
governmental authority or agency under any existing federal,
Pennsylvania or New York law except for the filing pursuant to Section
131.3 of the New York Banking Law, which filing has been duly
effected.

7. The execution, delivery and performance by Meridian of
each of the Financing Documents are not in violation of Meridian's
articles of incorporation or bylaws, or of any indenture, mortgage,
credit agreement, license, or other agreement or instrument known to
us without independent inquiry except as documented by the Meridian
officer's certificate attached hereto as Schedule II, to which
Meridian or the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, is a party or by
which either is bound, or of any law, governmental rule, or regulation
of the United States, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or the State
of New York governing the trust powers of Meridian, or any order or
judgment known to us without any independent inquiry except as
documented by the Meridian officer's certificate attached hereto as
Schedule II, to be applicable to Meridian or the Owner Trustee, as the
case may be, or subjects either the Owner Trust Estate or the
Indenture Estate to any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) under any of
the foregoing.

8. To the best of our knowledge without any independent
inquiry except as documented by the Meridian officer's certificate
attached hereto as Schedule II, there are no proceedings pending or
threatened against or affecting Meridian or the Owner Trustee in any
court or before any governmental authority, agency, or arbitration
board or tribunal which, if adversely determined, individually or in
the aggregate, would materially and adversely affect the right, power
and authority of Meridian or the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, to
enter into or perform the Financing Documents.

9. There are no taxes, fees or other charges ("Taxes")
(except Taxes imposed on Meridian on fees payable to the Owner
Trustee) payable under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or
any political subdivision thereof in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance by the Owner Trustee, Lessee, the Indenture
Trustee, the Pass Through Trustee or the Owner Participant of the
Financing Documents or in connection with the making by the Owner
Participant of
<PAGE> 72
A-3-4

its investment in the Items of Equipment or its acquisition of the
beneficial interest in the Owner Trust Estate, which would not have
been imposed if Meridian had not (a) been incorporated under the laws
of, (b) had its principal place of business in, (c) performed (in its
individual capacity or as Owner Trustee) any or all of its duties
under the Operative Documents in, and (d) engaged in any activities
unrelated to the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents
in, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and none of the Owner Trustee,
the Lessee, the Indenture Trustee, the Pass Through Trustee, the Owner
Participant, the Owner Trust Estate or the trust created by the Trust
Agreement will be subject to any Taxes (except Taxes imposed on
Meridian on fees payable to the Owner Trustee) under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any political subdivision thereof
based on or measured by, directly or indirectly, the gross receipts,
net income or value of the Owner Trust Estate, in any case, which
would not have been imposed if Meridian had not (w) been incorporated
under the laws of, (x) had its principal place of business in, (y)
performed (in its individual capacity or as Owner Trustee) any or all
of its duties under the Operative Documents in, and (z) engaged in any
activities unrelated to the transactions contemplated by the Operative
Documents in, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

10. The Owner Trustee has received from Lessee such title to
the Items of Equipment as was conveyed to it by Lessee, subject to the
rights of the Owner Trustee and Lessee under the Lease and the
security interest created pursuant to the Indenture, the Indenture
Supplement and the Lease Supplement; and, to our knowledge, there
exist no Lessor's Liens or other Liens (other than Permitted Liens)
affecting the Owner Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate, including
the interest of the Owner Trustee in the Items of Equipment resulting
from acts of the Owner Trustee or Meridian, as the case may be.

11. Neither a Pennsylvania court nor a Federal court applying
Pennsylvania law would permit the Owner Participant to terminate the
Trust Agreement, except as otherwise provided therein, until the Lien
of the Indenture on the Indenture Estate has been released and until
payment in full of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest
on, the Equipment Notes.

12. Under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as
long as the Trust Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with
its terms, creditors of any person that is an Owner Participant,
holders of a lien against the assets of any such person, such as
trustees, receivers or liquidators (whether or not any insolvency
proceeding has been commenced) (collectively the "Creditors") may
acquire legal, valid and enforceable claims and liens, as to the Trust
Estate, only against the beneficial interest of such person in the
Trust Estate, and do not have, and may not through the enforcement of
such Creditors' rights acquire, and other legal, valid, and
enforceable claim or lien against the Trust Estate.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following
assumptions, exceptions and qualifications:

A. No opinion is expressed herein as to the laws of any
jurisdiction except for the laws of the United States of America, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New York; provided,
however, that (i) no opinion is expressed herein as to any federal
securities laws, including but not limited to the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or any state
securities law; (ii) no opinion is expressed herein as to any law
related to the nature of the Items of Equipment; and (iii) no opinion
is expressed herein as to the accuracy or correctness of any number or
financial computation included in any Financing Document.

B. The foregoing opinions regarding enforceability of
any document or instrument are subject to (i) except for paragraphs 11
and 12 hereinabove, applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization, receivership, and similar laws affecting the rights
and remedies of creditors generally, (ii) general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) certain of the remedial
provisions in the Indenture being limited or rendered unenforceable by
applicable laws, which laws, however, do not in our opinion make the
remedies (taken as a whole) provided in the Indenture inadequate for
the practical realization of the benefits provided thereby.

C. We have assumed the due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of the parties thereto, other than Meridian or the
Owner Trustee, of the Financing Documents to which each is a party,
and that each of such parties has the full power, authority and legal
right to execute, deliver and perform each of such Financing
Documents.

D. We have assumed that all signatures (other than those
of Meridian and the Owner Trustee) on documents and instruments
examined by us are genuine, that all documents and instruments
submitted to us as originals are authentic, and that all documents and
instruments submitted to us as copies conform with the originals,
which facts we have not independently verified.

E. No opinion is expressed herein as to the priority of
any security interest or pledge.

F. We have assumed that any securities deposited or
required to be deposited with the Indenture Trustee are or will be in
certificated form.

December 22, 1994

To Each of the Persons Listed on
Schedule I Attached Hereto

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION

Leveraged Lease Financing of Railcars
Conrail 1994-A Pass Through Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel to Wilmington Trust Company
("Wilmington"), a Delaware banking corporation, in connection with the
Indenture, dated as of December 22, 1994 (the "Indenture"), by and between
Wilmington and Consolidated Rail Corporation ("Conrail"). Pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by the Participation Agreement, dated as of December
22, 1994 (the "Participation Agreement"), by and among Wilmington, not in its
individual capacity except as expressly set forth therein but solely as
Indenture Trustee (the "Indenture Trustee") under the Indenture, Wilmington,
not in its individual capacity except as expressly set forth therein but solely
as Pass Through Trustee under the Pass Through Agreement, Conrail, as Lessee,
J.P. Morgan Intefunding Corp., as Owner Participant, and the Owner Trustee,
financing is being provided for rebuilt and new railcars. This opinion is
provided pursuant to Section 4(a)(viii) of the Participation Agreement.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are used as defined in or by
reference in Appendix A to the Participation Agreement.

We have examined executed or conformed counterparts, or copies
otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Indenture and the
Participation Agreement (the Indenture and the Participation Agreement being
collectively referred to herein as the "Operative Documents"), Indenture
Supplement No. 1 dated December 22, 1994 (the "Indenture Supplement") and the
Equipment Notes.

We have also examined originals or copies of such other
documents, such corporate records, certificates and other statements of
governmental and corporate officials
<PAGE> 78
A-4-2

and other representatives of the corporation or entities referred to herein and
such other instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes
of this opinion. As to certain facts material to the opinions expressed
herein, we have relied upon the representations and warranties contained in the
Operative Documents.

Based on the foregoing and upon an examination of such
questions of law as we have considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to
the assumptions, exceptions and qualifications set forth herein, we advise you
that in our opinion:

1. Wilmington is a Delaware banking corporation duly
organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, has the corporate power and authority, individually
or as Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, to enter into its
obligations under the Operative Documents, to perform its obligations
under the Indenture and the Participation Agreement and to issue,
execute, deliver and perform the obligations under the Equipment
Notes.

2. Each of Wilmington and the Indenture Trustee, as the case
may be, has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Operative
Documents, and such documents constitute the legal, valid, and binding
obligations of Wilmington or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may
be, enforceable against Wilmington or the Indenture Trustee, as the
case may be, in accordance with their respective terms.

3. The Equipment Notes have been duly authorized, issued,
executed and delivered by the Indenture Trustee, pursuant to
authorization contained in the Indenture and such Equipment Notes
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Indenture
Trustee enforceable against the Indenture Trustee in accordance with
their terms and the terms of the Indenture.

4. The execution and delivery of the Operative Documents, the
performance of the Indenture and the Participation Agreement and the
authorization, issuance, execution, delivery and performance of the
Equipment Notes by Wilmington or the Indenture Trustee, as the case
may be, are not in violation of Wilmington's articles of incorporation
or by-laws, or of any indenture, mortgage, credit agreement, license
or other agreement or instrument known to us to which Wilmington or
the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, is a party or by which
either is bound, or of any law, governmental rule or regulation of the
State of Delaware, or of any order or judgment known to us to be
applicable to Wilmington or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be.

5. To our knowledge, there exist no Liens affecting the
interest of the Indenture Trustee in the Items of Equipment resulting
from acts of Wilmington or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be,
except Liens permitted by the Operative Documents.
<PAGE> 79
A-4-3

6. Neither the authorization, execution, or delivery by
Wilmington or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, of the
Operative Documents nor the issuance, execution, and delivery of the
Equipment Notes by the Indenture Trustee, nor the consummation of any
transactions, or performance of any of the obligations, by Wilmington
or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, contemplated thereby
requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, or the
registration with, or the taking of any other action with respect to,
any Delaware governmental authority, agency, or regulatory body
governing the banking and trust powers of Wilmington under any
existing Delaware law.

7. There are no taxes, fees, or other governmental charges
payable under the laws of the State of Delaware in respect to the
execution and delivery by Wilmington or the Indenture Trustee, as the
case may be, of the Participation Agreement, the Indenture or the
issuance, execution, and delivery of the Equipment Notes by the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture except for taxes on any
fees received by the Indenture Trustee, which would not have been
imposed if the Indenture Trustee did not have its principal place of
business in Delaware or did not perform its administrative duties
under the Indenture in Delaware. Neither Wilmington, the Indenture
Trustee, the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the trust created
by the Trust Agreement, the Equipment Notes, a Holder of a Equipment
Note, nor the trust created by the Indenture Supplement will, as a
result of the transactions contemplated thereby, be subject to any
tax, fee, or other governmental charge under the laws of the State of
Delaware or any political subdivision thereof (except for taxes on any
fees received by the Indenture Trustee) which would not have been
imposed if the Indenture Trustee did not have its principal place of
business in Delaware or did not perform its administrative duties
under the Indenture in Delaware, and there are no applicable taxes,
fees, or other governmental charges under the laws of the State of
Delaware or any political subdivision thereof (except for taxes on any
fees received by the Indenture Trustee) upon or with respect to the
Items of Equipment or any part of any interest therein, or the
purchase, ownership, delivery, lease, sublease, possession, presence,
use, operation, condition, storage, maintenance, modification,
alteration, repair, sale, return, transfer or other disposition of the
Items of Equipment or any part which would not have been imposed if
the Indenture Trustee did not have its principal place of business in
Delaware or did not perform its administrative duties under the
Indenture in the State of Delaware.

8. To the best of our knowledge, there are no proceedings
pending or threatened against or affecting Wilmington or the Indenture
Trustee, as the case may be, in any court or before any governmental
authority, agency or arbitration board or tribunal which, if adversely
determined, individually or in the aggregate, would materially and
adversely affect the right, power, and authority of Wilmington or the
Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, to enter into or perform the
respective

A-4-4

obligations of Wilmington or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may
be, under the instruments referred to in paragraph 1 above.

9. Under Delaware law, no filing or recording in Delaware of
any document or instrument is necessary to establish and perfect the
security interest created by the Indenture in all estate, right,
title, and interest of the Owner Trustee in and to the Lease (other
than Excepted Property) and to establish and perfect the Indenture
Trustee's legal title to the Items of Equipment purchased by the Owner
Trustee on the Delivery Date of such Items of Equipment.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following
assumptions, exceptions and qualifications:

A. The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the
State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America
governing the banking and trust powers of Wilmington. In addition, we
express no opinion with respect to (i) federal securities laws,
including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or (ii) state securities or blue
sky laws. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity
and enforceability in Delaware of the Equipment Notes and the
Operative Documents expressed to be governed by the laws of the State
of New York, we have assumed that the Equipment Notes and such
Operative Documents constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable
documents or instruments under such laws (as to which we express no
opinion).

B. The foregoing opinions regarding the enforceability of any
document or instrument are subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, receivership, fraudulent
conveyance and similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors generally, and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law).

C. With respect to the opinion expressed in paragraph 9
above, we have, with your permission and without any independent
investigation, assumed that (i) neither the Owner Trustee nor the
Lessee has its chief executive office in Delaware and (ii) under the
laws of the jurisdictions in which the Owner Trustee and the Lessee
are located, no filing or recording in Delaware of any document or
instrument is necessary to establish and perfect the security interest
created by the Indenture in all estate, right, title, and interest of
the Owner Trustee in and to the Lease (other than Expected Property)
and to establish and perfect the Indenture Trustee's legal title to
the Items of Equipment purchased by the Owner Trustee on the Delivery
Date of the Items of Equipment.
<PAGE> 81
A-4-5

D. We have assumed the due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of the parties thereto, other than Wilmington or the
Indenture Trustee, of the Operative Documents to which each is a party
and that each of such parties has the full power, authority and legal
right to execute and deliver each such document.

E. We have assumed that all signatures (other than those of
Wilmington or the Indenture Trustee) on documents and instruments
submitted to us as originals are authentic, and that all documents and
instruments submitted to us as copies conform with the originals,
which facts we have not independently verified.

F. We do not purport to be experts in respect of, or express
any opinion concerning, any laws, rules or regulations applicable to
the particular nature of the equipment to be acquired by the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee.

G. We have assumed that the Participation Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby are not within the prohibitions of
Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

H. No opinion is expressed as to the nature of the title to
any part of the Indenture Estate or as to the establishment,
perfection or priority of any mortgage or security interest.

FORM OF OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL
TO PASS THROUGH TRUSTEE 

December 22, 1994

To Each of the Persons Listed on
Schedule I Attached Hereto

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION

Leveraged Lease Financing of Railcars
Conrail 1994-A Pass Through Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel to Wilmington Trust Company
("Wilmington"), a Delaware banking corporation, in connection with the Pass
Through Trust Agreement, dated as of December 22, 1994 (the "Pass Through
Agreement"), by and between Wilmington and Consolidated Rail Corporation
("Conrail") and Pass Through Trust Agreement Supplement No. 1 (the "Pass
Through Trust Supplement"), by and between Wilmington and Conrail. Pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by the Participation Agreement, dated as of
December 22, 1994 (the "Participation Agreement"), by and among Wilmington, not
in its individual capacity except as expressly set forth therein but solely as
Indenture Trustee (the "Indenture Trustee") under the Indenture, Wilmington,
not in its individual capacity except as expressly set forth therein but solely
as Pass Through Trustee under the Pass Through Agreement, Conrail, as Lessee,
J.P. Morgan Intefunding Corp., as Owner Participant, and the Owner Trustee,
financing is being provided for rebuilt and new railcars. This opinion is
provided pursuant to Section 4(a)(ix) of the Participation Agreement.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are used as defined in or by
reference in Appendix A to the Participation Agreement.

We have examined executed or conformed counterparts, or copies
otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Pass Through Trust Agreement,
the Pass Through Trust Supplement, the Participation Agreement (the Pass
Through Trust Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Supplement and the
Participation Agreement being collectively referred to herein as the "Operative
Documents") and the 8.45% Pass Through Certificates, Series 1994-A being issued
on the date hereof (the "Certificates").
<PAGE> 84
We have also examined originals or copies of such other
documents, such corporate records, certificates and other statements of
governmental and corporate officials and other representatives of the
corporation or entities referred to herein and such other instruments as we
have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. As to
certain facts material to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon
the representations and warranties contained in the Operative Documents.

Based on the foregoing and upon an examination of such
questions of law as we have considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to
the assumptions, exceptions and qualifications set forth herein, we advise you
that in our opinion:

1. Wilmington is a Delaware banking corporation duly
organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, has the corporate power and authority, individually
or as Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, to enter into and
perform its obligations under the Operative Documents, and to issue,
execute, deliver and perform the obligations under the Certificates.

2. Each of Wilmington and the Pass Through Trustee, as the
case may be, has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Operative
Documents, and such documents constitute the legal, valid, and binding
obligations of Wilmington or the Pass Through Trustee, as the case may
be, enforceable against Wilmington or the Pass Through Trustee, as the
case may be, in accordance with their respective terms.

3. The Certificates have been duly authorized, issued,
executed and delivered by the Pass Through Trustee, pursuant to
authorization contained in the Pass Through Trust Agreement and such
Certificates constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of
the Pass Through Trustee enforceable against the Pass Through Trustee
in accordance with their terms and the terms of the Pass Through Trust
Agreement and the holders of the Certificates are entitled to the
benefits of the Pass Through Trust Agreement.

4. The execution and delivery of the Operative Documents, the
performance of the Pass Through Trust Agreement and the Participation
Agreement and the authorization, issuance, execution, delivery and
performance of the Certificates by Wilmington or the Pass Through
Trustee, as the case may be, are not in violation of Wilmington's
articles of incorporation or by-laws, or of any indenture, mortgage,
credit agreement, license or other agreement or instrument known to us
to which Wilmington or the Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be,
is a party or by which either is bound, or of any law, governmental
rule or regulation of the State of Delaware, or of any order or
judgment known to us to be applicable to Wilmington or the Pass
Through Trustee, as the case may be.

5. Neither the authorization, execution, or delivery by
Wilmington or the Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, of the
Operative Documents nor the issuance,
<PAGE> 85
A-5-3

execution, and delivery of the Certificates by the Pass Through
Trustee, nor the consummation of any transactions, or performance of
any of the obligations, by Wilmington or the Pass Through Trustee, as
the case may be, contemplated thereby requires the consent or approval
of, the giving of notice to, or the registration with, or the taking
of any other action with respect to, any Delaware governmental
authority, agency, or regulatory body governing the banking and trust
powers of Wilmington under any existing Delaware law.

6. There are no taxes, fees, or other governmental charges
payable under the laws of the State of Delaware or any political
subdivision thereof in respect to the execution and delivery by
Wilmington or the Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, of the
Participation Agreement, the Pass Through Trust Agreement or the Pass
Through Trust Supplement or the issuance, execution, and delivery of
the Certificates by the Pass Through Trustee pursuant to the Pass
Through Trust Agreement except for taxes on any fees received by the
Pass Through Trustee, which would not have been imposed if the Pass
Through Trustee did not have its principal place of business in
Delaware or did not perform its administrative duties under the Pass
Through Trust Agreement in Delaware. There no taxes, fees, or other
governmental charges payable under the laws of the State of Delaware
or any political subdivision thereof by the Pass Through Trustee in
connection with the acquisition, possession or ownership by the Pass
Through Trustee of any of the Equipment Notes except for taxes on any
fees received by the Pass Through Trustee, which would not have been
imposed if the Pass Through Trustee did not have its principal place
of business in Delaware or did not perform its administrative duties
under the Pass Through Trust Agreement in Delaware.

7. Assuming that the trust created by the Pass Through Trust
Agreement will not be taxable as a corporation, but, rather will be
characterized as a grantor trust under Subpart R, Part I of Subchapter
J of the Code, such trust and the Trust Property (as defined in the
Pass Through Trust Agreement) will not be subject to any taxes imposed
by the State of Delaware or any political subdivision thereof.
Holders of Certificates who are not residents of the State of Delaware
and who are not otherwise subject to tax in the State of Delaware on
account of business or investment activities transacted or consummated
therein, will not be subject to any tax (including, but not limited
to, net or gross income, tangible or intangible property, net worth,
capital, franchise or doing business tax), governmental fees or other
governmental charges under the laws of the State of Delaware or any
political subdivision thereof as a result of purchasing, holding
(including receiving payments with respect to) or selling a
Certificate.

8. To the best of our knowledge, there are no proceedings
pending or threatened against or affecting Wilmington or the Pass
Through Trustee, as the case may be, in any court or before any
governmental authority, agency or arbitration
<PAGE> 86
A-5-4

board or tribunal which, if adversely determined, individually or in
the aggregate, would materially and adversely affect the right, power,
and authority of Wilmington or the Pass Through Trustee, as the case
may be, to enter into or perform the respective obligations of
Wilmington or the Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, under the
instruments referred to in paragraph 1 above.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following
assumptions, exceptions and qualifications:

A. The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the
State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America
governing the banking and trust powers of Wilmington. In addition, we
express no opinion with respect to (i) federal securities laws,
including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or (ii) state securities or blue
sky laws. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity
and enforceability in Delaware of the Certificates and the Operative
Documents expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of New
York, we have assumed that the Certificates and such Operative
Documents constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable documents
or instruments under such laws (as to which we express no opinion).

B. The foregoing opinions regarding the enforceability of any
document or instrument are subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, receivership, fraudulent
conveyance and similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors generally, and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law).

C. We have assumed the due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of the parties thereto, other than Wilmington or the
Pass Through Trustee, of the Operative Documents to which each is a
party and that each of such parties has the full power, authority and
legal right to execute and deliver each such document.

D. We have assumed that all signatures (other than those of
Wilmington or the Pass Through Trustee) on documents and instruments
submitted to us as originals are authentic, and that all documents and
instruments submitted to us as copies conform with the originals,
which facts we have not independently verified.

E. We have assumed that the Participation Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby are not within the prohibitions of
Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

FORM OF OPINION OF SPECIAL
CANADIAN COUNSEL 

December 22, 1993

To each of the persons listed
on the Schedule attached hereto

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION

Leveraged Lease Financing of Railcars
Conrail 1994-A Pass Through Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special Canadian Counsel in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Participation Agreement, dated as of
December 22, 1994 (the "Participation Agreement"), pertaining to the
above-referenced Pass Through Trust, among Consolidated Rail Corporation (the
"Lessee"), J.P. Morgan Interfunding Corp., (the "Owner Participant"), Meridian
Trust Company, not in its individual capacity except as specifically set forth
therein but solely as owner trustee (the "Owner Trustee"), Wilmington Trust
Company ("Wilmington"), as Indenture Trustee (the "Indenture Trustee") and
Wilmington, as Pass Through Trustee. This opinion is delivered to you pursuant
to Section 4(a)(x) of the Participation Agreement and Section ____ of the
Underwriting Agreement between Lessee and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated.
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined are used as defined in
Appendix A to the Participation Agreement.

We have examined executed copies of each of the Indenture,
Indenture Supplement No. 1 dated December 22, 1994 (the "Indenture
Supplement"), the Lease and Lease Supplement No. 1 dated December 22, 1994 (the
"Lease Supplement") and execution copies of the Participation Agreement.

In giving the opinion hereinafter expressed, we considered
such questions of law as we have deemed necessary.
<PAGE> 89
A-6-2

Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Indenture, the Indenture Supplement, the Lease and the
Lease Supplement have been duly deposited with the office of the
Registrar General of Canada pursuant to Section 90 of the Railway Act
(Canada).

2. The aforementioned deposit of the Indenture, the Indenture
Supplement, the Lease and the Lease Supplement with the Registrar
General of Canada will preserve and protect the Indenture Trustee's
rights under the Indenture and to all Items of Equipment against any
other person in Canada and no other filing, recordation, deposit,
re-filing, re-recordation or re-deposit (or giving of notice) with any
federal, provincial or local government or agency thereof is necessary
in order to fully protect the Indenture Trustee's rights under the
Indenture and to all Items of Equipment described in the Lease
Supplement in Canada or any province or territory thereof.

3. The aforementioned deposit of the Lease and the Lease
Supplement with the Registrar General of Canada will preserve and
protect the Owner Trustee's rights under the Lease and to all Items of
Equipment delivered under the Lease Supplement against any other
person in Canada and no other filing, recordation, deposit, re-filing,
re-recordation or re-deposit (or giving of notice) with any federal,
provincial or local government or agency thereof is necessary in order
to protect the Owner Trustee's rights under the Lease and to all Items
of Equipment described in the Lease Supplement in Canada or any
province or territory thereof.

The opinions expressed herein are subject to the following
qualifications:

(i) enforcement of the rights of the Owner Trustee or
Indenture Trustee may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally from time to time in
effect;

(ii) equitable remedies are subject to the discretion of
the court before which they are brought; and

(iii) a monetary judgment by a court in Canada will only be
awarded in Canadian dollars; however, in Ontario, a court will award
that amount of Canadian dollars on the day before payment.

Yours very truly,

Event of Default, ETA Default or Event of Acceleration, the Owner Trustee shall
give to the Owner Participant, Lessee and the Indenture Trustee prompt

certified mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested. Subject to
Section 5.03, the Owner Trustee shall take such action or shall refrain from
taking such action, not inconsistent with the terms of the Operative Documents,
with respect to such Potential Default, Event of Default, ETA Default or Event
of Acceleration as the Owner Trustee shall be directed in writing by the Owner

above provided within 20 days after mailing notice of such Potential Default,
Event of Default, ETA Default or Event of Acceleration to the Owner
Participant, the Owner Trustee may, subject to instructions received pursuant
to the preceding sentence, take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, but shall be under no duty to take or refrain from taking any action,
with respect to such Potential Default, Event of Default, ETA Default or Event
of Acceleration not inconsistent with the provisions of the Indenture, as it
shall deem in its sole and absolute discretion to be in the best interests of
the Owner Participant. For all purposes of this Agreement and the Lease, the
Owner Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of a Potential Default,
Event of Default, ETA Default or an Event of Acceleration unless notified in
writing thereof in the manner and at the address set forth in Section 11.05 or
unless an officer in the Corporate Trust Administration of the Owner Trustee
has actual knowledge thereof. The Owner Trustee will furnish to the Owner
Participant and the Indenture Trustee, promptly upon receipt thereof,
duplicates or copies of all reports, notices, requests, demands, certificates,
financial statements and any other instrument furnished to the Owner Trustee
hereunder or under the Operative Documents, unless by the express terms of any
Operative Document a copy of the same is required to be furnished by some other
Person directly to the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee or the Owner
Trustee shall have determined that the same has already been furnished to the
Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee.

Section 5.02. Action Upon Instructions. Subject to Sections
5.01 and 5.03 and to the terms of any other applicable Operative Document, upon
the written instructions at any time and from time to time of the Owner

be specified in such instructions: (i) give such notice or

<PAGE> 9

direction or exercise such right, remedy or power hereunder or under any
Operative Document to which the Owner Trustee is a party, or in respect of all
or any part of the Owner Trust Estate, as shall be specified in such
instructions; (ii) take such action to preserve or protect the Owner Trust
Estate (including the discharge of any Liens) as shall be specified in such
instructions; (iii) approve as satisfactory to the Owner Trustee all matters
required by the terms of the Lease or any other Operative Document to be

instructions of the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee shall not approve any
such matter as satisfactory to it; and (iv) subject to the rights of Lessee
under the Operative Documents, after the expiration or earlier termination of
the Lease with respect to such Items of Equipment, convey all of the Owner
Trustee's right, title and interest in and to the Item of Equipment for such
amount, on such terms and to such purchaser or purchasers as shall be
designated in such instructions, or retain, lease or otherwise dispose of the
Items of Equipment on such terms as shall be set forth in such instructions or
deliver the Items of Equipment to the Owner Participant in accordance with such
instructions; provided, however, that if such instructions have not been
delivered to the Owner Trustee prior to the expiration of one year following
expiration or earlier termination of the Lease with respect to such Item of
Equipment, the Owner Trustee shall transfer title to all such interests to the
Owner Participant. In the event that the Owner Trustee is unsure as to the
application of any provision of this Agreement or of any other agreement
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Owner Trustee may request
and rely upon instructions of the Owner Participant.

Section 5.03. Right to Indemnity Before Acting. The Owner
Trustee shall not be required to take or refrain from taking action under
Section 5.01 or 5.02 (other than to give the notices required of the Owner
Trustee therein) unless the Owner Trustee shall have been indemnified by the
Owner Participant, in manner and form reasonably satisfactory to the Owner
Trustee, against any liability, cost or expense (including reasonable counsel
fees and disbursements) which may be incurred in connection therewith; and if
the Owner Participant shall have directed the Owner Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any such action, the Owner Participant agrees to furnish such
indemnity as shall be required and, in addition (to the extent not otherwise
paid pursuant to the Participation Agreement, the Lease or the Indenture) to
pay the reasonable fees and charges of the Owner Trustee for the services
performed or to be performed by it pursuant to such direction. The Owner
Trustee shall not be required to take any action under Section 5.01 or 5.02 if
the Owner Trustee shall reasonable determine, or shall have been advised by
counsel, that such action is contrary to the terms of any Operative Document to
which the Owner Trustee is a party or is contrary to law.

Section 5.04. No Duties Except as Specified. The Owner
Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to manage, control, use, sell,
dispose of or otherwise deal with any Item of Equipment or any other part of
the Owner Trust Estate, or otherwise to take or refrain from taking any action
under, or in connection with, any Operative Document to which the Owner Trustee
is a party, except as expressly required by the terms of any

<PAGE> 10

Operative Document to which the Owner Trustee is a party, or (to the extent not
inconsistent with the terms of the Indenture) as expressly required by the
terms hereof or in written instructions received pursuant to Section 5.01 or
5.02 from the Owner Participant; and no implied duties or obligations shall be
read into this Agreement or any other Operative Document to which the Owner
Trustee is a party against the Owner Trustee. Meridian nevertheless agrees
that it will, at its own cost and expense (without any right of indemnity in
respect of any such cost or expense under Section 7.01), promptly take such
action as may be necessary duly to discharge and satisfy in full: (i) all
Lessor's Liens attributable to Meridian or the Owner Trustee; (ii) any Liens
(other than Lessor's Liens attributable to Meridian or the Owner Trustee)
created as a result of Meridian's or the Owner Trustee's breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement (subject to the limitations on liability set
forth in Section 6.01) on any part of the Owner Trust Estate, or on any
properties of the Owner Trustee assigned, pledged or mortgaged as part of the
Owner Trust Estate, which arise from acts of Meridian or the Owner Trustee,
except the Lien created by the Indenture, the rights of Lessee under the Lease
and the rights of the Owner Participant hereunder, and (iii) any other Liens
attributable to Meridian or the Owner Trustee on any part of the Owner Trust
Estate which result from claims against Meridian or the Owner Trustee unrelated
to the ownership of the Items of Equipment, the administration of the Owner
Trust Estate or the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents.

Section 5.05. No Action Except Under Specified Documents or
Instructions. The Owner Trustee shall have no power or authority to, and the
Owner Trustee agrees that it will not, manage, control, use, sell, dispose of
or otherwise deal with the Items of Equipment or any other part of the Owner
Trust Estate except (i) as expressly required by the terms of any Operative
Document to which the Owner Trustee is a party, (ii) as expressly required by
the terms hereof or (iii) as expressly provided in written instructions from
the Owner participant pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.02, but subject always to
the provisions of, and the Lien created by, the Indenture.

OTHER EFFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, AS TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY
INFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENT, TRADEMARK OR COPYRIGHT OR AS TO THE ABSENCE OF
OBLIGATIONS BASED ON LIABILITY IN TORT, STRICT OR OTHERWISE, OR AS TO THE
QUALITY OF THE MATERIAL OR WORKMANSHIP OF ANY ITEM OF EQUIPMENT OR ANY PART
THEREOF OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,

any other Operative Document to which the Owner Trustee is a party, or any
other document or instrument delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, or as to the
correctness of any statement contained in any thereof, except to the extent
that any such representation, warranty or statement is expressly made herein or
therein as a representation, warranty or statement by Meridian or the Owner
Trustee and except that Meridian hereby represents and warrants that this
Agreement has been, and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Owner Participant) the other Operative Documents to
which the Owner Trustee is a party have been, or at the time of execution and
delivery thereof by the Owner Trustee pursuant hereto or to the Participation
Agreement will be, duly executed and delivered by one of Meridian's officers
who is or will be, as the case may be, duly authorized to execute and deliver
the same on behalf of the Owner Trustee and that this Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by Meridian and constitutes the legal, valid

in reliance upon any signature, instrument, notice, resolution, request,
consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other document or paper
reasonably believed by it to be genuine and reasonably believed by it to be
signed by the proper party or parties. Unless other evidence in respect
thereof is specifically prescribed herein, any request, direction, order or
demand of the Owner Participant, Lessee or the Indenture Trustee mentioned
herein or in any other Operative Document to which the Owner Trustee is a party
shall be sufficiently evidenced by a written instrument signed by a person
purporting to be an officer of the Owner Participant, Lessee or the Indenture

resolution of the Board of Directors of the Owner Participant or Lessee, as the
case may be, certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Owner
Participant or Lessee as the case may be, as duly adopted and in full force and
effect, as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted by
such Board of Directors and that the same is in full force and effect. As to
any fact or matter the manner of ascertainment of which is not specifically
provided herein, the Owner Trustee may for all purposes hereof rely on a
certificate signed by an officer of the Owner Participant, Lessee or the
Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, as to such fact or matter, and such
certificate shall constitute full protection

<PAGE> 13

to the Owner Trustee for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good
faith in reliance thereon.

for its services hereunder.

Section 6.08. Tax Returns. The Owner Trustee shall be
responsible for the keeping of all appropriate books and records relating to

Owner Trustee, upon request and upon adequate assurance of reimbursement by the
Owner Participant for the costs and expenses associated therewith, shall
furnish to the Owner Participant all such information as may be reasonably
required from the Owner Trustee in connection with the preparation of such
income tax returns. Upon request of Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee shall
sign and file the trust's tax returns prepared by the Owner Participant.

liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, taxes (excluding any
taxes payable by Meridian on or measured by any fees or other compensation
received by Meridian for its services hereunder), claims, actions, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements (including, without limitation, reasonable

<PAGE> 14

relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Operative Document or
the enforcement of the terms of any thereof, or in any way relating to or
arising out of the manufacture, purchase, acceptance, non-acceptance,
rejection, ownership, delivery, lease, possession, use, operation, condition,
sale, return or other disposition of any Item of Equipment (including, without
limitation, latent and other defects, whether or not discoverable, and any
claim for patent, trademark or copyright infringement), or in any way relating
to or arising out of the administration of the Owner Trust Estate or the action
or inaction of the Owner Trustee hereunder, except: (i) in the case of willful
misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Owner Trustee or Meridian as
trustee or in its individual capacity, respectively, in the performance or
nonperformance of its obligations and duties hereunder, (ii) those resulting
from the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Meridian or the Owner
Trustee (or from its failure to perform any covenant) in Section 6.03 or in any
other Operative Document; (iii) those arising or resulting from any of the
matters described in the last sentence of Section 6.01; or (iv) those resulting
from its failure to perform the terms of the last sentence of Section 5.04 or

provided that the Owner Participant shall be liable under this Section 7.01
only to the extent that the Owner Trustee is indemnified by the Lessee pursuant
to Section 16 of the Participation Agreement; provided further that before
asserting its right to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.01, the Owner
Trustee shall first demand its corresponding right to indemnification, if any,
pursuant to Section 16 of the Participation Agreement (but need not exhaust any
or all remedies available thereunder), provided the Owner Participant has the
right to pursue any such remedies against the Lessee which are not pursued by
the Owner Trustee. The indemnities contained in this Section 7.01 extend to
Meridian only and shall not be construed as indemnities of the Indenture Estate
or the Owner Trust Estate. The indemnities contained in this Section 7.01
shall survive the termination of this Agreement. In addition, if necessary,
the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification from the Owner Trust
Estate, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 4.01 and the Lien
created by the Indenture, for any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty,
tax, claim, action, suit, cost, expense or disbursement indemnified against
pursuant to this Section 7.01 to the extent not reimbursed by Lessee, the Owner
Participant or others, but without releasing any of them from their respective
agreements of reimbursement; and to secure the same the Owner Trustee shall
have a Lien on the Owner Trust Estate, subject, however, to the provisions of
Section 4.01 and the Lien created by the Indenture, which Lien of the Owner
Trustee shall be prior to any interest herein of the Owner Participant.

ARTICLE VIII

Section 14 of the Participation Agreement shall (with the same force and effect
as if set forth in full, mutatis mutandis, in this Section 8.01) be applicable

party.

ARTICLE IX

Section 9.01. Resignation or Removal of the Owner Trustee;
Appointment of Successor. (a) Resignation or Removal. The Owner Trustee or
any successor Owner Trustee may resign at any time without cause by giving at
least 60 days' prior written notice to the Owner Participant, the Indenture
Trustee and Lessee, such resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Owner Trustee under Section 9.01(b). In addition,
the Owner Participant may at any time remove the Owner Trustee without cause by
a notice in writing delivered to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and
Lessee, such removal to be effective upon the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Owner Trustee under Section 9.01(b). In the case of the resignation
or removal of the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant may appoint a successor
Owner Trustee by an instrument in writing signed by the Owner Participant. If
a successor Owner Trustee shall not have been appointed within 30 days after
such notice of resignation or removal, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee
or Lessee may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a
successor Owner Trustee to act until such time, if any, as a successor shall
have been appointed by the Owner Participant as above provided. Any successor
Owner Trustee so appointed by such court shall immediately, and without further
act, be superseded by any successor Owner Trustee appointed by the Owner
Participant as above provided within one year from the date of the appointment
by such court.

(b) Execution and Delivery of Certain Documents. Any
successor Owner Trustee, however appointed, shall execute and deliver to the
predecessor Owner Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and
thereupon such successor Owner Trustee, without further act, shall become
vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and trusts of
the predecessor Owner Trustee in the trusts hereunder with like effect as if
originally named the Owner Trustee herein; but nevertheless, upon the written
request of such successor Owner Trustee, such predecessor Owner Trustee shall
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Owner Trustee,
upon the trusts herein expressed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers
and trusts of such predecessor Owner Trustee, and such predecessor Owner
Trustee shall duly assign, transfer, deliver and pay over to such successor
Owner Trustee all monies or other property then held by such predecessor Owner
Trustee upon the trusts herein expressed.

(c) Qualification. Any successor Owner Trustee, however
appointed, shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $100,000,000, if there by such an

<PAGE> 16

Trustee hereunder upon reasonable and customary terms.

(d) Merger, etc. Any corporation into which the Owner
Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Owner Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all
the corporate trust business of the Owner Trustee may be transferred, shall,
subject to Section 9.01(c), be the Owner Trustee hereunder without further act.

Section 9.02. Co-Trustees and Separate Trustees. If at any
time or times it shall be necessary or prudent in order to conform to any
applicable law of any jurisdiction in which all or any part of the Owner Trust
Estate is located, or the Owner Trustee shall be advised by counsel that it is
so necessary or prudent in the interest of the Owner Participant or the Owner
Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant shall execute and deliver
an agreement supplemental hereto and all other instruments and agreements
necessary or proper to constitute another bank or trust company or one or more
Persons approved by the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant and Lessee, either
to act as co-trustee or co-trustees, jointly with the Owner Trustee, or to act
