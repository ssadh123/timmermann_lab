Item 5. Other Events.

On November 22, the registrant announced that it has reached definitive 
agreements with Bell Atlantic Corporation and NYNEX to purchase certain 
cellular properties that are within or contiguous to areas served by 
SNET Mobility, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the registrant. The 
properties to be purchased include all of Rhode Island and the New Bedford, 
Massachusetts area now owned by Bell Atlantic as well as NYNEX's ownership
of 80 percent of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts market and a 16.1 percent 
interest in a cellular partnership currently 82.5 percent owned and managed 
by the registrant.

These acquisitions, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 
$450 million in cash, will add an estimated 2.3 million people, or POPS, 
to the registrant's cellular service area for a combined market population 
of over 5.5 million POPS. The registrant expects to finance these 
acquisitions with debt. 

The closing of these transactions is subject to the consummation by Bell
Atlantic and NYNEX of their cellular joint venture, the formation of which 
requires their sale of these properties. It is also subject to approval
by the Federal Communications Commission and the United States Department
of Justice. In addition, the acquisition of the Pittsfield property is 
subject to a right of first refusal by a third party.

The dilution to the registrant's earnings per share for 1995, assuming
these acquisitions closed on January 1, 1995, would range from 7 percent 
to 9 percent as compared to external analyst expectations for the registrant's 
1995 earnings. However, since the closing of these transactions is dependent
upon the events described above, the registrant does not expect these 
transactions to close until later in 1995. Accordingly, such 1995 dilution 
to earnings should be significantly less than 7 percent to 9 percent.

On November 22, Moody's Investors Service confirmed the registrant's 
senior unsecured long-term debt rating of A1 and the Prime-1 short-term 
rating.

On November 23, Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P") placed its AA long-
term debt and A-1+ commercial paper ratings of the registrant on CreditWatch
with negative implications. Additionally, S&P placed the AA long-term debt 
rating of The Southern New England Telephone Company on CreditWatch with 
negative implications. The registrant anticipates that S&P will reach its 
final decision on such credit ratings by the end of 1994.

The news release providing the announcement by the registrant is filed as 
an exhibit hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

SNET SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS CELLULAR BUSINESS IN
BOSTON-NEW YORK CORRIDOR

SNET (NYSE:SNG) announced today that it has reached

definitive agreements with Bell Atlantic Corporation

(NYSE:BEL) and NYNEX (NYSE:NYN) to purchase certain

cellular properties that are within or contiguous to areas

already served by SNET Mobility. The properties to be

purchased include all of Rhode Island and the New Bedford,

Massachusetts area now owned by Bell Atlantic as well as

NYNEX's ownership of 80 percent of the Pittsfield,

Massachusetts market and a 16.1 percent interest in a

cellular partnership currently 82.5 percent owned and

managed by SNET.

The acquisition will add approximately 2.3 million

people - or POPs - to SNET's cellular service area for a

combined market covering a population of over 5.5 million

POPs, and increases SNET's POPs by 70 percent. POPs is an

industry term referring to population of the cellular area

served. Under the agreement, SNET Mobility will pay

approximately $450 million in cash for a combination of

controlled and minority interests.

"With the purchase of these cellular properties,

we are seizing a unique opportunity to dramatically increase

our presence in the fastest growing

segment of the telecommunications industry," said Daniel J.

Miglio, SNET Chairman and CEO. "All of these properties are

within or adjacent to cellular properties we already serve,

significantly expanding our position in the strategic New

York - Boston corridor. We look forward to bringing our

high quality wireless communications service to an expanded

marketplace in one of the most communications-intensive

corridors in the world. This acquisition improves the

economies of scale in our cellular business and it

strengthens our competitive position in the wireless

marketplace. This represents an excellent business growth

opportunity for SNET and its investors and is consistent

with our overall business strategy of investing in key

growth areas of telecommunications including wireless, long

distance and the information superhighway we are building in

Connecticut called I-SNET."

SNET Mobility currently serves an area consisting of

over 3.2 million POPs. This area includes the metropolitan

areas of Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven and New London,

Connecticut and Springfield, Massachusetts as well as the

rural service areas of Windham and Litchfield, Connecticut

and Franklin, Massachusetts.

Closing of this transaction is subject to the

consummation by Bell Atlantic and NYNEX of their cellular

joint venture, the formation of which requires their sale of

these properties. It is also subject to approval by the

Federal Communications Commission and the US Department of

Justice. In addition, the acquisition of the Pittsfield

property is subject to a right of first refusal by a third

party.
