This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities (as

Outstanding Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of
all the Securities of such series, to waive, with respect to the
Securities of such series, compliance by the Company with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the
Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by
the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent
or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of
the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and
rates, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, this Note is transferable on the

registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in
The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written

transferee or transferees.

in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As

therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate
principal amount of Notes of any authorized denominations and of
like tenor, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in
connection therewith.

<PAGE> 4

* Represents the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle relating to the adoption of SFAS 109 ("Accounting for Income
Taxes") in the first quarter of 1993.

** For the six months ended June 30, 1993 and the years ended December 31, 1990 and 1989, earnings did not cover fixed charges by
$161 million, $91 million and $449 million, respectively, primarily as a result of large additions 
to the Reserve for Possible Credit Losses and special charges. 

For purposes of computing the consolidated ratios, earnings represent net income (loss) plus applicable income taxes and fixed 
charges, less cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (for the first six months of 1993 and the year ended 
December 31, 1993) and equity in undistributed earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries and associated companies.
Fixed charges represent interest expense (exclusive of interest on deposits in one case and inclusive of such interest 
in the other), amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and one-third (the amount deemed to represent an interest factor) 
of net rental expense under all lease commitments.
