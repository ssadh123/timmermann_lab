FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- ---------------------

THE CIT GROUP REPORTS RECORD EARNINGS IN 1994 FIRST QUARTER
-----------------------------------------------------------

OF $48.0 MILLION;
----------------

10.3 PERCENT INCREASE OVER 1993 FIRST QUARTER
---------------------------------------------

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, APRIL 12, 1994 --- The CIT Group Holdings,
Inc., one of the nation's leading asset-based finance companies, today
reported record net income of $48.0 million for the first quarter
ended March 31, 1994, an increase of 10.3 percent from the
$43.5 million reported for the first quarter of 1993. The rise in
earnings was principally due to improved net interest and other
revenue, reflecting the excellent finance receivables growth over the
past year.

"CIT's improved performance and growth is a reflection of the overall
improvement in the U.S. economy," said Albert R. Gamper, Jr., CIT
president and CEO. "This improvement looks very sustainable for 1994
unless the recent rise in interest rates discourages business and
consumer spending," he added.

<PAGE>

During the first quarter, CIT completed the acquisition of Barclays
Commercial Corporation, a major provider of factoring, commercial
finance and credit-related services, from the Barclays Group. The
acquisition added over $700.0 million in finance receivables and
affirms CIT's leadership position in the factoring industry.

OTHER HIGHLIGHTS:
- - Financing and leasing assets totaled $14.3 billion, up 7.1 
percent from $13.4 billion at December 31, 1993 and 13.5
percent from $12.6 billion at March 31, 1993. The increase
from year-end reflects continued growth from new business
financings in most operating units, the acquisition of Barclays
Commercial Corporation and a seasonal increase in factored
receivables.
- - Net interest revenue rose to $175.1 million in the first 
quarter of 1994, up 7.4 percent from $163.0 million in the
first quarter of 1993, reflecting earnings on the higher level
of financing and leasing assets, offset in part by reduced
interest rate margins as rates charged on earning assets
increased more slowly than rates paid on the related
liabilities.
- - Gains on asset sales were $7.6 million, up sharply from $1.3 
million in the first quarter of 1993 and included a gain from
securitizing $150 million of recreation vehicle receivables in
January 1994.
- - Operating expenses before the provision for credit losses 

<PAGE>

totaled $80.5 million, 2.47 percent of average financing and
leasing assets, versus $67.7 million, 2.29 percent of average
financing and leasing assets in the first quarter of 1993. The
increases are primarily attributable to several factors,
including the recently completed Barclays acquisition,
continued expansion of the Consumer Finance operation, and
certain non-recurring charges associated with restructuring the
Sales Financing sales office network.
- - Net charge-offs for the first quarter of 1994 were $25.8
million, 0.80 percent of average finance receivables, compared
to $22.4 million, 0.75 percent of average finance receivables
for the first quarter of 1993.
- - Finance receivables past due 60 days or more fell to $198.2 
million (1.46 percent of finance receivables) at March 31,
1994, down from $216.1 million (1.71 percent of finance
receivables) at December 31, 1993. Past due receivables on
nonaccrual status declined to $105.6 million (0.78 percent of
finance receivables) at March 31, 1994 from $139.9 million
(1.11 percent of finance receivables) at year-end 1993.
- - Assets received in the settlement of loans were $79.5 million 
at March 31, 1994, compared to $87.0 million at December 31,
1993.

The CIT Group Holdings, Inc., one of the nation's largest
asset-based lenders, is owned 60 percent by The Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank Limited, the largest bank in the world, and 40 percent by
Chemical Banking Corporation, one of the largest bank holding
companies in the United States.
