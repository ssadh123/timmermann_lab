FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- ---------------------

THE CIT GROUP REPORTS RECORD EARNINGS OF $52.6 MILLION IN 1994 THIRD QUARTER;
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

UP 10.8 PERCENT OVER 1993 THIRD QUARTER;
----------------------------------------

NINE MONTH EARNINGS UP 10.2 PERCENT TO A RECORD $151.6 MILLION
--------------------------------------------------------------

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, OCTOBER 13, 1994 --- The CIT Group Holdings, Inc.,
one of the nation's leading asset-based finance companies, today reported
record net income of $52.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1994,
an increase of 10.8 percent from $47.4 million reported for the third quarter
of 1993. Net income for the first nine months of 1994 was a record $151.6
million, a 10.2 percent increase over $137.6 million reported in the prior
year. The record 1994 earnings gains reflect improved interest income from
continued growth in financing and leasing assets, increased factoring
commissions, and lower charge-offs as a result of improved credit quality. 
The 1994 earnings reflect the acquisition of Barclays Commercial Corporation
(BCC) on February 28, 1994 which added over $700.0 million of factored
receivables.

"CIT's strong third quarter and nine months performance continues the
trend of disciplined growth and excellent portfolio credit quality which
prompted the recent upgrades in our senior debt ratings to AA- by Duff &
Phelps and Aa3 by Moody's ," said Albert R. Gamper, Jr., CIT president and
CEO.

OTHER HIGHLIGHTS:

- Financing and leasing assets totaled $15.2 billion, up 4.4 percent
from $14.5 billion at June 30, 1994 and 13.3 percent from $13.4
billion at December 31, 1993. The increases resulted from
continued growth in middle market financing, home equity lending,
traditional commercial finance, and a seasonal increase in factored
receivables.

- Net interest and fees rose to $181.5 million in the third quarter
of 1994, up 2.6 percent from $176.9 million in the third quarter of
1993. For the first nine months of 1994, net interest and fees
totaled $549.8 million, an increase of 8.2 percent from $508.4
million in 1993. The improvements reflect interest from the higher
levels of financing and leasing assets and increased factoring
commissions, offset in part by higher funding costs due to rising
1994 market interest rates.

- Operating expenses before the provision for credit losses totaled
$85.2 million, 2.48 percent of average financing and leasing assets
(AEA) in the third quarter of 1994, versus $73.0 million, 2.37
percent of AEA in the third quarter of 1993. For the nine months
ended September 30, 1994, operating expenses before the provision
for credit losses totaled $252.2 million, 2.51 percent of AEA,
compared with $209.5 million, 2.30 percent of AEA, in the
comparable 1993 period. Operating expenses in 1994 reflect
incremental expenses associated with the BCC acquisition and the
expanded Consumer Finance operation, and normal expense increases.

- Net charge-offs for the third quarter of 1994 were $18.2 million,
0.52 percent of average finance receivables (AFR), compared with
$27.2 million, 0.88 percent for the third quarter of 1993. For the
nine months ended September 30, 1994, net charge-offs totaled $67.1
million, 0.66 percent of AFR compared with $71.8 million, 0.79
percent in 1993.

- The 1993 third quarter and nine month results include a $10.3
million net charge to record the effect of a one percent increase
in the corporate Federal income tax rate enacted in August 1993.

- Finance receivables past due 60 days or more were $214.5 million
(1.49 percent of finance receivables) at September 30, 1994
compared with $187.8 million (1.36 percent of finance receivables)
at June 30, 1994 and $216.1 million (1.71 percent of finance
receivables) at December 31, 1993. Past due receivables on
nonaccrual status were $128.7 million (0.90 percent of finance
receivables) at September 30, 1994 up from $117.0 million (0.85
percent of finance receivables) at June 30, 1994, but improved from
$139.9 million (1.11 percent of finance receivables) at year-end
1993.

- Assets received in the settlement of loans were $60.4 million at
September 30, 1994, compared to $67.6 million at June 30, 1994 and
$87.0 million at December 31, 1993.
