FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CHIQUITA EXPECTS UNUSUAL CHARGES AND NON-RECURRING 

LOSSES FOR THIRD QUARTER

CINCINNATI, OHIO, October 10, 1994 -- Chiquita Brands
International, Inc. announced today that its results for the
quarter ended September 30, 1994 will include unusual charges and
non-recurring losses totaling approximately $50 million ($1.00 per
share). Aside from these items, Chiquita expects to report a loss
for the third quarter during this seasonally low period for
worldwide banana pricing.

The unusual charges and non-recurring losses primarily result
from:

. the shutdown of over 1,200 hectares of low productivity
Honduran banana farms following an unusually severe strike
and, at its remaining Honduran farms, the chopback of
cultivations weakened during the strike. The Company
undertook these extraordinary measures to optimize the future
economic yield and quality of its Honduran banana production. 
Chiquita expects to recommence banana exports from its
Honduran farms around year-end.

. the substantial reduction of the Company's Japanese "green"
banana trading operations. Poor local market conditions, and
the desire to eliminate related losses, contributed to the
Company's decision to significantly scale back this portion of
its business. 

Chiquita indicated that it will remain active in the Japanese
banana market primarily through its existing banana ripening
operations and value-added distribution network.

Final results for the third quarter are expected to be reported on
or about November 1, 1994.

Chiquita is a leading international marketer, processor and
producer of quality fresh and prepared food products.
