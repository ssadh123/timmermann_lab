Item 5. Other Events

On June 30, 1994, Yellow Corporation (the company) announced
that the union associates of its Preston Trucking Company
subsidiary had approved a plan that would reduce wages in return
for a share of profits if certain operating results are achieved.
The associates, members of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, voted to approve a wage reduction program that would
lessen pay by seven percent in 1994, five percent in 1995 and
return to standard contract wages in 1996. This plan replaced a
one year, nine percent wage reduction approved in March 1993,
shortly after Preston Trucking was acquired by the company.

The company indicated that the temporary reduction in wages
was necessary to help complete a financial turnaround of Preston
Trucking. The vote on the wage reduction provides Preston
Trucking with additional time to implement permanent changes and
complete the turnaround.

Preston Corporation, including Preston Trucking Company,
Saia Motor Freight Line and Smalley Transportation Company, was
purchased by Yellow Corporation in February 1993. Preston
Trucking is a Maryland-based regional less-than-truckload carrier
serving the Northeast and Central states regions. They had
operating revenue of $397 million in 1993.
