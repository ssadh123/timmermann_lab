LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Due to BANC ONE's recent 10 percent stock
dividend declaration, the following table sets forth the
adjustments in the exchange ratio of BANC ONE shares for Liberty
National Bancorp shares and the adjusted pro forma for cash
dividends per Liberty share.

On January 25, 1994, BANC ONE's Board of Directors announced
a 10 percent stock dividend payable on March 4, 1994, to BANC ONE
shareholders of record as of February 16, 1994. A cash dividend of
31 cents per BANC ONE share will be paid March 31, 1994, to BANC
ONE shareholders of record on March 15, 1994. This cash dividend,
which will be paid on the new shares as a result of the stock
dividend, represents an effective increase in BANC ONE's indicated
cash dividend rate of 10 percent.

Over the last 10 years BANC ONE's cash dividend has been
increased on 15 occasions and has grown at an annual compound rate
in excess of 14 percent. Since the first quarter of 1993,
dividends have been increased by 21.8 percent. 

Liberty is a regional bank holding company headquartered in
Louisville, Kentucky. In November 1993, Liberty announced its plan
to join BANC ONE CORPORATION, a regional bank holding company based
in Columbus, Ohio. Pending shareholder and regulatory approval,
the merger is expected to be completed in mid-1994.

Liberty conducts a wide range of commercial and personal
banking activities through its 103 banking offices located
throughout Kentucky and southern Indiana. In addition, Liberty
provides leasing, credit life insurance, brokerage services and
retail loan services through various non-banking subsidiaries.
