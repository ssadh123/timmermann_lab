Item 5. Other Events.

Extended Registration Statement

Certain holders of Ashland Coal common stock acquired in
connection with the 1992 acquisition by Ashland Coal of Dal-Tex
Coal Corporation have elected to take advantage of the Company's 
offer to maintain for an additional year the effectiveness of the
shelf registration statement, as amended, currently registering
such holders' shares for public offering. In addition, at the
request of certain of the selling shareholders named in the
registration statement, Ashland Coal has agreed to indemnify such
selling shareholders and certain brokers, dealers and agents
acting on their behalf against certain liabilities under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Ashland Coal's obligation to
maintain the current registration would have expired on the
earlier of the date all registered shares were sold or May 10,
1994. Instead, it is now anticipated that a post-effective
amendment to the current registration statement reflecting the
extension will be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission after May 10, 1994, and that Ashland Coal will
maintain the effectiveness of the amended registration statement
for a one year period commencing on the date the Commission
declares the amended registration statement effective.
