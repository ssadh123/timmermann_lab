AST LOWERS FIRST QUARTER REVENUE ESTIMATE,
PROJECTS NET LOSS RANGE

COMPANY TO CLOSE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING FACILITY

IRVINE, Calif., Oct. 14, 1994 -- AST Research Inc. (ASTA-NASDAQ) today announced
that it expects first quarter fiscal year 1995 revenues to be lower than earlier
anticipated. The company first described manufacturing issues such as component
constraints and product development delays in a press release on Aug. 31. These
issues continued into September, along with additional deeper than anticipated
price reductions to maintain product flow amidst severe industry price cutting,
which severely impacted the company's first quarter gross margins and may also
impact the company's second quarter performance.
AST anticipates fiscal first quarter revenue to be approximately $495
million. A net loss for the quarter of $39 to $40 million is also expected,
which will result in a net loss per share of between $1.20 and $1.25. The
company has received a waiver on its $300 million committed bank revolving
credit agreement, which covers potential defaults due to its first quarter loss.
AST plans to release its first quarter financial results on
Oct. 27, 1994.
AST also announced today that it will be consolidating its mobile computing
manufacturing and closing its Fountain Valley, Calif. manufacturing facility
Feb. 1, 1995.
The closing of AST's Fountain Valley facility will impact approximately 440
employees who perform manufacturing-related functions for the company's mobile
computers and multiprocessor servers. The company will immediately eliminate
approximately 100 positions at Fountain Valley as well as additional positions

companywide over the next few weeks. The actions result in a combined workforce
reduction of approximately 10 percent of AST's global workforce of 6,900.
"We must take aggressive actions and redefine our business model to remain
competitive in the market," stated Jim Schraith, AST president and chief
operating officer. "We will make changes in the organization and management
structure to reduce costs, and improve product development processes, quality
and product availability.
"Moving forward, AST will refocus on four core areas: customers, products,
distribution channels and geographic regions. We will maximize our resources
toward mainstream products and markets; deliver a competitive set of products
and services; optimize our use of the indirect distribution channel; and
concentrate on established, rapidly growing geographic regions. Details of
these plans will be rolled out over the next several weeks."
RE-BALANCING GLOBAL OPERATIONS
In light of the competitive environment and AST's current operating
conditions, AST analyzed its worldwide manufacturing operations and found that
it could improve its operating efficiency by consolidating mobile computer
manufacturing in Taiwan. AST has a subsidiary in Taiwan, which currently serves
as an AST mobile computer manufacturing center. Mobile computer distribution
for the Americas will be centralized in the company's Fort Worth, Texas
manufacturing center. AST's full range of desktops and servers are also
manufactured and distributed in Fort Worth.
EMPLOYEE TRANSITION PROGRAMS
AST has a comprehensive employee transition program established for
impacted employees. The program includes:
Salary continuance -- Impacted employees will be given salary continuance in
accordance with company policy.
Job Assistance Center -- AST offers a Job Assistance Center at its Fountain
Valley site that offers employees assistance in interviewing skills, resume
writing and job training.
Outplacement Task Team -- An Outplacement Task Team is networking with other
area companies to help place affected employees and offer external
outplacement services to help employees find new jobs.

the salary continuance period and then are available under the federal COBRA
program.
"We have always been proud of our California manufacturing operations,"
commented Safi Qureshey, AST co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer.
"Market dynamics forced us to make this difficult decision to position AST for
long-term success."
