ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OF ASSETS
---------------------

On March 31, 1994, The J. M. Smucker Company ("Smucker") acquired certain
assets and assumed certain liabilities of the frozen pie business of
Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Kellogg
Company. Smucker acquired the Pottstown, Pennsylvania facility, which
includes a production plant, equipment, warehouse storage, and office
buildings. In addition, Smucker also received title to all raw material
and finished goods inventories, outstanding contracts, prepaid assets and
other intangible assets used in the frozen pie business. Smucker will
account for this acquisition under the purchase method.

At the closing date, Smucker paid an initial price of $80.1 million
for the assets of the Mrs. Smith's pie business, in accordance with the
purchase agreement dated March 1, 1994. This initial price is subject to
subsequent adjustment based upon, among other things, the value of the net
assets of the frozen pie business at March 31, 1994.

In order to provide long term financing for this transaction and to provide
funds for seasonal purchases of fruit during the coming months, Smucker
will enter into a $125.0 million revolving credit agreement with Society
National Bank, National City Bank, and First National Bank of Chicago. The
Company provided the funds for the initial price at closing by borrowing
$56 million under an existing line of credit with Society National Bank and
by using $24.1 million in cash from internally generated funds.

Smucker intends to continue the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution
of frozen pies.

Timothy P. Smucker, Chairman and a director of Smucker, also is a director
of Kellogg Company. Russell G. Mawby also is a director of both Smucker
and Kellogg Company.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
---------------------------------

(a & b)

Historically, the frozen pie business was consolidated into the overall
financial results of Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co. As a result, no
separate financial statements were prepared for the pie business.
Therefore, it is impractical at this time to provide the required financial
information. The Company will file an amendment to this Report containing
audited financial statements and proforma information as soon as practical,
but no later than sixty days following the date of this Report.

Buyer and its representatives shall have the right, at Buyer's

to furnish them with all such information as they may reasonably require in

Should Buyer and Seller disagree as to the proper accounting
treatment of any item or disagree as to any matter relating to the Statement of
Net Assets, then the matter shall be submitted to Arthur Andersen & Co. whose
decision shall be final.
If the amount of assets less liabilities as shown on the
Statement of Net Assets (the "CLOSING NET ASSETS") is less than the amount of
assets less liabilities as shown on the Reference Balance Sheet minus $100,000
(the "MINIMUM NET ASSETS"), Seller shall pay the difference between the Minimum
Net Assets and the Closing Net Assets to Buyer within ten (10) business days of
completion of the Statement of Net Assets. If the Closing Net Assets is
greater than the amount of assets less liabilities as shown on the Reference
Balance Sheet plus $100,000 (the "MAXIMUM NET ASSETS"), Buyer shall pay the
difference between the Closing Net Assets and the Maximum Net Assets to Seller
within ten (10) business days of completion of the Statement of Net Assets.

the Closing, and except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or

Employees will be employed by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer on and after the
Closing Date for a period of not less than one (1) year on substantially the
same terms (including salary, fringe benefits, job responsibility and location)
as those provided by Buyer to its similarly situated employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.4.
Buyer agrees (i) to recognize, or to cause each of its applicable Affiliates to
recognize, the unions which are parties to the collective bargaining agreements
noted in SCHEDULE 5.4 as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agents,
as of the Closing Date and immediately thereafter, for the Frozen Pie Employees
represented by such unions as of the Closing Date who will continue employment

SCHEDULE 5.4, or that Buyer or any other Affiliate of Buyer will be the
successor employer under such collective bargaining agreements, and (iii) that
it will cause the Frozen Pie Business and each applicable Affiliate of Buyer to
comply with its respective obligations under such collective bargaining
agreements. Buyer shall not, at any time prior to sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are
defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988
("WARN") affecting in whole or in part any facility, site of employment,
operating unit or employee of the Frozen Pie Business without complying fully
with the requirements of WARN.

#20060353.14 18
<PAGE> 23

Employees and Assumed Union Employees.
(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Scheduled Employees
shall cease accruing benefits under the Kellogg Company Salaried Pension Plan
(the "SALARIED PENSION PLAN"). Seller shall continue to be responsible on and
after the Closing Date for all benefits accrued for Employees under the
Salaried Pension Plan as of the Closing Date. All Scheduled Employees shall be
fully vested in their accrued benefits under the Salaried Pension Plan as of
the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date and effective
as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause its The J.M. Smucker Company
Employees' Retirement Plan (the "BUYER PENSION PLAN") to cover the Scheduled
Employees who were covered by the Salaried Pension Plan immediately prior to
the Closing Date on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to Buyer's
salaried employees under the Buyer Pension Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall cause the Buyer Pension Plan to count for purposes
of eligibility and vesting all service of the Scheduled Employees that was
counted for such purposes under the Salaried Pension Plan.
(c) (i) With respect to each multi-employer plan
identified on SCHEDULE 3.12 as one to which Seller is obliged to contribute,
Buyer shall be obligated to contribute to each such multi-employer plan for
substantially the same number of contribution base units for which Seller had
an obligation to contribute thereto.
(ii) Subject to subsection (iii) hereof, Buyer will provide
to each multi-employer plan referred to in the collective bargaining agreements
listed on SCHEDULE 5.4 for a

#20060353.14 19
<PAGE> 24
period of five (5) plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning
after the Closing Date, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an
acceptable surety for purposes of Section 412 of ERISA, or an amount held in
escrow by a bank or similar financial institution, satisfactory to such plan,
in an amount equal to 120% of the greater of
(A) the average annual contribution required to be
made by Seller with respect to the operations under such plan for the 
three (3) plan years preceding the plan year in which the Closing 
occurs, being $1,094,103 in the aggregate for such plan, or
(B) the annual contribution that Seller was required
to make with respect to the operations under such multi-employer plan
for the last plan year prior to the plan year in which the Closing
occurs, being $1,309,291 in the aggregate for such plan, which bond or
escrow shall be paid to such multi-employer plan if Buyer withdraws
from such plan, or fails to make a contribution when due, at any time
during the first five (5) plan years beginning after the Closing
occurs.
(iii) In lieu of providing the bond contemplated by
subsection (b) hereof, Buyer may obtain a waiver or variance of the requirement
under ERISA that it provide such bond.
(iv) If Buyer withdraws from any of such multi-employer plans
in a complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with respect to operations,
during the first five (5) plan years beginning after the Closing, Seller will
be secondarily liable to such plan and the PBGC for any withdrawal liability
Seller would have had to any such plan with respect to the operations (but for
Section 4204 of ERISA) if the liability of Buyer with respect to such plan is
not paid.
(d) Effective as of the Closing Date, all Scheduled
Employees shall be fully vested in their accrued benefits under the Kellogg
Company Salaried Savings and Investment Plan (the "SAVINGS PLAN") and Seller
shall cease to make contributions under the Savings Plan on behalf of such
Scheduled Employees. The Scheduled Employees shall be entitled to receive a

#20060353.14 20
<PAGE> 25
distribution of their benefits under the Savings Plan on and after the Closing
Date in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the Savings Plan.
As soon as practicable after the Closing Date and effective as
of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause its The J.M. Smucker Company Employee
Savings Plan (the "BUYER SAVINGS PLAN") to cover the Scheduled Employees who
were covered by the Savings Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date on the
same terms and conditions as such Plan is made available to Buyer's salaried
employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause the Buyer
Savings Plan to count for purposes of eligibility and vesting all service of
the Scheduled Employees that was counted for such purposes under the Savings
Plan. Buyer shall also cause the Buyer Savings Plan to accept, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, rollover contributions by the Scheduled Employees
of amounts distributed to such employees from the Savings Plan.
(e) Buyer shall provide the Assumed Employees and their
covered dependents with life insurance, medical benefits, disability benefits
and other employee welfare benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements
that are the same as or comparable to the benefits, plans, programs, policies
and arrangements that Buyer provides or makes available to its similarly
situated employees (the "BUYER WELFARE PLANS"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
benefits, plans, programs, policies and arrangements to be provided by Buyer,
in the case of Scheduled Employees to whom a collective bargaining agreement is
applicable, shall conform with the benefits, plans, programs, policies and
arrangements required to be provided under such agreement. Buyer shall cause
the Buyer Welfare Plans to count for purposes of eligibility and benefits under
such plans all service of the Assumed Employees that was counted for such
purposes under Seller's welfare plans and arrangements. In addition, Buyer
shall cause the Buyer Welfare Plans to grant credit to the Assumed Employees
and their covered dependents for payments made by such individuals toward
out-of-pocket maximums and deductibles for the

#20060353.14 21
<PAGE> 26
year in which the Closing Date occurs, and to waive any pre-existing condition
restrictions under the Buyer Welfare Plans with respect to such individuals.
Seller shall retain responsibility for Retiree Welfare
Benefits for all Retired Frozen Pie Employees. Seller shall also retain
responsibility for all salaried Frozen Pie Employees who are not Scheduled
Employees with regard to long-term disability, life, medical and pension
benefits.
With respect to Employees covered by welfare plans sponsored
or maintained by Seller, Seller shall retain responsibility for and continue to
pay all medical, dental, life insurance, disability, supplemental unemployment,
workers' compensation and other welfare plan expenses and benefits with respect
to claims incurred prior to the Closing Date. Expenses and benefits with
respect to claims incurred by any Assumed Employee or his or her covered
dependents on or after the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of Buyer.
For purposes of this paragraph, a medical, dental, workers' compensation or
similar claim is deemed incurred when the services that are the subject of the
claim are performed and any other claim is deemed incurred when the event
occurs which entitles the Employee or his or her dependents to benefits.
(f) Seller shall retain and be responsible for all
severance pay and benefit continuation relating to the termination of
employment of Employees prior to the Closing Date. If any Assumed Employee is
terminated by Buyer on or after the Closing Date and prior to the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to such employee
severance pay and benefit continuation in accordance with the terms of Mrs.
Smith's Frozen Foods Co. Severance Plan, as in effect on the date hereof, and
any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
(g) Buyer shall be responsible for vacation pay on and
after the Closing Date with respect to all periods of service (whether prior to
or after the Closing Date) of all Assumed Employees.

third-party beneficiary rights in any person or organization, including without
limitation employees or former employees (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of Seller or any of its Affiliates, unions or other
representatives of such employees or former employees, or trustees,
administrators, participants or beneficiaries of any employee benefit plan, and
no provision of this Section 5.4 shall create such third-party beneficiary
rights in any such person or organization in respect of any benefits that may
be provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plan or
arrangement, including the currently existing Plans of Seller.

will not, for a period of three (3) years thereafter, directly or indirectly,
solicit, encourage, entice or induce any Person who is an employee of Seller to
terminate his or her employment with Seller. Buyer agrees that money damages
will not be an adequate remedy and that Seller shall be entitled to equitable
relief, including but not limited to injunction, in the event of any breach by
Buyer of this Section 5.5, in addition to any other remedies available to
Seller at law.
5.6 BOOKS AND RECORDS. Buyer shall retain all books, records

from all signs, purchase orders, invoices, sales orders, letterheads, shipping 
documents and other materials used by it; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Buyer may 
utilize any packaging stock and labels held in inventory by the Frozen Pie

#20060353.14 24
<PAGE> 29
(b) Seller agrees that it shall, within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, remove "Mrs. Smith's" from its corporate name and
terminate its use thereof.
5.11 EMPLOYEE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Buyer acknowledges

confidentiality agreements with Seller. Buyer agrees that it will not induce
such employees to violate or breach the provisions of, nor will Buyer knowingly
obtain information in violation of, such confidentiality agreements.
5.12 COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES. In the event that, after the
Closing Date, Buyer receives any payment in respect of an account receivable
outstanding as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly remit such funds to
Seller and Buyer agrees that, until the forty-fifth day after the Closing Date,
all payments received by Buyer that are not identified, by reference to an
invoice number, as payments for a receivable arising after the Closing Date,

payment to Buyer if Seller is not owed any amount by the payor with respect to
accounts receivable arising on or prior to the Closing Date.
5.13 INSURANCE POLICIES. Seller agrees that, between the date
hereof and the Closing Date, Seller shall maintain in force all insurance
policies pertaining to the Frozen Pie Business in force on the date hereof or
insurance policies providing the same or substantially similar coverage.
5.14 ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT. (a) Buyer may at its own expense
conduct a phase 1 environmental audit of the Pottstown Facility. Seller shall
cooperate fully with Buyer during the audit and will provide Buyer access to
the facility during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice from
Buyer. Buyer will complete the audit and provide Seller with the phase 1 audit
report within fifteen (15) days of the date hereof.
(b) If during the audit Buyer finds specific evidence that
the facility or a portion of the facility may be contaminated with Hazardous
Substances, Buyer at its own

#20060353.14 25
<PAGE> 30
expense may conduct a phase 2 audit of the facility to delineate the extent of
the contamination. The phase 2 audit shall be limited to the area or areas in
which the phase 1 audit identified specific evidence of contamination. Buyer
shall complete its initial set of tests for contamination and shall provide
Seller with a report on those tests within forty-five (45) days from the date
hereof.
(c) If during the phase 1 or phase 2 environmental audits
Buyer determines that the Pottstown Facility or the Frozen Pie Business is not
in compliance with Environmental Laws, it shall so state in the appropriate
environmental audit report. If Buyer concludes that the cost of bringing the
facility or the business into compliance with law will not exceed $100,000, it
shall so state in the report and Buyer shall be responsible for such costs.
(d) If Buyer concludes that the cost of bringing the
Pottstown Facility or the Frozen Pie Business into compliance with any
Environmental Laws will exceed $100,000, it shall so state in the environmental
audit report and shall specify in the report the matters it believes are not in
compliance with such laws. Seller shall then take all steps necessary to
correct each of these violations. Buyer and Seller shall allocate the cost of
correcting each of the violations as follows:
(i) Buyer shall be responsible for the first $100,000 of
cost;

the costs between $100,000 and $1,000,000;

(iii) Seller shall be responsible for 85% of and Buyer
shall be responsible for 15% of the costs between
$1,000,000 and $3,000,000; and

(iv) Seller shall be responsible for all costs above
$3,000,0000. In the alternative, if Buyer notifies
Seller in an audit report that it has reasonable
grounds to believe that the costs of bringing the
facility into compliance with law will exceed
$3,000,000, or if Seller reasonably concludes that
the cost of bringing the facility into compliance
with law will exceed $3,000,000, Seller may terminate
this transaction (if the Closing shall not have
occurred).

(e) Seller in taking action to correct a violation of an
Environmental Law shall provide Buyer with notice of the action it plans to
take. Buyer may within three (3) days of

#20060353.14 26
<PAGE> 31
receipt of notice propose changes to the actions Seller plans to take. If
Seller and Buyer are then unable to agree on the action that Buyer should take,
each party shall direct its environmental engineers to meet and agree within

environmental engineer of national repute to resolve the dispute. Buyer and

appoint an environmental expert to resolve the dispute. If the parties are

report within fifteen (15) days of the date hereof.

exists at the Pottstown Facility any unsound, unsafe condition or conditions
which materially interfere with the use of the Pottstown Facility and the
operation of the Frozen Pie Business and specifies how such condition or
conditions are unsound, unsafe and materially interfere with the use of the
Pottstown Facility and the operation of the Frozen Pie Business, Seller shall
then take all steps

necessary, at its expense, to rectify such conditions; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
if Seller reasonably concludes that the cost of bringing the condition or
conditions into a state that does not materially interfere with the use of the

$3,000,000, Seller may terminate this transaction (if the Closing shall not
have occurred).
