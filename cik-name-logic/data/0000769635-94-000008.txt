Item 4. Changes In Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

Effective April 22, 1994, Registrant dismissed its prior
Independent Auditors, Deloitte & Touche ("Deloitte") and retained
as its new Independent Auditors, Imowitz Koenig & Company. 
Deloitte's Independent Auditors' Report on Registrant's financial
statements for fiscal years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992 did
not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and
were
not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles. The decision to change Independent
Auditors
was approved by the Managing General Partner's Directors. During
fiscal years ended 1992, 1993 and through April 22, 1994, there
were no disagreements between Registrant and Deloitte on any
matter
of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope of procedure which disagreements if
not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte, would have caused
it
to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in
connection with its reports.

Effective April 22, 1994, Registrant engaged Imowitz Koenig &
Company as its Independent Auditors. During the last two fiscal
years and the subsequent interim periods to the date hereof,
Registrant did not consult Imowitz Koenig & Company regarding any
of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii)
of Regulation S-K.

Item 7. Financial Statement and Exhibits.

(c) Exhibits:

10. (a) Letter dated April 27, 1994 from Registrant's Former
Independent Auditors.
