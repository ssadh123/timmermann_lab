NEWS RELEASE

(818) 683-4040,, ext. 711

Pasadena, Calif. - Ameron, Inc. (NYSE) announced today that the
U.S. District Court for Arizona has dismissed a $146.7 million
lawsuit filed in 1992 against Ameron and two other companies by the
Central Arizona Water Conservation District in connection with six
siphon pipelines installed as part of the Central Arizona Project
from 1975 to 1980.

Ameron manufactured large-diameter prestressed concrete pipe for
the siphons, which provide water from the Colorado River for
municipal, industrial and agricultural use in the region from Lake
Havasu to the Mexican border, including the metropolitan areas of
Phoenix and Tucson. The legal action was filed after corrosion was
discovered in some pipe sections.

In a 31 page opinion, District Judge Robert C. Broomfield ordered
the lawsuit terminated and judgment entered in favor of Ameron and
its co-defendants. James S. Marlen, president and chief executive
officer of Ameron, called the judgment "very positive news for
Ameron and its shareholders."
