Item 5. Other Events.

The Board of Directors of Sears Roebuck Acceptance Corp. ("SRAC")
declared a $1.7 billion dividend on December 20, 1993 to its sole
stockholder, Sears, Roebuck and Co. ("Sears"), payable on
December 30, 1993. The Board also approved payment to Sears on
December 30, 1993 of $330 million out of Capital in Excess of Par
Value; such payment is characterized as a dividend under the
Delaware General Corporation Law. Payments for these
transactions were effected by reducing SRAC's investment in the
Notes of Sears by $2.0 billion.

This reduction of the Capital Base was made possible by a
decrease in the funding requirements of Sears, as a portion of
the proceeds from the strategic repositioning of Sears was used
to reduce SRAC's commercial paper. Sears strategic repositioning
was completed in November 1993 with the sale of its Sears
Mortgage Banking Operations.

The impact of the above mentioned activity on the financial
position of SRAC is shown in the following table:

12/31/93 9/30/93 12/31/92*
(billions) UNAUDITED
Assets $4.2 $6.2 $12.4
Debt 3.1 3.0 9.3
Equity 1.1 3.2 3.1
D/E Ratio 2.82:1 .94:1 3.00:1

On December 20, 1993 the Board of SRAC approved the sale by SRAC
to Sears of $848 million the net book value of the Retail
Customer Receivable Balances ("RCRB") owned by SRAC. The RCRB
were sold to Sears on December 30, 1993.

*The 12/31/92 figures were taken from the audited financial 
statements at that date.
