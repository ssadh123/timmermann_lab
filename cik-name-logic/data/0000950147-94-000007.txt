AMERICA WEST AIRLINES
FILES MOTION TO PRESERVE TAX ASSETS OF THE ESTATE

PHOENIX, AZ (FEB. 10) (NASDAQ:AWAQC; PSE: AWA) -- America West
Airlines has filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to prohibit the
sale or other transfers or any general unsecured claims, debentures or
shares of any class of stock of America West, to attempt to preserve the
estate's tax assets. Such transfers in sufficient numbers and amounts
could, under current tax law, jeopardize the preservation of the airline's
net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards, the value of which
after reorganization could approximate $400 million.

"Transfers of claims have become a significant concern based on
recent trading activity in America West stock and approaches to holders of
our general unsecured claims, for purchase of those claims," said W.A.
Franke, chairman and chief executive officer of America West. "It is
imperative that as part of protecting the Company's value for potential
investors upon reorganization we attempt to preserve these sizeable tax
benefits in the form of net operating loss and business tax credit
carryforwards," he added.

Franke said that significant changes in stock ownership or major
shifts in ownership among the Company's creditors could, under current tax
law, materially impair the value of the past net operating losses to offset
the tax liability of the newly reorganized company.
