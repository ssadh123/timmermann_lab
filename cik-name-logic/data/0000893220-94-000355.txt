FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

RITE AID ANNOUNCES AGREEMENTS TO SELL TWO SUSIDIARIES

Camp Hill , PA (August 3, 1994) - Rite Aid Corporation (RAD-NYSE,
PSE), today announced that it entered into definitive contracts for the sale
of ADAP, Inc. and Sera-Tec Biologicals. These dispositions are part of the
restructuring strategy announced on January 7, aimed at focusing resources
entirely on drugstore related businesses.

The stock of ADAP, a chain of 96 auto parts stores, is being sold in a cash
transaction for $75 million that is scheduled to close in October.

Sera-Tec Biologicals, which provides plasma for use in therapeutic and
diagnostic products, is being sold for $70 million in a cash transaction that
is expected to close at the end of September.

The businesses were purchased by various investors including Alex Grass,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Rite Aid. As previously announced,
Mr. Grass is relinquishing the title of Chief Executive Officer on March 4,
1995, the end of the current fiscal year.

The businesses were sold based on a competitive bid process conducted by
Donaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette and a special committee of outside Rite Aid
directors.

Proceeds, estimated to be $130 million after income taxes and expenses, will
be used to reduce corporate debt, fund the current share repurchase program
and for general working capital needs.
