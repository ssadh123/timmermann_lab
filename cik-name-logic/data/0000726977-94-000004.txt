Item 5. Other Events

Effective June 24, 1994, the Registrant entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
with Abaco Casa de Bolsa, S.A. de C.V., Abaco Grupo Financiero ("Abaco"), the
Registrant's controlling stockholder, under which the Registrant issued 150
shares of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, $.09 par value
per share (the "Preferred Stock"), to Abaco in a private placement. Abaco
purchased the Preferred Stock at a price of $100,000 per share for an
aggregate purchase price of $15,000,000. Under the terms of the Stock
Purchase Agreement, each outstanding share of the Preferred Stock will be
converted automatically into shares of Common Stock of the Registrant upon 
approval of the conversion by the stockholders of the Registrant. The 
Registrant intends to hold a special meeting of its stockholders on November 17,
1994, at which it will present a proposal to the stockholders to approve the
conversion.

The Registrant and Abaco agreed in a letter agreement executed simultaneously
with the Stock Purchase Agreement that the conversion ratio for the Preferred
Stock would be based upon a conversion price to be fixed by the Board of 
Directors of the Registrant following receipt of an analysis of the fair
market value of the Common Stock to be prepared by a recognized public 
accounting firm. On August 31, 1994, the Board of Directors of the Registrant
fixed the conversion price at $7.25 per share of Common Stock. Therefore, upon 
stockholder approval of the conversion, the 150 shares of Preferred Stock held
by Abaco will automatically convert into 2,068,965 shares of Common Stock of
the Registrant
