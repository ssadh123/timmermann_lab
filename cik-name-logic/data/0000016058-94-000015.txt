As previously reported in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ending September 30, 1994, the Company reached agreement on the terms
of settlement for two pending shareholder suits against the Company and
certain of its directors entitled CHRYSOGELOS v. LONDON, et al., and PFIRMAN
v. LONDON, et al. By orders dated November 15, 1994, and December 1, 1994,
respectively, the Delaware Chancery Court and the Federal District Court for
the District of Columbia decreed that all issues of the litigations have been
resolved by the settlement, and ordered that the cases be dismissed on the
merits with prejudice.

Under the terms of the final settlement, the Company agreed to: (1) amend its
By-laws to change the size of its Board of Directors from seven (7) to a
number between five (5) and nine (9) as a majority of the Board plus one may
set (accomplished December, 1993); (2) elect six mutually-acceptable
candidates to the Board (accomplished December, 1993); (3) establish a fund
of up to $600,000 available on a claims-made basis to pay a portion of any
loss as defined by the settlement documents suffered by those who sold Common
Stock between April 26, 1990 and December 1, 1990; (4) undertake a self-
tender for 1.3 million shares at $6.00 per share if the average closing price
of the Company's stock is below $6.00 per share for twenty consecutive
trading days before February 28, 1995; and (5) reimburse the plaintiffs for
their reasonable legal fees and expenses up to a total of $598,000.

CACI International Inc Announces Court Approval of
Settlement of Shareholder Suits Filed in Early 1991

Arlington, VA - CACI International Inc (NASDAQ: CACI) announced today that
both the Delaware Chancery Court and the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia have accepted the proposed settlement of two shareholder
lawsuits originally filed in Delaware and the District of Columbia in early
1991 on the terms previously announced.

By orders dated November 15, 1994 and December 1, 1994, respectively, the

final settlement of these matters. While the settlement does not acknowledge
any wrongdoing on the part of the Board of Directors on any aspect of the
suits, the Board believes that the settlement will allow the Company to
concentrate its efforts on building the Company going forward."
