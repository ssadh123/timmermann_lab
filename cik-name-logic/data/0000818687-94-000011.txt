AT&T
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)
(Unaudited)

(a) ACCOUNTING POLICIES - The consolidated financial statements
have been prepared by AT&T Corp. ("AT&T" or the "Company")
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") and, in the opinion of management,
include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the
consolidated results of operations, financial position and
cash flows for each period presented. The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of foreign entities
based on their fiscal years, which end either November 30 or
December 31. The consolidated results for interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with AT&T's
1993 Annual Report to Shareowners and Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 1993. 

(b) RESTATEMENTS AND RECLASSIFICATIONS - Previously reported
quarterly results for 1993 were restated to reflect the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." In addition, the provisions for business
restructuring have been reclassified to costs and operating
expenses.

(c) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES - Effective January 1, 1993,
AT&T adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." This standard
requires companies to accrue for estimated future
postretirement benefit expenses during the years employees are
working and earning benefits for retirement. Previously,
AT&T expensed these benefits as claims were incurred. AT&T
recorded an after-tax charge of $7,023 ($5.21 per share) to
record the unprovided portion of these liabilities as the
cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter
of 1993. This accounting change does not affect cash flows.

Effective January 1, 1993, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 112. This
standard requires companies to accrue for estimated future
postemployment benefits during the years employees are working
and accumulating these benefits. Before this change in
accounting method, AT&T recognized the separation costs as
they were identified and disability benefits when paid. AT&T
recorded an after-tax charge of $1,128 ($.83 per share) to
record the unprovided portion of these liabilities as the
cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter
of 1993. This accounting change does not affect cash flows.<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)
(Unaudited)

Also effective January 1, 1993, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." Among other provisions, this
standard requires tax assets and liabilities to be determined
using the enacted income tax rates for the years in which
taxes will be paid or refunds received. Prior to 1993, AT&T's
deferred tax accounts reflected the statutory rates that were
in effect when the deferrals were initiated. The adoption of
SFAS No. 109 resulted in a net income benefit of $383, or $.28
per share. This benefit was recorded as the cumulative effect
of an accounting change in the first quarter of 1993. This
accounting change does not affect cash flows.

Effective January 1, 1994, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities". The standard provides for the accounting and
reporting for investments in equity securities that have
readily determinable fair values and for all investments in
debt securities. The new standard did not have a material
impact on AT&T's results of operations or financial position. 

(d) INVENTORIES - Inventories at March 31, 1994 and December 31,
1993 were as follows: 

March 31, December 31,
1994 1993

Completed goods .............. $2,343 $1,893
Work-in-process and raw
materials ................. 1,514 1,294
Total inventories ............ $3,857 $3,187

(e) LONG-TERM DEBT REDEMPTION - In March 1993, AT&T issued
redemption notices for debentures and notes with an aggregate
outstanding balance of $1,750 at March 31, 1993. Expenses
associated with these redemptions of $83 ($52 or $.04 per
share after taxes) were included in interest expense for the
three months ended March 31, 1993.

(f) STATUS OF PROSPECTIVE MERGER WITH McCAW CELLULAR
COMMUNICATIONS, INC. ("McCaw")- On April 5, 1994 the U.S.
District Court, acting on a motion filed by BellSouth
Corporation on December 2, 1993, ruled that AT&T's
acquisition, under the proposed merger, of the interests owned
by McCaw in certain cellular properties controlled by regional
Bell operating companies would violate the antitrust consent
decree entered into by AT&T in 1982 (the "Decree"). The court
determined that AT&T must seek a waiver of the Decree to
proceed with the merger, and that the record before the court
was insufficient to support a waiver previously requested by
AT&T. Accordingly, the court declined to grant such a waiver
without prejudice to a renewed request by AT&T, and noted that
its ruling does not absolutely foreclose the waiver. Rather,
the court held that AT&T must satisfy the legal standard for a
Decree modification. The proposed merger is also subject to
the approval of the Federal Communications Commission and
expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act ("HSR"). There can be no assurance
as to whether the foregoing approvals or waiver will be
granted, or if granted, when that will occur.

(g) AT&T CREDIT HOLDINGS, INC. - In connection with a March 31,
1993 legal restructuring of AT&T Capital Holdings, Inc.
(formerly AT&T Capital Corporation), AT&T issued a direct,
full and unconditional guarantee of all the outstanding public
debt of AT&T Credit Holdings, Inc. (formerly AT&T Credit
Corporation) existing at March 31, 1993.

AT&T Credit Holdings, Inc. holds the majority of AT&T's
investment in AT&T Capital Corporation and the lease finance
assets of the former AT&T Credit Corporation. The table below
shows summarized consolidated financial information for AT&T
Credit Holdings, Inc., which consolidates the accounts of AT&T
Capital Corporation. Financial information for prior periods
was restated for the legal restructuring. The summarized
financial information includes transactions with AT&T that are
eliminated in consolidation.

AT&T AND SUBSIDIARIES AND McCAW AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Note 1 - McCaw Historical Presentation

Certain amounts reported in McCaw's historical financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the AT&T presentations in the
accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet and Statements of
Income. Such reclassifications are not material to the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements.

Note 2 - Exchange Ratio

As defined in the Merger Agreement, the Exchange Ratio will be one
AT&T Common Share for each share of McCaw Common Stock; provided, however,
that (i) in the event the Closing Date Market Price of one AT&T Common
Share (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement) is less than
$53.00, the-Exchange Ratio will be equal to $53.00 divided by the Closing
Date Market Price of one AT&T Common Share, but in no event greater than
1.111 AT&T Common Shares, and (ii) in the event the Closing Date Market
Price of one AT&T Common Share is greater than $71.73, the Exchange Ratio
will be equal to $71.73 divided by the Closing Date Market Price of one
AT&T Common Share, but in no event less than .909 of an AT&T Common Share.
For purposes of the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements, an
Exchange Ratio of one AT&T Common Share per share of McCaw Common Stock (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) is assumed.

Note 3 - Other Pro Forma Adjustments

(A) The McCaw Common Stock account has been adjusted to reflect the
assumed exchange of one AT&T Common Share, par value $1.00 per share, for
each of approximately 194.6 million shares of McCaw Common Stock, par value
$.01 per share, outstanding at March 31, 1994 (excluding shares of McCaw
Common Stock held by AT&T - see Note 3 (5)). The difference between the
par value of the AT&T Common Shares and the par value of the McCaw Common
Stock, after giving effect to the assumed Exchange Ratio, is reflected as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital of $193.

(B) The $400 investment by AT&T in 14.5 million shares of Class A
Common Stock purchased in February 1993 has been eliminated. The weighted
average common shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 1993
and March 31, 1994 have been adjusted to eliminate the impact of this
investment.

(C) McCaw's historical financial statements reflect the adoption of
SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," retroactive to January 1,
1991. AT&T adopted SFAS No. 109 effective January 1, 1993. For conformity
purposes, the pro forma combined information for AT&T and McCaw has been
adjusted as if McCaw had adopted SFAS No. 109 on January 1, 1993. Such
adoption would result in the use of different tax assumptions related to
intangible assets McCaw acquired in purchase business combinations in 1991
and 1992 that would increase the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109
by $39. Accordingly, the pro forma combined net income and earnings per <PAGE>

<PAGE> 20

common share have been decreased $1,840 and $1.20 for the period ended
March 31, 1993, respectively. Pro forma combined total assets and
shareowners' equity have been decreased $39 at March 31, 1994. Also,
effective January 1, 1993, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." McCaw adopted SFAS No. 112
effective January 1, 1994. The impact of this standard on McCaw's
financial statements is immaterial.

(D) No adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements for direct expenses related to the Merger.
Direct expenses included in the historical periods presented have not been
adjusted for in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements. Such
amounts are not material.

(E) No adjustments to eliminate intercompany transactions and
balances have been made in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial
Statements as such amounts are not material.

(F) The cash dividends per common share in the unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements reflect AT&T's cash dividends declared in the
periods presented. McCaw has never paid cash dividends on the McCaw Common
stock.

Note 4 - Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements assume that the
Merger qualifies as a "tax-free" reorganization for federal income tax
purposes.
