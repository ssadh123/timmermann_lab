6
<PAGE> 15
3.1 Net Purchase Price. The Net Purchase Price to be paid shall be
equal to the Asset Purchase Price (which includes the cash payment plus the
transfer of the Stations), plus the Accounts Receivable Price and the Inventory
Price, less the Station Inventory Price, plus and minus the amounts provided
for in Section Section 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 hereof. The Net Purchase Price may be
adjusted in accordance with Section Section 3.6 and 3.8.

All cash payments under this Agreement shall be by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account as the recipient shall designate.

3.2 Post Closing Receipt of Revenues. If EPC shall receive after
the Closing Date any proceeds attributable to the Assets for any period of time
after the Effective Time, EPC shall promptly pay to MNGL the amount of such
proceeds, unless an adjustment of the Purchase Price for such proceeds received
by EPC has previously been accounted for in the estimated Net Purchase Price.
If MNGL shall receive any proceeds attributable to the Assets for any period of
time prior to the Effective Time, then MNGL promptly shall pay to EPC such
proceeds, unless an upward adjustment of the Purchase Price for such proceeds
received by MNGL has previously been accounted for in the estimated Net

<PAGE> 16
3.3 Estimate of Net Purchase Price. For purposes of estimating the
Net Purchase Price to determine the amount to be paid by MNGL at the Closing,
the amount of the adjustments referred to in Section 3.2 will be estimated in
good faith by EPC.

An estimate of the value of the Station Inventory Price using the most
recent perpetual inventory and accounting records of MPI and MFI prior to the
Closing Date shall be calculated by MPI and MFI. Such estimate, will be set
forth in a certificate of MPI delivered to EMC at least seven (7) business days
before the Closing Date. An estimate of the value of the Inventory Price and
the Accounts Receivable Price using the most recent perpetual inventory and
accounting records of EPC prior to the Closing Date shall be calculated by EPC.

The estimated Net Purchase Price calculation using this information
will be set forth in a certificate of EPC delivered to MNGL at least seven (7)
business days before the Closing Date.

In addition, EPC agrees to give MNGL a credit for underground storage
tanks situated at customer locations, the sum of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars
($250.00) per tank.

3.4 Final Determination of Net Purchase Price. The Net Purchase
Price shall be finally determined as follows:

(a) As soon as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, MNGL, MPI, EMC and EPC together shall prepare the Final
Adjustment Certificate setting forth the final computation of the Net Purchase
Price (which shall include an adjustment for the Inventory Price) which shall
be based on the inventories taken as follows: a complete inventory and
compilation of the Inventory in the possession of EPC on the Closing Date shall
be taken jointly by MNGL and EPC; concurrently, a complete inventory and
compilation of the Station Inventory in the possession of MPI and MFI on the
Closing Date shall be taken jointly by EMC, MFI and MPI. Such inventories shall
be completed as promptly as is reasonably possible. The Final Adjustment
Certificate shall also include an adjustment for the Accounts Receivable Price,
being brought current to the Effective Time from its estimated value to its
actual value in accordance with Section 1.2. The difference between the
estimated Net Purchase Price paid at Closing and the Net Purchase Price set
forth in the Final Adjustment Certificate will be paid by MNGL or EPC, as the
case may be, within twenty (20) days thereafter.

(b) If MNGL and EPC are unable to agree upon the Net Purchase
Price, MNGL and EPC will submit the matters in dispute to a mutually acceptable
independent accounting firm to resolve the disputed items and make a
determination of the Net Purchase Price based thereon. Such determination will
be made within sixty (60) days after

8
<PAGE> 17
submitting the matter to the accounting firm and will be binding upon the
parties. The fees, cost and expenses of the accounting firm will be shared
equally by MNGL and EPC.

(c) The Net Purchase Price may be adjusted after such sixty (60)
day period in accordance with Section Section 3.6 and 3.8.

3.5 Proration of Certain Items. With respect to the assets being
transferred pursuant to this Agreement, the appropriate parties shall receive a
credit with respect to the following items:

(a) Real Estate and Personal Property Taxes. MNGL will pay all
real estate and personal property taxes on the Assets (prorated as of the
Effective Time) for the calendar year 1994, if any, which are not payable until
after the Closing Date. MNGL will make such payments as and when due. If the
amount of such taxes is not ascertainable as of the Closing Date, then such
reimbursement shall be based upon 1993 taxes paid by EPC, except for Assets in
the State of Michigan which will be at a value of eighty five percent (85%) of
the 1993 tax rates. MNGL shall receive a credit, or a debit where appropriate
for such taxes paid in advance, for EPC's prorated share of the amounts to be
paid by MNGL.

EMC will pay all real estate and personal property taxes on the Motor
Fuel Assets (prorated as of the Effective Time) for the calendar year 1994, if
any, which are not payable until after the Closing Date. EMC will make such
payments as and when due. If the amount of such taxes is not ascertainable as
of the Closing Date, then such reimbursement shall be based upon 1993 taxes
paid by MPI or MFI. EMC shall receive a credit, or a debit where appropriate
for such taxes paid in advance, for MPI's or MFI's prorated share of the
amounts to be paid by EMC.

(b) Customer Tank Rent Prepayment. Prepayments of tank rent shall
be prorated over the period to which the prepayment applies. MNGL shall receive
a credit for the amount by which the prepayment of tank rent exceed the tank
rent due through the end of the day prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Customer Deposits and Balances. MNGL shall receive a credit
for all customer deposits made with EPC, not otherwise included in the Accounts
Receivable Price, as described on Exhibit 1.24, in connection with the use,
lease or purchase of propane, propane tanks, cylinders, regulators or
equipment; provided, however, MNGL shall assume all liabilities and obligations
to such customers for refunds of customer deposits or credit balances of any
kind, not to exceed the amount of the credit received by MNGL.

9
<PAGE> 18
(d) Prepaid Expenses and Other Prepayments. EPC shall receive a
credit at Closing in an amount equal to the value of real property lease
payments, personal property lease payments, taxes, utility charges, or other
prepaid expenses, as described on Exhibit 3.5(d), made by EPC, if any, that are
related to the Business, and which are allocable to periods following the
Effective Time.

MPI or MFI shall receive a credit at Closing in an amount equal to the
value of real property lease payments, personal property lease payments, taxes,
utility charges, or other prepaid expenses, as described on Exhibit 3.5(d),
made by MPI or MFI, if any, that are related to the Motor Fuel Assets, and
which are allocable to periods following the Effective Time.

The foregoing items to be prorated between the parties will be
computed as of the Effective Time and will be adjustments to the payment to be
made by MNGL to EPC, as further described in Section 3.1.

3.6 Propane Tank Inventory. Subsequent to the Closing Date and
within three hundred sixty-five (365) days thereafter, MNGL and EPC agree to
make payments and agree to take the actions set forth in this Section 3.6. Any
dispute between EPC and MNGL in connection with this Propane Tank Inventory
that cannot be resolved between them shall be finally determined in the same
manner set forth in Section 3.4(b). EPC represents to MNGL that Exhibit 1.13
lists the number of propane customer storage tanks (250 gallon or greater) and
propane bulk storage tanks, by water capacity size, owned by EPC.

(a) Within three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the Closing
Date, MNGL shall verify and give written notice to EPC of any discrepancies in
the total water capacity of such propane customer storage tanks purchased by
MNGL from EPC as listed on Exhibit 1.13. Within ninety (90) days after EPC's
receipt of MNGL's written notice to EPC of any discrepancies in the total water
capacity of such tanks purchased by MNGL from EPC, EPC with MNGL's cooperation
shall have the right to confirm MNGL's tank verification and MNGL's
verification of the percentage of EPC-owned propane customer storage tanks,
where such verifications indicate discrepancies in the total water capacity of
the number of tanks listed on Exhibit 1.13.

A propane customer storage tank shall be "verified" as EPC-owned if:

10
<PAGE> 19
(1) the tank has a proper data plate or tank
identification (marked in accordance with NFPA 58) attached and shall
be rated for a working pressure of at least 200 pounds per square
inch, determined in accordance with the standards of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, and

(2) an executed lease covering the tanks is provided to 
MNGL; or

(3) MNGL acknowledges the existence of those tanks used
at the branch or in any branch inventory of tanks; or

(4) MNGL or EPC receives a statement signed by the
customer acknowledging MNGL's or EPC's ownership of the tanks.

In addition, at such time as the percentage of the tanks "verified" by
MNGL in accordance with the above procedures reaches seventy-five percent (75%)
of the numbers set forth on Exhibit 1.13, the customer storage tanks (250
gallons or greater) may also be "verified" for non-agricultural and
non-commercial propane customers, if documentation is provided to MNGL showing
that:

(A) The customer has received deliveries of propane from EPC into
the tank(s) to be "verified" and an invoice has been paid by the
customer including payment of an annual rental for the tank(s) to be
"verified"; or

(B) In cases where the annual rental for the tank(s) to be
"verified" has been waived by EPC, the customer is purchasing propane
(i) on EPC's budget pay plan, or (ii) on EPC's courtesy fill plan, or
(iii) in excess of a volume which would otherwise require annual
rental for the tank(s) to be "verified."

At such time as the percentage of tanks (250 gallon or greater)
"verified" at any branch is equal to ninety-seven percent (97%) of the quantity
listed for such branch, the total at such branch shall be considered as
"verified." If the quantity "verified" is greater than one hundred percent
(100%), the excess shall be included in the aggregate water capacity
determination.

In the event there exists a shortage of propane customer storage tanks
(250 gallon or greater), and such shortage is greater than three percent (3%)
of the aggregate water capacity of the EPC-owned propane customer storage tanks
(250 gallon or greater) for all locations described in Exhibit 1.13, as
determined in MNGL's tank verification within the 365 days following Closing,
additional time shall be given to MNGL to continue its "verification" of such
tanks at any branch with shortages greater than three percent (3%) of the
aggregate water capacity of the EPC-owned storage tanks (250

11
<PAGE> 20
gallon or greater) for such branch. During the time following such initial
period the minimum percentage of "verification" at any branch shall be met if
the percentages set forth below are met:

90 days after initial period 96%
180 days after initial period 95%
270 days after initial period 94%

All "verifications" are subject to EPC's confirmation in the manner
set forth in this Section 3.6. If the indicated percentages are not met within
the appropriate time periods, an adjustment shall be made in the Net Purchase
Price to reflect the actual number of tanks. Any adjustment arising from the
propane customer storage tank verification shall be made at an agreed
adjustment value of One and Ten/100 Dollars ($1.10) per gallon of total tank
water capacity for such tank (250 gallon or greater) shortage. In the event
that an overage in the total water capacity of propane customer storage tanks
is determined, there shall be no adjustment to the Net Purchase Price. In the
event that a shortage adjustment in the number of propane customer storage
tanks is determined, EPC shall pay to MNGL, in cash within sixty (60) days of
the EPC's audit of MNGL's verification, the value of such shortage adjustment.

(b) A propane bulk storage tank shall be "verified" as EPC-owned
if:

(1) the tank has a proper data plate or tank
identification (marked in accordance with NFPA 58) attached and shall
be rated for a working pressure of at least 200 pounds per square
inch, determined in accordance with the standards of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, and

(2) MNGL acknowledges the existence of those tanks used
at the branch, satellite, or installed on any vehicle or trailer;
provided, further, for such tanks installed on vehicles or trailers,
EPC shall provide MNGL with the "Manufacturer's Data Report for
Unfired Pressure Vessels" and the current "Certificate of Hydrostatic
Testing" for each such tank installed on a vehicle or trailer.

In the event there exists a shortage of propane bulk storage tanks
described in Exhibit 1.13, as determined by MNGL's propane bulk storage tank
verification as set forth in this Section 3.6, which shall be accomplished by
MNGL at or prior to the Closing Date, and subject to EPC's confirmation within
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, an adjustment shall be made, as set
forth in Section Section 3.4 above, in the Net Purchase Price to reflect the
actual number of propane bulk storage tanks. Any adjustment arising from the
propane bulk storage tank verification shall be made at an agreed

12
<PAGE> 21
adjustment value of: (i) Eight and Seventy-five/100 Dollars ($8.75) per gallon
of total tank water capacity for any vehicle mounted propane bulk storage tank
(bobtails) shortage; (ii) Five and No/100 Dollars ($5.00) per gallon of total
tank water capacity for any trailer mounted propane bulk storage tank
(transports) shortage; and (iii) One and Ten/100 Dollars ($1.10) per gallon of
total water capacity for all other propane bulk storage tank shortages,
including without limitation all such tanks installed at EPC branch or
satellite locations. In the event that an overage adjustment in the number of
propane bulk storage tanks is determined, there shall be no adjustment to the
Net Purchase Price.

3.7 Accounts Receivable. To determine the price of the Accounts
Receivable, EPC's total outstanding Accounts Receivable shall be verified by
EPC and MNGL as of the Effective Time. The price to be paid shall be the
applicable percentage, as set forth in the schedule below, of the amount of the
Accounts Receivable, subject to adjustments for the final determination of Net
Purchase Price as provided above in Section 3.4.

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Accounts Receivable Age Percentage
----------------------- ----------
<S> <C>
0 - 30 days after invoice date 100.00%
31 - 60 days after invoice date 99.58%
61 - 90 days after invoice date 99.16%
91 - 120 days after invoice date 98.75%
121 - 150 days after invoice date 98.33%
151 - 180 days after invoice date 97.81%
</TABLE>

Delinquent Accounts Receivable past due in excess of 180 days of the
invoice date, those in bankruptcy proceedings or placed for collection
shall be retained by EPC.

EPC agrees that all Accounts Receivable transferred to MNGL that are
or become delinquent and reach an age of 181 days or greater, at the option of
MNGL, may be reconveyed to EPC at the end of the sixth calendar month following
Closing. The Accounts Receivable shall be reconveyed to EPC by an assignment
substantially in the form of Exhibit 20.2(d) and shall be at a value equal to
one hundred percent (100%) of the face value of the principal amount of such
account at the time of reconveyance. The option to reconvey the Accounts
Receivable shall cease ten (10) days after the end of the sixth calendar month
following Closing; provided, further, within ten (10) days

13
<PAGE> 22
after the time of reconveyance of such accounts, EPC shall pay to MNGL an
amount equal to 100% of the face value of such accounts reconveyed to EPC. MNGL
agrees to use its best efforts to collect the Accounts Receivable conveyed to
it by EPC, reconveyed by MNGL to EPC, and to assist EPC in collection of those
Accounts Receivable not conveyed to MNGL for a period of twelve (12) months
from the Closing Date.

Effective on the Closing Date, EPC hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints MNGL and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of
substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable
power and authority in the place and stead of EPC and in the name of EPC or in
its own name, without notice to or assent by EPC to sign, endorse and negotiate
any check, draft, deposit item or other instruments received by MNGL as a
customer payment on the Accounts Receivable transferred or assigned as provided
in this Section 3.7; provided, however, the parties agree to, within thirty
(30) days of receipt, remit to the other party any payments received by such
party on accounts receivable transferred hereunder to MNGL or retained by EPC.

3.8 Adjustment for Natural Gas Encroachment. The Net Purchase
Price to be paid to EPC by MNGL is based, in substantial part, on MNGL's
assessment of the value of the EPC retail propane customer base. Accordingly,
if a significant erosion to the customer base for the branch locations listed
on Exhibit 3.8 occurs within the thirty-six (36) month period following the
Closing as a result of encroachment to such customer base by natural gas
(except those customers with existing natural gas service), an adjustment to
the Net Purchase Price shall be made in accordance with the following
provisions. MNGL will give EPC prompt notice upon its learning of any efforts
by natural gas suppliers to expand within or in to the areas serviced by the
branches listed on Exhibit 3.8.

(a) Adjustment Period. In the event: (i) more than the percentage
indicated below of EPC's propane customer base being serviced by any EPC branch
listed on Exhibit 3.8 convert from propane to natural gas (except those
customers with existing natural gas service), within any twelve (12) month
period after Closing; or (ii) more than fifteen percent (15%) of EPC's propane
customer base being serviced by any EPC branch listed on Exhibit 3.8 convert
from propane to natural gas (except those customers with existing natural gas
service), within thirty-six (36) months following Closing, EPC shall reimburse
MNGL for such customers. MNGL agrees to provided EPC on a quarterly basis, by
month by branch listed on Exhibit 3.8, with a listing of the number of
customers converting to natural gas. Such list shall include

14
<PAGE> 23
the customer name, address, EPC account number, the approximate date of
conversion to natural gas and the system to which such account was connected.

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

At the end of the 36-month adjustment period, MNGL shall identify for purposes
of calculation the 12-month periods which exceed the above percentages or the
36-month total if greater than 15%. The reimbursement shall be an amount equal
to One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) multiplied by the total number of customers
converting to natural gas, in excess of two percent (2%) of the customer base
for the affected branch(es). Examples of this reimbursement are shown on
Exhibit 3.8. In no event will EPC be required to pay in excess of Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000.00) to MNGL under this Section 3.8. The customer base for
all percentage calculations hereunder shall be established as the number of
customers at the branches as of the Effective Time. No adjustment shall be made
for customers serviced by any branch not listed on Exhibit 3.8 who may convert
to natural gas at any time.

(b) Reimbursement Procedure. Within sixty (60) days following the
end of the thirty-sixth month after Closing, and if any adjustment is to be
made pursuant to the provisions of this section, MNGL shall provide EPC with a
list of customers, by servicing branch, who qualify hereunder. Such list shall
include the customer name, address, EPC's account number, the approximate date
of conversion to natural gas and the system to which such account was
connected. Within sixty (60) days thereafter, EPC shall pay to MNGL the amount
of the adjustment calculated in accordance with Section 3.8(a). If EPC disputes
the adjustment with respect to any of the customers, which dispute cannot be
resolved by mutual agreement of the parties, the dispute shall be finally
determined in the same manner as set forth in Section 3.4(b).

party in connection with federal, state or local regulatory or tax matters,
resolution of existing disputes or contract compliance matters affecting the
party and to audit the same. Further, during such period, each party shall each
provide to the other parties such assistance as is reasonably requested in the
review and analysis of such files, books, and records. Such assistance will
include, but not be limited to, providing tax data for the period of time
through the Closing Date; providing space, facilities and assistance to the
requesting party's internal and external auditors to complete their audit work;
assisting the requesting party in responding to questions and issues raised by
tax authorities during their audits of periods ending prior to or including the
Closing Date; and providing information which may be relevant to the requesting
party in defending or pursuing claims or litigation

31
<PAGE> 40
by or against the requesting party. Each party will notify the other before
destroying any such files, books and records. Their disposition shall be
mutually agreed upon by the party requesting permission to destroy or dispose
of same giving to the other party sixty (60) days to respond to such request.
Either party may choose to have the documents noticed for destruction or
disposition delivered to it for retention by the party at the party's expense.

The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other
party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and agree on a fee for providing
such assistance at the providing party's usual rates.

they shall have no recourse whatsoever as against the qualified intermediary
under the Agreement, including any breach of representations and warranties
herein contained, except for those obligations of payment. MNGL, EPC and EMC
agree to execute any and all documents necessary to consummate the purposes of
this section. EPC and EMC agree to consent to such assignment of rights under
Section 1031 provided that (i) it is to an intermediary qualified as such
pursuant to the regulations under IRC Section 1031; (ii) in no event will EPC
or EMC be required to become the owner of record of any real property other
than the Stations; (iii) there shall be no adverse tax consequences to EPC or
EMC as the result of such exchange; and (iv) the participation in any such
exchange shall not be a representation by EPC or EMC of the tax consequences to
MNGL, MPI or MFI of the exchange.

Further, the parties acknowledge that they may engage in a like-kind
property exchange with each other pursuant to IRC Section 1031.

ARTICLE XIV: ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

14.1 Assessment and Remediation of the Land.

39
<PAGE> 48
14.1.1 Except as provided in Section 20.2, EPC has provided MNGL with
copies of the following environmental information which it has in its custody
and which are not privileged: any assessments, studies, reports, or data which
EPC has submitted to, or prepared for, a governmental agency regarding the
Land; any notices of violations, order or inquiries of an environmental nature
from any government or third party directed to EPC regarding the Land; and any
information with respect to suspected or confirmed releases of Hazardous
Materials at the Land. MNGL acknowledges that Hydrocarbon contamination exists
at each parcel of the Land identified in Exhibit 14.1.1.

14.1.2 EPC has started conducting Phase I and, as necessary, Phase II
environmental site assessments on all of the Land. All Phase I assessments
shall be completed at least thirty (30) days before the Closing Date and all
Phase II assessments, as needed, shall be completed by December 31, 1994. The
assessments shall be performed in accordance with ASTM standards and shall
include the procedures set forth in Exhibit 14.1.2. Phase II work shall include
soil and groundwater monitoring sampling and laboratory analysis to adequately
define the lateral and vertical extent of any Petroleum or other Hazardous
Materials at the Land or migrating from the Land. Phase II testing for
underground storage tanks shall include tank and line tightness tests using
appropriately experienced contractors. All corrective work that may be required
so that the underground storage tanks and lines test tight and otherwise comply
with all applicable requirements shall be completed by December 31, 1994. The
results of these assessments will be provided to MNGL. Upon receipt of such
assessments, MNGL may exclude any Land for which suspected or confirmed
contamination appears to be present in a significant amount or where in the
reasonable judgment of MNGL, there is significant third party exposure to
liability because of such contamination; in that case, and if prior to the
Closing, the cash allocated price shown on Exhibit 1.27 for such Land together
with reasonable cost to relocate the Assets located on the Land shall be paid
by EPC at Closing. If receipt of the Phase II assessment occurs after Closing,
MNGL shall reconvey the Land to EPC by quitclaim deed and receive from EPC the
cash allocated price for such Land, together with reasonable cost to relocate
the Assets located on such Land.

For the branch at Neapolis, Ohio, and the satellite at Lucerne,
Indiana, or at any other branches or satellites, if tank and/or line tightness
tests reveal that tanks and/or lines are leaking and are, at EPC's reasonable
determination, repairable in accordance with good oil industry practices, EPC
shall commence repair of such tanks and lines at its own cost prior to the
Closing Date; provided, however, that EPC shall advise MNGL of the costs EPC
will incur in repairing

40
<PAGE> 49
said tanks and/or lines, and if MNGL desires to replace rather than repair such
lines and/or tanks, MNGL shall so advise EPC and the tanks and lines shall be
replaced at MNGL's sole cost and expense and EPC shall pay to MNGL the amount
EPC would have incurred to repair. If, in the reasonable determination of EPC's
independent UST engineering consultant, tanks and/or lines are not repairable
and require replacement, then EPC shall replace such tanks at its sole cost.

14.1.3 EPC has reported or shall report all suspected or confirmed
releases of Petroleum or other Hazardous Materials in conformity with
Applicable Laws, and are complying with the Applicable Laws for these
properties and for all properties for which a suspected or confirmed release
has already been reported in conducting the following work and any other work
required by Applicable Laws, including work at any off-site properties to where
contamination has migrated; assessing and reporting the contamination,
developing a corrective, or remedial, action plan for the contamination,
obtaining approval of the plan from the appropriate governmental authorities,
implementing the approved plan, and obtaining a "no-further-action" letter or
equivalent from such governmental authorities or if applicable law, regulation
or practice does not practically make such letter available, remediating the
contamination to standards contained in Applicable Laws.

14.1.4 Subsequent to Closing and during site remediation being
conducted by EPC, MNGL shall report all suspected or confirmed releases of
Petroleum or other Hazardous Materials to EPC within 48 hours and provide EPC
with all documentation in regard to that location and incident, including all
sampling results taken at that location and all environmental documents and
reports prepared for that location along with any reports or documents
submitted to any governmental agency.

14.1.5 Prior to the commencement of any remedial or corrective action
plan or assessments to create such plans, such plans shall be sent by overnight
mail to MNGL at least fourteen (14) days before they are due with the
governmental agency to allow MNGL the opportunity to comment to EPC before the
work plans are finalized. In the event a remedial or corrective action plan has
been prepared and approved by the relevant governmental agency prior to
Closing, EPC shall forward such plans to MNGL within thirty (30) days after
Closing. Thereafter, EPC shall provide MNGL with all reports prepared pursuant
to the work plans. No remedial measures in excess of those required by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or relevant state regulatory agency shall
be required to be performed by EPC hereunder.

41
<PAGE> 50

14.1.6 Before work is concluded at any particular site, EPC shall
submit a "no further action" letter or equivalent or other documentation to
MNGL demonstrating that all environmental laws, regulations or other applicable
requirements have been satisfied at that particular Land. If MNGL disputes that
such standards have been satisfied, MNGL shall notify EPC of such dispute and
the parties shall discuss this issue in good faith and seek to resolve it. No
remedial measures in excess of those required by the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency or relevant state regulatory agency shall be required to be
performed by EPC hereunder, and all remedial measures for the Land may be
deemed completed for purposes of this Agreement upon the receipt of a "no
further action" letter or its equivalent from the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency or relevant state regulatory agency accepting the measures
performed at the Land and stating that no further action is required beyond
periodic monitoring of groundwater wells. The receipt of a "no further action"
letter or its equivalent from the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency or
relevant state regulatory agency shall not relieve any party of its obligations
as to third parties under the indemnity portions of this Agreement.

14.1.7 EPC shall not unreasonably reject recommendations by MNGL as
to assessment plans or remediation strategies which are required by applicable
standards, are prudent measures that are generally accepted in the oil
industry, or are necessary to make the affected Land suitable for commercial
uses other than those involving the retail sale of propane.

14.1.8 If there is more than one treatment strategy available to EPC
at Land where it is required to conduct remediation, which strategies can
effectively remediate the contamination to applicable standards, preference
shall be given to the treatment strategy which shall be least disruptive to the
post-Closing business activities of MNGL, which remediates the contamination in
the most expeditious manner and which reduces the potential of the
contamination migrating to other person's property. MNGL may require an
excavation and landfilling remedy to be selected over remedies which take a
longer period of time to implement so long as the excavation and landfilling
remedy is materially faster to implement and so long as the excavation and
landfilling remedy is reimbursable by a governmental authority to the same
extent as other remedies. In those situations where the site is not
reimbursable or where some portion of the excavation and landfilling remedy is
not reimbursable, the excavation and landfilling remedy may still be required
by MNGL over remedies which take a longer period of time to implement so long
as the excavation and landfilling remedy will not

42
<PAGE> 51
result in an increase in out-of-pocket cost by EPC of more than ten percent of
the overall cost of the remedy originally chosen.

14.1.9 MNGL may accompany EPC or its contractors when it is
conducting any of the assessments or other work at the Land and EPC shall give
notice of such work at least 48 hours before it is conducted.

14.1.10 EPC shall employ scientific consultants, who meet with the
reasonable approval of MNGL, to conduct the work required by this Article, and
all of the assessments and work shall be conducted in conformance with any
applicable state, local or federal requirements and normal oil industry
practices for this type of work. EPC shall for all remediation activities, to
the extent permissible, pass through to MNGL any contractors' warranties it
receives. At its own expense, MNGL may require split samples to be taken, with
one sample given to MNGL.

14.1.11 EPC shall indemnify and hold MNGL harmless from any claim,
action or suit arising from EPC's or its consultant's conducting of this work.
EPC shall require that any of its consultants conducting work under this
Agreement maintain insurance coverage of at least $1,000,000.00 and in the form
of an insurance policy common to the type of work being conducted by this
consultant for the oil industry and it shall cover any personal injury,
property damage, or environmental liability caused by their activities and
shall name MNGL as an additional insured.

14.1.12 If remediation work will occur after MNGL takes possession of
the Land, this Agreement shall serve to grant reasonable access to EPC and its
contractors, as necessary, at no cost, to accomplish the work required by this
Agreement. No separate access or license agreement shall be needed. EPC shall
provide 72 business hours notice to MNGL of work to be conducted on the Land
after Closing. In their activities, EPC and its contractors shall minimize any
disturbance to MNGL's business, and shall restore the Land to as good a
condition as existed at the commencement of the remediation work.

If at any time after the Closing Date, during the performance of
remedial measures at the Land as set forth in this article, EPC or its
consultants or contractors determines that the level of then existing
hydrocarbons has begun to increase due to reasons that cannot be explained by
the existing technical data for the site, EPC shall so notify MNGL immediately
and MNGL agrees to cease, or cause to be ceased, the operation of equipment
that could be related to the increase in contamination at such location
promptly within receipt of oral or written notice from EPC until testing can be
performed by MNGL. MNGL shall give advance notice of the testing. Such
additional tank and line tightness tests shall be

43
<PAGE> 52
performed at the cost of MNGL; provided, however, that in the event the written
reports of such tests indicate that the equipment did not leak, EPC shall be
responsible to pay said testing expenses directly or reimburse MNGL. If, upon
subsequent investigation by EPC and MNGL, the presence of hydrocarbons is
determined to have occurred subsequent to the Closing Date which is not
attributable to a release of Hydrocarbons occurring prior to the Closing and it
is caused by any reason other than the acts or omissions of EPC, EPC and MNGL
shall jointly determine how best to remedy such additional hydrocarbon impact
and MNGL agrees that it shall be responsible for remediation of such additional
Hydrocarbon impact.

MNGL agrees that to the extent such remedial measures undertaken and
performed by EPC would entitle either EPC or MNGL to compensation or financial
assistance from any applicable state or federal underground storage tank trust
fund, then the party who paid for the cost of such measures shall receive such
compensation or financial assistance and the other parties will take all steps
necessary to cooperate in pursuit of such monies.

14.1.13 MNGL has the right (but is not obligated) to conduct work
required by this Agreement and bill EPC if the work needs to be immediately
conducted as a matter of public health or safety and EPC fails to do work under
this Agreement after MNGL provides reasonable notice that it will assume such
work.

14.1.14 MNGL agrees and covenants that it shall take no action or fail
to comply with any applicable state or federal statute or law, and any
regulations, rules and orders promulgated thereunder, presently existing or
promulgated after the Closing Date, which the omission to act or failure to
comply with, would result in EPC or MNGL losing its right to compensation or
financial assistance from any applicable state or federal underground storage
tank trust fund. MNGL further agrees on the Closing Date to execute and deliver
Underground Storage Tank Notifications for filing with the responsible
governmental agency to show that EPC is no longer the "owner and/or operator"
and that MNGL is the new "owner and/or operator", as such terms are defined
under applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. In the event MNGL's actions, or failure to comply or
act, results in the Land being suspended, deleted, declared ineligible or
removed from any applicable underground storage tank trust fund or
reimbursement program, MNGL agrees to additionally indemnify EPC under Article
XXIII for lost compensation for such remediation costs, expenses, claims and
damages.

44
<PAGE> 53
14.1.15 Disclosure Documents. To the extent required by state law, on
or before fifteen (15) days before Closing, EPC shall deliver to MNGL an
environmental disclosure document for each property where one is required by
applicable law or regulation. EPC and MNGL expressly waive any requirement that
such disclosure documents be delivered and received in a period greater than
such fifteen (15) day time limit. The disclosure document shall be prepared in
accordance with applicable law or regulation and shall include a discussion of
any obligation under Applicable Law to register underground storage tanks.

14.2 Assessment and Remediation of the Stations.

14.2.1 Except as provided in Section 20.5(e), MPI and MFI have
provided EMC with copies of the following environmental information which it
has in its custody and which are not privileged: any assessments, studies,
reports, or data which MPI and MFI have submitted to, or prepared for, a
governmental agency regarding the Stations; any notices of violations, order or
inquiries of an environmental nature from any government or third party
directed to MPI and MFI regarding the Stations; and any information with
respect to suspected or confirmed releases of Hazardous Materials at the
Stations. EMC acknowledges that Hydrocarbon contamination exists at each
Station identified in Exhibit 14.2.1.

14.2.2 MPI and MFI have commenced testing of all underground storage
tanks and tank lines at the Stations, to ensure that they test tight and to
ensure their compliance with the underground storage tank system laws of the
States of Florida and Tennessee, as applicable, using appropriately experienced
contractors. MPI and MFI shall provide EMC with copies of all test results, as
certified by such contractors as soon as practicable but in no event any later
than thirty (30) days before Closing. All corrective work that may be required
so that the underground storage tanks and lines test tight and otherwise comply
with all applicable requirements shall be completed by the Closing Date.

If tank and/or line tightness tests reveal that tanks and/or lines are
leaking and are, at MPI's or MFI's reasonable determination, repairable in
accordance with good oil industry practices, MPI or MFI shall repair such tanks
and lines at its own cost prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that
MPI or MFI shall advise EMC of the costs MPI or MFI will incur in repairing
said tanks and/or lines, and if EMC desires to replace rather than repair such
lines and/or tanks, EMC shall so advise MPI or MFI and the tanks and lines
shall be replaced at EMC's sole cost and expense and MPI or MFI shall pay to
EMC the amount MPI or MFI would have incurred to repair. If, in the reasonable
determination of MPI's or MFI's independent UST engineering consultant, tanks
and/or lines are not repairable and require replacement, then MPI

45
<PAGE> 54
or MFI shall replace such tanks at its sole cost; provided, however, that in
the event the aggregate cost estimate of such replacement for a Station exceeds
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), then MPI or MFI may withdraw such
Station from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the cash
payment for the Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the allocated value of the
withdrawn Station. Upon notice of withdrawal, EMC may, within fifteen (15) days
of such notice of withdrawal, advise MPI or MFI that it elects to pay MPI or
MFI those replacement costs in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000); and in such event this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect as to the Stations and the replacement shall be undertaken. In the event
EMC desires additional replacement of lines and/or tanks beyond the replacement
required under this Section, then EMC shall have the option to replace such
lines and/or tanks at EMC's sole cost and expense.

14.2.3 MPI and MFI have commenced Phase I and Phase II environmental
site assessments at all the Stations. All Phase I assessments shall be
completed and provided to EMC at least thirty (30) days before the scheduled
Closing Date and all Phase II assessments shall be completed at least five (5)
days before the scheduled Closing Date. A Phase I assessment shall include the
procedures set forth in Exhibit 14.1.2 and a review of documents within MPI's
or MFI's custody which could identify any environmental contamination,
suspected or confirmed release of Petroleum or other Hazardous Materials, or
environmental non- compliance problem at the facility and a walk through at the
locations by a qualified environmental engineer or scientist to identify any
material environmental contamination or environmental non-compliance problems.
Phase II shall include the procedures set forth in Exhibit 14.1.2 and shall
include soil and groundwater monitoring sampling and laboratory analysis to
adequately define the lateral and vertical extent of any Petroleum or other
Hazardous Materials at the Stations or migrating from the Stations. Upon
receipt of such assessments, EMC may exclude any Station(s) for which suspected
or confirmed contamination appears to be present in a significant amount or
where in the reasonable judgment of EMC, there is significant third party
exposure to liability because of such contamination; in that case, and if prior
to the Closing, the cash allocated price shown on Exhibit 1.27 for such Station
shall be paid by MNGL at Closing. If receipt of the Phase II assessment occurs
after Closing, EMC shall reconvey the Station to MPI or MFI by quitclaim deed
and receive from MNGL the cash allocated price shown on Exhibit 1.27 for such
Station.

46
<PAGE> 55
14.2.4 MPI or MFI, as appropriate, may seek to have or continue to
have the State of Florida and/or prior owners/operators of the Stations be
responsible to remediate or pay for the remediation of certain of the Stations,
as the laws or regulations of those states provide. MPI and MFI, however,
maintain ultimate responsibility to EMC for the work to be conducted under this
Agreement, including the costs of the work. MPI and MFI agree that all of the
work under this Agreement shall be conducted in a reasonably prompt and
professional manner and should the States of Florida or Tennessee, as
appropriate, fail to conduct the work in such manner, MPI and MFI shall take
over said work and conduct it in said manner.

14.2.5 MPI and MFI have reported or shall report all suspected or
confirmed releases of Petroleum or other Hazardous Materials in conformity with
Applicable Law, and are complying with the Applicable Laws for these properties
and for all properties for which a suspected or confirmed release has already
been reported in conducting the following work and any other work required by
Applicable Law, including work at any off-site properties to where
contamination has migrated; assessing and reporting the contamination,
developing a corrective, or remedial, action plan for the contamination,
obtaining approval of the plan from the appropriate governmental authorities,
implementing the approved plan, and obtaining a "no further action" letter or
equivalent from such governmental authorities or if applicable law, regulation
or practice does not practically make such letter available, remediating the
contamination to standards contained in Applicable Law and so as to satisfy any
requirements for the lease of the Station(s).

14.2.6 Subsequent to Closing and during site remediation being
conducted by MPI or MFI, EMC shall report all suspected or confirmed releases
of Hazardous Materials on the Stations to MPI or MFI within 48 hours and
provide MPI or MFI with all documentation in regard to that location and
incident, including all sampling results taken at that location and all
environmental documents and reports prepared for that location along with any
reports or documents submitted to any governmental agency.

14.2.7 Prior to the commencement of any remedial or corrective action
plan or assessments to create such plans, the work plans shall be sent by
overnight mail to EMC at least fourteen (14) days before they are due with the
governmental agency to allow EMC the opportunity to comment to MPI or MFI
before such work plans are finalized. In the event a remedial or corrective
action plan has been prepared and approved by the relevant governmental agency
prior to Closing, MFI or MPI shall forward such plans to EMC within thirty (30)
days after Closing. Thereafter, MFI or MPI shall

47
<PAGE> 56
provide EMC with all reports prepared pursuant to the work plans. No remedial
measures in excess of those required by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency or relevant state regulatory agency shall be required to be performed by
MFI or MPI hereunder.

14.2.8 Before work is concluded at any particular site, MPI or MFI
shall submit a "no further action" letter or equivalent or other documentation
to EMC demonstrating that all environmental laws, regulations or other
applicable requirements have been satisfied at that particular Station. If EMC
disputes that such standards have been satisfied, EMC shall notify MPI and MFI
of such dispute and the parties shall discuss this issue in good faith and seek
to resolve it. No remedial measures in excess of those required by the U. S.
Environmental Protection Agency or relevant state regulatory agency shall be
required to be performed by MPI or MFI hereunder, and all remedial measures for
the Stations may be deemed completed for purposes of this Agreement upon the
receipt of a "no-further-action" letter or its equivalent from the U. S.
Environmental Protection Agency or relevant state regulatory agency accepting
the measures performed at the Stations and stating that no further action is
required beyond periodic monitoring of groundwater wells. The receipt of a
"no-further-action" letter or its equivalent from the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency or relevant state regulatory agency shall not relieve any
party of its obligations as to third parties under the indemnity portions of
this Agreement.

14.2.9 MPI and MFI shall not unreasonably reject recommendations by
EMC as to assessment plans or remediation strategies which are required by
applicable standards, are prudent measures that are generally accepted in the
oil industry, or are necessary to make the affected Station suitable for
commercial uses other than those involving gasoline stations, or will make the
Station(s) comply with particular leasehold requirements.

14.2.10 If there is more than one treatment strategy which can
effectively remediate the contamination to applicable standards at Stations
where MPI or MFI are required to conduct remediation, preference shall be given
to the treatment strategy which shall be least disruptive to the post-Closing
business activities of EMC, which remediates the contamination in the most
expeditious manner and which reduces the potential of the contamination
migrating to other person's property. EMC may require an excavation and
landfilling remedy selected over remedies which take a longer period of time to
implement so long as the excavation and landfilling remedy is materially faster
to implement and so long as the excavation and landfilling

48
<PAGE> 57
remedy is reimbursable by a governmental authority to the same extent as other
remedies. In those situations where the site is not reimbursable or where some
portion of the excavation and landfilling remedy is not reimbursable, the
excavation and landfilling remedy may still be required by EMC over remedies
which take a longer period of time to implement so long as the excavation and
landfilling remedy will not result in an increase in out-of-pocket cost by MPI
or MFI of more than ten percent of the overall cost of the remedy originally
chosen.

14.2.11 EMC may accompany MPI and MFI or their contractors when any of
them are conducting any of the assessments required or any of the work or
testing required by this Agreement and MPI or MFI shall give notice of any such
activity at least 48 hours before it is conducted.

14.2.12 MPI and MFI shall employ scientific consultants, who meet with
the reasonable approval of EMC, to conduct the work required by this section,
and all of the assessments and work shall be conducted in conformance with any
applicable state, local or federal requirements. MPI and MFI shall for all
remediation activities, to the extent permissible, pass through to EMC any
contractors' warranties they receive. At its own cost, EMC may require split
samples to be taken, with one sample given to EMC.
14.2.13 MPI and MFI shall indemnify and hold EMC harmless from any
claim, action or suit arising from MPI's or MFI's conducting of this work. MPI
or MFI shall require that any of its consultants conducting work under this
Agreement maintain insurance coverage of at least $1,000,000.00 and in the form
of an insurance policy common to the type of work being conducted by this
consultant for the oil industry and it shall cover any personal injury,
property damage, or environmental liability caused by their activities and
shall name EMC as an additional insured.

14.2.15 If remediation work will occur after EMC takes possession of
the Stations, this Agreement shall serve to grant reasonable access to MPI, MFI
and their contractors, and/or the State of Florida or third parties responsible
for remediation, as necessary, at no cost, to accomplish the work required by
this Agreement. No separate access or license agreement shall be needed. MPI or
MFI shall provide 72 business hours notice to EMC of work to be conducted at
the Stations after Closing. In their activities, MPI and MFI and their
contractors shall minimize any disturbance to EMC's business, and shall restore
the surface of the Station(s) to as good a condition as existed at the
commencement of the remediation work.

If at any time after the Closing Date, during the performance of
remedial measures at the Stations as set forth in this article, MPI or MFI or
their consultants or contractors determine that the level of then existing
hydrocarbons has begun to increase due to reasons that cannot be explained by
the existing technical data for the site, MPI or MFI shall

49
<PAGE> 58
so notify EMC immediately and EMC agrees to cease, or cause to be ceased, the
operation of equipment that could be related to the increase in contamination
at such location promptly within receipt of oral or written notice from MPI or
MFI until testing can be performed by EMC. EMC shall give advance notice of the
testing. Such additional tank and line tightness tests shall be performed at
the cost of EMC; provided, however, that in the event the written reports of
such tests indicate that the equipment did not leak, MPI or MFI shall be
responsible to pay said testing expenses directly or reimburse EMC. If, upon
subsequent investigation by MPI or MFI and EMC, the presence of hydrocarbons is
determined to have occurred subsequent to the Closing Date which is not
attributable to a release of Hydrocarbons occurring prior to the Closing and it
is caused by any reason other than the acts or omissions of MPI or MFI, EMC and
MPI or MFI shall jointly determine how best to remedy such additional
hydrocarbon impact and EMC agrees that it shall be responsible for remediation
of such additional Hydrocarbon impact.

EMC agrees that to the extent such remedial measures undertaken and
performed by MPI or MFI would entitle either MPI or MFI or EMC to compensation
or financial assistance from any applicable state or federal underground
storage tank trust fund, then the party who paid for the cost of such measures
shall receive such compensation or financial assistance and the other parties
will take all steps necessary to cooperate in pursuit of such monies.

14.2.16 EMC has the right (but is not obligated) to conduct work
required by this Agreement and bill MFI and MPI if the work needs to be
immediately conducted as a matter of public health or safety and both MFI and
MPI fail to do work under this Agreement after EMC provides reasonable notice
to them that it will assume such work.

14.2.17 EMC agrees and covenants that it shall take no action or fail
to comply with any applicable state or federal statute or law, and any
regulations, rules and orders promulgated thereunder, presently existing or
promulgated after the Closing Date, which the omission to act or failure to
comply with, would result in MPI or MFI or EMC losing its right to compensation
or financial assistance from any applicable state or federal underground
storage tank trust fund. EMC further agrees on the Closing Date to execute and
deliver Underground Storage Tank Notifications for filing with the Department
or other responsible governmental agency to show that MPI or MFI is no longer
the "owner and/or operator" and that EMC is the new "owner and/or operator", as
such terms are defined under applicable federal, state and local laws, rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder. In the event EMC's actions, or failure
to comply or act, results in the Stations being suspended, deleted, declared
ineligible or removed from any applicable underground storage tank trust

50
<PAGE> 59
fund or reimbursement program, EMC agrees to additionally indemnify MPI or MFI
under Article XIII for lost compensation for such remediation costs, expenses,
claims and damages.

14.2.18 Disclosure Documents. To the extent required by state law, on
or before fifteen (15) days before Closing MFI or MPI shall deliver to EMC an
environmental disclosure document for each property where one is required by
applicable law or regulation. EMC, MPI and MFI expressly waive any requirement
that such disclosure documents be delivered and received in a period greater
than such fifteen (15) day time limit. The disclosure document shall be
prepared in accordance with applicable law or regulation and shall include a
discussion of any obligation under Applicable Law to register underground
storage tanks.

as such exist as of the Closing Date. Such remedy shall not otherwise modify
any obligations under Articles XIV or XXIII.

portion of the Motor Fuel Assets in to compliance with the appropriate law or
regulation as such exist as of the Closing Date. Such remedy shall not
otherwise modify any obligations under Articles XIV or XXIII.

of the claim or action. The party obligated to assume the defense thereof shall
promptly assume the defense or settlement of any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding; provided, however, that: (i) the defending party shall cooperate
and communicate

62
<PAGE> 71
with the other party as to significant developments in the matters being

ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES

PURPOSE: The purpose of this exhibit is to augment and amplify the Phase I and
Phase II requirements set forth in the text of the Agreement. To the maximum
extent possible, EPC, EMC, MNGL, MPI, and MFI and their respective consultants
are to work together in an expeditious, cost effective, professional manner to
properly assess the environmental conditions of the Land and the Stations. The
parties will utilize standard industry practices, those practices that may be
legally required, and their best professional judgment in conducting the
assessments.

ASTM STANDARDS: The parties recognize the ASTM Standards on Environmental Site
Assessments for Commercial Real Estate, particularly ASTM Standard E 1527-93
"Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental
Site Assessment Process" as providing the framework for the Phase I assessments
of the Land and the Stations. The environmental representatives of the
parties, along with their respective environmental consultants, will work
together to ensure that all necessary aspects of the ASTM Standards are
incorporated into the Phase I assessments of the Land and the Stations.

PHASE I ASSESSMENTS: In addition to the ASTM Standards, the following concepts
will be incorporated into the Phase I assessments of the Land and the Stations:

1. A review of the applicable federal, state, and local governmental
documentation pertaining to the real property at the Land and the Stations;

2. A review of the applicable federal, state, and local governmental
documentation pertaining to the real property adjacent to or in the vicinity of
the Land and the Stations that may pose a source of offsite contamination to
the Land and the Stations;

3. A review of the operations conducted at the real property identified in 1
and 2 above. This review should specifically include the review of any
environmental operating, treatment, storage, or disposal permits for any media;

4. A review of the past uses of the real property identified in 1 and 2 above;
and

5. A review of any current environmental remediation at the Land and the
Stations.

PHASE II ASSESSMENTS: The primary purpose of the Phase II assessment will be
to adequately define the lateral and vertical extent of any Hydrocarbon and
Hazardous Materials in the soil and the groundwater at the Land and the
Stations. The Phase II assessment requirements will be tailored for each
individual piece of real property comprising the Land and the Stations after a
review by the parties of the results of the Phase I assessments for the
properties. The environmental representatives for the parties and their
respective environmental consultants will work together to determine what Phase
II assessment work needs to be done for a particular piece of real property at
the Land and the Stations. The parties may rely on assessment and remediation
work done to date by any of the parties or their agents at a particular piece
of real property in determining what further Phase II assessment work needs to
be done.

The following concepts will be included in the Phase II assessments:

1. The taking of soil samples, the drilling of groundwater test wells, and the
installation of groundwater monitoring wells (if indicated) in those areas
identified by the parties as needing investigation for Hydrocarbon and/or
Hazardous Materials;
<PAGE> 429

2. The investigation of all current and former underground storage tank
batteries on the Land and the Stations, unless said batteries have been
previously investigated to the satisfaction of the parties;

3. The utilization of certified laboratories for all samples; and

4. The sampling and testing of all class V injection wells.

LEGAL OPINION, COUNSEL FOR MNGL

_____________, 1994

Emro Propane Company
500 Speedway Dr.
Enon, OH 45323

Gentlemen:

I have acted as counsel to MAPCO Natural Gas Liquids Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("MNGL"), and have been requested to provide you with the opinion
called for by Section 16.4 of the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of
_____________, 1994 (the "Agreement"), by and between Emro Propane Company
("EPC"), Emro Marketing Company ("EMC") and MNGL, MAPCO Petroleum Inc. ("MPI"),
and MAPCO Florida Inc. ("MFI"). Capitalized terms used herein without
definition have the respective meanings set forth in the Agreement.

I have examined and relied upon the original, or copies of certified or
otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of the Agreement, and all other
agreements, instruments and certificates executed and delivered in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereunder. I have also
reviewed and relied upon certificates of officers of MNGL as to factual
matters, certificates of public officials, and such other instruments,
documents and agreements as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below. In such examination, I have assumed (a) as to questions of
fact, the accuracy of all representations and certifications of MNGL set forth
in the Agreement, or in any other instrument, agreement or certificate issued
or delivered by them in connection therewith or in connection with the issuance
of this opinion, (b) the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all
documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity with the originals
of all documents submitted to me as copies, and (c) the due authorization,
execution and delivery of the Agreement and any other instrument, agreement or
certificate issued or delivered in connection therewith, by EPC and EMC.

The opinions expressed below are subject to the qualifications that enforcement
of any agreement or instrument referred to herein may be subject to, or limited
by (i) the effect of insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization and other laws
affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights, and (ii) the
availability of injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable
remedies.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

1. MNGL is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and is duly qualified to
do business in all jurisdictions in which the ownership of its properties or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, and where the
failure to be so qualified could be expected to have a material adverse effect
on MNGL's ability to complete the transaction contemplated in the Agreement.

2. No provisions of the MNGL's Articles of Incorporation and any
amendments thereto, by-laws and any amendments thereto, minutes or share
certificates, or of any contracts of which I have knowledge to which MNGL is a
party or by which it is otherwise bound prevents MNGL from complying with its
obligations under the Agreement.

LEGAL OPINION, COUNSEL FOR MPI & MFI

_____________, 1994

Emro Marketing Company
500 Speedway Dr.
Enon, OH 45323

Gentlemen:

I have acted as counsel to MAPCO Petroleum Inc. ("MPI") and MAPCO Florida Inc.
("MFI")., Delaware corporations, and have been requested to provide you with
the opinion called for by Section 17.4 of the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated
as of August 3, 1994 (the "Agreement"), by and between Emro Propane Company
("EPC"), Emro Marketing Company ("EMC") and MAPCO Natural Gas Liquids Inc.
("MNGL"), MPI and MFI. Capitalized terms used herein without definition have
the respective meanings set forth in the Agreement.

I have examined and relied upon the original, or copies of certified or
otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of the Agreement, and all other
agreements, instruments and certificates executed and delivered in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereunder. I have also
reviewed and relied upon certificates of officers of MPI and MFI as to factual
matters, certificates of public officials, and such other instruments,
documents and agreements as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below. In such examination, I have assumed (a) as to questions of
fact, the accuracy of all representations and certifications of MPI and MFI set
forth in the Agreement, or in any other instrument, agreement or certificate
issued or delivered by them in connection therewith or in connection with the
issuance of this opinion, (b) the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity
with the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies, and (c) the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Agreement and any other
instrument, agreement or certificate issued or delivered in connection
therewith, by EPC and EMC.

The opinions expressed below are subject to the qualifications that enforcement
of any agreement or instrument referred to herein may be subject to, or limited
by (i) the effect of insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization and other laws
affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights, and (ii) the
availability of injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable
remedies.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

1. MPI and MFI are corporations duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, have the
corporate power to own or lease their properties and assets and to carry on the
operation of the Motor Fuel Assets as now being conducted, and is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing in all states in which
ownership or possession of its properties or the nature of its activities in
connection with the Motor Fuel Assets requires such qualification, except where
the failure to do so qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the
Motor Fuel Assets.

2. No provisions of MPI's or MFI's Articles of Incorporation and
any amendments thereto, by-laws and any amendments thereto, minutes or share
certificates, or of any contracts of which I have knowledge to which MPI or MFI
is a party or by which they are otherwise bound prevents MPI and MFI from
complying with its obligations under the Agreement.
<PAGE> 436

3. No approval, authorization, consent or other order or action
of or filing or registration with any court, administrative agency or other
governmental authority, other than that previously obtained in connection with
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, is required by or
with respect to MPI or MFI for the Closing of the Agreement and delivery of the
instruments required thereby by MPI and MFI.

4. MPI and MFI have full corporate power and authority to enter
into the Agreement and to consummate the transaction contemplated thereby. The
execution of the Agreement and all of the instruments executed by MPI or MFI
and delivered to EMC on the Closing Date are duly authorized acts of MPI or
MFI, constitute valid and binding obligations of MPI or MFI in accordance with
their terms, and are effective to vest in EMC all of the rights, title and
interest of MPI and MFI in the Motor Fuel Assets and contract and liabilities
to be conveyed by MPI or MFI hereby.

5. The execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement and
the other instruments and agreements delivered at the Closing by MPI and MFI do
not violate any law and do not conflict with or result in a breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which with the giving of notice, or lapse of
time, or both would become a default) under or pursuant to the Articles of
Incorporation or by-laws of MPI or MFI or any material indenture, mortgage,
lease, contract, agreement or other instrument of which I have knowledge to
which MPI or MFI is a party or by which it may be bound or affected.

The foregoing opinion is delivered solely to you, and only you shall be
entitled to rely thereon.

LEGAL OPINION, COUNSEL FOR EPC & EMC

_____________, 1994

MAPCO Natural Gas Liquids Inc.
MAPCO Petroleum Inc.
MAPCO Florida Inc.
1800 South Baltimore St.
Tulsa, OK 74101

Gentlemen:

I have acted as counsel to Emro Propane Company, a Michigan corporation
("EPC"), and to Emro Marketing Company, an Ohio corporation ("EMC"), and have
been requested to provide you with the opinion called for by Sections 18.4 and
19.4 of the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of _____________, 1994 (the
"Agreement"), by and between EPC, EMC and MAPCO Natural Gas Liquids Inc.
("MNGL"), MAPCO Petroleum Inc. ("MPI"), and MAPCO Florida Inc. ("MFI"), and
with Thermogas Company ("TGAS") as the permitted assign of MNGL. Capitalized
terms used herein without definition have the respective meanings set forth in
the Agreement.

I have examined and relied upon the original, or copies of certified or
otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of the Agreement, and all other
agreements, instruments and certificates executed and delivered in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereunder. I have also
reviewed and relied upon certificates of officers of EPC and EMC as to factual
matters, certificates of public officials, and such other instruments,
documents and agreements as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below. In such examination, I have assumed (a) as to questions of
fact, the accuracy of all representations and certifications of the EPC and EMC
set forth in the Agreement, or in any other instrument, agreement or
certificate issued or delivered by them in connection therewith or in
connection with the issuance of this opinion, (b) the genuineness of all
signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and
the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies,
and (c) the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Agreement and any
other instrument, agreement or certificate issued or delivered in connection
therewith, by MNGL, TGAS, MPI and MFI.

The opinions expressed below are subject to the qualifications that enforcement
of any agreement or instrument referred to herein may be subject to, or limited
by (i) the effect of insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization and other laws
affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights, and (ii) the
availability of
<PAGE> 439
injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable remedies.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

1. EPC is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Michigan, has the corporate power
to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on the Business as now
being conducted, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and in good
standing in all states in which ownership or possession of its properties or
the nature of its activities in connection with the Business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to do so qualify would not have a
material adverse effect on the Business.

2. No provisions of EPC's Articles of Incorporation and any
amendments thereto, by-laws and any amendments thereto, minutes or share
certificates, or of any contracts of which I have knowledge to which EPC is a
party or by which it is otherwise bound prevents EPC from complying with its
obligations under the Agreement.

3. EMC is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and is duly qualified to
do business in all jurisdictions in which the ownership of its properties or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, and where the
failure to be so qualified could be expected to have a material adverse effect
on EMC's ability to complete the transaction contemplated in the Agreement.

4. No provisions of the EMC's Articles of Incorporation and any
amendments thereto, by-laws and any amendments thereto, minutes or share
certificates, or of any contracts of which I have knowledge to which EMC is a
party or by which it is otherwise bound prevents EMC from complying with its
obligations under the Agreement.

5. No approval, authorization, consent or other order or action
of or filing or registration with any court, administrative agency or other
governmental authority, other than that previously obtained in connection with
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, is required by or
with respect to EPC or EMC for the Closing of the Agreement and delivery of the
instruments required thereby by EPC or EMC.

6. EPC has full corporate power and authority to enter into the
Agreement and to consummate the transaction contemplated thereby. The
execution of the Agreement and all of the instruments executed by EPC and
delivered to TGAS on the Closing Date are duly authorized acts of EPC,
constitute valid and binding obligations of EPC in accordance with their terms,
and are effective to vest in TGAS all of the rights, title and interest of EPC
in the Assets and Assumed Liabilities to be conveyed by EPC hereby.
<PAGE> 440
7. EMC has full corporate power and authority to enter into the
Agreement and to consummate the transaction contemplated thereby. The
execution of the Agreement and all of the instruments executed by EMC and
delivered to MPI or MFI on the Closing Date are duly authorized acts of EMC,
constitute valid and binding obligations of EMC in accordance with their terms.

8. The execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement and
the other instruments and agreements delivered at the Closing by EPC and EMC do
not violate any law and do not conflict with or result in a breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which with the giving of notice, or lapse of
time, or both would become a default) under or pursuant to the Articles of
Incorporation or by-laws of EPC or EMC or any material indenture, mortgage,
lease, contract, agreement or other instrument of which I have knowledge to
which EPC or EMC is a party or by which it may be bound or affected, or result
in the creation of a lien or encumbrance on any of the property of assets of
EPC.

The foregoing opinion is delivered solely to you, and only you shall be
entitled to rely thereon.
