Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On August 3, 1994, Quaker State entered into separate agreements to
acquire Westland Oil Company, Inc. and the Specialty Oil Companies, all of
Shreveport, Louisiana. Westland Oil Company, Inc. and the Specialty Oil
Companies are engaged in the sale and distribution of motor oils, lubricants,
greases and antifreeze, the blending, packaging, sale and distribution of
private label lubricants, antifreeze and greases and the collection and
transportation of used motor oil.

The acquisition of Westland Oil Company, Inc. and the Specialty Oil
Companies was completed on September 30, 1994. All of the stock of Westland
Oil Company, Inc. was acquired by Quaker State from L. David Myatt, Dennis M.
Myatt, Jr., Dennis M. Myatt, III, other members of the Myatt family and various
trusts created for the benefit of members of the Myatt family in exchange for
4,000,000 shares of Quaker State's Capital Stock. The Specialty Oil Companies
(four separate companies controlled by members of the Myatt family) were
acquired by cash merger with the Specialty Oil Companies merging into a newly
formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Quaker State for $19,500,000. Quaker State
also purchased certain equipment used by the acquired companies from Moon
Realty, a Louisiana partnership controlled by L. David Myatt and Dennis M.
Myatt, Jr. for approximately $1,500,000. The indebtedness of the acquired
companies at the time of closing was approximately $42,000,000 (of which
approximately $22,000,000 was satisfied by Quaker State at the time of
closing). The business combination will be accounted for by the purchase
method. 

The consideration in the transaction was determined under a negotiated
Stock Purchase Agreement, a negotiated Agreement and Plan of Merger, and under a
negotiated Agreement to Buy and Sell related to certain assets of Moon Realty. 
The Agreement to Buy and Sell also provides for the purchase by Quaker
State of certain real property used in the acquired companies' operations, for
$9,000,000, with the purchase and sale to be completed at a later date subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent.

On September 29, 1994, L. David Myatt was elected Vice Chairman and a
Director of Quaker State and President and Chief Executive Officer of its Motor
Oil Division effective as of the closing and at the closing entered into an
employment agreement with Quaker State. Prior to completion of the
transaction, the Specialty Oil Companies were parties to distributor agreements
with Quaker State under which the Specialty Oil Companies distributed Quaker
State products in certain designated geographic areas. There is no other
material relationship between any of the selling parties and Quaker State or
any of its affiliates, directors, or officers.

The source of the funds used for the acquisition was the proceeds of the
sale of Quaker State's former subsidiary Heritage Insurance Group, Inc., which
disposition was concluded on August 31, 1994 (see Quaker State's current report
on Form 8-K filed on September 15, 1994).

Certain of the assets acquired by Quaker State included equipment used
in the acquired companies' businesses of blending and packaging motor oil,
lubricants and antifreeze, distributing motor oil, lubricants and other
products, and collecting and transporting used motor oil and oil filters.
Quaker State intends to continue the use of these assets consistent with the
prior use of these assets.

operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification and being in
good standing necessary, other than where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing would not, when taken together with all other such failures, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has no subsidiaries, and there
are no partnerships or joint venture arrangements or other business entities in
which the Company owns an equity interest. The Company Disclosure Schedule

whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or

Act) in connection with evaluating the merits and risks of this Agreement, the
Exchange and the issuance to such Stockholder of Parent Common Stock pursuant

"Disclosure Information") and no person has made any representations or
warranties of any kind or nature to induce such Stockholder to enter into this
Agreement except as set forth in the written Disclosure Information. Such
Stockholder acknowledges that L. David Myatt received additional information
with respect to Parent in connection with the negotiation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

-4-
<PAGE> 9
(c) Such Stockholder understands that the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued to such Stockholder as a result of the Exchange will not be
registered under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law and
that, as a result, such shares of Parent Common Stock may be sold by such
Stockholder only pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act or an exemption from such registration requirements, if
available, and in compliance with applicable state securities laws and that
certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock will contain an
appropriate legend to the effect of the foregoing and that such Stockholder
will be entering into as of the Closing Date a Registration Rights Agreement
(as defined in Section 5.1 hereof), which agreement contains certain
restrictions on transfers and acquisitions of additional shares of Parent
Common Stock by the Stockholders.

(d) Such Stockholder and the Purchaser Representative have had the
opportunity at a reasonable time prior to the date of this Agreement to ask
questions concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement of
representatives of the Company and its financial advisor and Parent and to
obtain any additional information that Parent possesses or can acquire without
unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to verify the accuracy of the
information provided as set forth in Section 2.4(b) hereof.

(e) Such Stockholder and the Purchaser Representative have made an
independent investigation of the pertinent facts relating to the Exchange, have
reviewed carefully the terms of this Agreement and the information furnished to
such Stockholder and the Purchaser Representative (including the Disclosure
Information) to the extent each such person deems necessary to be fully
informed with respect thereto and understand the nature of an investment in the
Parent Common Stock.

(f) Such Stockholder has, or such Stockholder and the Purchaser
Representative together have, such knowledge and experience in financial,
investment and business matters that such Stockholder is, or such Stockholder
and the Purchaser Representative together are, capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of an investment in the Parent Common Stock and protecting such
Stockholder's interests in connection with an investment in Parent Common
Stock.

-5-
<PAGE> 10
present or existing or contemplated future need to dispose of all or any
portion of his, her or its interest in Parent Shares to satisfy any existing or
contemplated undertaking, need or indebtedness, and has assets or sources of
income that, taken together, are more than sufficient so that such Stockholder
can bear the risk of the loss of his, her or its entire investment in Parent
Common Stock.

(h) Such Stockholder is acquiring an interest in Parent Common Stock for
his, her or its own account, as a principal, for investment, and not with a

sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of such interest. Such Stockholder
understands that the shares of Parent Common Stock he, she or it is acquiring
as a result of the Exchange have not been registered under the Securities Act
or any state securities laws by reason of specific exemptions under the
provisions thereof that depend in part upon the representations and warranties
made by such Stockholder in this Agreement. Such Stockholder understands that
Parent is relying upon such Stockholder's representations and warranties and
agreements contained in this Agreement for the purpose of determining whether
the Exchange meets the requirements for such exemptions. Such Stockholder
understands that he, she or it must bear the economic risks of such
Stockholder's investment in Parent Common Stock for an indefinite period of
time.

deficiency or refund litigation with respect to any Taxes of the Company and
(e) all liabilities for Taxes of the Company that are or will become due or
payable with respect to periods covered by the financial statements referred to
in Section 2.10 hereof have been paid or adequately reserved for on such
financial statements. The Company has not executed an extension or waiver of
any statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any material Tax

SECTION 2.20 Insurance. Section 2.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule

effect, is with responsible insurance carriers and is in an amount and of a
scope customary for persons engaged in businesses and having assets similar to
those of the Company. The Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each
insurance policy of the Company with respect to which premiums payable are
determined from the amount of actual claims paid by the insurer during the
policy year ("Retrospective Policies"). With regard to any such Retrospective
Policy, the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete
list of the dollar amount of each actual claim made under such Retrospective

environmental contamination including, but not limited to, all Laws governing
the generation, use, collection, treatment, storage, transportation, recovery,
removal, discharge or disposal of Hazardous Substances and all Laws with regard
to record-keeping, notification and reporting requirements respecting Hazardous
Substances. For purposes of this Section 2.23, "substantial compliance" shall
mean compliance, except to the

-15-
<PAGE> 20
extent that failure to comply would not have or result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

The Company is not subject to any order or decree of and has not, within the

biphenyls and asbestos.

property rights, applications therefor and licenses or other rights in respect

notice from any other person pertaining to or challenging the right of the
Company to use any Intellectual Property or any trade secrets, proprietary

Company Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 2.25 Disclosure. This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule
and any certificate attached hereto or delivered in accordance with the terms

contemplated by this Agreement, when taken together, do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements contained herein and/or therein not misleading.

SECTION 2.26 Miscellaneous. (a) There is no plan or intention by any
Stockholder to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of a number of Parent Shares
that would reduce the Stockholders' ownership of Parent Shares to a number of
Parent Shares having a value, as of the Closing Date, less than 50 percent of
the value of all of the Parent Shares.

-16-
<PAGE> 21
(b) The Company and the Stockholders will each pay their respective
expenses, if any, other than Reorganization Expenses, incurred in connection
with the Exchange.

(f) At the time of the Exchange, the Company will not have outstanding any
warrants, options or convertible securities or any other type of right pursuant
to which any person could acquire capital stock in the Company that, if
exercised or converted, would affect Parent's acquisition or retention of
control of the Company, as defined in Section 368(c) of the Code.

(g) The Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or
similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

(h) The fair market value of the assets of the Company on the Closing Date

(i) None of the compensation received by any employees of the Company will

persons; none of the Parent Shares received by any employees of the Company
will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment agreement
with the Company or Parent; and the compensation paid by Parent to any
employees of the Company will be commensurate with amounts paid to similarly
situated third parties bargaining at arms-length for similar services. None of
the compensation to be received in connection with the transactions or matters
referenced in Section 5.8 hereof will be separate consideration for, or
allocable in any way to, any Company Shares.

(j) The liabilities of the Company either (i) were incurred by the Company
in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) were incurred by the Company in
connection with the Special AAA Distribution, or (iii) are Reorganization
Expenses.

-17-

Stockholder in exchange for Company Shares. Specifically, no consideration
(including without limitation payments in cash or kind, assumption of
liabilities, or the grant of indemnification rights) flowing to the
Stockholders (in their capacities as such or otherwise) from Parent or any
Affiliate and reflected in this Agreement, or in any agreement executed
contemporaneously herewith, or in the various exhibits or schedules hereto or
thereto is allocable in whole or part to, or constitutes separate consideration
to any extent for, the Company Shares.

(and not primary} liabilities of certain of the Stockholders which were given
by them in the ordinary course to secure certain of the Company's obligations
to its lenders for debt incurred in the ordinary course of the Company's
business. It is the custom of such lenders, based upon a long course of dealing
with the Company and its Affiliates, to require guaranties of such
Stockholders, and such guaranties are consistent in form and substance with
the guaranties which such lenders have traditionally required to be given by
such Stockholders.

ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Stockholders prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure
Schedule"), which shall identify exceptions by specific section references,
Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Stockholders that:

SECTION 3.1 Organization and Qualification. Parent is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and
Parent is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification and being in
good standing necessary, other than where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing would not, when taken together with all other such failures, have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth in
Section 3.1 a complete and accurate list of the jurisdictions in which Parent
is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation.

SECTION 3.2 Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. Parent has heretofore
furnished to the Agent a complete and correct copy

of 37,500,000 shares of Parent Common Stock. As of June 30, 1994: (a)
27,338,746 shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of
which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to preemptive rights created by statute, Parent's Certificate of
Incorporation or By-Laws or any agreement to which Parent is a party or is
bound; (b) 6,696 shares of Parent Common Stock were held in the treasury of
Parent; and (c) 1,056,184 shares of Parent Common Stock were reserved for
future issuance pursuant to stock options issued to certain officers, employees

registration rights), agreements, restrictions on transfer, arrangements or
commitments of any character to which Parent is a party relating to the issued
or unissued capital stock of, or other equity interests in, Parent or
obligating Parent to grant, issue or sell any shares of the capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, Parent, by sale, lease, license or otherwise,
except (i) as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.6

proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the Stockholders, constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of Parent enforceable against Parent in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited or affected by (a)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation, arrangement,
fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws (including

and delivery of this Agreement by Parent does not, and the performance by
Parent of its obligations hereunder will not, (i) conflict with, breach or

-28-
<PAGE> 33
separate any portion of the business or assets of the Company; or (C) impose
any limitation on the ability of Parent or any of its respective Affiliates or
subsidiaries to own or operate the business and operations of the Company. The
Agent and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each shall consult with the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information as advised by
independent counsel in writing, all the information relating to the Company or
Parent and any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates which are to
appear in any filing to be made with, or written materials to be submitted to,
any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable laws relating to the

shall, and the Stockholders shall cause the Company to, furnish all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules
and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Stockholders and Parent shall, and the Stockholders shall cause the
Company to, cooperate and use their reasonable commercial efforts to contest
and resist any action, including legislative, administrative or judicial
action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) (an "Order") that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or
prohibits the consummation of the Exchange or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, by vigorously
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all
available legislative action.

(c) Parent shall, and the Stockholders shall cause the Company to, (i) give
any notices to third parties, and use their reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain all third party consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations and orders
required in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Exchange; and (ii) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as

SECTION 5.3 Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law, Parent on the one hand shall, and the Stockholders shall cause the Company
on the other hand to, consult with each other before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the Exchange and
shall

-29-
<PAGE> 34
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation.

SECTION 5.4 NYSE Listing. Parent shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
cause the Parent Shares to be issued in the Exchange to be approved for listing
on the NYSE prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.5 Indemnification of Directors and Officers. (a) From and after
the Closing Date, Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, defend, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now or
who has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing Date an officer or director of the Company (each, an "Indemnitee" and,
collectively, the "Indemnitees") against all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, based on or arising out of the fact that such
person is or was such an officer or director, whether pertaining to any matter
existing or occurring on or prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, on or after the Closing Date other than any such costs,
expenses, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation based on any action of or any failure to act by such director or
officer with respect to any shareholder or former shareholder of the Company or
any of his or its legal representatives, successors or heirs (including with
respect to this Agreement, the Exchange or the other transactions contemplated
hereby), including with respect to their ownership, acquisition or disposition
of Company Shares (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"). Parent shall
be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume
the defense of any action with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities, with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee; provided, however, that if
any Indemnitee believes, based upon the written advice of independent counsel,
that, by reason of an actual or potential conflict of interest, it is advisable
for such Indemnitee to be represented by separate counsel, or if Parent shall
fail to assume responsibility for such defense, such Indemnitee may retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent who will represent such Indemnitee,
and Parent shall pay all reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel
promptly as statements therefor are received to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law upon receipt of any undertaking contemplated by Section 145(e)
of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Indemnitees and Parent shall
cooperate with each other and use all reasonable efforts to

-30-
<PAGE> 35
assist each other in the vigorous defense of any such matter; provided,
however, that Parent shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim
effected without the written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 5.5, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Parent (but the failure to be so notified
by an Indemnitee shall not relieve Parent from any liability that it may have
under this Section 5.5 except to the extent such failure prejudices Parent).
Parent shall be required to pay for only one law firm selected by the
Indemnitees as a group in accordance with the foregoing provisions with respect
to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict in any significant issue between the positions of any two
or more Indemnitees as described in the written advice of independent counsel.

(b) Nothing in this Section 5.5 shall give rise to any right to
indemnification for the malfeasance or willful misfeasance of any person. This
Section 5.5 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnitee, his heirs and his representatives.

SECTION 5.6 Company Employees Benefits. Until the second anniversary of
the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company not to take any action that
would result in any reduction in the benefits currently payable to any employee
of the Company under any Benefit Plan, except to the extent required by
applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the Closing
Date, Parent may cause the Company to modify any Benefit Plan or the accrual of
benefits thereunder, or to terminate any Benefit Plan or the accrual of
benefits thereunder and enroll the employees of the Company into an equivalent
employee benefit plan of Parent, so long as the aggregate benefits the
employees of the Company would receive under the employee benefits plans that
they would be enrolled in after such actions are at least substantially
equivalent to the aggregate benefits such employees were receiving prior to
such actions. If all Benefit Plans are modified or terminated as provided in
the immediately preceding sentence, the obligations of Parent set forth in the
first sentence of this Section 5.6 shall terminate.

SECTION 5.7 Motor Oil Division. As of the Closing Date, L. David Myatt
shall be appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Parent Motor Oil Division
with the headquarters of the Parent Motor Oil Division located in Shreveport,
Louisiana.

The obligations of each party hereto to effect the Exchange shall be subject to
the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:

(a) No Order. No Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) which is in effect or which is pending and which has
a reasonable probability of making the Exchange illegal or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Exchange or which imposes any material
restrictions on Parent or the Company with respect to their business operations
either prior to or subsequent to the Exchange.

(b) Government Approvals; HSR Act. All authorizations, consents, orders or
approvals of, or declarations, registrations, or filings with, or expiration of
waiting periods imposed by, any Government Entity necessary for the

shall have expired or been terminated without any indication by the Federal
Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice that it intends to take any
further action with respect thereto.

(c) Reorganization Status. There shall have been no material change, since
the date of this Agreement, in the law (including the

-35-
<PAGE> 40
Code, any regulations promulgated thereunder, any rulings, revenue procedures
or other authority issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury or the IRS that
constitute an "administrative pronouncement" under Treasury Regulation Section
301.6661-3(b)(2), and any judicial decisions) that could reasonably be expected
to affect adversely the eligibility of the Exchange for treatment as a tax-free
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Code.

(d) Merger Agreement. The mergers contemplated by that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated the date hereof among Specialty Oil Company, Inc.-I,

made on and as of the Closing Date (without regard to any qualification of such
representations or warranties as to any person's knowledge), except that those
representations and warranties which address matters only as of a particular
date shall only need to remain true and correct as of such date; provided,
however, that the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct in all material respects on the appropriate dates shall not be a
condition to Parent's obligations to effect the Exchange unless such failures
in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to result in Damages (as defined
in Section 8.2) in excess of $6,000,000. Parent shall have received a
certificate from each Stockholder to such effect.

(b) Agreements and Covenants. The Stockholders shall have performed or

which the Credit Line Apportionment is to be consummated shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent; provided, however, the foregoing condition shall be
deemed satisfied if the Credit Line Apportionment (i) works a separation of the
existing credit line such that the Company's liability in respect of the debt
which is affected by the Credit Line Apportionment corresponds in all material
respects to the amount of its existing intercompany liability in respect of
funds drawn by the Company and the other obligors under the debt which is
affected by the Credit Line Apportionment prior to the Credit Line
Apportionment and (ii) is upon commercially reasonable terms.

(g) Delivery of all Company Shares. All of the Stockholders shall have
complied with the requirements of Section 1.1 hereof so that certificates
representing all Company Shares are presented at the closing on the Closing
Date.

Parent contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
respects as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as though made on and

representations and warranties which address matters only as of a particular
date shall only need to remain true and correct as of such date; provided,

certificate of the President and Chief Financial Officer of Parent to that
effect.

(b) Agreements and Covenants. Parent shall have performed or complied in
all material respects with all agreements and covenants required by this
Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the Closing
Date. The Stockholders shall have received a certificate of the President and

Vinson & Elkins LLP, special tax counsel to counsel to the Stockholders, dated
as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the Exchange will be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and that the Company and Parent will each be a party to that
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. In rendering

alleged statement) or omission (or alleged omission) was made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information specifically furnished by Parent or its
representatives for use in the Disclosure Information.

(b) Parent shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless each Stockholder
against and in respect of any claim made by such Stockholder that any statement
in the Disclosure Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information specifically furnished by Parent or its representatives for use in
the Disclosure Information was an untrue statement of a material fact or that
any omission from the Disclosure Information made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information specifically furnished by Parent or its
representatives for use in the Disclosure Information was an omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein (in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading.

(c) The Stockholders shall have no right to seek contribution from the
Company or Parent in the event that they are required to make any payments
under this Article 8. Each Stockholder shall have the right to seek
contribution from each other Stockholder in the event that he, she or it is
required to make any payments under Section 8.3(a); provided, however, that
such right of contribution shall be based solely upon the relative aggregate
amounts that the Stockholders received on account of the Exchange.

SECTION 8.4 Indemnification by Parent. Parent shall indemnify, defend, save
and hold harmless any Stockholder against and in respect of all Damages
(including any Tax Loss) incurred by such Stockholder arising out of or
otherwise related to (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation
or warranty made by Parent in Article 3 (other than in Section 3.10) or in any
certificate or document furnished by Parent to the Stockholders pursuant to
this Agreement or (b) the nonperformance or breach of any covenant or agreement
of Parent contained in this Agreement.

-42-
<PAGE> 47
There shall be no liability for indemnification from Parent under any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein unless the
aggregate amount of Damages incurred by all Stockholders exceeds $5,000,000
(the "Parent Basket Amount"); provided, that any Parent liability for such
Damages shall be limited to the amount of Damages in excess of the Parent
Basket Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
there shall be no liability for indemnification from Parent for any breach of,
or failure to comply with, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein if such breach or failure to comply (i) has been waived by the
Stockholders on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) relates, directly or
indirectly, to any matters within the subject matter set forth in Section 3.10.

SECTION 8.5 Claims Against Indemnified Parties. (a) L. David Myatt has
been designated as the representative of the Stockholders (the "Stockholders
Representative") to whom claims or demands upon Stockholders for
indemnification under this Article 8 shall be made and who shall have certain
rights and responsibilities as set forth herein.

(b) If any Parent Indemnitee or any Stockholder (an "Indemnified Party")
believes that it or he has suffered or incurred or may suffer or incur any
Damages under this Article 8, such Indemnified Party shall so notify either
the Stockholders through the Stockholders Representative, the relevant
Stockholder or Parent (the "Indemnifying Party"), as appropriate, with
reasonable promptness and reasonable particularity in light of the
circumstances then existing. If any action at law or suit in equity is
instituted by or against a third party with respect to which any Indemnified
Party intends to claim any Damages, such Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of such action or suit. The failure of an
Indemnified Party to give any notice required by this Section 8.5 shall not
affect any of such party's rights under this Article 8 except to the extent
that such failure is actually prejudicial to the rights or obligations of the
Indemnifying Party.

(c) With respect to claims or demands by third parties, following receipt of
notice pursuant to Section 8.5(b) hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right at his, its or their own expense to undertake the defense of any such
claims or demands utilizing counsel selected by the Stockholders
Representative, the relevant Stockholder or Parent, as the case may be, and
approved by the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Any such undertaking of the defense of any such claims or demands by
or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party shall be an acknowledgment and agreement
that such claim or demand, if true, constitutes indemnifiable Damages. In the
event that the

-43-
<PAGE> 48
Indemnifying Party shall fail to give notice of their, its or his intention to
undertake the defense of any such claim or demand within 30 days after
receiving notice that it has been asserted or threatened, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to satisfy and discharge the same by payment, compromise
or otherwise.

(d) If an Indemnified Party believes it or he has incurred Damages which are
subject to indemnification under this Article 8 and do not involve a third
party claim or demand, it or he shall forward notice thereof to either the
Stockholders Representative, the relevant Stockholder or Parent as specified in
Section 8.5(b) hereof, and shall state the amount of Damages it or he believes
it or he has suffered, and shall provide, in reasonable detail the facts
alleged as the basis for such claim and the section or sections of this
Agreement alleged to have been violated (a "Damages Notice"). No later than
30 days after receipt of a Damages Notice from an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Indemnified
Party either a notice accepting such claim for Damages or a notice that the
Indemnifying Party disputes such claim for Damages. A notice by the
Stockholders Representative accepting a claim for Damages under Section 8.3(a)
shall be binding on all of the Stockholders. A failure to provide notice
disputing a claim for Damages within 30 days of receipt of a Damages Notice
shall be deemed acceptance of the relevant claim by the relevant Indemnifying
Party.

SECTION 8.6 Fees and Expenses. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, in the event of any dispute or controversy governed by this Article
8, the prevailing party in such dispute shall, in addition to any other
remedies such prevailing party may obtain in such dispute, be entitled to
recover from the other parties thereto all of its or his reasonable legal fees
and out-of-pocket costs incurred by such party in enforcing or defending its or
his rights hereunder.

SECTION 8.7 Fraud; Willful Breach. Any limitations set forth in this
Article 8 on the right of any party hereto to indemnification hereunder shall
not apply to the extent that Damages are incurred by such party as the result
of fraud or the willful breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or
covenant by another party to this Agreement.

reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, then subject to any
requirements of applicable law or stock exchange requirements, such payment
shall be made in shares of Parent Common Stock, with the number of such shares
to be calculated by dividing the amount owed by the closing sale price of
Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date, and each party shall provide all
reasonable cooperation to the others so as to effect the foregoing.

SECTION 9.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public

-49-
<PAGE> 54
SECTION 9.10 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive

laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of Parent
Sub with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall
continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth below. The name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be SO Acquisition Corp. or such other name as
Parent shall determine.

SECTION 1.2 Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after the

of, the applicable state's law (the date and time of the last of such filings
being the "Effective Time").

SECTION 1.3 Effect of the Mergers. At the Effective Time, the Mergers shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the applicable
states' corporate law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise specifically set
forth herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Parent Sub and the Companies shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of Parent Sub and the Companies shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws. At the Effective Time,
the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws of Parent Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.5 Directors and Officers. Immediately after consummation of the
Mergers, Parent shall take all necessary action so that Herbert M. Baum, Conrad
A. Conrad, L. David Myatt, William Grube and Dennis M. Myatt, Jr. shall be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of Specialty II immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their resignation, death or disqualification or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

<PAGE> 7
SECTION 1.6 Closing Date, Time and Place. The date on which the Mergers
shall be consummated is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date". The

ARTICLE 2

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.1 Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates. (a) By
virtue of the Mergers and without any action on the part of Parent, Parent Sub,
the Companies or the Shareholders:

(i) At the Effective Time, each share of (A) common stock, $100.00 per share
par value ("Specialty I Common Stock"), of Specialty I, (B) common stock, $1.00
per share par value ("Specialty II Common Stock"), of Specialty II, (C) common
stock, no par value ("Specialty III Common Stock"), of Specialty III, and (D)
common stock, no par value ("Specialty IV Common Stock"), of Specialty IV, in
each case, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Shares"), other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) hereof, shall be converted, subject to the provisions of this
Section 2.1, into the right to receive such amount of cash (the "Cash
Consideration"), as set forth on Schedule 2.1 hereto.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each share of Specialty I Common Stock, Specialty
II Common Stock, Specialty III Common Stock, and Specialty IV Common Stock
(collectively referred to herein as "Companies Common Stock" or, individually,
as the "Company's Common Stock"), held in the treasury of such Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished at
the Effective Time without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.

(iii) At the Effective Time, the shares of common stock, par value $.01 per
share ("Parent Sub Common Stock"), of Parent Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and as a
result of the Mergers and without any action on the part of the holder thereof
shall be converted into and thereafter constitute all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate that prior thereto represented Shares shall be entitled, upon
surrender thereof to Parent in the manner set

-3-
<PAGE> 8
forth in Section 2.1(c) hereof, to receive in exchange therefor, in accordance
with Section 2.1(a)(i) hereof and Schedule 2.1 hereto, certified funds equal to
the aggregate Cash Consideration into which the Shares so surrendered shall
have been converted as provided in Section 2.1(a)(i) hereof and Schedule 2.1
hereto. Until so surrendered, each such certificate that, prior to the
Effective Time, represented Shares shall be deemed from and after the Effective
Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends and
distributions declared on Companies Common Stock prior to the Effective Time,
to evidence solely the right to receive the aggregate Cash Consideration,
without interest thereon, into which such Shares shall have been converted
pursuant to this Section 2.1 and Schedule 2.1 hereto.

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent will deliver or cause to be delivered to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "Certificates"), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to a Certificate shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificate to Parent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such Certificate in exchange for cash. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to Parent together with such a letter of transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the terms thereof, and such other customary
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the aggregate
Cash Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(i) hereof and Schedule 2.1 hereto and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

(d) None of Parent, Surviving Corporation, the Companies or their transfer
agents shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable escheat or similar laws.

(e) All cash paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Companies Common Stock.

SECTION 2.2 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Companies shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Companies Common Stock on the records of
the Companies.

<PAGE> 9
SECTION 2.3 Additional Compensation. (a) If the Effective Time has not
occurred within 45 days after the date of the execution of this Agreement, the
Companies may declare dividends or make distributions to the Shareholders out
of the earnings of each Company accruing after the 45th day until the Effective
Time; provided, that the delay in excess of 45 days is not caused by any act
or failure to take any action of any Company or the Shareholders or those
acting on their behalf, or by any act or failure to act by one or more
governmental agencies (including the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission), but provided further, that the Companies shall be entitled
to declare dividends or make distributions to the Shareholders out of earnings
of each Company accruing after the 60th day after the date of the execution of
this Agreement if the Effective Time is delayed for 60 days or more for any
reason. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any delay in providing complete
information about the Companies and the Shareholders as requested by Parent in
order to make the required filings under the HSR Act (as defined in Section 3.5
hereof) with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
shall extend the 45-day and 60-day deadlines set forth herein by the number of
calendar days, commencing on the 10th day after the date of execution of this
Agreement, which are taken by the Companies or the Shareholders, as the case
may be, to supply all the information requested by Parent as necessary, in the
opinion of counsel for the Parent, to make such filings.

(b) If, as a result of the allocation of the Cash Consideration to the assets
of the Companies pursuant to Section 7.8 hereof, the Shareholders recognize
gain taxable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes in excess of
$500,000, then Parent shall pay to the appropriate Shareholders an amount equal
to 16.18% of the total recognized gain taxable as ordinary income for federal
income tax purposes.

ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANIES

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Companies to
Parent and Parent Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Companies
Disclosure Schedule"), which shall identify exceptions by specific section
references, the Companies hereby represent and warrant to Parent as follows:

SECTION 3.1 Organization and Qualification. Each Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has all requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as it is

-5-
<PAGE> 10
now being conducted and is duly qualified to do business and in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification and being in
good standing necessary, other than where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing would not, when taken together with all other such failures, have
a Companies Material Adverse Effect. Each Company has no subsidiaries, and
there are no partnerships or joint venture arrangements or other business
entities in which such Company owns an equity interest. The Companies
Disclosure Schedule sets forth in Section 3.1 a complete and accurate list of
the jurisdictions in which each Company is qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation.

SECTION 3.2 Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws. Each Company has
heretofore furnished to Parent complete and correct copies of the Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws of such Company, in each case as amended or restated
to date. Each Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of its
Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws, all of which are in full force and
effect.

SECTION 3.3 Capitalization. (a) The equity capitalization of each Company
is as set forth in Section 3.3 of the Companies Disclosure Schedule. All
Shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(b) Other than the Shares, there are not now, and at the Effective Time
there will not be, any (i) shares of capital stock or other equity securities
of any Company outstanding or (ii) outstanding options, warrants, scrip, rights
to subscribe for, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to,
or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of any
class of capital stock of any Company, or agreements, understandings or
arrangements to which any Company is a party, or by which any of them is or may
be bound, to issue additional shares of its capital stock or options, warrants,
scrip or rights to subscribe for, calls or commitment of any character
whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or
exchangeable for, any shares of any class of its capital stock. There are no
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (contingent or
otherwise) pursuant to which any person is or may be entitled to receive any
payment based on the revenues or earnings, or calculated in accordance
therewith, of any Company. There are no restrictions on transfer, voting
trusts, proxies or other agreements, arrangements or understandings to which
any Company is a party or by which any Company is bound with respect to any
shares of capital stock of any Company. All transactions in securities of any
Company effected by any Company have been

-6-
<PAGE> 11
effected in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and after
disclosure to the other parties to such transactions of all material facts
regarding the Companies.

SECTION 3.4 Authority. Each Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated by such Company. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
each Company and the consummation by such Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of such Company are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Board of Directors of each Company has determined that the consideration to
be received by its shareholders in the relevant Merger is fair to the holders
of such Company's Common Stock from a financial point of view and resolved to
recommend that the shareholders of such Company approve and adopt this
Agreement and approve such Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by Parent and Parent Sub, constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Company enforceable against such Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited or
affected by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
liquidation, arrangement, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance and other
similar laws (including court decisions) now or hereafter in effect and
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally or providing for the
relief of debtors, (b) the refusal of a particular court to grant equitable
remedies, including, without limitation, specific performance and injunctive
relief, and (c) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
remedies are sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

SECTION 3.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. (a) The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by each Company do not, and the performance by
such Company of its obligations hereunder will not, (i) conflict with or
violate the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of such Company, (ii) conflict
with, breach or violate any federal, state, foreign or local law, statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (collectively, "Laws")
in effect as of the date of this Agreement and applicable to such Company or by
which any of its properties or assets are bound, or (iii) result in any breach
of, constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, give to any other entity any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, require payment under,
or result in the creation of a lien or encumbrance

-7-
<PAGE> 12
on any of the properties or assets of such Company pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation to which such Company is a party or by which
such Company or any of its properties or assets is bound.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each Company do not, and
the performance by such Company of its obligations hereunder will not, require
such Company to obtain any consent, registration, approval, authorization or
permit of, to make any filing with, or to give notification to, any person,
including any governmental or regulatory authority, agency, court or
commission, domestic or foreign (collectively, "Governmental Entities"), based
on any Law or other requirement of any Governmental Entity in effect as of the
date of this Agreement, except under the applicable requirements, if any, of
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), and for the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by the laws of the states of Louisiana, Arkansas and Delaware.

SECTION 3.6 Permits; Compliance. As of the date of this Agreement, each
Company is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
permits, easements, variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals
and orders necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted (collectively, the "Company
Permits"), all of which are in full force and effect, and there is no action,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of such Company,

All of the Contracts are in full force and effect and no Company is in default
thereunder nor, to the knowledge of any Company, is any other party to any
Contract in default thereunder nor, to any Company's knowledge, does any

practicable each will consult with the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information as advised by
independent counsel in writing, all the information relating to the other
parties and any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates which are to
appear in any filing to be made with, or written materials to be submitted to,

Companies and Parent shall furnish all information required for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an "Order") that is in effect and that

<PAGE> 33

SECTION 7.2 Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law, Parent on the one hand and the Companies on the other hand shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public

SECTION 7.3 Indemnification of Directors and Officers. (a) From and after
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, defend, indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is now or who has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of any of the
Companies (each, an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the "Indemnitees") against
all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, based on or arising out of
the fact that such person is or was such an officer or director, whether
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
other than any such costs, expenses, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation based on any action of or any failure to act
by such director or officer with respect to any shareholder or former
shareholder of any Company or any of his or its legal representatives,
successors or heirs (including with respect to this Agreement, the Mergers or
the other transactions contemplated hereby), including with respect to their
ownership, acquisition or disposition of Shares (collectively, the "Indemnified
Liabilities"). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
participate in and, to the extent that they may wish, to assume the defense of
any action with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee; provided, however, that if any Indemnitee
believes, based upon the written advice of independent counsel, that, by

-29-
<PAGE> 34
reason of an actual or potential conflict of interest, it is advisable for such
Indemnitee to be represented by separate counsel, or if Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall fail to assume responsibility for such defense, such
Indemnitee may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent who will
represent such Indemnitee, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay
all reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel promptly as statements
therefor are received to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law upon
receipt of any undertaking contemplated by Section 145(e) of the Delaware
General Corporation Law. The Indemnitees and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with each other and use all reasonable efforts to
assist each other in the vigorous defense of any such matter; provided,
however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for
any settlement of any claim effected without the written consent of Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnitee wishing to
claim indemnification under this Section 7.3, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent (but
the failure to be so notified by an Indemnitee shall not relieve Parent from
any liability that it may have under this Section 7.3 except to the extent such
failure prejudices Parent). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to pay for only one law firm selected by the Indemnitees as a group in
accordance with the foregoing provisions with respect to each such matter
unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict
in any significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnitees
as described in the written advice of independent counsel.

(b) Nothing in this Section 7.3 shall give rise to any right to
indemnification for the malfeasance or willful misfeasance of any person. This
Section 7.3 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnitee, his heirs and his representatives.

SECTION 7.4 Obligations of Parent in Respect of Parent Sub. Parent shall
take all action necessary to cause Parent Sub to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Mergers on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

SECTION 7.5 Companies Employees Benefits. Until the second anniversary of
the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to take any
action that would result in any reduction in the benefits currently payable to
any employee of any Company under any Benefit Plan, except to the extent
required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after
the Closing Date, Parent may cause the Surviving Corporation to modify any
Benefit Plan or the accrual of benefits thereunder, or

-30-
<PAGE> 35
to terminate any Benefit Plan or the accrual of benefits thereunder and enroll
the employees of the Surviving Corporation into an equivalent employee benefit
plan of Parent, so long as the aggregate benefits the employees of the
Surviving Corporation would receive under the employee benefits plans that they
would be enrolled in after such actions are at least substantially equivalent
to the aggregate benefits such employees were receiving prior to such actions.
If all Benefit Plans are modified or terminated as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, the obligations of Parent set forth in the first sentence
of this Section 7.5 shall terminate.

SECTION 7.6 Indemnity Against Shareholder Liability for Companies' Debt. At
the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into agreements with L. David Myatt and
Dennis M. Myatt, Jr. to indemnify them, their heirs, successors and assigns
against any liability on or payments under any guaranty by either of them of
the Companies' obligations to the Companies' lenders, such indemnity to be
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto (the "Indemnity Agreement").

SECTION 7.7 Purchase of Scrip Dividend Notes. Immediately after the
Effective Time, Parent shall purchase the Scrip Dividend Notes from the
Shareholders for their full face value plus accrued interest to the Closing
Date, such purchase to be pursuant to an assignment of each such note
substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto (the "Note Assignment") which
shall be executed by the parties immediately prior to the Effective Time.

SECTION 7.8 Reporting of Allocation of Purchase Price. For federal income
tax reporting purposes and in accordance with the provisions of Section 1060 of

a cost allocation associated with the assets of the Companies. Once a cost
allocation has been agreed upon, Parent Sub and the Companies shall prepare and
file asset acquisition statements on Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, or any
similar form, with their federal income tax returns for the taxable year that
includes the Closing Date based upon the agreed allocation.

Section 7.9 Employment Agreements. On the Closing Date, Parent shall enter
into agreements with L. David Myatt and Dennis M. Myatt, substantially in the
form of Exhibits E and F hereto, respectively (the "Employment Agreements").

commercial efforts to enter into prior to the Closing Date an arbitration
agreement to resolve disputes relating to, or arising under, this Agreement.

knowledge), except that those representations and warranties which address
matters only as of a particular date shall only need to remain true and correct

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 10.1 Survival. All claims for damages made by the parties hereto by
virtue of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein or
in any certificate or document furnished pursuant hereto shall be made under,
and subject to the limitations set forth in, this Article 10. The
representations and warranties set forth and contained in Article 4 shall
survive indefinitely after the Effective Time. No other representations and
warranties in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. Only the
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement which by their terms must
survive the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time.

SECTION 10.2 Indemnification by the Shareholders. Each Shareholder shall,
severally and not jointly, indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless Parent
against and in respect of all claims, losses, expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) and damages (all such amounts
being hereinafter sometimes referred to as "Damages") incurred by Parent
relating to any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty
made by such Shareholder in Article 4 or in any certificate or document
furnished by such Shareholder in connection with such Article.

SECTION 10.3 Indemnification Based on Disclosure Obligations. (a) The
Shareholders shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend, save and hold
harmless Parent and its officers, directors and controlling persons (as defined
in the Exchange Act) and the Surviving Corporation (the "Parent Indemnities")
against and in respect of any claim made by any Shareholder based on any untrue
statement of a material fact (or alleged untrue statement of a material fact)
contained in the Disclosure Information or the omission (or alleged omission)
to state therein a material fact

-39-
<PAGE> 44
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading,
unless any such statement (or alleged statement) or omission (or alleged
omission) was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
specifically furnished by Parent or its representatives for use in the
Disclosure Information.

(b) Parent shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless each Shareholder
against and in respect of any claim made by such Shareholder that any statement
in the Disclosure Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information specifically furnished by Parent or its representatives for use in
the Disclosure Information was an untrue statement of a material fact or that
any omission from the Disclosure Information made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information specifically furnished by Parent or its
representatives for use in the Disclosure Information was an omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein (in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading.

(c) The Shareholders shall have no right to seek contribution from the
Companies or Parent in the event that they are required to make any payments
under this Article 10. Each Shareholder shall have the right to seek
contribution from each other Shareholder in the event that he or it is required
to make any payments under Section 10.3(a); provided, however, that such right
of contribution shall be based solely upon the relative aggregate amounts that
the Shareholders received on account of the Mergers.

SECTION 10.4 Claims Against Indemnified Parties. (a) L. David Myatt has
been designated as the representative of the Shareholders (the "Shareholders
Representative") to whom claims or demands upon Shareholders for
indemnification under Section 10.3(a) shall be made and who shall have certain
rights and responsibilities as set forth herein.

(b) If any Parent Indemnitee or any Shareholder (an "Indemnified Party")
believes that it or he has suffered or incurred or may suffer or incur any
Damages under this Article 10, such Indemnified Party shall so notify either
the Shareholders through the Shareholders Representative, the relevant
Shareholder or Parent (the "Indemnifying Party"), as appropriate, with
reasonable promptness and reasonable particularity in light of the
circumstances then existing. If any action at law or suit in equity is
instituted by or against a third party with respect to which any Indemnified
Party intends to claim any Damages, such Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of

-40-
<PAGE> 45
such action or suit. The failure of an Indemnified Party to give any notice
required by this Section 10.4 shall not affect any of such party's rights
under this Article 10 except to the extent that such failure is actually
prejudicial to the rights or obligations of the Indemnifying Party.

(c) With respect to claims or demands by third parties, following receipt of
notice pursuant to Section 10.4(b) hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right at his, its or their own expense to undertake the defense of any such
claims or demands utilizing counsel selected by the Shareholders
Representative, the relevant Shareholder or Parent, as the case may be, and
approved by the Indemnified Party which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Any such undertaking of the defense of any such claims or demands by
or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party shall be an acknowledgment and agreement
that such claim or demand, if true, constitutes indemnifiable Damages. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give notice of its, his or
their intention to undertake the defense of any such claim or demand within 30
days after receiving notice that it has been asserted or threatened, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to satisfy and discharge the same by
payment, compromise or otherwise.

(d) If an Indemnified Party believes it or he has incurred Damages which are
subject to indemnification under this Article 10 and do not involve a third
party claim or demand, it or he shall forward notice thereof to either the
Shareholders Representative, the relevant Shareholder or Parent as specified in
Section 10.4(b) hereof, and shall state the amount of Damages it or he believe
it or he has suffered, and shall provide, in reasonable detail the facts
alleged as the basis for such claim and the section or sections of this
Agreement alleged to have been violated (a "Damages Notice"). No later than 30
days after receipt of a Damages Notice from an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Indemnified
Party either a notice accepting such claim for Damages or a notice that the
Indemnifying Party disputes such claim for Damages. A notice by the
Shareholders Representative accepting a claim for Damages under Section 10.3(a)
shall be binding on all of the Shareholders. A failure to provide notice
disputing a claim for Damages within 30 days of receipt of a Damages Notice
shall be deemed acceptance of the relevant claim by the relevant Indemnifying
Party.

SECTION 10.5 Fees and Expenses. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, in the event of any dispute or controversy governed by this Article
10, the prevailing party in such dispute shall, in addition to any other
remedies such prevailing party may obtain in such dispute, be entitled to
recover from the other parties thereto all of its or his reasonable legal

-41-
<PAGE> 46
fees and out-of-pocket costs incurred by such party in enforcing or defending
its or his rights hereunder.

SECTION 10.6 Fraud; Willful Breach. Any limitations set forth in this
Article 10 on the right of any party hereto to indemnification hereunder shall
not apply to the extent that Damages are incurred by such party as the result
of fraud or the willful breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by
another party to this Agreement.

(as hereinafter defined), if any, and the following exceptions, reservations
and conditions:

(d) IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE PROPERTY WILL BE

IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SUCH

THAT THIS SUBPARAGRAPH (d) SHALL NOT ALTER THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE PROVIDED FOR

such waivers and disclaimers.

(4) Purchase Price.
---------------
The purchase price for the Property shall be $10,541,100. The parties
agree that $9,000,000 of the purchase price shall be allocated to Land and
Improvements and the remainder of the purchase price shall be allocated to the

Within fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined)

<PAGE> 5

(6) Title Commitment.
-----------------

Within ten (10) days after the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined)

Company acceptable to Buyer. The cost of the actual policy when issued shall
be paid by Buyer.

(7) Objections and Permitted Exceptions.
------------------------------------

Buyer shall have ten (10) days after receipt of the Title Commitment and the
Survey in which to object, in writing, to any matter therein, and those matters
to which Buyer does not object, in writing, shall become permitted exceptions
hereunder (the "Permitted Exceptions"). If within such ten (10) day period,
Buyer notifies Seller of any title or survey objections, Seller shall have ten
(10) days in which to cure or remove same, and Seller hereby agrees to make a
good faith effort to cure any Survey or title objections. If Seller is unable
to cure or remove such title and Survey objections to the satisfaction of Buyer
and the Title Company within such ten (10) day period, Buyer, at Buyer's option
and as Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy, shall either (a) terminate this
Agreement and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations
pursuant to this Agreement, or (b) waive any such Survey or title objections
or defects and accept such title as Seller is able to convey without offset,
reduction or abatement in the Purchase Price (with the uncured objections or
defects becoming Permitted Exceptions hereunder). Nothing in this

-5-
<PAGE> 6

Paragraph 7 shall relieve Seller from its obligation to convey title to the
Property free and clear of all monetary liens.

(8) Inspection.
-----------

Upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, Buyer may, at Buyer's sole cost and
expense, examine and inspect the Property at any reasonable
time. Buyer shall and does hereby indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and
against any and all liability, loss, cost, expense and damage caused to or
incurred by Seller or the Property by any acts or omissions of Buyer (or its
agents or representatives) in connection with such inspection. Any information
relating to the Property provided by Seller to Buyer or obtained by Buyer in
the course of its inspection shall be treated as confidential information by
Buyer, to be made available only to such persons as may be reasonably necessary
to properly evaluate the Property and/or as may be needed by Buyer to secure
financing for the Property.

(9) Environmental matters.
----------------------

Seller makes no representation or warranty, either express or implied, with
regard to the Environmental Condition of the Property.

"Environmental Condition" shall mean the presence on the Property of any
"hazardous substance" as that term is defined in any federal, state,
county/parish, or municipal statute, ordinance, regulation, rule, order,
judgment, or decree, including, without limitation, (i) the Comprehensive
Environmental Response,

-6-
<PAGE> 7

Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended; the Clean Air Act; the Water Pollution
Control Act (the Clean Water Act); the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe
Drinking Water Act, and the Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as
amended, and the state counterparts of those laws; and (ii) any material or
substance which is now listed in the United States Department of Transportation
Hazardous Materials Table (49 C.F.R. Section 172.101); and (iii) any
contaminant, oil, petroleum product or by-product, radioactive material or
by-product, any mining waste, toxic substance, hazardous waste, or other
material, the removal of which is required or the existence or management of
which is prohibited, penalized, or regulated by any federal, state, or local
government agency, authority, or unit.

Buyer may, at Buyer's sole expense, conduct an environmental site assessment
(the "Assessment") by qualified environmental consultants acceptable to Seller
to determine the Environmental Condition of the Land and Improvements.
However, Buyer agrees that the Assessment which may be conducted by Buyer shall
not be conducted until such time that all of the Agreement Conditions and the
Funding Condition (which are defined in Paragraph 15 of this Agreement) have
been satisfied. A copy of the Assessment shall be provided promptly by Buyer
to Seller. Buyer may, at Buyer's sole expense, conduct any additional test
studies and investigations recommended in the Assessment. Buyer may, at
Buyer's sole expense,

-7-
<PAGE> 8

undertake such investigation and remediation of the Land and Improvements as
may be necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, regulations or
government orders regarding the Environmental Condition of the Land and
Improvements or as may be recommended by the environmental consultants. Buyer
agrees that Seller shall have no obligation to perform the remediations of the
Land and Improvements recommended by the environmental consultants in the
Assessment, if any, and Buyer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Seller
in the same manner as set forth in Paragraph 11 of this Agreement from any
liabilities to any party or entity or government agency for, with respect to,
or as a result of the Environmental Condition of the property irrespective of
whether the Assessment is conducted before or after the Second Closing.

At such time that the Agreement Conditions and the Funding Condition have
been satisfied, Seller shall provide Buyer with access to the Land and
Improvements to perform the Assessment, any additional tests, studies and
investigations recommended in the Assessment, and any remediation of the Land
and Improvements. In the event that Buyer exercises its right to take such
action, Buyer shall, to the extent practicable, undertake these actions in a
manner that will not unreasonably disrupt the business operations conducted on
the Land. After the completion of any investigation or remediation undertaken
by Buyer, Buyer shall restore the surface and existing structures to a
condition substantially similar to

-8-
<PAGE> 9
that existing at the time immediately prior to such action taken by Buyer.

Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any loss,
cost, expense or liability arising, directly or indirectly, from the
performance of the Assessment, additional tests, studies, and investigations,
and any remediation performed by Buyer, its agents, employees and contractors.

(10) Access to information regarding the Property.
---------------------------------------------

Seller agrees to make available to Buyer any information, documents, surveys
or reports within Seller's possession or control regarding any environmental
assessments or audits of the Property, underground storage tanks located on the
Property or engineering reports or assessments regarding the Property.

(11) Indemnification.
----------------

Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any and all
liabilities (including strict liability), actions, demands, penalties, losses,
out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
consultant's fees, investigation and laboratory fees, attorney's fees and
expenses and remedial costs), suits, clean-up costs, costs of any settlement or
judgment and claims of any and every kind whatsoever which may now or in the
future be paid, incurred or suffered by or asserted against Seller by any
person or entity or government agency for, with respect to, or as a result of
the Environmental Condition of the Property or Buyer's actions or omissions
after the Closing.

<PAGE> 13

(15) Move to Port Site.
------------------

Seller has been engaged in negotiations with the Caddo-Bossier Parishes Port
Commission (the "Port Commission") and the Industrial Development Board of the
Parish of Caddo, Inc. (the "IDB") regarding the sale of the Land and
Improvements to the IDB/Port Commission for $9,000,000 and the relocation of
substantially all of the manufacturing and business operations conducted at the
Property to a new facility (the "Port Facility") to be constructed at the Port
Commission's port on Red River. A letter of intent dated July 12, 1994, has
been executed by Seller and the Caddo-Bossier Parish Port Commissions, a copy
of which letter is attached hereto as Exhibit "H." Buyer agrees that the
obligations imposed on Buyer in this Agreement are subject to the terms and
conditions of the July 12, 1994 letter of intent attached hereto as Exhibit
"H."

Buyer has entered into this Agreement in the expectation that it will be able
to (a) enter into a definitive agreement or agreements with the IDB pursuant to
which the IDB will commit to purchase the property from Buyer at a purchase
price of $9,000,000 subject only to the condition that title be good and
merchantable and that the Land and Improvements be free of "Environmental
Conditions" which are in violation of applicable local, state or federal law or
regulation, (b) enter into a definitive agreement with the IDB pursuant to
which the IDB will commit to lease the Land and Improvements to Buyer for the
period during which the

-13-
<PAGE> 14

Buyer is preparing the Port Facility for occupancy at a rent not to exceed
$45,000 per month and pursuant to which the IDB will lease a portion of the
Land and Improvements to Buyer for use subsequent to the move by Buyer to the
Port Facility, and (c) enter into a definitive agreement with the Port
Commission pursuant to which the Buyer will commit to obtain a twenty year
leasehold estate coupled with a nominal price purchase option for a prepaid
rent of approximately $1,000,000 (collectively referred to herein as the
"Agreement Conditions"). In order to complete the purchase commitment
contemplated under subparagraph (a) above, the IDB will need to secure and
confirm funding for the $9,000,000 necessary to enable the IDB to purchase the
Land and Improvements (the "Funding Condition"). For purposes of this
Agreement, the Funding Condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied at such
time that the IDB confirms to Buyer by written notice that it stands ready,
willing and able to consummate the purchase of the Land and Improvements for
$9,000,000, subject to such other terms and conditions as may be negotiated
between the IDB and Buyer. After the Effective Date, Buyer agrees to 
cooperate with Seller in Seller's efforts to satisfy the Agreement Conditions 
and the Funding Condition for the purpose of facilitating the proposed move 
to the port site. Following the execution hereof, Buyer agrees to proceed 
with reasonable diligence and dispatch to complete the negotiations with the 
IDB and the Port Commission regarding the satisfaction of the 
Agreement Conditions and the Funding Condition.
