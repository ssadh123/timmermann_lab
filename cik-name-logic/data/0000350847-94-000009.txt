RIGGS REPURCHASES SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK

For Immediate Release, Tuesday, September 27, 1994

Riggs National Corporation announced that it has
repurchased all 764,537 shares of its 7-1/2% Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, from The Norwich
Union Life Insurance Society, a major insurance company
headquartered in Norwich, England. Riggs paid $19,113,425
to repurchase the shares, which is equal to the original
issue price in June 1992. The shares were convertible into
2,002,141 shares of Riggs common stock at $9.5465 per share.
Riggs common shares closed yesterday at $10.375. The Series
A shares will be canceled and will revert to authorized but
unissued shares.

As a result of the repurchase, the company's dividend
expense will be reduced by $1.4 million annually, and a
source of potential dilution of its common stockholders has
been eliminated.

After repurchase of the Series A shares, the company's
capital ratios remain substantially in excess of regulatory
minimum requirements. On a pro forma basis at June 30,
1994, the company's Tier I capital to risk-based assets
ratio was 10.55 percent; the total capital to risk-based
assets ratio was 17.11 percent; and the leverage ratio was
6.19 percent. These ratios compare favorably with minimum
regulatory guidelines of 4.00 percent for the Tier I capital
ratio; 8.00 percent for the total capital ratio; and 4.00 to
5.00 percent for the leverage ratio for most bank holding
companies.

Riggs National Corporation is a Washington, D.C.-based
multibank holding company, with banks in Washington, D.C.,
Virginia, Maryland, The United Kingdom and France. Riggs
serves the metropolitan Washington area with 34 locations in
the District of Columbia, 17 in Virginia and 11 in Maryland.
The company's common shares (RIGS) are traded on the NASDAQ
National Market System.
