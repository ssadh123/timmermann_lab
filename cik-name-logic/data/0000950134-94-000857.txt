INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Partners of
Rampart Operating Partnership
New Orleans, Louisiana

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Rampart Operating
Partnership as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related statements of
operations, partners' capital (deficit), and cash flows for the years then
ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on A test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Rampart Operating Partnership at December
31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements, on March 29, 1994, the
Partnership entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets
of WWL-TV.

RAMPART OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION - Rampart Operating Partnership (the "Operating
Partnership") was formed on August 24, 1990 to acquire substantially
all of the assets of WWL-TV (the "Station"), a network-affiliated
television station authorized to broadcast on VHF Channel 4 in New
Orleans, Louisiana, from Loyola University ("Loyola"). The Operating
Partnership, a Louisiana general partnership, has three general
partners. Rampart Broadcasting Limited Partnership (the "Limited
Partnership") is the managing general partner and owns an approximate
99% equity interest in the Operating Partnership. Allocation of
partnership profits and losses is determined based upon the provisions
of the Operating Partnership agreement, primarily in accordance with
each partner's ownership interest.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand and investments (at cost) in repurchase agreements with
maturities of three months or less secured by United States Government
securities.

BROADCAST RIGHTS - Broadcast rights consist of rights to broadcast
syndicated programs and feature films and are stated at the lower of
unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. The cost of these
rights is recorded as an asset and liability when the program becomes
available for broadcast. The amount charged to operations is based on
varying rates as appropriate to match related revenues with these
expenses. Broadcast rights that will be amortized in the succeeding
year are classified as current assets. The liability for these rights
is classified as current in accordance with the payment terms of the
various agreements.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are
stated at cost. Additions and improvements are capitalized, while
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Buildings 35 years
Equipment 5-10 years
</TABLE>

The cost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or retired are
removed from the accounts, and gains or losses, if any, are reflected
in earnings for the period.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS - Intangible assets are stated at cost and are
amortized using the straight-line method over periods generally not to
exceed 40 years.

DEFERRED FINANCING AND ORGANIZATION COSTS - Deferred financing costs
consist of professional fees and other costs incurred in connection
with the issuance of long-term debt. These costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the related debt.

Deferred organization costs consist of professional fees and other
costs incurred in connection with the organization of the Operating
Partnership and acquisition of the Station. These costs are amortized
using the straight-line method over a five year period.

F-7
<PAGE> 12
NON-MONETARY TRANSACTIONS - Certain transactions of the Operating
Partnership involve non-monetary exchanges in which the Operating
Partnership provides commercial air time to customers in exchange for
goods and services. Such trade transactions are recorded at the
estimated fair market value of the products or services received.
Revenues from such transactions are recognized when commercials are
broadcast, and goods or services are recorded when received or used.
Such revenues recorded in the year ended December 31, 1993 and 1992
amounted to $1,348,015 and $1,078,813, respectively. If goods or
services are received prior to the broadcast of the commercial, a
liability is recorded; likewise, if the commercial is broadcast prior
to receipt of the goods or services, a receivable is recorded.

INCOME TAXES - Rampart Operating Partnership, as a partnership, is not
subject to income taxes. Any income or loss of the entity is reported
to the appropriate Federal and state income tax authorities for
informational purposes, while actual profit or loss passes to
individual partners for taxation.

RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain 1992 amounts included in the accompanying
financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the 1993
presentation.

6. LONG-TERM DEBT

In connection with the acquisition of the Station, the Operating
Partnership together with the Limited Partnership (the "Partnerships")
entered into a Securities Purchase and Revolving Credit Agreement
dated as of August 27, 1990 (the "Credit Agreement") with certain
lenders who are also limited partners in the Limited Partnership. The
Credit Agreement provides for the issuance by the Operating
Partnership of revolving credit, senior and subordinated notes.

F-9
<PAGE> 14
REVOLVING CREDIT

The Operating Partnership had available $23,000,000 at December 31,
1993 and 1992 under a revolving credit agreement, with amounts
outstanding thereunder of $19,000,000 and $22,800,000, respectively.
The Operating Partnership is required to pay a commitment fee of 1/2
of 1% per annum on the unused portion of the loan commitment available
under the revolving credit note. On February 22, 1993, the Credit
Agreement was amended to provide for, among other things, the
following maximum principal amounts available to August 31, 1997:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
PERIODS 
--------------------- MAXIMUM PRINCIPAL BALANCE

01/01/97 08/31/97 15,000,000
</TABLE> 

Interest is payable quarterly based upon the three-month London
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), plus 2.75 percentage points. The
rate is established at the end of each quarter for the succeeding
quarter. The applicable interest rate on the revolving credit note
outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992 was 6.125% and 6.0%,
respectively. The Operating Partnership had an "interest rate swap"
agreement from December 19, 1990 through December 19, 1992 covering
$15,000,000 of the amount outstanding under the revolving credit note.
The Operating Partnership agreed to make quarterly payments based upon
a floor LIBOR rate of 7%, in exchange for quarterly payments by the
lender based upon a LIBOR rate cap of 9%. The effective annual
interest rate on the amount covered by this agreement was 9.8% for the
year ended December 31, 1992.

The Operating Partnership entered into an interest rate cap corridor
agreement on January 14, 1993 to provide for interest rate protection
covering $15,000,000 of the amount outstanding under the revolving
credit note. The protected interest rate is 6.0% up to but not
exceeding 9.0% based on the three-month LIBOR. The cost of this
agreement was $114,000, which will be amortized over its term of July
1, 1993 through June 30, 1995.

SENIOR NOTES

Immediately prior to the acquisition, the Operating Partnership issued
$40,000,000 of senior notes bearing interest at 12% per annum, with
interest payable semi-annually. The notes mature on August 31, 1997,
at which time the outstanding principal balances must be paid in full.

SUBORDINATED NOTES

The Operating Partnership also issued $15,000,000 of subordinated
notes bearing interest at 17% per annum, of which 12% is payable
semi-annually and 5% is deferred, added to the outstanding principal
balance of the notes and compounded semi-annually until paid.
However, upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the Credit
Agreement, the interest deferral would cease and the entire 17% would
be paid currently from that date forward. Cumulative deferred
interest amounted to $2,699,821 and $1,846,944 at December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively. The notes mature on August 31, 1997.

<PAGE> 15
COVENANTS

The Credit Agreement contains financial and operating covenants that
prohibit or significantly limit the Partnerships' ability to, among
other things, incur or repay any other indebtedness, cause cash
distributions to be made to partners, issue additional equity
interests or make capital expenditures above certain annual amounts.
The Credit Agreement also requires the Partnerships to maintain
specified working capital reserves and interest coverage percentages.
Specifically, the principal restrictive covenants of the Credit
Agreement are as follows:

-- Require the Partnerships to maintain a working capital reserve
of $3,000,000 at the end of each quarter and limit annual
capital expenditures to $750,000.

-- Limit indebtedness other than amounts outstanding under the
Credit Agreement to $500,000.

-- Substantially restrict any distributions to partners other
than in limited instances specified by the Credit Agreement.

-- Require specified percentages of operating cash flow to cash
interest expense for each four quarter period during the term
of the Credit Agreement.

For the four quarter periods ended during 1992 the
required percentage was 120%. The Partnership was
not in compliance with this percentage during certain
periods in 1992; however, waivers were obtained for
all instances of non-compliance from the principal
lender. On February 22, 1993 the Credit Agreement
was amended to provide for the following revised
required percentages:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
FOR QUARTERS ENDED PERCENTAGE
<S> <C>
March 31, 1993 through September 30, 1995 110%
December 31, 1995 and thereafter 125%
</TABLE>

See Note 9, "Subsequent Event," for discussion regarding the Operating
Partnership's agreement to sell the Station. All amounts outstanding
under the Credit Agreement will become immediately due and payable
concurrently with the sale of the Station.

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, there are various commitments such
as long-term employment contracts and consulting agreements, which are
not recorded as obligations in the accompanying financial statements.
These agreements expire at various dates through 1997. The total
commitment at December 31, 1993 and 1992 was approximately $4,141,000
and $3,700,000, respectively.

The Partnerships are named as defendants in several lawsuits arising
in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to the asset purchase
agreement, the Operating Partnership acquired the assets of the
Station free of liability or obligations relating to ownership or
operation of the Station prior to the acquisition. In connection with
the acquisition of the Station, Loyola agreed to indemnify the
Operating Partnership against claims and litigation relating to the
prior operation of the Station by Loyola. While the outcome of these
lawsuits against the Partnerships cannot be predicted with certainty,
management does not expect these matters to have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the
Partnerships.

8. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

As discussed in Note 1, the managing general partner of the Operating
Partnership is Rampart Broadcasting Limited Partnership. The two
non-managing general partners of the Operating Partnership are
affiliated with parties that are limited partners in the Limited
Partnership. Several employees of the Operating Partnership are also
limited partners in the Limited Partnership. Additionally, five
employees of the Operating Partnership are the stockholders of Rampart
Broadcasting Company, a corporation which is the general partner in
the Limited Partnership.

The Operating Partnership has entered into an incentive bonus
agreement whereby the Operating Partnership is required to pay Rampart
Broadcasting Company an incentive bonus if the Operating Partnership
achieves stipulated cash flow projections. No such bonus was earned
for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992.

The Operating Partnership has retained a limited partner in the
Limited Partnership to provide national sales representation for the
Station. Amounts paid to this limited partner for the years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992 were approximately $576,000 and $515,000,
respectively.

9. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On March 29, 1994, the Partnership entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement whereby substantially all of the assets of WWL- TV,
exclusive of cash and accounts receivable, will be sold. The sale of
the Station is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events,
principally Federal Communications Commission approval. The purchase
price of the assets is $110,000,000, subject to certain adjustments
provided for by the Asset Purchase Agreement, primarily resulting from
the operations of the Partnership prior to the date of the sale, which
is expected to occur in mid-year 1994. The Asset Purchase Agreement
provides for the establishment of a $2,000,000 indemnification escrow
fund out of the proceeds of the sale, the purpose of which is to
provide funds for the resolution of any pre-acquisition contingencies.
The consummation of the sale of the Station will result in the
ultimate dissolution of the Partnerships.

If the aforementioned sale is not consummated, the Operating
Partnership Agreement contains a provision which provides the two
non-managing general partners of the Operating Partnership the right
to cause the sale of the Station if specified cash flow requirements
for the 12 months ending August 31, 1994 are not achieved. Although
it is not possible to predict future performance with certainty,
management does not expect such cash flow requirements will be
achieved for the 12 months ending August 31, 1994; accordingly, the
non-managing general partners could exercise the aforementioned right
for up to 135 days following August 31, 1994.

A. H. BELO CORPORATION
NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1: GENERAL

On June 1, 1994, A. H. Belo Corporation (the "Company"), through its
wholly-owned subsidiary, WWL-TV, Inc., acquired the assets of television
station WWL-TV, the CBS affiliate in New Orleans, Louisiana, from Rampart
Operating Partnership ("Rampart") for approximately $110,000,000 in cash. The
transaction was financed with funds from the Company's existing revolving
credit facility utilizing short-term rates. However, for purposes of pro forma
financial results, the Company has assumed an interest rate representing a
long-term fixed rate that could have been obtained at the date of the
transaction.

The pro forma financial statements present the historical consolidated
financial statements of the Company adjusted for the acquisition. The
accompanying pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet assumes the
transaction was completed on March 31, 1994. The accompanying pro forma
consolidated statements of earnings assume the transaction was completed at the
beginning of the periods indicated.

These pro forma financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the
financial position which would have actually been obtained had the acquisition
occurred on March 31, 1994 or the results of operations which would have
actually been obtained had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 1993 or 1994.
These pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the annual report
for the year ended December 31, 1993 filed on Form 10-K and the quarterly
report for the three-month period ended March 31, 1994 filed on Form 10-Q and
