Chiquita Brands International News Release

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CHIQUITA ANNOUNCES 1993 RESULTS

CINCINNATI, OHIO, February 28, 1994 -- In line with its
January 28 announcement of expected 1993 results, Chiquita Brands
International, Inc. today reported a net loss for the year of $51
million, or $.99 per share. In 1992, Chiquita reported a net loss
of $284 million, or $5.48 per share (including restructuring and
reorganization charges of $61 million, or $1.18 per share, and a
loss from discontinued operations of $62 million, or $1.20 per
share). 

For its 1993 fourth quarter, Chiquita reported a net loss of
$60 million, or $1.17 per share, compared to a net loss of $193
million, or $3.77 per share (including restructuring and
reorganization charges of $61 million, or $1.18 per share, and a
loss from discontinued operations of $41 million, or $.80 per
share) for the 1992 fourth quarter.

Operating income for 1993 was $104 million in contrast to an
operating loss for 1992 of $97 million including restructuring and
reorganization charges. Chiquita attributed the improvement to the
continuing benefits of its multi-year investment spending program
and the ongoing impact of its restructuring and cost reduction
efforts. The Company indicated that since imposition of a new
quota system on July 1, 1993 which in effect restricts the volume
of Latin American bananas imported into the European Community
("EC"), 1993 prices within the EC increased to a higher level than
in prior years. Chiquita also indicated that banana prices in
other worldwide markets during the same period of 1993 were lower
than in previous years, as displaced EC volume entered those
markets.

Keith E. Lindner, President and Chief Operating Officer
stated: "In 1993 Chiquita substantially reduced its losses through
significant cost reductions and began adjusting to the worldwide
impact of the new EC quota system. As we begin 1994, year-to-date
EC pricing is exceeding pre-quota early 1993 levels. Average price
levels for markets outside the EC in early 1994 are also exceeding
price levels for comparable pre-quota periods even though those
markets have continued to absorb displaced EC volume."

Chiquita recently received approximately $310 million from
public sales of senior notes and preferred stock. The Company is
proceeding with previously announced plans to redeem subordinated
debt and/or repay portions of its outstanding subsidiary debt with
the proceeds of these offerings. While net interest expense rose
to $149 million in 1993 from $112 million in 1992, these
refinancings will result in net interest savings for 1994 and
future years.

Chiquita is a leading international marketer, processor and
producer of quality food products.
