AST BOLSTERS ITS MANAGEMENT TEAM, NAMES JAMES T. SCHRAITH AS PRESIDENT AND COO 
AND BRUCE C. EDWARDS, EXECUTIVE VP
IRVINE, Calif., July 12, 1994--AST Research, the world's No. 5 PC manufacturer, 
today bolstered its senior management team by promoting James T. Schraith to 
president and chief operating officer and Bruce C. Edwards to executive vice 
president. Both AST veterans, Schraith and Edwards were also appointed to the 
board of directors which now comprises seven members. During Schraith and 
Edwards' tenure at AST the company has grown into a Fortune 500 company with 
annual revenue growth of more than 70 percent for the first three quarters of 
fiscal year 1994. Safi Qureshey remains Chairman of the Board and Chief 
Executive Officer.
"AST has grown in sophistication as it has reached multibillion-dollar, 
world-class status in this rapid-fire, quick-moving industry," said Safi 
Qureshey, AST Chairman and CEO. "To take advantage of the opportunities for 
growth in the world's most dynamic industry, the day-to-day business operations 
will be led by an AST veteran, Jim Schraith, who has been instrumental to AST's 
growth and success over the years.
"Jim has a history of managing for results. His organizational management 
and team building skills, combined with his expertise and track record in sales 
and service gives him a unique, perspective to guide AST. He understands the 
industry and has an intimate knowledge and belief in AST's philosophy to 
deliver the ultimate in customer satisfaction. Jim and Bruce have played vital 
roles in the company's tremendous growth and will give me the management team 
to seize the opportunities before us."
As president and chief operating officer, Schraith will be responsible for 
worldwide 
-more-
operations, sales, marketing and engineering.
"AST's growth has dramatically outpaced the industry's," said James T. 
Schraith, AST's new president and chief operating officer. "Process 
efficiency, with a focus on quality, will be the drive in our operations so we 
can continue to give our global customers the best product and ownership 
experience offered in the world."
Schraith, 36 and a 15-year industry veteran, joined AST in 1987 when 
revenues totaled $172 million. He most recently served as senior vice 
president, sales and service, leading the company's worldwide sales and service 
operations. Under his direction in worldwide sales, AST has expanded its 
distribution channels and continued to increase unit shipments, achieving a 69 
percent volume increase for fiscal year 1993. 
His commitment to AST channel partners has resulted in strong 
relationships with worldwide distributors, such as: Merisel, Ingram Micro and 
Tech Data. He has successfully negotiated relationships with strategic 
distribution partners worldwide, making AST computers easier to obtain, by 
adding partners such as: CompUSA, Intelligent Electronics, Inacom and MicroAge.
Schraith was also instrumental in building the company's European presence 
which resulted in significant growth in excess of the market in that region. 
Under his direction AST has forged paths in growing and emerging markets such 
as Africa, Japan and Newly Independent States, with continuing progress in 
established regions such as Canada. 
Schraith distinguished AST from its competition with a unique vision in 
service and support that revolutionized customer service early on in the 
computer marketplace and set new industry standards. 
Edwards, 40, has provided the company with the financial resources 
necessary to expand its operations as a tier-one industry player. Since he 
joined AST in 1983, Edwards has been an integral part of AST's executive 
management team, helping to set up AST's network of international subsidiaries, 
negotiating the company's 1993 acquisition of Tandy Corp.'s PC manufacturing 
operations and managing the company's five public offerings.
"Timed with the start of our new fiscal year, I look forward to working 
with Safi and Jim in helping AST capitalize on its position as a leader in the 
worldwide personal computer marketplace," said Bruce Edwards, AST executive 
vice president and chief financial officer.
Schraith, Edwards and Wai Szeto, vice president of corporate development, 
will report directly to Qureshey. Schraith and Edwards join current AST board 
members: Qureshey, Carmelo J. Santoro, Richard J. Goeglein, Delbert W. Yocam, 
and Jack Peltason.
"AST has a vision--that the PC, as an information tool, can have a 
profound effect on people's quality of life in an ever-changing world," said 
Qureshey. "Our company mission and goal is to be the easiest company to do 
business with in every way. Our new management team will help the company 
build on its success and make this vision and mission a reality."
