Item 5. Other Events.

On October 19, 1994 Advanta Corp. announced record quarterly 
earnings for the third quarter 1994 with net income of $26.8 million 
and earnings per share of $.65, increases of 32% and 30%, respectively, 
over the $20.3 million and $.50 per share results reported for the third 
quarter 1993. Earnings for the second quarter 1994 totalled $25.8 million
or $.63 per share. From September 1993, the Company's portfolio
of managed receivables increased by $2 billion or 44% to $6.6
billion at September 30, 1994.

Highlights for the third quarter include the following items:

Managed credit card receivables at September 30 of $5.1 billion
posted a 52% increase over the $3.3 billion level of last
September.

The managed credit card 30+ day delinquency rate fell to 2.1%,
from 2.8% in the third quarter last year.

The charge-off rate on managed credit cards dropped to 2.4%,
compared to 3.2% a year ago.

The Company added 192,000 new credit card accounts during the
quarter compared to 166,000 in the third quarter of 1993.

The managed net interest margin for the quarter fell to 6.79%
from 6.95% in the second quarter, and 8.05% in the comparable period
of 1993 primarily due to introductory pricing on credit card 
receivables acquired during the quarter.
