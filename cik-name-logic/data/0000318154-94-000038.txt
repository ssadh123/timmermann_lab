Item 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

------------------------------------

On November 18, 1994, Amgen Inc. ("Amgen") and Synergen,

Inc. ("Synergen") announced that they have entered into a

definitive agreement through which Amgen will acquire Synergen.

Pursuant to this agreement, Amgen will commence no later than

November 29, 1994 a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares

of Synergen common stock (including the associated preferred

stock purchase rights) for $9.25 per share. Any shares not

purchased in the offer will be acquired for the same price in

cash, in a second-step merger. Funds from Amgen's working

capital will be used to purchase shares of Synergen stock. In

determining the amount to be offered for the shares of Synergen

stock, Amgen considered, among other things, the financial

condition and results of operations of Synergen and detailed

financial and valuation analyses presented to Amgen by Amgen's

financial advisors. It is anticipated that at least some of the

assets constituting plant, equipment and other physical property

generally used in Synergen's business will continue to be used by

Amgen for such purposes but Amgen has not yet determined how it

intends to use all of such assets proposed to be acquired. The

proposed acquisition is subject to the purchase of a majority of

the outstanding shares of Synergen common stock in the tender

offer and various other conditions. Amgen and Synergen

anticipate that the acquisition will be completed by December 31,

1994.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of November
17, 1994, is among Amgen Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Amgen
Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser") and Synergen, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Company").

RECITALS

A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and Company
have approved the acquisition of Company pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

B. In furtherance of such acquisition it is proposed that Purchaser will
make a tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Company (the "Common
Stock"), together with all of the associated rights to purchase units of Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Company
(the "Rights"), for $9.25 per share net to the seller in cash. The Common Stock
and the Rights are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Shares."

C. The Board of Directors of Company (the "Board of Directors") has duly
approved the Offer and resolved to recommend its acceptance by Company's
stockholders.

D. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and Company
have each duly approved the merger of Purchaser and Company (the "Merger")
following consummation of the Offer, in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Law").

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, Parent, Purchaser and Company hereby
agree as follows:

1. THE OFFER

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1 and that none of the events set forth in Annex I hereto shall have
occurred, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, and in any event within five business days of
the day on which the proposed Offer is announced, commence (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act")) the Offer for all of the outstanding Shares at a price of $9.25
per Share net to the seller in cash.

(b) The obligations of Purchaser to consummate the Offer and to accept for
payment and pay for any of the Shares tendered shall be subject only to the
conditions set forth on Annex I, including the condition that a minimum of not
less than a majority of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis
(including for purposes of such calculation all Shares issuable upon exercise of
outstanding Options (as defined in Section 2.6), but excluding for purposes of
such calculation all Shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding Warrants (as
defined in Section 2.7), Rights and any other rights or securities to purchase
or acquire the Shares) being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the Offer (the "Minimum Condition"). The Offer shall remain open
for a minimum of 20 business days after commencement of the Offer as provided in
Rule 14e-1 promulgated by the Commission (the "Expiration Date"), unless
Purchaser extends the Offer as permitted by this Agreement, in which case the
"Expiration Date" means the latest time and date to which the Offer is extended.

(c) Purchaser reserves the right to waive any conditions to the Offer,
other than the Minimum Condition, to increase the price per Share payable in the
Offer or to make any other changes in the terms and

<PAGE>

conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that no such change may be made
which decreases the price per Share, changes the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, reduces the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer,
imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I or
amends any other material term of the Offer in a manner materially adverse to
Company's stockholders without Company's prior written consent; provided,
further, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing Purchaser may waive the
Minimum Condition if Purchaser after consultation with Company, upon
consummation of the Offer, accepts for payment and pays for a majority of the
Shares outstanding at the time of such consummation. The Offer may not, without
Company's prior written consent, be extended, except as necessary to provide
time to satisfy the conditions set forth in Annex I; provided, however, that
Purchaser may extend (and re-extend) the Offer for up to a total of 10 business
days, if as of the initial Expiration Date, there shall not have been validly
tendered and not withdrawn at least 90% of the outstanding Shares so that the
Merger can be effected without a meeting of Company's stockholders in accordance
with the Delaware Law. Purchaser agrees that if all conditions set forth in
Annex I are satisfied on the initial Expiration Date, other than the Minimum
Condition or the condition set forth in paragraph (b) of Annex I, Purchaser
shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer for up to a maximum of 20 business days
to provide time to satisfy either such conditions, so long as all such other
conditions remain satisfied.

(d) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and the conditions
set forth in Annex I. As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") with respect to the Offer a Schedule 14D-1 (the
"Schedule 14D-1") which will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of applicable federal securities law, and will contain the Offer to
Purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement (which documents, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, are referred to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents"). The
Schedule 14D-1 and the Offer Documents, on the date the Schedule 14D-1 is filed
with the Commission, and on the date the Offer Documents are first published,
sent or given to Company's stockholders, as the case may be, shall not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and Parent and Purchaser agree promptly to correct the Schedule
14D-1 or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that either shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and to take all steps necessary to
cause such Schedule 14D-1 as so corrected to be filed with the Commission and
such Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.
Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review the
Offer Documents prior to the filing with the Commission. Company agrees to file
contemporaneously with the commencement of the Offer with the Commission a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9")
which will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable federal securities laws. The Schedule 14D9, on the date filed with
the Commission and on the date first published, sent or given to Company's
stockholders, as the case may be, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and Company agrees
promptly to correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and to take all steps
necessary to cause such Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the
Commission and mailed to Company's stockholders to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. Subject to the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors, as advised by counsel, the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9
shall contain the recommendation of the Board of Directors that Company's
stockholders accept the Offer.

1.2 Company Action. Company represents that the Board of Directors has
duly approved by a unanimous vote the Offer and the Merger and resolved to
recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval of the Merger by Company's
stockholders. Company will promptly furnish Parent or Purchaser with mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares and,
to the extent available (including upon request), lists of securities positions
of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, and shall
furnish Purchaser with such additional information, including updated lists of
stockholders,

2

<PAGE>

mailing labels and lists of securities positions, and assistance as Purchaser
may reasonably request in connection with communicating the Offer. Subject to
the requirements of law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents, Parent and Purchaser shall hold in confidence
the information contained in any of such labels and lists and the additional
information referred to in the preceding sentence, shall use such information
only in connection with the Offer, and, if this Agreement is terminated, shall
deliver to Company all such written information and any copies or extracts
thereof then in their possession.

1.3 Directors. Promptly upon the acceptance for payment and payment by
Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries of such number of Shares which satisfies
the Minimum Condition and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled
to designate a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, subject to
compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. Subject to applicable law,
Company shall take all action necessary to effect any such election, including
mailing to its stockholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the affirmative vote of a majority of Company's
directors (or the approval of the director, if there is only one remaining) then
in office who are directors on the date hereof or are directors (other than
directors designated by Purchaser) designated by such persons to fill any
vacancy, shall be required to (i) amend or modify Company's Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, (ii) take any action by Company pursuant to Sections
8.1, 8.3 or 8.4 of this Agreement or (iii) approve any other action by Company
which adversely affects the interests of the stockholders of Company (other than
Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates) with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

2. THE MERGER

2.1 The Merger. At the Effective Date, in accordance with this Agreement
and the Delaware Law, Purchaser shall be merged with and into Company, the
separate existence of Purchaser (except as may be continued by operation of law)
shall cease, and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation under the
corporate name it possesses immediately prior to the Effective Date. Company
hereinafter sometimes is referred to as the "Surviving Corporation." At the
election of Parent, the Merger may be structured so that Company shall be merged
with and into Purchaser with the result that Purchaser shall be the "Surviving
Corporation." If Parent elects to structure the Merger so that Purchaser, rather
than Company, is the Surviving Corporation, the inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty of Company which is premised on the assumption that Company shall be
the Surviving Corporation, which representation or warranty becomes inaccurate
solely as a result of Purchaser, rather than Company, being the Surviving
Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a breach of such representation or
warranty and shall not release Purchaser from its duties and obligations under
the Offer and this Agreement.

2.2 Effect of the Merger. When the Merger has been effected, the
Surviving Corporation shall thereupon and thereafter possess all the rights,
privileges, immunities and franchises, of a public as well as of a private
nature, of Purchaser and Company (the "Constituent Corporations"); all property,
real, personal and mixed, and all debts due on whatever account and all choses
in action, and all and every other interest, of or belonging to or due each of
the Constituent Corporations shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation
without further act or deed; and the title to any real estate, or any interest
therein, vested in Purchaser, Company or the Surviving Corporation shall not
revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Merger. The Surviving
Corporation shall thereupon and thereafter be responsible and liable for all the
liabilities and obligations of each of the Constituent Corporations so merged;
any claim existing or action or proceeding pending by or against any of the
Constituent Corporations may be prosecuted as if the Merger had not taken place,
or the Surviving Corporation may be substituted in its place. The Surviving
Corporation thereupon and thereafter shall have all the rights, privileges,
immunities and powers and shall be subject to all the duties and liabilities of
a corporation organized under the Delaware Law, and neither the rights of
creditors nor any liens upon the respective properties of the Constituent
Corporations and the Surviving Corporation shall be impaired by the Merger; all
with the effect set forth in the Delaware Law.

2.3 Consummation of the Merger. As soon as is practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties
hereto will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the

3

<PAGE>

Secretary of State of Delaware a certificate of merger in such form as required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the Delaware Law
(the time of such filing being the "Effective Date").

2.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers. The
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Purchaser shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Date, until thereafter amended as provided therein and
under the Delaware Law. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Date will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and
the officers of Company immediately prior to the Effective Date will be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
successors are elected and qualified.

2.5 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Date, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Date (other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.5(b) hereof and Shares held by any holder who becomes entitled to the
payment of the fair value for his Shares under the Delaware Law if the
Delaware Law provides for such payment in connection with the Merger
("Dissenting Shares")) shall be cancelled and extinguished and be converted
into and become a right to receive $9.25 in cash, or such higher amount per
share as is paid pursuant to the Offer (the "Merger Consideration").

(b) Each Share which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Date and owned by Purchaser, Parent or Company or any direct
or indirect subsidiary of Purchaser, Parent or Company, shall be cancelled
and retired, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) All notes and other debt instruments of Company which are
outstanding at the Effective Date shall continue to be outstanding
subsequent to the Effective Date as debt instruments of the Surviving
Corporation, if permitted by their respective terms and provisions.

The holders of Dissenting Shares, if any, shall be entitled to payment for
such Shares only to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware Law; provided, however, that if, in
accordance with such Section of the Delaware Law, any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall forfeit such right to payment of the fair value of such Shares,
such Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Date, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration provided in Section 2.5(a) of this Agreement.

2.6 Company Stock Options and Related Matters. As promptly as practicable
after the Effective Date, each holder of a then outstanding employee or director
stock option (an "Option") to purchase Shares heretofore granted under any
Employee Plan (as defined in Section 4.15), other than any Options that are held
by any director of Company or any officer (as that term is defined in Rule
16a-1(f) promulgated by the Commission) of Company and that were granted (or
deemed granted) at any time on or after the date that is six months prior to the
Effective Date (the "Recent Insider Options"), will be entitled (whether or not
such Option is then exercisable) to receive in consideration of cancellation of
such Option (and any outstanding stock appreciation right related thereto) a
cash payment from Company in an amount equal to the difference between the
Merger Consideration and the per Share exercise price of such Option, multiplied
by the number of Shares covered by such Option. The Recent Insider Options shall
remain outstanding in accordance with their terms and shall not be affected in
any way by the consummation of the Merger.

2.7 Treatment of Warrants. Each (i) warrant outstanding pursuant to the
Warrant Agreement dated as of February 1, 1990 by and between Company and Bank
of America, NT & SA, as Warrant Agent (the "Warrant Agreement") (the "Syntex
Joint Venture Warrants"), (ii) Class A Warrant outstanding issued in connection
with the Sales Agency Agreement dated January 4, 1991 by and between, among
others, PaineWebber Development Corporation and Company (the "Sales Agency
Agreement") (the "Class A Warrants"), (iii) Class B Warrant outstanding issued
in connection with the Sales Agency Agreement (the "Class B Warrants"), (iv)
Investment Executive Warrant outstanding issued in connection with the Sales

4

<PAGE>

Agency Agreement (the "Investment Executive Warrants") and (v) warrant
outstanding issued in connection with Company's purchase of the assets of
Synergen Development Partners Limited (the "Development Partners Warrants")
(collectively, the Syntex Joint Venture Warrants, Class A Warrants, Class B
Warrants, Investment Executive Warrants and Development Partners Warrants are
referred to herein as the "Warrants") will be unaffected by the Merger, except
as otherwise provided in the Warrant Agreement or Warrants.

2.8 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) From and after the Effective Date, a bank or trust company to be
designated by Parent (the "Exchange Agent") shall act as exchange agent in
effecting the exchange of certificates (the "Certificates") for the Merger
Consideration, which Certificates, prior to the Effective Date, represented
Shares entitled to payment pursuant to Section 2.5. On or before the Effective
Date, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the Merger
Consideration in trust for the benefit of the holders of Certificates. Upon the
surrender of each such Certificate and the issuance and delivery by the Exchange
Agent of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, such Certificates shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Shares held by Purchaser,
Parent or Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Purchaser, Parent or
Company or Dissenting Shares) shall represent solely the right to receive the
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such
Certificate. Upon the surrender and exchange of such an outstanding Certificate,
the holder shall receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.
If any cash is to be paid to a name other than the name in which the Certificate
representing Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment or exchange that the person requesting such payment
or exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the payment of such cash to a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or such person shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any Merger Consideration
or interest or other payments made with respect to the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat and similar laws.

(b) Promptly following the date which is six months after the Effective
Date, the Exchange Agent shall return to the Surviving Corporation all Merger
Consideration in its possession relating to the transactions described in this
Agreement, and the Exchange Agent's duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each
holder of a Certificate representing a Share may surrender such Certificate to
the Surviving Corporation and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat
and similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon.

(c) Promptly after the Effective Date, the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each record holder of Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Date
represented Shares, a form of letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
surrendering such Certificates and receiving the Merger Consideration therefor.

(d) After the Effective Date, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any Shares. If, after the
Effective Date, Certificates for Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration, as provided in this Article 2, subject to applicable law
in the case of Dissenting Shares.

3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND PURCHASER

Each of Parent and Purchaser represents and warrants to Company as follows:

3.1 Organization and Qualification. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power to carry on its respective

Purchaser, nor the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Parent and Purchaser with any of the
provisions hereof will (i) violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any
provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination
of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of
termination or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any lien,
security interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of
Parent and Purchaser or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (x) the Certificates of
Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or Purchaser or any other direct or indirect

each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, terminations, accelerations or creations of liens, security interests,
charges or encumbrances which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

the Delaware Law, the Exchange Act, the "takeover" or "blue sky" laws of various
states, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,

required material foreign regulatory approvals, no notice to, filing with, or
authorization, consent or approval of, any domestic or foreign public body or
authority is necessary for the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except where failure to give such

hereunder.

corporate funds, and will make available to Purchaser, all funds necessary to

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and which are not
adequately reflected or reserved against in Company's balance sheet as of
December 31, 1993, including the footnotes thereto (the "Balance Sheet"), except

the acceleration of the vesting or exercisability of any stock options, the
acceleration of the vesting of any restricted stock, the acceleration of
the accrual or vesting of any benefits under any Pension Plan or the
acceleration or creation of any rights under any severance, parachute or
change in control agreement); or

(m) any agreement by Company to do any of the things described in the
preceding clauses (a) through (l) other than as expressly provided for

4.12 Taxes. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has duly filed all
material tax returns it is required to file. Each of Company and its
Subsidiaries has paid (or made adequate provision for payment of) all taxes
shown as due on those returns as well as all taxes, interest, penalties,
assessments and deficiencies due or claimed due from foreign, federal, state or
local taxing authorities (including without limitation taxes on properties,
income, franchises, licenses, sales and payrolls). The filed returns are correct
in all material respects and neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
required to pay, for the periods represented by such tax returns, any material
taxes other than those shown in those returns or reflected on the balance sheet
of Company contained in the most recent SEC Report. Company's and each of its
Subsidiaries' federal income tax returns have not been audited by the Internal
Revenue Service since December 31, 1985. The provision for taxes on the Balance
Sheet is adequate to cover all accrued and unpaid taxes as of the date of the
Balance Sheet. Since December 31, 1991, neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has requested or been granted any extension of limitation periods
applicable to audits or claims by any taxing authority. No material claim,
audit, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is pending or threatened with
respect to any taxes of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no fact or
circumstance that, if known by any federal, state or local taxing authority,
could result in the assertion of a material deficiency with respect to any taxes
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

4.13 Title to Properties; Condition of Properties. The Disclosure
Schedule lists and reasonably describes all material real property owned or
leased by Company and its Subsidiaries. Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
good and valid title (in fee simple absolute in the case of real property) to
all properties and assets used in its business, except for leased properties and
assets; none of those owned properties is subject to any mortgage, deed of
trust, pledge, lien, claim, charge, equity, covenant, condition, restriction,
easement, right-of-way or encumbrance, except (i) liens, claims, charges and
encumbrances disclosed, or reserved against, in the Balance Sheet, (ii) liens
for current taxes not yet due and payable, and (iii) minor imperfections of
title not material (individually or in the aggregate) and not materially
detracting from the value, or the use (either actual or intended) Company and
its Subsidiaries make, of the property in question. All of the buildings,
fixtures, machinery and equipment owned or used by Company and its Subsidiaries
are in reasonably good operating condition and repair, normal wear and tear
excepted, and comply in all material respects with applicable zoning, building
and fire codes.

10

<PAGE>

4.14 Contracts. The Disclosure Schedule lists all material contracts and

in accordance with their respective terms until their respective expiration
dates.

notify Parent if any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with any
person with respect thereto, is made.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required by the fiduciary
obligations of the Board of Directors, as advised by counsel, Company may, in
response to a request or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to result in
an Acquisition Proposal, which request or inquiry was unsolicited after the date

information with respect to Company pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
substantially similar to the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section
6.8), to any person. In addition, following the receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal, which the Board of Directors determines in good faith, based upon the
advice of its outside financial advisors, to be more favorable to Company's
stockholders than the Offer and the Merger (a "Superior Proposal"), Company may
terminate this Agreement under Section 8.1(b)(ii) and accept such Superior
Proposal, and the Board of Directors may approve or recommend (and, in
connection therewith, withdraw or modify the approval or recommendation of the
Offer, this Agreement or the Merger) such Superior Proposal. Nothing contained

the Board of Directors or Company, is required under applicable law.

6.7 Notification of Certain Matters. Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to Company, of (i) the occurrence,
or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure would be likely to
cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedule or any written certificate or schedule delivered pursuant hereto to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to
the time Purchaser first pays for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and
(ii) any material failure of Company, or Parent, Purchaser or any of their
affiliates, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent
thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations to the parties hereunder.

6.8 Access to Information.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of that certain Confidentiality
Agreement dated August 22, 1994 by and between Parent and Company (the

officers, directors, employees and agents to, provide to the officers, employees
and agents (including, without limitation, lawyers and investment bankers) of
Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates reasonable access, at all reasonable
times upon reasonable notice and in such manner as will not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of Company's business, to, from the date hereof to
the Effective Date, Company's officers, employees, agents, properties, books,
records and contracts, and shall furnish to Parent, Purchaser and their
affiliates all financial, operating and other data and information as Parent,

and agreed that Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
laws, indemnify and hold harmless, and, after the Effective Date, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
laws, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director and officer
of Company (the "Indemnified Parties") against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses, judgments and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out
of or pertaining to any action or omission by such director or officer prior to
the Effective Date in his/her capacity as such (including, without limitation,
any claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations which arise out of or
relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that neither Company, Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation
under this Section to indemnify any Indemnified Party hereunder against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, judgments or amounts to
the extent the same is found to have resulted from such Indemnified Person's own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the event any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified Party
(whether arising before or after the Effective Date), (a) the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them and Company (or them and the
Surviving Corporation and Parent after the Effective Date), (b) Company (or
after the Effective Date, the Surviving Corporation and Parent) shall pay all
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received, and (c) Company (or after the Effective Date,
the Surviving Corporation and Parent) will use their respective reasonable
efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter, provided, that
neither Company, the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be liable for any
such settlement effected without their written consent, which consent, however,
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 6.9, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent thereof and shall deliver to Company or the Surviving
Corporation an undertaking to repay any amounts advanced pursuant hereto when
and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, after
exhaustion of all avenues of appeal, that such Indemnified Party was not
entitled to indemnification under this Section. The Indemnified Parties as a
group may retain only one law firm in each jurisdiction to represent them with
respect to any such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of
professional conduct as determined by such counsel, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.
This Section 6.9 shall survive

19

<PAGE>

the consummation of the Merger. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
Company will not be amended in a manner which adversely affects the rights of
the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.9. Nothing contained herein shall
in any way limit the rights of any director or officer under any indemnification
agreement or charter or Bylaw provision of Company existing on the date hereof.

6.10 Severance. If at any time during the one year period following the
Effective Date, Company effects any reduction in employment of any employee who
as of the Effective Date had been an employee of Company, Company shall, except
as otherwise required pursuant to applicable severance agreements, substantially
comply with the Synergen, Inc. August 1, 1994 Severance Benefits Program For
Eligible Employees Below Director Level; Synergen, Inc. August 1, 1994 Severance
Benefits Program For Eligible Director Level Employees; and Synergen, Inc.
August 1, 1994 Severance Benefits Program For Eligible Vice Presidents.

6.11 Liquidated Damages. If Purchaser shall have elected to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(v), then Company shall be obligated to
pay Purchaser $8,000,000 as liquidated damages. The parties acknowledge and
agree that it is difficult or impossible to determine with precision the amount
of damages that would or might be incurred by Purchaser if an event described in
Section 8.1(c)(v) were to occur. It is understood and agreed by the parties that
if Purchaser shall be damaged by an event described in Section 8.1(c)(v), (i) it
would be impracticable or extremely difficult to fix the actual damages
resulting therefrom, (ii) any sums which would be payable by Company under this
Agreement are in the nature of liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and are
fair and reasonable, and (iii) such payment represents a reasonable estimate of
fair compensation for the losses that may reasonably be anticipated from the
occurrence of any such events, and, except for the termination rights of
Purchaser set forth in Section 8.1(c)(v) and Annex I, shall be the sole and
exclusive measure of damages with respect to any such occurrence. Once such
liquidated damages have been paid in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, Company shall be relieved of any further liability in respect of
damages relating to the fact or circumstance giving rise to such liquidated
damages.

by Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates of the shares of Common Stock of
the Surviving Corporation illegal or otherwise prevent the consummation of
the Merger; provided, however, that the parties shall have used all
reasonable efforts to prevent such event.

ANNEX I

Certain Conditions of the Offer. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
the Offer, but subject to the terms of this Agreement, and in addition to the
Minimum Condition, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or pay
for, or may delay the acceptance for payment of or payment for, tendered Shares,
or may, in the sole discretion of Purchaser, terminate the Offer as to any
Shares not then accepted for payment or paid for, if any of the following events
shall occur, which, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser with respect to each
and every matter referred to below and regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any of the following events, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the
Offer, the acceptance for payment or payment for the Shares or the Merger:

(a) The affirmative vote of the holders of more than a majority of the
outstanding Shares is required to consummate the Merger or Purchaser is not
entitled to vote its Shares for the Merger, or the affirmative vote of the
holders of any securities of Company other than the Shares is required to
consummate the Merger;

(b) Any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act shall not have expired or been terminated;

(c) Company shall not have obtained such licenses, permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of governmental
authorities and parties to contracts with Company and its Subsidiaries as
are necessary for consummation of the Merger (excluding licenses, permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications or orders, the failure
of which to obtain would not in the aggregate have a Material Adverse
Effect on Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole);

(d) Company shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
Purchaser its approval or recommendation of the Offer, this Agreement or
the Merger, or the Board of Directors shall have resolved to do any of the
foregoing, except in the case that Purchaser or Parent shall have failed to
perform in any material respect any of their respective material
obligations under this Agreement;

(e) There shall be instituted or pending any action or proceeding
which has a reasonable probability of success before any domestic or
foreign court, legislative body or governmental agency or other regulatory
or administrative agency or commission (i) challenging the acquisition in
whole or in part of the Shares, seeking to restrain or prohibit the making
or consummation of the Offer or seeking to obtain any material damages or
otherwise directly or indirectly relating to the transaction contemplated
by the Offer, (ii) seeking to prohibit or restrict the ownership or
operation by Parent or Purchaser (or any of their respective affiliates or
subsidiaries) of any material portion of its or Company's business or
assets, or to compel Parent or Purchaser (or any of their respective
affiliates or subsidiaries) to dispose of or hold separate all or any
material portion of Company's business or assets as a result of the Offer,
(iii) making the purchase of, or payment for, some or all of the Shares
illegal, (iv) resulting in a delay in the ability of Purchaser to accept
for payment or pay for some or all of the Shares, (v) imposing material
limitations on the ability of Purchaser effectively to acquire or to hold
or to exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares, including, without
limitation, the right to vote the Shares purchased by Purchaser on all
matters properly presented to the stockholders of Company, (vi) imposing
any limitations on the ability of Parent or Purchaser or any of their
respective affiliates or subsidiaries effectively to control in any
material respect the business and operations of Company; (vii) which
otherwise is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; or (viii) which may result in a
material limitation on the benefits expected to be derived by Parent and
Purchaser as a result of the Offer, including without limitation, any
limitation on the ability to consummate the Merger;

(f) Any statute, rule, regulation or order shall be enacted,
promulgated, entered or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger, or
any other action shall have been taken, proposed or threatened, by any
domestic or foreign government or governmental authority or by any court,
domestic or foreign, which, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser, is
reasonably likely, directly or indirectly, to result in any of the
consequences referred to in clauses (i)-(viii) of subsection (e) above;

I-1

<PAGE>

(g) Any change (or any development involving a prospective change)
shall have occurred which in the judgment of Purchaser had, or may
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

(h) Company shall have breached or failed to perform in all material
respects any of its obligations or agreements under this Agreement, or any
of the representations and warranties of Company set forth in this
Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule or in any written certificate or
schedule delivered pursuant thereto shall be, or have become, inaccurate or
incomplete in any respect, in each case, with such exceptions as would not
in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

(i) This Agreement shall have been terminated by Company, Parent or
Purchaser pursuant to its terms;

(j) Any "Triggering Event" under the Rights Agreement shall have
occurred and the Rights shall not be redeemable by Company; or

(k) (1) a Stipulation of Settlement shall not have been entered into
by Company and certain plaintiffs (the "Plaintiffs") (the "Stipulation of
Settlement") constituting, subject to court approval, a legally binding
agreement for the full and complete settlement of the class action
litigation captioned In re Synergen, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No.
93-B-402, pending in the United States District Court for the District of
Colorado (the "Court"), as such settlement is described in that certain
Memorandum of Understanding dated the date hereof by and between Company
and the Plaintiffs (the "MOU"), (2) the Stipulation of Settlement shall not
be in full force and effect or shall not reasonably reflect the terms and
conditions of the MOU or (3) the Court shall not have entered a Scheduling
Order providing for, (a) approval of a form of notice to the class members
of the Stipulation of Settlement and a deadline for giving notice to the
class members, (b) deadlines for class members to object to the settlement
and/or to opt out of the class and (c) a hearing date upon which the Court
will consider whether to grant final approval of the Stipulation of
Settlement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and may be
asserted regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions or
may be waived in whole or in part. The failure to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, and each right shall be
deemed a continuing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.
