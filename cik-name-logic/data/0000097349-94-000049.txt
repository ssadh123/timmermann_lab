TEXACO REPORTS RESULTS
----------------------
FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS 1994
------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1994.
- -------------------------------------------------
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., Oct. 25 - Texaco announced today that consolidated
worldwide net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 1994 
was $281 million, or $.98 per share, compared with $317 million, or $1.13 per 
share, for the third quarter of 1993. Net income from continuing operations 
for the first nine months of 1994 was $598 million, or $2.02 per share, 
compared with $910 million, or $3.22 per share, for the first nine months 
of 1993.

In commenting on 1994's results Alfred C. DeCrane, Jr., Texaco's Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer stated, "The third quarter results 
reflect solid benefits over last year from improved operating performance and 
expense containment efforts. Higher international crude oil production, higher
natural gas production in the U.S. and the North Sea, coupled with higher 
worldwide crude prices were sufficient to offset the decline in natural gas
prices, depressed downstream margins in the eastern half of the U.S. and in 
Europe, and refinery downtime in Pembroke, Wales, due to a July fire."

Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 1994 
included a special charge of $20 million by an insurance subsidiary related 
to property damage from the fire at the Pembroke refinery, as well as a 
special gain of $23 million from the sale of an interest in a downstream joint
venture in Sweden. Results for the nine months of 1994 also included net
special charges of $119 million relating to staff reductions and write-down 
of certain assets being offered for sale in the company's program to 
consolidate activities and sell non-core assets. Nine months and third quarter
of 1993 included special charges of $235 million related to staff reductions, 
write-down of assets and provisions for financial reserves, partly offset by
$152 million of net deferred tax benefits principally arising from reduced tax 
rates in the United Kingdom. Net income from continuing operations for the 
third quarter and nine months of 1994 included $8 million and $87 million, 
respectively, of net tax benefits realizable through the sale of an interest 
in a subsidiary. Similar benefits of $145 million were recognized in 1993. 
Net income for the nine months of 1994 included a second quarter charge 
of $87 million for discontinued operations relating to the completion of the 
first phase of a transaction to sell substantially all of Texaco's worldwide 
chemical business. Comparatively, a charge of $164 million was recorded in 
the third quarter of 1993, reflecting the initial projected effects of
these sales. Of the previously mentioned tax benefits on the sale of an 
interest in a subsidiary, $29 million and $145 million for the first nine 
months 1994 and 1993, respectively, were realizable due to the taxable gain 
on the sale of the chemical operations. Negotiations for the second phase 
of this sale, consisting of the lubricant additives business, are continuing.
Capital and exploratory expenditures for continuing operations, including
equity in such expenditures of affiliates, were $1,788 million for the first 
nine months of 1994, as compared to $1,887 million for the same period in 1993.
Expenditures for the third quarter of 1994 amounted to $557 million versus 
$732 million for the same quarter in 1993.
"Third quarter operating performance and financial results reflect the 
program for value growth and competitive improvement," DeCrane added. "Solid 
increases in international production, the initial benefits of reduced layers 
of supervision and a more focused exploration and development program all 
contributed to the improvement."

</TABLE>

Lower natural gas prices of $.33 per MCF in the 1994 third quarter 
adversely impacted comparative earnings. These lower natural gas prices more 
than offset the benefits from higher crude oil prices of $1.27 per barrel for 
the quarter. In spite of the gradually improving crude oil prices during 1994,
nine months earnings were adversely impacted by the depressed prices early in 
this year, which resulted in comparatively lower crude oil prices of $1.80 
per barrel.
The company's results in 1994 benefitted from further reductions in 
operating expenses and added production from successful exploration and 
development programs.
Special charges for 1994 provide for the estimated cost of announced 
employee separations. Special charges in 1993 included a deferred tax charge 
of $32 million due to the U.S. tax rate increase to 35 percent effective 
January 1, 1993, coupled with charges relating to staff reductions.

</TABLE>

Results for the comparative third quarter and nine month periods were 
essentially unchanged. Both periods benefitted from higher gasoline sales 
following the March 1994 successful introduction of Texaco's CleanSystem3 
gasolines. In the western half of the U.S., third quarter 1994 earnings 
reflect improved performance at refineries partly offset by higher refinery 
feedstock costs. For the nine months, earnings in the western U.S. benefitted 
from both improved refinery performance plus lower average feedstock costs 
occurring in the first half of the year. These improvements were generally 
offset by decreased refinery margins in the East and Gulf coasts, particularly 
in the third quarter, reflecting feedstock costs that could not be fully 
recovered in the marketplace.
Special charges for 1994 relate to the adjustment to fair market value of 
certain facilities to be offered for sale and the estimated cost of employee 
separations. Results for 1993 included special charges for staff reductions, 
environmental reserves and the U.S. tax rate increase.

</TABLE>

Results for the third quarter 1994 improved substantially over 1993 
reflecting a combination of increased international production of both crude 
oil and natural gas mainly in the U.K. sector of the North Sea, lower 
exploratory expenses, and somewhat higher crude prices. For the comparative
first nine months, earnings benefitted also from higher production, mainly in 
the North Sea and in Indonesia. However, generally lower crude oil prices 
prevailing in the first half of 1994 more than offset the benefit of 
increased production.

The 1994 third quarter and nine months included non-cash charges of $7 
million and $18 million, respectively, relating to the currency exchange 
impacts of the Pound Sterling on deferred income taxes. For 1993, such 
currency exchange impacts resulted in a charge of $2 million for the third 
quarter and a $4 million benefit for the nine months.

Special charges for 1994 related to the adjustment to fair market value 
of certain facilities being offered for sale and the estimated cost of employee
separations. The third quarter of 1993 included a benefit of $169 million 
relating to changes in the U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax associated with the 
taxability of certain items, as well as a tax rate reduction from 75 percent
to 50 percent. Special charges in 1993 related to staff reductions and the 
write-down of the carrying value of certain assets, principally in the North 
Sea, brought about by changes in the Petroleum Revenue Tax laws.

</TABLE>

Results for both the third quarter and nine months of 1994 versus 1993 
reflect the decline in marketing margins in Europe, as well as lower refining 
margins and unfavorable currency exchange effects in the Caltex operating 
areas. Also, earnings were comparatively lower due to downtime resulting from 
a fire at the Pembroke refinery. Partly offsetting these decreases were higher
marketing margins and sales volumes in Latin America, mainly Brazil.
The 1994 third quarter and nine months included non-cash charges of $8 
million and $20 million, respectively, relating to the currency exchange 
impacts of the Pound Sterling on deferred income taxes. 
The third quarter of 1994 included a special gain of $23 million related 
to the sale of an interest in a downstream joint venture in Sweden. In 
addition to the gain in Sweden, the nine months of 1994 included special 
charges related to the estimated cost of employee separations, and the 
adjustment to fair market value of certain properties being offered for sale.
The third quarter and nine months of 1993 included special charges related
to staff reductions and the write-down in the carrying values of certain assets.

</TABLE>

Results for the third quarter and nine months were principally impacted by
reduced capitalization of interest expense due to project completions, which 
was partially offset by lower corporate overhead due to the company's ongoing 
expense reduction efforts.
The 1994 results included $87 million of tax benefits realizable through 
the sale of an interest in a subsidiary of which $8 million was realized in 
the third quarter. In addition, $17 million of charges related to the 
estimated cost of employee separations were included in the nine month results.
The third quarter and nine months 1993 included net tax benefits realizable 
through the sale of an interest in a subsidiary of $145 million. Special 
charges and credits in 1993 related mainly to staff reductions.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES
International upstream capital and exploratory expenditures declined for 
the comparative nine months and third quarter periods reflecting lower 
expenditures in the U.K. North Sea, where successful project completions have 
increased production of liquids and natural gas. Partly offsetting this decline
for the comparative nine months were higher drilling and development activities
in the United States, which began in the third quarter of 1993.

<PAGE>

Downstream international expenditures for the first nine months of 1994 
increased as compared to the same period of 1993 reflecting investments by 
Texaco's affiliate, Caltex, in refinery construction and upgrade projects in 
Thailand and Singapore and increased marketing expenditures, as well as ongoing
refinery upgrades in Panama and increased marketing expenditures in selected 
European and Latin American countries. These increases were partially offset 
by lower expenditures in the U.S. due to completion of refinery upgrade 
projects underway in 1993 by both Texaco and its affiliate, Star Enterprise, 
and lower marketing investments.
