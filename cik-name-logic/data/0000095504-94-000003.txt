NEWS RELEASE

SUPER FOOD SERVICES, INC.

SUBJECT: Lawsuit Against Albertson's Inc.

FOR: Immediate Release

For additional information contact: Jack Twyman/John Demos

DAYTON, OHIO---SUPER FOOD SERVICES, INC., (NYSE:SFS) Jack
Twyman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Super
Food Services, Inc., announced today that in a previously reported
action in the Circuit Court for the Ninth Judicial Circuit of
Florida, the Court on March 31, 1994 granted Albertson's motion for
summary judgment on Count 4 of the Company's Second Amended Com-
plaint relating to the breach by Albertson's, Inc., of a settlement
agreement for the purchase by Albertson's, Inc., of the assets of
the Company's Florida Division. On March 25, 1994, the Company and
Albertson's entered into a joint stipulation to the entry of a
final judgment as to Counts 1, 2 and 3 of the Company's Second
Amended Complaint relating to the breach by Albertson's of a
requirements contract with the Company. The Company agreed to
enter into a joint stipulation on Counts 1, 2 and 3 of the Second
Amended Complaint after the Court denied Albertson's summary
judgment motion on these counts but ruled that if a requirements
contract existed between the parties, the contract was terminable
by either party upon reasonable notice and that the issue to be
tried would be limited to whether Albertson's notice of termination
was reasonable, which the Company did not allege as an issue in the
lawsuit.

Mr. Twyman commented that the Company's management was aston-
ished with the findings of the Court and that the Company intends
to appeal from the agreed final judgment on Counts 1, 2 and 3 on
the ground that the requirements contract between the parties was
not terminable upon reasonable notice but terminable only for
cause. Mr. Twyman further commented that the Company also intends
to appeal Count 4. It is the opinion of special counsel for the
Company handling this case that the findings of the Court are
clearly erroneous as a matter of law and should be reversed on
appeal and that the issues in the lawsuit will ultimately be
resolved in the Company's favor.
