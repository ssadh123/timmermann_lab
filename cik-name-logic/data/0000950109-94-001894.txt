EXHIBIT 99.1

RESOLVED, that the Second Amended and Restated By-Laws shall be amended to
delete Section 4.3 and replace it with a new Section 4.3 to read as follows:

4.3 Vacancies; Increases. If any or all of the Trust Managers
-------------------- 
cease to be Trust Managers hereunder, whether by reason of
resignation, removal, incapacity, death or otherwise, such event shall
not terminate the Trust or affect its continuity. Until such vacancies
are filled, the remaining Trust Manager or Trust Managers (even though
fewer than three) may exercise the powers of the Trust Managers
hereunder. A replacement for any vacancy occurring in an Independent
Trust Manager's position shall be nominated by the remaining
Independent Trust Managers, if any. Vacancies may be filled either by
a majority of the remaining Trust Managers or by the vote of the
holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding Shares at an annual or
special meeting of the Shareholders. A Trust Manager elected by the
Trust Managers to fill a vacancy shall hold office only until the next
annual election of Trust Managers by the Shareholders. A Trust Manager
elected by the Shareholders to fill a vacancy shall hold office until
the next annual meeting of Shareholders and until their successors are
elected and qualified. Any Trust Manager elected to fill a vacancy
created by the resignation, removal or death of a former Trust Manager
shall hold office for the unexpired term of such former Trust Manager.

Notwithstanding any provision in these By-Laws to the contrary,
any vacancy created by reason of an increase in the number of Trust
Managers shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining Trust Managers, though less than a quorum of the full Board
of Trust Managers. A Trust Manager elected to fill a vacancy created
by reason of an increase in the number of Trust Managers shall hold
office only until the next annual election of Trust Managers by the
Shareholders.
