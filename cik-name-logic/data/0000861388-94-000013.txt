LG&E Power/DuPont End Negotiations on Power Partnership

Fairfax, VA - LG&E Power Inc. and DuPont have ended negotiations without
reaching final agreement on a plan to form a partnership that would have owned
and operated power generation facilities at nine DuPont fiber manufacturing
sites on the East Coast.

"We believe the strategy of partnering with industrials to manage their
energy needs on-site is clearly a viable concept," said Mike McInnis, LG&E
Power senior vice president - development and marketing. "While the
negotiations with DuPont did not result in a final agreement, we expect this
approach will still eventually develop in the industry."

The two companies had signed a letter of intent in February 1994 but were
not able to reach mutually acceptable contract terms. LG&E Power late last
year won a bid on DuPont's proposal to spin off the power generation functions
at its fiber plants in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and
Delaware. The plants generate steam, chilled water and compressed air used in
the fiber manufacturing process, as well as the electric power required by the
energy complex.

"Our approach to this concept has stimulated several inquiries from other
major corporations," said McInnis. "We are now holding discussions with
several large industrial energy users who want to pursue the benefits of having
a qualified partner help them with site-based energy services."

LG&E Power, a subsidiary of LG&E Energy Corp. in Louisville, Kentucky, is a
fully integrated power project developer and wholesale power marketer with coal
or natural gas fired plants in Virginia, North Carolina, New York and Maine. 
It also operates for others 12 plants in Pennsylvania, Montana and California,
and owns a partnership interest in wind power projects in Minnesota and
California.
