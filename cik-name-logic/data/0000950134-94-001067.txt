STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of
August 22, 1994, by and among LDDS Communications, Inc., a Georgia corporation
(the "Buyer"), The Williams Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Seller"), and WTG Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Selling 
Subsidiary").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Selling Subsidiary, and the Selling Subsidiary
owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock (the "Shares") of Williams
Telecommunications Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"); and

WHEREAS, the Selling Subsidiary wishes to, and the Seller
wishes to cause Selling Subsidiary to, sell the Shares to the Buyer, and the
Buyer wishes to purchase the Shares from the Selling Subsidiary, on the terms
and conditions and for the consideration described in this Agreement
(capitalized and other terms defined as provided in Article VIII hereof being
used as therein defined);

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
promises, covenants, agreements, representations and warranties hereinafter set
forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I
PURCHASE AND SALE

1.1. Purchase and Sale; Purchase Price. (a) Each of the Seller
and the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the representations, covenants,
warranties, agreements, indemnities and other undertakings contained in this
Agreement are made for the benefit of the other such party hereto and that the
parties hereto, in reliance thereon, have agreed to execute this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the
Closing Date, the Selling Subsidiary shall, and the Seller shall cause the
Selling Subsidiary to,

<PAGE> 10
sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to the Buyer free and clear of all
Liens other than any Lien arising as a result of any action taken by the Buyer
or the Buyer Affiliates, and the Buyer shall purchase, all right, title and
interest in and to the Shares.

(b) In full payment for the Shares, and also in consideration
of the representations, covenants, warranties, agreements and indemnities
contained in this Agreement, the Buyer shall pay, and the Selling Subsidiary
shall accept (and the Seller shall cause the Selling Subsidiary to accept), at
the Closing, subject to the provisions of this Agreement and any applicable
withholding requirements, an amount equal to $2,500,000,000 (2.5 billion U.S.
dollars) plus the Additional Amount, if any (as such aggregate amount may be
adjusted as provided in Sections 4.7(b) and 4.15, the "Purchase Price"). As
used in this Agreement, the term "Additional Amount" means, in the event that
the Closing shall occur after January 2, 1995, an amount equivalent to interest
on $2,500,000,000, for the period from January 2, 1995 to the Closing Date, at
a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published by The Wall Street
Journal from time to time (calculated on the basis of a 365-day year, for the
actual number of days elapsed during the period from but not including January
2, 1995 to and including the Closing Date).

1.2. Time and Place of Closing. The closing of the sale and
purchase of the Shares (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Debevoise & Plimpton, 875 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022, at 10:00 a.m.
on December 1, 1994, or such other time, date and place as the Buyer and the
Seller may mutually determine as soon as practicable after all of the
conditions hereunder to the obligations of the parties hereto shall have been
satisfied or waived (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").
At the Closing:

(a) the Selling Subsidiary shall deliver (and the Seller shall
cause the Selling Subsidiary to deliver) to the Buyer, free and clear
of all Liens other than any Lien arising as a result of any action
taken by the Buyer or the Buyer Affiliates, certificates representing
the Shares, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers or
other instruments of transfer duly executed in blank, and bearing or
accompanied by all requisite stock transfer stamps; and

2
<PAGE> 11
(b) the Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price to the Selling
Subsidiary for the Shares so delivered by the Selling Subsidiary, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the
Selling Subsidiary designated at least two business days prior to the
Closing Date.

ARTICLE 11
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER

The Buyer represents and warrants to the Seller as follows,
which representations and warranties are made as of the date hereof and (with
such changes as the Seller may hereafter expressly consent to in writing prior
to the Closing Date) as of the Closing Date:

2.1. Organization. The Buyer is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Georgia.

2.2. Authorization. The Buyer has full corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Buyer of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been, or as of the Closing Date will have
been, duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of the Buyer. The Buyer has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and on
the Closing Date shall have duly executed and delivered the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party. This Agreement constitutes, and the
Ancillary Agreements when executed and delivered shall constitute, legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Buyer, enforceable against the Buyer in
accordance with their terms, subject to (i) general principles of equity,
regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at
law, and (ii) bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
moratorium, receivership or other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally.

2.3. Non-Contravention. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance by the Buyer of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to which
the Buyer is a party, nor

3
<PAGE> 12
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will
conflict with, contravene, result in the breach of any term or provision of, or
constitute a default under (with or without the giving of notice or the lapse
of time or both), create in any other Person a right or claim of termination,
amendment, modification, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of any Lien (or any obligation to create any Lien) upon any of the
properties of the Buyer under, (a) any provision of the Organizational
Documents of the Buyer, (b) any Law applicable to the Buyer or (c) any
agreement (including without limitation any loan agreement or promissory note
or indenture), or instrument to which the Buyer is a party or by which it is
bound, except in the case of the preceding clauses (b) and (c) for conflicts,
contraventions, breaches, defaults, rights, claims and Liens that (x) would
exist if the Governmental Approvals and Consents set forth in Schedule 2.5 of
the written disclosure schedule previously delivered by the Buyer to the Seller
(the "Buyer Disclosure Schedule") were not obtained or made, or (y)
individually and in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of the Buyer to perform its obligations hereunder
and under the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party.

2.4. Financing Commitment. The Buyer has delivered to the
Seller copies of binding commitment letters (the "Commitment Letters") pursuant
to which the lenders party thereto have advised the Buyer that they are
willing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letters, to provide financing to the Buyer in an aggregate amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.5. Governmental Approvals and Consents. Schedule 2.5 of the

and Bylaws (the "Organizational Documents") of each member of the Company Group,

(b) The Selling Subsidiary owns, beneficially and of record,
the Shares free and clear of all Liens. Upon consummation of the transactions

and clear of any Lien other than Permitted Liens (and except for defects in the
title of the underlying fee owner), and enjoys peaceful and undisturbed
possession under its respective Leases, except for such failures to have such
title or possession that, individually and in the aggregate, would not

and none of the currently or formerly owned or leased Real Property,
is, to the best knowledge of each member of the Seller Group, the
subject of any investigation or evaluation by any Governmental
Authority as to whether any Remedial Action is needed to respond to a
Release or threatened Release of any Hazardous Materials, which
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
or result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(2) The Company Group has filed all notices required to be
filed by any member thereof under any Environmental Law, except to the
extent that the failure to file, individually and in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

(c) There are no environmental conditions on any Real Property
or (to the best knowledge of each member of the Seller Group) Rights of Way
that would reasonably be expected to result in a requirement under
Environmental Laws that any member of the Company Group perform Remedial
Actions that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have or result in a Material Adverse Effect.

12
<PAGE> 21
(d) The Seller has made available to the Buyer all written

Group has good and valid title to all Owned Intellectual Property set forth or

or more of the members of the Company Group will own all Owned Intellectual

whatever medium to the extent that the same relate to the Company Group's
existing contracts, disputes, negotiations, proposals or other contacts with
the buyer or its Affiliates; provided that to the extent that the same do not
relate thereto, the Seller shall afford such access to, and provide such copies
of, such portions of the same that do not so relate.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of Section 4.3(a) or 4.3(d),
the Seller may restrict access to customer Contracts, marketing strategies and
customer pricing data, to the Buyer's lenders and the attorneys and accountants

only be used as permitted by Section 3(d) of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, and
(unless and until the Closing shall occur) shall not use such information to
solicit the customers of, or otherwise to compete with, the Company Group. The
Buyer shall so advise such lenders, attorneys and accountants as required by
Section 3(c) of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

4.3(e) hereof, the Seller shall, and shall cause each member of the Seller
Group to, permit the Buyer and its Affiliates (including each member of the
Company Group) reasonable access, during reasonable business hours and at the
Buyer's expense, to the relevant books and records (including all relevant Tax
Returns and related work papers) of any member of the Seller Group in existence
at the Closing Date relating to the Business or the Company Group, and (ii) 
subject to the Buyer's record retention policies as presently in effect, the 
Buyer shall, and shall cause each member of the Company Group to, permit each 
member of the Seller Group reasonable access, during reasonable business hours 
and at the Seller's expense, to the relevant books and records (including all 
relevant Tax Returns and related work papers) of each member of the Company 
Group in existence at the Closing Date relating to the Business or the Company 
Group. Except to the extent required by law or legal process, the Seller shall,

4.4. Governmental Approvals. Consents, Filings and Further
Actions. (a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as practicable, (i) make, or
cause to be made, all filings and submissions (including but not limited to
under the HSR Act) required under any Law applicable to such party (or in the
case of the Seller, any member of the Seller Group), and give such reasonable
undertakings as may be required in connection therewith, and (ii) use all
reasonable efforts to obtain or make, or cause to be obtained or made, all
Governmental Approvals and Consents necessary to be obtained or made by such
party (or in the case of the Seller, any member of the Seller Group), in each
case in connection with this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, the sale
and transfer of the Shares pursuant hereto, or the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to
be done all other things, necessary, proper or advisable in order for such
party (or in the case of the

39
<PAGE> 48
Seller, each member of the Seller Group) to fulfill and perform its obligations
in respect of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party, or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

(b) The Buyer shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain as
promptly as practicable the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters
(or alternative financing on terms substantially comparable to those
contemplated by the Commitment Letters), providing sufficient funds for the
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, pursuant to
definitive agreements in form and substance satisfactory to the Buyer in its
reasonable judgment.

(c) The Buyer shall use all reasonable efforts to assist the
Seller (and the Seller shall cooperate fully with the Buyer) in obtaining
releases of the Seller's obligations under the Sale-Leaseback Guarantees, which
efforts shall include without limitation offering (i) to enter into substitute
guarantees on terms mutually satisfactory to the Sale-Leaseback Parties and the
Buyer in their reasonable judgment, provided that in no event shall any such
substitute guarantee be required to contain financial covenants that are any
more restrictive than those that are contained in the Buyer Financing
Agreements, and (ii) to provide to the Sale-Leaseback Parties a letter of
credit on commercially reasonable terms in a face amount not to exceed
$29,000,000, in substitution for the currently outstanding letter of credit
provided by the Seller. The Buyer's obligations under this Section 4.4(c) shall
not require the Buyer to agree to any additional or different terms of the
Sale-Leaseback Financings. In the event that the Buyer and the Seller are
unable to obtain releases of the Seller's obligations under the Sale-Leaseback
Guarantees, the Buyer and the Seller shall, at or prior to the Closing, enter
into an agreement pursuant to which the Buyer shall agree to indemnify the
Seller against any obligation the Seller may incur from and after the closing
under the Sale-Leaseback Guarantees on terms mutually satisfactory to the Buyer
and the Seller in their reasonable judgment, and the Buyer shall pay to the
Seller a fee of $1,000,000 per annum until such time as the Seller shall be
released from its obligations under the Sale-Leaseback Guarantees. The Seller
agrees to use reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the Sale-Leaseback
Parties to the termination of any continuing requirement for the provision of
letters of credit in respect of the Sale-Leaseback Financings.

40
<PAGE> 49

hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto in writing of any fact,
condition, event or occurrence that would reasonably be expected to result in
the failure of any of the conditions contained in Section 5.2 (in the case of
the Seller) or Section 5.1 (in the case of the Buyer) to be satisfied, promptly
upon becoming aware of the same.

4.5. Further Assurances. Following the Closing Date, the Buyer
and the Seller shall, the Buyer shall cause each member of the Company Group
to, and the Seller shall cause each other member of the Seller Group to, from
time to time, execute and deliver such additional instruments, documents,
conveyances or assurances and take such other actions as shall be necessary, or
otherwise reasonably be requested by the Seller or the Buyer as the case may
be, to confirm and assure the rights and obligations provided for in this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and render effective the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or otherwise to carry out the
intent and purposes of this Agreement (which include the transfer to the Buyer
of the ownership and intended related benefits of the Business and the Company
Group).

4.6. Taxes. (a) Tax Sharing Agreements. On the Closing Date,
all Tax sharing agreements and arrangements between any member of the Company

41
<PAGE> 50
of-pocket expenses and reasonable attorneys and accountants' fees and expenses

preserving or enforcing any of their respective rights hereunder, but not
including any Income Taxes imposed upon the receipt by a Buyer Indemnitee of a
payment under this Section 4.6(b)(i), which any of the foregoing may incur or

Seller or any of the Non-Company Affiliates is or was a member pursuant to any
similar provision of any state, local or foreign law with respect to Income
Taxes, and (F) all Taxes that may be imposed, and other amounts

42
<PAGE> 51
that may become payable to third parties, that would not be imposed or payable
if there were no inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in Section 3.17 (such inaccuracy or breach to be determined based on a
conclusive presumption that, if a matter has occurred, any requirement on
qualification that such matter "reasonably be expected" to occur or not occur
shall have been satisfied; and the indemnification for such inaccuracy or
breach by the Seller under this Section 4.6(b)(i) shall, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 4.6(b)(i), be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Buyer after the Closing for such inaccuracy or breach of any such
representation or warranty); provided, however, that the Seller shall not be

the taxable periods that include the Closing Date, in either case to the extent
such Taxes are shown as due on the relevant Tax Return timely filed and
prepared in a manner consistent with past practices used in preparing such Tax
Returns, (II) in respect of any Taxes with respect to which an audit or similar
proceeding is pending and a deficiency has been assessed or proposed to be
assessed against the relevant member of the Company Group and has not been paid
as of the Closing, (III) in respect of any Taxes for which an election, consent
or extension agreement described in clause (iii)(B) of Section 3.17(a) was
filed or entered into after the date hereof and prior to the Closing or (IV) in
respect of any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are attributable to an election
described in the third sentence of Section 3.17(o) that is made after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing, and (y) nothing herein shall limit in any way
the Buyer's remedies in respect of (and the preceding proviso shall not apply
in the event of) any actual fraud by any member of the Seller Group. With
respect to payments required to be made pursuant to clause (C) above, Tax
liability shall be computed in a manner consistent with past practices used in
preparing Tax Returns and, as between the Seller and the Buyer, such liability
shall be apportioned between the period through and including the Closing Date
(for which the Seller

43
<PAGE> 52
shall be responsible under clause (C) above), on the one hand, and the balance
of the tax year (for which the Buyer shall be responsible under Section
4.6(b)(ii)), on the other hand, based upon the number of days in each such
period, unless with respect to any specified Tax other than property Taxes
either party shall request that such amount for such specified Tax be
determined based upon the actual books and records, in which case such amount
shall be determined based upon the actual books and records, provided that in
all cases the Seller shall be responsible for all Taxes arising from the

Income Tax law (other than those sales and transfer taxes for which the Buyer
is responsible under Section 4.6(f)).

in this Agreement, the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid (without duplication
of amounts otherwise payable), all Taxes payable with respect to any member of
the Company Group (A) for all periods or portions thereof beginning after the
Closing Date (including Taxes for which the Buyer shall be responsible under
the last sentence of Section 4.6(b)(i)) and (A) attributable to operations,
acts or omissions of the Buyer or (after the consummation of the Closing) any
member of the Company Group on the Closing Date which are not in the Ordinary
Course of Business other than such operations, acts or omissions contemplated
by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

(c) Tax Returns. (i) The Seller's Responsibility. The Seller
shall file, or cause to be filed, and the Seller and the Buyer shall cause the
Company Group, to the extent permitted by law, to join, for all taxable periods
or portions thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date, in (A) the
consolidated federal Income Tax Returns of the Seller's Consolidated Group and
(B) the combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Returns for state, local and
foreign Income Taxes which include the Seller or any Non-Company Affiliate and
with respect to which any member of the Company Group (x) joined in such a Tax
Return for the most recent taxable period for which a Tax Return has been filed
prior to the Closing Date and may file such a Tax Return for subsequent taxable
periods or (y) is required to join in such a Tax Return. The income, deductions
and credits of any such member of the Company Group for all periods or portions
thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be included in the
consolidated federal Income Tax Returns of thy Seller's Consolidated Group and
in such combined, con-

44
<PAGE> 53
solidated and unitary Tax Returns where applicable. The Seller shall file, or
cause to be filed, all other Tax Returns with respect to any member of the
Company Group for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

(ii) The Buyer's Responsibility. The Buyer shall file, or
cause to be filed, all Tax Returns relating to the business or assets of the
Company Group other than those Tax Returns described in Section 4.6(c)(i)
(including, without limitation, any federal Income Tax Return filed by the
consolidated group of which the Buyer is a member with respect to any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date). The income, deductions and credits of
the Company Group, other than those required to be included in the Tax Returns
described in Section 4.6(c)(i), shall be included in the Tax Returns described
in the immediately preceding sentence.

(iii) Cooperation. The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate,
and the Buyer shall cause the Company Group to cooperate with the Seller, with
respect to the preparation and filing of any Tax Return for which the other is
responsible pursuant to this Section 4.6(c).

(d) Refunds. Subject to the provisions of this Section 4.6(d),
(i) the Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment from
the Company Group or the Buyer of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes
(including, without limitation, refunds and credits arising by reason of
amended Returns filed after the Closing Date), plus any interest received with
respect thereto from the applicable taxing authorities, relating to any member
of the Company Group that are described as being the responsibility of the
Seller in Section 4.6(b)(i) and (ii) the Buyer or the Company Group shall be
entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment from the Seller of, any refund
or credit with respect to Taxes, plus any interest received with respect
thereto from the applicable taxing authorities, relating to any member of the
Company Group that are described as being the responsibility of the Buyer in
Section 4.6(b)(ii). The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate, and the Buyer
shall cause the Company Group to cooperate with the Seller, with respect to
claiming any refund or credit with respect to Taxes referred to in this Section
4.6(d). Such cooperation shall include providing all relevant information
available to the Seller or the Buyer (through the Company or otherwise), as the
case may be, with respect to any such claim; filing and diligently pursuing
such claim (including by litigation, if appropriate); paying over to the Seller
or

45
<PAGE> 54
the Buyer, as the case may be, in accordance with this provision, any amount
received by the Buyer (or any member of the Company Group) or the Seller (or
any Non-Company Affiliate), as the case may be, with respect to such claim;
and, in the case of the party filing such a claim, consulting with the other
party prior to agreeing to any disposition of such claim, provided, that the
foregoing shall be done in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with
the conduct of the business of the parties. The party that is to enjoy the
economic benefit of a refund under this Section 4.6(d) shall bear the
out-of-pocket expenses of the other party reasonably incurred in seeking such
refund. If one party is to enjoy the economic benefit of a refund under this
Section 4.6(d) but the refund involves an issue that (A) in the case of the
Buyer, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (B)
in the case of the Seller, would reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the business, operations, results of operations or financial
condition of the Seller Group taken as a whole (provided that for purposes of
this clause (B), the materiality shall exist if an amount involved is
comparable to the amount that would result in a Material Adverse Effect), the
party that would enjoy the economic benefit shall give notice to the other
party of such issue, with respect to which the parties, each at its own
expense, shall jointly pursue such issue, and any disagreement between them as
to such issue shall be resolved pursuant to the Tax Dispute Resolution
Mechanism.

(e) Audits. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall promptly
notify the other in writing within twenty days from its receipt of notice of
(i) any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments of any member of the
Company Group, as long as any taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date remain open and (ii) any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments
of the Buyer or the Seller, or any of the Affiliates thereof, that may affect
the Tax liabilities of any member of the Company Group, in each case for
taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. The Seller shall have
the right to represent the interests of the Company Group in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding to the extent relating to Taxes that are
described as being the responsibility of the Seller in Section 4.6(b)(i), and
to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, provided, that the Seller shall
give notice to the Buyer with respect to any issue relating to such audit or
proceeding that would reasonably be expected to affect the aggregate Tax
liability of the Buyer or the

46
<PAGE> 55
Company Group by more than $1,000,000 (taking into account any recurring
effects of such issue) with respect to Taxes that are described as being the
responsibility of the Buyer in Section 4.6(b)(ii), with respect to which issue
the Seller and the Buyer, each at its own expense, shall jointly have the right
to represent the interests of the Company Group, and any disagreement between
the Seller and the Buyer as to such issue shall be resolved pursuant to the Tax
Dispute Resolution Mechanism. The Buyer shall have the right to represent the
interests of the Company Group in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding not described in the immediately preceding sentence and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense, provided, that the Buyer shall give
notice to the Seller with respect to any issue relating to such audit or
proceeding that would reasonably be expected to affect the aggregate Tax
liability of the Seller or the Company Group by more than $1,000,000 (taking
into account any recurring effects of such issue) with respect to Taxes that
are described as being the responsibility of the Seller in Section 4.6(b)(i),
with respect to which issue the Buyer and the Seller, each at its own expense,
shall jointly have the right to represent the interests of the Company Group,
and any disagreement between the Seller and the Buyer as to such issue shall be
resolved pursuant to the Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanism. The Buyer and the
Seller shall cooperate, and the Buyer shall cause the Company Group to
cooperate with the Seller, with respect to any Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding relating to Taxes referred to in this Section 4.6(e). Such
cooperation shall include providing all relevant information available to the
Seller or the Buyer (through the Company or otherwise), as the case may be,
with respect to any such audit or proceeding and making personnel available at
and for reasonable times, provided, that the foregoing shall be done in a
manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
the parties.

(f) Transaction-Related Taxes. The Seller shall be responsible
for, and neither the Buyer nor any member of the Company Group shall bear, any
Taxes that relate to the purchase and sale of the shares pursuant to this
Agreement and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, any real property gains and transfer Taxes but
not including any Income Taxes imposed upon the receipt by a Buyer Indemnitee
of a payment under this Section 4.6(f)), except for up to $100,000 in the
aggregate of the sum of (i) stock transfer taxes imposed on the transfer of the
Shares to the Buyer (other than any

47
<PAGE> 56
interest or penalty thereon or additions thereto resulting from the negligence
or willful misconduct of the Seller or any Non-Company Affiliate) and (ii)
sales and transfer taxes resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election and all
comparable elections under state and local Income Tax law (other than any
interest or penalty thereon or additions thereto resulting from the negligence
or willful misconduct of the Seller or any Non-Company Affiliate), for which
the Buyer shall be responsible. Nothing contained in this Section 4.6(f) shall
limit the Buyer's responsibility for Taxes pursuant to Section 4.6(b)(ii).

(g) Section 338(h)(10) Election. (i) Election. The Buyer
shall, and the Seller shall cause the common parent of the Seller's
Consolidated Group to, join in an election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code with respect to each member of the Company Group (a "Section
338(h)(10) Election"), and the Buyer shall, and the Seller shall, or shall
cause the proper Non-Company Affiliates to, join in all comparable elections
under state and local Income Tax law with respect to each member of the Company
Group.

(ii) Forms. On or before the date that is ten (10) business
days before the Closing Date, the Buyer shall provide to the Seller drafts of
all forms, together with all drafts of required attachments thereto, required
for making the Section 338(h)(10) Election and all comparable elections under
state and local Tax law (the "Election Forms"). On the Closing Date the Seller
shall deliver to the Buyer the Election Forms, properly executed by the common
parent of the Seller's Group or any proper Non-Company Affiliate. The Seller
and the Buyer shall cooperate in drafting and making final the Election Forms,
and any dispute with respect thereto shall be resolved pursuant to the Tax
Dispute Resolution Mechanism. The Buyer shall be responsible for filing the
Election Forms with the proper taxing authorities, provided that the Seller
shall be responsible for filing any Election Form that must be filed with a Tax
Return described in Section 4.6(c)(i) above.

(iii) Allocation. On or before the date that is 120 days after
the Closing Date, the Buyer shall provide to the Seller a proposed allocation
of the purchase price, for the Seller Noncompete Agreement and the deemed sale
of assets resulting from the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, setting
forth the estimated fair market values of the assets of the Company and, to the
extent relevant to

48
<PAGE> 57
such deemed sale, other members of the Company Group. On or before the date
that is 180 days after the Closing Date, the Seller and the Buyer shall agree
upon a final allocation of such purchase price (the "Final Allocation"), which
shall be based upon the Buyer's proposed allocation of such purchase price in
the absence of manifest error. The Seller agrees that the Seller shall
cooperate with the Buyer in developing the Final Allocation.

(iv) modification; Revocation. The Buyer and the Seller each
agree that it shall not, and shall not permit any of its respective Affiliates
to, take any action to modify the Election Forms following the execution
thereof, or to modify or revoke the Section 338(h)(10) Election or any
comparable election under state and local Tax law following the filing of the
Election Forms, without the written consent of the Seller or the Buyer, as the
case may be.

(v) Consistent Treatment. The Buyer and the Seller shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the information contained in the Election Forms as filed and
the Final Allocation, unless otherwise required because of a change in
applicable Tax law.

(vi) Expenses Resulting from Elections. The Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company Group following the Closing), on the one
side, and the Seller and the Non-Company Affiliates, on the other side, shall
bear their respective administrative, legal, accounting and similar expenses
resulting from the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election and all comparable
elections under state and local Tax law. As specified in the last sentence of
Section 9.1(a), the Buyer shall bear any appraisal fees incurred by it in
developing the allocation of the Purchase Price.

(h) Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanism. Wherever in this Section
4.6 it shall be provided that a dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the "Tax
Dispute Resolution Mechanism," such dispute shall be resolved as follows: (i)
the parties shall in good faith attempt to negotiate a settlement of the
dispute, (ii) if the parties are unable to negotiate a resolution of the
dispute within 30 days, the dispute shall be submitted, as soon as practicable
thereafter, to the national office of KPMG Peat Marwick or other independent
accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to the
Seller and the Buyer (the

49
<PAGE> 58
"Tax Dispute Accountants") (iii) the parties shall present their arguments to
the Tax Dispute Accountants within 15 days after submission of the dispute to
the Tax Dispute Accountants, (iv) the Tax Dispute Accountants shall resolve the
dispute, in a fair and equitable manner and in accordance with the applicable
Tax law, within 30 days after the parties have presented their arguments to the
Tax Dispute Accountants, whose decision shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the parties, (v) any payment to be made as a result of the resolution of a
dispute shall be made, and any other action to be taken as a result of the
resolution of a dispute shall be taken, on or before the later of (A) the date
on which such payment or action would otherwise be required or (B) the third
business day following the date on which the dispute is resolved (in the case
of a dispute resolved by the Tax Dispute Accountants, such date being the date
on which the parties receive written notice from the Tax Dispute Accountants of
their resolution) and (vi) the fees and expenses of the Tax Dispute Accountants
in resolving a dispute shall be borne equally by the Seller and the Buyer.

(i) Federal Income Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments.
Without affecting any rights of the Buyer or the Seller under any other
provisions of this Agreement or otherwise, each of the Buyer and the Seller
agrees to treat any payments pursuant to Sections 4.6, 4.7(b), 4.8, 4.15 or
4.17 as adjustments (i.e., reductions or increases, as the case may be) of the
Purchase Price for federal Income Tax purposes and file federal Income Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment unless (i) otherwise
required by a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) otherwise required by the
IRS following an audit (but only if the amount of payments for which the IRS
requires a different treatment in any taxable year is less than $150,000) or
(iii) such party receives a written opinion from a nationally recognized law
firm (which opinion and law firm shall be reasonably acceptable to the other
party) that there is no substantial authority (within the meaning of Section
6662(d)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) for such position.

4.7. Cancellation of Intercompany Accounts; Maintenance of
Current Ratio. (a) The Seller agrees to cause all accounts payable, accounts
receivable, Contracts, Plans, agreements, instruments, commitments, claims and
other obligations pursuant to which any member of the Company Group has made or
is obligated to make payments or incur expenses to or for the benefit of the
Seller or any Non-Company Af-

50
<PAGE> 59
filiate to be cancelled, terminated, waived and released at or prior to the
Closing without any consideration being paid or payable in respect thereof,
pursuant to appropriate agreements and instruments in form and substance
mutually satisfactory to the Buyer and the Seller in their reasonable judgment;
provided that the accounts payable, accounts receivable, Contracts, Plans,
agreements, instruments, commitments, claims and other obligations set forth in
Schedule 4.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be treated in the manner
expressly set forth in such Schedule.

(b) From the date hereof to the Closing Date, the Company
Group shall be permitted to continue to make payments in the Ordinary Course of
Business to any member of the Seller Group in respect of indebtedness of the
Company Group to any member of Seller Group incurred in the Ordinary Course of
Business; provided that the Current Ratio of the Company Group as of the
Closing Date (the "Closing Date Current Ratio") is equal to the Current Ratio
of the Company Group as at December 31, 1993, as determined based on the
Audited 1993 Balance Sheet (the "Audited Balance Sheet Current Ratio"). In the
event that the Closing Date Current Ratio is not equal to the Audited Balance
Sheet Current Ratio, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted following the Closing
by a cash payment, to be made within 30 days after the Closing Date. If the
Closing Date Current Ratio is less than the Audited Balance Sheet Current
Ratio, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer an amount equal to the amount that,
when added to the amount of current assets utilized in determining the Closing
Date Current Ratio, causes the Closing Date Current Ratio as so adjusted to be
equal to the Audited Balance Sheet Current Ratio. If the Closing Date Current
Ratio is greater than the Audited Balance Sheet Current Ratio, the Buyer shall
pay to the Seller an amount equal to the amount that, when subtracted from the
amount of current assets utilized in determining the Closing Date Current
Ratio, causes the Closing Date Current Ratio as so adjusted to be equal to the
Audited Balance Sheet Current Ratio. Any such amount to be paid in accordance
with this Section 4.7(b) shall be paid together with an amount equivalent to
interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published by
the Wall Street Journal from time to time (calculated on the basis of a 365-day
year, for the actual number of days elapsed during the period from but not
including the Closing Date to and including the date of payment).

51
<PAGE> 60
4.8. Indemnity. (a) The Seller covenants and agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless each of the Buyer, its Affiliates, the members of
the Company Group and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisers and representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnities") from and
against, and pay or reimburse each of the Buyer Indemnities for, any and all
claims, demands, liabilities, obligations, losses, fines, costs, expenses,
royalties, Litigation, deficiencies or damages (whether absolute, accrued,
conditional or otherwise and whether or not resulting from third party claims)
including but not limited to interest and penalties with respect thereto and
out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and
expenses incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same or in
asserting, preserving or enforcing any of their respective rights hereunder or
under any Ancillary Agreement but not including any Income Taxes imposed upon
the receipt by a Buyer Indemnitee of a payment under this Section
4.8(a) (collectively, "Losses"), which any of the foregoing may incur or to
which any of the foregoing may be subjected, resulting from, arising out of or
otherwise based upon any of the following:

(i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty
made by any member of the Seller Group herein (other than any
representation or warranty contained in Section 3.17) or in any of the
Ancillary Agreements or in connection herewith or therewith, at or as
of the date made or deemed made or the Closing Date (such inaccuracy
or breach to be determined based upon a conclusive presumption that,
if a matter has occurred, any requirement or qualification that such
matter "reasonably be expected" to occur or not occur shall have been
satisfied); or

(ii) any and all Excluded Liabilities.

(b) Except for inaccuracies in or breaches of the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, the Seller
shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnities with respect to any
claim for indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of Section 4.8(a) in respect
of any inaccuracies in or breaches of the representations and warranties of any
member of the Seller Group referred to in such clause, unless and until the
aggregate amount of all claims against the Seller under this Section 4.8
exceeds $25,000,000 and then only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds
$25,000,000, provided, however, that the

52
<PAGE> 61
aggregate liability of the Seller to the Buyer under this Section 4.8 with
respect to all claims for indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of Section
4.8(a) shall not exceed the Purchase Price. The indemnity provided for in this
Section 4.8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer after the
Closing for any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Seller
herein and referred to in clause (i) of Section 4.8(a); provided that nothing
herein shall limit in any way the Buyer's remedies in respect of (and this
Section 4.8(b) shall not apply in the event of) actual fraud by any member of
the Seller Group in connection herewith or with any Ancillary Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Any indemnity payment made by the
Seller to any Buyer indemnitee with respect to any claim for indemnification
pursuant to clause (i) of Section 4.8(a) shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered (after deducting any related costs and expenses) by the Buyer or any
member of the Company Group, for the Losses for which such indemnity payment is
made, under any warranty or indemnity from any third party existing at the
Closing Date to or for the benefit of any member of the Company Group. Neither
the Buyer nor any member of the Company Group shall be obligated to seek any
recovery under any such warranty or indemnity. If the Buyer and the Company
Group determine not to pursue any such recovery, the Buyer shall promptly so
notify the Seller, and the Seller (in its name or in the name of the
appropriate member of the Company Group) shall be entitled to pursue such
recovery directly and the Buyer and the Company Group shall use reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Seller in its pursuit of such recovery, provided
that (x) such pursuit of such recovery shall not unreasonably interfere with
the operation of the business of the Buyer or any member of the Company Group
and (y) the Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnities from and against, and shall pay or reimburse the Buyer Indemnities
for, any Losses which any of them may incur or to which any of them may be
subjected, resulting from or arising out of or otherwise based upon the
Seller's efforts to pursue any such recovery.

(c) In the case of any claim asserted by a third party against
a Buyer Indemnitee, notice shall be given by such Buyer Indemnitee to the
Seller promptly after such Buyer Indemnitee has actual knowledge of any claim
as to which indemnity may be sought, and such Buyer Indemnitee shall permit the
Seller (at the Seller's expense) to assume the defense of any claim or any
litigation resulting therefrom, provided, that (i) counsel for the Seller who
shall conduct

53
<PAGE> 62
the defense of such claim or litigation shall be reasonably satisfactory to
such Buyer Indemnitee, and such Buyer Indemnitee may participate in such
defense at such Buyer Indemnitee's expense, and (ii) the failure of any Buyer
Indemnitee to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Seller of
its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except to the extent that
such failure results in a lack of actual notice to the Seller and the Seller is
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice. Except with
the prior written consent of such Buyer Indemnitee, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, the Seller shall not, in the defense of any such claim
or litigation, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
that provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting such Buyer
Indemnitee or that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by each claimant or plaintiff to such Buyer Indemnitee of a release from all
liability with respect to such claim or litigation. In the event that such
Buyer Indemnitee shall in good faith determine that such Buyer Indemnitee may
have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are
inconsistent with one or more of those that may be available to the Seller in
respect of such claim or any litigation relating thereto, such Buyer Indemnitee
shall have the right at all times to take over and assume control over the
defense, settlement, negotiations or litigation relating to any such claim at
the sole cost of such Buyer Indemnitee, provided, that if such Buyer Indemnitee
does so take over and assume control, such Buyer Indemnitee shall not settle
such claim or litigation without the written consent of the Seller, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Seller fails to
assume or does not accept the defense of any matter as above provided promptly
after receipt of notice thereof from such Buyer Indemnitee (and in any event
within 20 days of such receipt), such Buyer Indemnitee shall have the full
right to defend against any such claim or demand, and shall be entitled to
settle or agree to pay in full such claim or demand. In any event, the Seller
and the Buyer shall cooperate in the defense of any claim or litigation subject
to this Section 4.8 and the records of each shall be available to the other
with respect to such defense.

4.9. Survival, etc. (a) All claims for indemnification under
clause (i) of Section 4.8(a) or under clause (F) of Section 4.6(b)(i) with
respect to the representations and warranties contained herein must be asserted
on or prior to the date that is 30 days after the termina-

54

any statutes of limitations applicable to the particular Tax at issue,
and in the case of Section 3.16(c)(ii), to any statutes of limitations
applicable to the particular provision of ERISA or the Code at issue);
and

contained in Sections 3.5, 3.10, 3.11, 3.13, 3.15, 3.16 (other than
3.16(c)(ii)), 3.21 and 3.22 shall survive until 11:59 p.m. Eastern
time on the 60th day after the date on which the Buyer receives the
audited consolidated financial statements of the Buyer and its
subsidiaries (including the Company Group) for the year ended December
31, 1995 accompanied by a report of the Buyer's independent public
accountants.

(b) The covenants and agreements (including but not limited to
the indemnities) contained in this Agreement shall survive the execution and
delivery thereof, any examination by or on behalf of the parties hereto, the
completion of the transactions contemplated herein and any expiration of the
respective survival periods set forth in Section 4.9(a), without limitation,
provided that the provisions of Section 4.11(a) shall only survive until the
second anniversary of the date hereof and thereafter the Confidentiality
Agreements will be void and of no further force or effect, except as to any
breach prior to such date of Section 4.11(a) or the Confidentiality Agreements.

4.10. Employees. (a) From and after the Closing, the Seller
shall be solely responsible, and, effective as of the Closing, hereby assumes
the responsibility of each mem-

55
<PAGE> 64
ber of the Company Group, for, and shall pay, any and all claims, liabilities,
obligations, commitments, costs and expenses under or in respect of the
Williams Telecommunications Group, Inc. Long-Term Equity incentive Compensation
Plan, including any cash or stock awards granted in respect of the termination
of such Plan (such Plan and awards referred to collectively as the "Equity
Plan"), including, but not limited to, all such claims, liabilities,
obligations, commitments, costs and expenses relating to or arising as a result
of or in connection with the termination or replacement of the Equity Plan and
any and all compensation or benefit entitlements thereunder or under any such
replacement plan or arrangement. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause
the accrual relating to the Equity Plan that is reflected as a liability on the
most recent Subsequent Monthly Financial Statement to be transferred to the
Seller without any payment therefor on the part of any member of the Company
Group or the Buyer or its Affiliates.

(b) (i) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause each member
of the Company Group to withdraw as a participating employer from the Plans
sponsored by the Seller which are listed on Schedule 4.10(b)(i) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (the "Seller Sponsored Plans"). The withdrawal of the
members of the Company Group from the Seller Sponsored Plans shall not cause
any assets held by, for or with respect to any member of the Seller Group under
such Seller Sponsored Plans or trusts or insurance contracts related thereto to
be transferred either: (i) to the Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the Company
Group; or (ii) to any employee benefit plans, program or arrangement
established, sponsored or maintained by the Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the
Company Group. From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Company
Group to assume, and to pay or reimburse the Seller for, any and all claims of
the Employees and Beneficiaries incurred but not paid, or paid by the Seller
but not yet reimbursed to the Seller by the Company Group, prior to the Closing
Date under those Plans that are medical, dental, life or accident insurance,
disability, educational assistance, legal services or Code section 125 flexible
reimbursement account plans (the "Seller Welfare Plans") except to the extent
any such claim is paid by insurance without the requirement that the Seller
reimburse the insurer with respect to such claim. From and after the date
hereof to the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause the Company Group to pay all
claims of the Employees and Beneficiaries under the Seller Welfare Plans
promptly upon receipt of notice of each such claim and otherwise in the
ordinary

56
<PAGE> 65
Course of Business. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause the Company
Group to (x) pay cash equal to those amounts necessary to satisfy all of the
obligations of the Company Group with respect to the Employees under those
Seller Sponsored Plans that are qualified plans under section 401(a) of the
Code with respect to service of such Employees completed prior to the Closing,
including employer matching contributions under the Seller's Savings Plan, such
cash amount to be determined in the Ordinary Course of Business and to be paid
to the Seller for the benefit of such qualified plans; provided, however, that
immediately prior to the Closing, such cash amount shall be determined pursuant
to Schedule 4.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and (y) transfer to the
Seller the accrual relating to the Seller's Supplemental Retirement Plan that
is reflected as a liability on the most recent Subsequent Monthly Financial
Statement, together with a cash payment by the Company Group equal to the
amount of such accrual.

(ii) With respect to the Plans (other than the Equity Plan)
that are not Seller Sponsored Plans and that are listed on Schedule 4.10(b)(ii)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Company Plans"), from and after the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay or cause the Company Group to pay all amounts
attributable to such Company Plans in accordance with the applicable terms
thereof. From and after the Closing, all assets and liabilities of the Company
Plans shall be retained by the Company Group and, to the extent that,
immediately prior to the Closing Date, any rights or assets in respect of any
Company Plan are held by or for the benefit of any member of the Seller Group
other than the Company Group, no later than 30 days following the Closing Date,
the Seller shall, or shall cause, any and all such rights and assets to be
transferred, in cash or kind, as directed by the Buyer, to the Company or to
any employee benefit fund established by the Company to receive such assets.

(iii) From and after the Closing, the Seller shall be solely
responsible, and, effective as of the Closing, hereby assumes the
responsibility of each member of the Company Group, for, and shall pay, any and
all claims, liabilities, obligations, commitments, costs and expenses under
each Plan, other than the Company Plans, to or in respect of any Employee or
Beneficiary, except (A) to the extent the Buyer has expressly agreed in this
Section 4.10 to assume the liability of the Seller to or in respect of any
Employee or Beneficiary under any such Plan and (B) if there is a transfer of
assets from the Seller's Savings Plan to the

57
<PAGE> 66

Buyer's Savings Plan, as contemplated by Section 4.10(h), then, from and after
the date of such transfer, for Seller's obligations with respect to the payment
of benefits accrued under the Seller's Savings Plan as of the Closing.

(c) (i) Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the
Company Group to make available to the current employees of the Company Group
and their Beneficiaries (collectively, the "Current Employees") and to those
former employees of the Company Group who, immediately prior to the Closing,
are totally disabled and, therefore, receiving benefits under the Seller's Long
Term Disability Plan and the Beneficiaries of such former employees
(collectively, the "LTD Employees") employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements of the Buyer or its Affiliates.

(ii) Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the
Company Group to make available "continuation coverage", within the meaning of
section 4980B of the Code, under the Buyer's group health plans to those former
employees of the Company Group who are "covered employees" and those
Beneficiaries who are "qualified beneficiaries", in each case, within the
meaning of section 4980B of the Code, and who, immediately prior to the
Closing, are receiving or are eligible to receive continuation coverage under
those Plans that are group health plans subject to the requirements of section
4980B of the Code (such former employees and Beneficiaries referred to
collectively as the "COBRA Participants").

(iii) in the case of the Buyer's or the Company Group's
medical, dental and hospitalization plans, the Buyer shall cause such plans to
(A) provide for each Current Employee, LTD Employee and COBRA Participant a
credit for any copayments or deductibles already incurred by such Current
Employee, LTD Employee or COBRA Participant, as the case may be, during the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs under the comparable Plan in which
such Current Employee, LTD Employee or COBRA Participant, as the case may be,
was an active participant immediately prior to the Closing and (B) waive any
pre-existing condition restrictions to the extent that, as of the Closing, the
pre-existing condition of any Current Employee, LTD Employee or COBRA
Participant, as the case may be, would not have been excluded under the
pre-existing condition restrictions of the comparable Plan in which such
Current Employee, LTD Employee or COBRA Participant, as the case may be, was an
active participant immediately prior to the Closing. To the extent a Current

58
<PAGE> 67
Employee becomes eligible to participate in a qualified retirement plan
maintained by the Buyer or its Affiliates, including following the Closing the
Company Group, such Current Employee shall be credited under such plan for
participation and vesting purposes with the service credited to such Current
Employee for such purposes under the Seller's Investment Plus Plan (the
"Seller's Savings Plan") as of the Closing Date. To the extent a Current
Employee becomes eligible to participate in a vacation policy, short-term
disability plan and/or severance plan maintained or established by the Buyer or
its Affiliates, including following the Closing the Company Group, such Current
Employee shall be credited under such plan or arrangement for participation,
vesting and benefit determination purposes with the most recent period of such
Current Employee's continuous service with the Seller and its Affiliates as of
the Closing Date.

(d) (i) With respect to those former employees of the Company
Group and their eligible dependents (the "Medical Plan Retirees") who,
immediately prior to the Closing, are provided retiree medical coverage under
Plans that provide retiree medical or hospitalization coverage (the "Seller
Retiree Medical Plans"), the Buyer shall, effective as of the Closing, cause
the Company Group to make available retiree medical and hospitalization
benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the retiree
medical and hospitalization benefits of such Medical Plan Retirees under the
Seller Retiree Medical Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing. The
Buyer shall cause its or the Company Group's retiree medical and
hospitalization plans covering the Medical Plan Retirees to provide for each
Medical Plan Retiree a credit for any copayments or deductibles already
incurred by such Medical Plan Retiree during the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs under the comparable Seller Retiree Medical Plan in which such
Medical Plan Retiree was an active participant immediately prior to the Closing
and waive any pre-existing condition restrictions to the extent that, as of
the Closing, the pre-existing condition of any such Medical Plan Retiree would
not have been excluded under the pre-existing condition restrictions of the
comparable Seller Retiree Medical Plan in which such Medical Plan Retiree was
an active participant immediately prior to the Closing.

(ii) Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer shall cause its
medical and hospitalization plans to be amended to provide retiree medical and
hospitalization coverage, that

59
<PAGE> 68
is comparable, in the aggregate, to that provided to the Medical Plan Retirees,
to those Current Employees (the "Eligible Retirees") who, as of the Closing

that become payable under a Plan (other than the Equity Plan) to any Current
Employee with respect to employment with the Company Group prior to the Closing
or that become payable under any plan, program or arrangement of the Buyer or,
following the Closing, the Company Group to a Current Employee or a future
employee of the Company Group with respect to employment following the Closing
with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall be the sole responsibility of the
Buyer and its Affiliates. Subject to Section 4.10(a), liabilities for claims of

under any Law respecting employment, including any litigation under any such
Law instituted by or on behalf of any such Employee prior to the Closing and

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall continue to be the
responsibility of the Company Group, except for any such claims relating to any
Plan, other than (x) a Company Plan and (y) to the extent the Buyer has
expressly agreed in Section 4.10 to assume any liability under any Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
cause the Company Group to continue to be responsible for, and shall indemnify
the Seller from and against, and shall pay the Seller for, any and all Losses
arising under any claims and liabilities of any Current Employee, Medical Plan
Retiree or Eligible Retiree or any of their eligible dependents with respect to
the failure of the Company Group following the Closing to make available to

such claim under any Plan.

(f) At the Closing, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Company to, offer to enter into a new employment agreement (the "New Contract")
with Roy A. Wilkens ("Wilkens") which shall contain substantially the same
terms and conditions as provided in that certain Employment Agreement, dated as
of January 1, 1990, among the Seller, the Company and Wilkens, as amended and
in effect on the date hereof (the "Existing Contract"). In the event that (x)
the terms of the New Contract, as executed and delivered by Wilkens, on the one
hand, and the Company and/or the Buyer, on the other hand, do not provide for
the termination of the Existing Contract and the release by Wilkens of the
Seller and the Company from all further liability or obligation in respect of
the Existing Contract or (y) Wilkens and the Buyer and/or the Company do not
execute and deliver the New Contract, then, notwithstanding Section 4.8 but

claims and liabilities relate to (A) any act or failure to act on the part of
the Buyer or, following the Closing, the Company Group or (B) the failure of
Wilkens and the Buyer and/or the Company to enter into the New Contract and
(ii) the Seller shall indemnify the Buyer, its Affiliates (including, following
the Closing, the Company Group) and their respective employees and directors
from all claims and liabilities under the Existing Contract to the extent such
claims and liabilities relate to (A) any act or failure to act on the part of
the Seller or, prior to the Closing, the Company Group or (A) any amendment to
the Existing Contract after the date hereof, except any such amendment to which
the Buyer has expressly consented.

(g) In accordance with all applicable terms and conditions of
the Seller's Consolidated Pension Plan, as amended from time to time (the
"Pension Plan"), the Seller shall cause the Pension Plan to continue to credit
benefit service to the LTD Employees solely during such LTD Employee's period
of total disability (within the meaning of the Pension Plan). Effective as of
the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause the Current Employees to be fully
vested (x) in their "Accrued Benefit," as defined in Section 2.1 of the Pension

er's Savings Plan and the Seller's Bonus Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

(h) (i) Promptly following the date hereof, the Seller and the
Buyer shall each use its best efforts and shall each cooperate with the other
to determine whether the account balances of the Current Employees under the
Seller's Savings Plan can be transferred to the Buyer's Savings Plan in
accordance with the Code and ERISA. If the Buyer and the Seller reasonably
determine prior to the Closing that such transfer may be effected, in the manner
described in Section 4.10(h)(ii), in compliance with ERISA and the Code and, if
requested by the Buyer or the Seller, the IRS has provided reasonable assurance
that such transfer, effected in such manner, will not result in a
disqualification of the Seller's Savings Plan or the Buyer's Savings Plan, such
transfer shall be so effected within six months following the Closing.

(ii) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section
4.10(h), effective as of the Closing Date, (x) the Buyer shall (A) amend the
Buyer's defined contribution plan (the "Buyer's Savings Plan") to permit the
Current Employees to participate therein and to permit the account balances of
the Current Employees under the Seller's Savings Plan to be transferred to the
Buyer's Plan pursuant to section 414(l) of the Code, including the transfer of
any outstanding loan in respect of any Current Employee under the Seller's
Savings Plan and the related promissory note evidencing such loan and (B) cause
the Buyer's Savings Plan to contain those provisions with respect to optional
forms of benefit that are required to be provided by a transferee plan pursuant
to section 411(d)(6) of the Code and (y) as soon as reasonably practicable, but
in no event later than 60 days, after (A) the amendment of the Buyer's Savings
Plan and (B) receipt by the Seller of (i) a copy of the Buyer's Savings Plan,
all amendments thereto, any related trust documents (as amended), the last IRS
determination letter with respect to the Buyer's Savings Plan and the three
most recent IRS Forms 5500 with respect to such Plan and (ii) a written opinion
of counsel to the Buyer reasonably acceptable to the Seller to the effect that
the Buyer's Savings Plan contains the material terms required for qualification
under section 401(a) of the Code, the Seller shall transfer, or cause to be
transferred, to the trust under the Buyer's Savings Plan an amount, in cash, in
kind, or in Seller's common stock and, with respect to outstanding participant
loans, the related promissory notes evidencing such loans, equal to

62
<PAGE> 71
the fair market value, determined as of the date of such transfer, of the
aggregate account balances under the Seller's Savings Plan of the Current
Employees.

(iii) Notwithstanding whether a transfer of assets is
effected, from and after the Closing, the Seller shall permit the Current
Employees to repay any outstanding loans of such Current Employees under the
Seller's Saving Plan in accordance with the loan repayment schedule in effect
with respect to each such loan immediately prior to the Closing Date, provided
that, from and after the Closing, the Buyer causes such repayment amounts that
are currently due in accordance with the applicable repayment schedule to be
deducted from each affected Current Employee's paycheck and timely remits (so
as to avoid a default of the applicable loan) such deducted amounts to the
trustee of the Seller's Savings Plan for credit to each such Current Employee's
account under the Seller's Savings Plan.

(i) Subject to Section 4.10(a), at or before the Closing, the
Seller shall cause (x) the Company Group to accelerate and, in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Plan and related award agreement, if any, pay,
perform and satisfy each of the then outstanding deferred awards granted under
the Seller's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan to any Current Employee and
(y) all restrictions on transferability to lapse with respect to all then
outstanding restricted stock awards under the Seller's Restricted Stock Plan in
respect of any Current Employee, such that the Seller's stock subject to such
awards becomes freely transferable by each such Current Employee. Subject to
Section 4.10(a), at or before the Closing, the Seller shall cause the Company
Group to pay, perform and satisfy, in accordance with the terms of such
Founders Award Plan, each of the awards granted to any Current Employee under
the Williams Telecommunications Group, Inc. Founders Award Plan that remain
outstanding as of the date hereof.

proceeding to disclose any Buyer Information, the Seller shall give the Buyer
prompt written notice of such request so that the Buyer may seek an appropriate
protective order. If in the absence of a protective order any Seller Party is
compelled in a proceeding to disclose Buyer Information, such Seller Party may
disclose such portion of the Buyer Information that in the opinion of the

under this Section 4.11(b), and agrees (and shall cause each Excluded
Subsidiary and Pipeline Subsidiary, in the case of the Seller, and each member
of the Company Group, in the case of the Buyer, to agree) that, in the event of
a breach or a threatened breach of any such obligation, the other such party

of such breach, be entitled to an injunction from a court of competent
jurisdiction granting it specific performance of the provisions of this Section
4.11(b).

(v) The provisions of this Section 4.11 shall not restrict the
Buyer or any member of the Company Group, or the Seller or any Excluded

66
<PAGE> 75
tive rights relating hereto or thereto or to the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

4.12. Noncompete Agreement. As of the Closing, the Seller
shall have executed a noncompete and nonsolicitation agreement in substantially
the form attached hereto as Annex A (the "Seller Noncompete Agreement").

4.13. Financial Statements. Until the Closing, (i) on or
before the 21st day of each month beginning with the month following the
execution of this Agreement, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer unaudited
monthly financial statements of WilTel Network Services as at and for the
monthly period ending the last day of the preceding month (the "Subsequent

Subsequent Monthly Financial Statements shall be prepared in a format

4.14. Transfer of Excluded Businesses. Prior to or on the
Closing Date (but in no event later than the consummation of the Closing), the
Seller shall cause the members of the Company Group to transfer to the Seller
or an Affiliate of the Seller, on an AS IS, WHERE IS basis (in respect of each
member of the Company Group, the Buyer or any Affiliate thereof), all of the
capital stock of the Excluded Subsidiaries and all tangible and intangible
assets of the Excluded Businesses not owned by any Excluded Subsidiary,
pursuant to all necessary or appropriate stock powers, bills of sale,
sublicenses, subleases and other instruments of transfer or conveyance, each in
form and substance mutually satisfactory to the Buyer and the Seller in their
reasonable judgment. In connection with such transfer, the Seller shall assume
all liabilities and obligations of the Company Group related to the Excluded
Businesses, pursuant to agreements and instruments of assumption in form and
substance mutually satisfactory to the Buyer and the Seller in their reasonable
judgment. The Seller shall be responsible for any severance or other benefits
payable by any member of the Seller Group to employees who are or were employed
or engaged primarily in functions comprising a part

67
<PAGE> 76
of the Excluded Businesses or are beneficiaries or dependents of Persons so
employed or engaged.

4.15. Capital Expenditures. (a) From the date hereof through
the Closing Date, the Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause the members
of the Company Group to make capital expenditures relating to the Business in a
manner consistent with the 1994 capital expenditures budget sat forth in
Schedule 4.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule such that, for the period
beginning on January 1, 1994 and ending on the Closing Date (the "Preclosing
Period"), the Company Group shall have made capital expenditures in an
aggregate amount at least equal to $97,865,700 (the "Required Amount"),
representing the "original" 1994 budgeted amount shown therein (multiplied by
eleven-twelfths and adjusted to exclude capital expenditures attributable to
the Excluded Subsidiaries) plus the 1993 carryforward amount shown therein. If,
however, the Closing Date occurs prior to November 30, 1994, the Required
Amount shall be reduced by $225,023 for each day by which the Closing Date
precedes November 30, 1994.

(b) If the amount of any capital expenditures paid by the
Company Group relating to the Business during the Preclosing Period (the
"Actual Amount") is less than the Required Amount, the difference between the
Required Amount and the Actual Amount shall be paid by the Seller to the Buyer
following the Closing. If the Actual Amount exceeds the Required Amount, the
difference between the Required Amount and the Actual Amount shall be paid by
the Buyer to the Seller following the Closing, provided that the Buyer shall
have no obligation so to pay, and the Actual Amount shall be reduced by, the
aggregate amount of all Extraordinary Expenditures (as hereinafter defined)
made without the prior written consent of the Buyer. In the event that the
Forum Property is transferred to the Seller as contemplated by Section 4.15(e),
the Actual Amount for purposes of any calculation to be made pursuant to this
Section 4.15(b) shall be reduced (without duplication) by the aggregate amount
of all Forum Expenditures (as hereinafter defined) made by the Company Group.

(c) The amount payable pursuant to Section 4.15(b) shall be
paid in cash within 30 days after the Closing Date, together with an amount
equivalent to interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as
published by the Wall Street Journal from time to time (calculated on the basis
of a 365-day year, for the actual number

68
<PAGE> 77
of days elapsed during the period from but not including the Closing Date to
and including the date of payment). Any amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 4.15 shall be an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(d) The Buyer shall have no obligation to reimburse the Seller
for any Extraordinary Expenditures, unless the Seller shall have obtained the
prior written consent of the Buyer to such Extraordinary Expenditures. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Extraordinary Expenditures" means any
capital expenditures by the Company Group incurred or paid during the period
from the date hereof through the Closing Date (i) in the category labelled
"Forum Property (including the parking lot) and Buildout" in Schedule 4.15(d)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule ("Forum Expenditures"), (ii) in the category
labelled "Transaction Network" in such Schedule, (iii) in the category labelled
"Cuba", in such Schedule, (iv) in any category set forth in such Schedule, that
exceed the respective amount set forth next to such category in such Schedule,
or (v) for new capital projects not set forth in such Schedule, that exceed
$3,000,000 in each case or $10,000,000 in the aggregate.

(e) The Buyer agrees that, if it has not, on or prior to
October 15, 1994, (i) given written notice to the Seller that the Buyer
consents to the making of the Forum Expenditures, in an aggregate amount not to
exceed the amount set forth therefor in Schedule 4.15(d) in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) confirmed to the Seller in writing and publicly
announced (by means of a press release or press conference) its intent to
remodel and fully occupy the Forum Property to be acquired by such capital
expenditures, then the Forum Property or the contract rights to acquire the
Forum Property shall be transferred to the Seller, on an AS IS, WHERE IS basis
without the payment of any consideration, prior to the Closing.

(f) The Buyer agrees that on or prior to the date that is 30
days after the date hereof, it will give written notice to the Seller as to
whether the Buyer will consent to the making of the capital expenditures set
forth in the category labelled "Transaction Network" in Schedule 4.15(d) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule. If the Buyer does not so consent to the making of
such expenditures, then the Seller shall have the right to enter into the
packet switching transaction network venture for which such proposed
expenditures have been allocated, notwithstanding any provision of

69
<PAGE> 78
the Seller Non-Compete Agreement, but without using the Vyvx Property (as
defined in the Vyvx Agreement).

(g) The Buyer agrees that it will not unreasonably delay or
deny consent to the making of the capital expenditures set forth in the
category labelled "Cuba" in Schedule 4.15(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
provided that the Seller provides, or causes the Company Group to provide, to
the Buyer a detailed explanation and sufficient justification, as determined by
the Buyer in its reasonable judgment, of the need for such expenditures.

(h) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section
4.15, all references in this Section 4.15 to expenditures listed in Schedule
4.15(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule refer to the amounts listed under the
heading "Supplemental Approved Budget" in such Schedule.

4.16. Trademark License Agreement. At the Closing, the Seller
shall grant or cause to be granted to the Buyer, and such member or members of
the Company Group as the Buyer may designate, a ten-year, royalty-free license,
pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, to use the name and mark "WilTel",
the "knight on a horse" logo and the other Licensed Marks referred to therein,
following the closing. Within 60 days following the Closing, the Buyer shall
cause each member of the Company Group to amend its Organizational Documents so
as to change its name so that it does not contain the word "Williams" or any
derivative thereof.

4.17. Governmental Approval and Consent Indemnity. This
Section 4.17 shall not become effective unless and until the Seller shall have
delivered to the Buyer the Indemnification Notice, and from and after such
delivery this Section 4.17 shall be in full force and effect and constitute an
integral part of this Agreement. The Seller covenants and agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless each of the Buyer Indemnities from and against, and
pay or reimburse each of the Buyer Indemnities for, all Losses which any of the
Buyer Indemnities may incur or to which any of the Buyer Indemnities may be
subject, resulting from or arising out of the obtaining or making of any
Governmental Approval or Consent referred to in clause (iii) or (iv) of Section
5.2(c) that shall not have been obtained or made prior to the Closing Date, or
from the failure to obtain or make any such Governmental Approval or Consent;
provided that (a) the Seller shall not be required to indemnify any

70
<PAGE> 79
of the Buyer Indemnitees under this Section 4.17 unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Losses as to which indemnification from the Seller is sought
pursuant to this Section 4.17 ("Consent Losses") exceeds $10,000,000, (b)
thereafter the Seller shall be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees
under this Section 4.17 with respect to all Consent Losses in excess of such
$10,000,000 aggregate amount, until the aggregate amount of all Consent Losses
exceeds $20,000,000, (c) thereafter the Seller shall be required to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees under this Section 4.17 with respect to one-half of the
amount of each Consent Loss in excess of such $20,000,000 aggregate amount,
until the aggregate amount of all Consent Losses equals $40,000,000, and (d)
the aggregate liability of the seller to the Buyer Indemnitees for Consent
Losses under this Section 4.17 shall not exceed $20,000,000.

4.18. Insurance. (a) In the event that, after the Closing, the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including but not limited to any member of the
Company Group or any successor thereto) shall suffer any loss, arising out of a
third party claim or otherwise, that Buyer in good faith notifies Seller that
the Buyer believes would be covered by any insurance policy maintained by or
for the benefit of any member of the Seller Group (an "Insured Claim"), Seller
shall, and shall cause each member of the Seller Group to, present and
diligently prosecute a claim for payment under such policy in respect of such
loss, and pay to the Buyer the proceeds of such claim under such policy as
reimbursement in respect of the amount of such loss, subject to the provisions
of this Section 4.18.

(b) The Seller shall not be obligated to, or to cause any
member of the Seller Group to, present or prosecute any claim under any such
insurance policy with respect to any Insured Claim unless (i) such Insured
Claim is based upon bodily injury, property damage, wrongful or other acts or
another condition or event that arose or occurred (as determined under the
applicable insurance policy) prior to the Closing and (ii) the Buyer or the
relevant Affiliate of the Buyer cooperates fully at its expense with the
Seller's insurers in the investigation of such Insured Claim and (in the case
of any insured Claim arising out of a third party claim) the defense thereof.

(c) The amount of proceeds of any such insurance claim to be
paid over to the Buyer shall be limited to the amount actually received by the
Seller Group from its insur-

71
<PAGE> 80
ers with respect to such claim (net of any self-insured retention amount,
deductible amount, or other amount that the Seller Group is required to
reimburse its insurers under its contractual agreements with them, in each case
with respect to such claim), minus the aggregate amount of all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Seller Group in presenting and
prosecuting such claim (to the extent not paid or reimbursed by its insurers).
The Buyer shall reimburse the Seller, upon written demand by the Seller
(accompanied by evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer), for such amount
as the Seller is required to pay and does pay by way of retrospective premium
adjustment in respect of such insurance policy on account of any payment by the
insurer thereunder in respect of such claim.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.18 shall require any
member of the Seller Group to keep in force and effect after the Closing any
insurance coverage in effect at the time of the Closing. The Seller will give
the Buyer 30 days' notice before any member of the Seller Group terminates any
insurance coverage in effect at the time of the Closing and applicable to any
member of the Company Group.

(e) With respect to the claims listed in Schedule 4.18 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the
Seller and its insurers in the investigation, prosecution and collection of
such claims. The Buyer shall provide reasonable access, during reasonable
business hours and at the Seller's expense, to any and all of the premises,
properties, contracts, commitments, books, records, data, personnel and
representatives of or relating to any member of the Company Group or their
business or operations as may be necessary to investigate, prosecute and
collect such claims. The Buyer's obligation so to cooperate shall not require
the Buyer to incur any unreasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Except to the
extent required by law or legal process, the Seller shall, and shall request
its insurers to, maintain any information so obtained pertaining to the Buyer
or any member of the Company Group or the Business in confidence.

4.19. Dispute Resolution. (a) Negotiations. The Buyer and the
Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute arising out of or
relating to the Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (a "Dispute") by
negotiations between senior executives of such parties. Such negotiations may
be commenced by either such party by written notice to the other party (the
"Negotiation Request"). In

72
<PAGE> 81
the event that such Dispute has not been resolved by such negotiations within
30 days of the delivery of the Negotiation Request, and one party hereto
requests non-binding mediation by written notice to the other party given prior
to the end of such 30-day period, the Buyer and the Seller shall attempt in
good faith to resolve such Dispute by non-binding mediation before a mediator
mutually agreeable to the Buyer and the Seller in their reasonable judgment.
Neither party shall be required to continue with such negotiations or with such
non-binding mediation for more than 90 days after the delivery of the
Negotiation Request (180 days in the case of any Dispute to the extent it
arises out of or relates to any Ancillary Agreement). All such negotiations and
mediation proceedings shall be confidential, and shall be treated as compromise
and settlement negotiations for all evidentiary purposes, including but not
limited to for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any state rules of
evidence.

(b) Other Remedies. The parties hereto shall not, and shall
not permit their respective Affiliates to, initiate litigation with respect to
the Dispute unless the Dispute has not been resolved within 90 days of the
delivery of the Negotiation Request (180 days, in the case of any Dispute to
the extent it arises out of or relates to any Ancillary Agreement), and shall
not initiate litigation with respect to such Dispute except upon 5 days' prior
written notice to the other party; provided that (i) if one such party has
delivered a Negotiation Request or has so requested non-binding mediation and

The Williams Companies agrees to sell WilTel's Network to LDDS for $2.5 billion

TULSA -- The Willams Companies, Inc. and LDDS Communications, Inc. signed
a definitive agreement today for Williams to sell WilTel Network Services, a
division of WilTel, to LDDS for $2.5 billion in cash.

The sale is subject to the expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting
period and approvals by the Federal Communications Commission and various state
public service agencies, which are expected by year end.

"We take great pride in the people within our organization who created
such substantial value from what began as just an idea," said Keith E. Bailey,
chairman, president and chief executive officer of Williams. "In an industry
that enjoys significant economies of scale, the combination of LDDS and WilTel
Network Services should be assured of success over time.

"We are satisfied the offer by LDDS represents a full and fair value for
WilTel Network Services," he said. "In the long term, we believe accepting the
offer is in the best interest of our shareholders and employees."

Under the terms of the agreement, Williams will retain WilTel
Communications Systems, a national telecommunications equipment supplier and
service company, and Vyvx, which operates a national video network specializing
in broadcast television applications.

WilTel Network Services, which employs about 2,100 people, operates one of
only four national digital telecommunications networks in the United States.

Bernard J. Ebbers, president and chief executive officer of LDDS, a
Jackson, Miss.-based company that has been one of WilTel's largest customers,
said operations headquarters for WilTel will remain in Tulsa.

"We expect significant operating synergies as a result of combining the
operations of
<PAGE> 2
WilTel and LDDS," Ebbers said. "WilTel is recognized as a leading 'carrier's
carrier,' but is also well recognized for its development of leading edge
technology for larger telecommunications users. This ideally complements our
historical focus on smaller business customers."

Under the terms of the agreement, Williams will continue to operate WilTel
until closing and will provide administrative service support for some period
of time beyond closing. For that reason, there is not expected to be any
immediate impact on the employees of Williams or WilTel Network Services.

Bailey said he expects Williams will quickly redeploy proceeds from the
sale.

"We have identified a number of investments in the energy area that we are
actively pursuing," Bailey said. "We are very optimistic we can continue to
grow earnings for the foreseeable future."

Subject to future adjustments, cash proceeds from the transaction net of
related costs and income taxes are estimated to be in excess of $1.6 billion,
with an after-tax gain estimated to be at least $950 million.

He said the Williams board of directors, which approved the sale earlier
today, also authorized discretionary open-market repurchases of up to $800
million of Williams' common stock over the next 12 months.

"The timing and extent of any repurchases will be dictated by the rate of
our capital redeployment and the price of our stock," Bailey said.

Ebbers said today's announcement, "like our pending acquisition of IDB
Communications Group, Inc., represents a continuation of the company's overall
strategy that includes the acquisition of, or merger with, other significant
telecommunications providers."

He said combining LDDS' and WilTel's networks will result in a 15,000-plus
mile state-of-the-art digital system.

LDDS has secured a $3.25 billion underwritten commitment from a group of
banks managed by NationsBank to both finance this transaction and re-finance
LDDS' existing outstanding indebtedness. The financing is subject to normal
closing conditions.

Williams is listed on the New York and Pacific stock exchanges under the
symbol WMB. LDDS Communications is Nasdaq-listed as LDDS.
