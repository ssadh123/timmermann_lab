Item 1 through Item 4. Not applicable.

Item 5. Other Events.

On January 5, 1994, Standard & Poor's Corp. ("S&P") removed the
Company's ratings from "CreditWatch" and lowered them as
follows: senior secured debt to "BB+" from "BBB-"; senior
unsecured debt to "BB-" from "BB+"; preferred stock to "B+"
from "BB"; and commercial paper to "B" from "A-3". In
addition, S&P assigned its preliminary "BB+" senior secured
debt rating to the Company's $150 million General and Refunding
Mortgage Bonds recently registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as a "shelf" registration pursuant to Rule
415 under the Securities Act of 1933.

S&P explained that the "downgrade reflects expectations of
continued poor financial performance that will not allow the
financial profile, adjusted for purchased power, to remain
acceptable for the current ratings for a utility with a below-
average business position. Despite aggressive and anticipated
cost reductions on both capital and operating expenses, a lower
dividend, and an approach to reduce high-cost nonutility power,
financial pressures will persist over the intermediate term. 
Other management challenges include a depressed Maine economy,
a large industrial customer base demanding lower rates,
increasing competitive pressures, significant purchased-power
obligations, excess high-cost capacity, and nuclear
concentration risk."

S&P further stated that the Company's "ability to materially
reduce the annual $350 million cost associated with nonutility
power will be difficult. Despite the cost reductions, the
utility will unlikely earn its authorized return for the next
several years. Furthermore, a weak economy will pressure
sales, and inability to secure reasonable future rate relief
will dampen financial improvement."

Item 6 through Item 8. Not applicable.
