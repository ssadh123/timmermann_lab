Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

On October 6, 1994, the Registrant dismissed Ernst & Young
as Registrant's principal accountant to audit Registrant's
financial statements, and effective the same date engaged
KPMG Peat Marwick in place of Ernst & Young. Both the dismissal
of Ernst & Young and the engagement of KPMG Peat Marwick were
approved by the Registrant's board of directors. The Registrant
believes that it may have disagreements with Ernst & Young's
behavior and form possibly within the meaning of Item 304 of
Regulation S-K but has been unable to determine to do date
whether this is the case. The Registrant will amend this
Form 8-K if it makes such determination. Ernst & Young's report
on the Registrant's consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 1993 (the only fiscal year for which
Ernst & Young served as the Registrant's principal accountants)
did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, or
modification or qualification as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles.<PAGE>
Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(a) Not applicable.

(b) Not applicable.

(c) The following documents are furnished as Exhibits to
this Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to Item 601 of
Regulation S-K:

(16) Letter re Change in Certifying Accountants (to be
filed by amendment).
