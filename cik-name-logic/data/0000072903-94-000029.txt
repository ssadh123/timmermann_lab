Item 5. Other Events

Non-Regulated Cogeneration Project - Termination of Power Sale Agreement

In August 1994, Northern States Power Company (the Company) announced that a
joint venture between one of the Company's non-regulated subsidiaries and
Cogentrix, Inc., had agreed to terminate a contract for power sales from a
cogeneration project in Michigan. At that time, the financial consequences
to the Company were not fully determinable because certain expenses associated
with the termination could not yet be estimated. The Company's management has
now estimated the costs associated with the contract termination and expects
to record a net gain from the termination of approximately nine cents per
share in the third quarter of 1994.

Prairie Island Monitoring Compliance Update

The Company and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MCPA) are currently
negotiating a Stipulation Agreement to address monitoring procedures used at
the Company's Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant between January and
September of 1992 that allegedly did not comply with National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System permits, limiting the halogen content of water
discharges at the Plant. The MCPA is alleging noncompliance with permit terms
and conditions and is proposing a civil penalty of $105,436. Management does
not believe that this matter will have a material effect on the results of
operations or on the financial condition of the Company.
