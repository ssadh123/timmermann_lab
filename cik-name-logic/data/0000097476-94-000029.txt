TI to appeal decision by Japanese court on Fujitsu
manufacturing 

Dallas (August 30, 1994) -- Texas Instruments today
announced it will appeal the Tokyo District Court's ruling that
Texas Instruments Japanese Patent 320,275 -- known as the Kilby
Patent -- is not infringed by Fujitsu in its manufacturing of
1-megabit and 4-megabit dynamic random access memories (DRAMs)
and 32K erasable, programmable, read-only memories (EPROMs).

Speaking of the court's decision, Richard J. Agnich, TI
senior vice president and general counsel said, "We are
disappointed. The inventor, Jack Kilby, his invention of the
integrated circuit and the resulting patents have been recognized
by industry and academia in Japan and throughout the world, and
by legal systems throughout the world outside of Japan.

"We are deeply disturbed by a patent system that keeps a
major invention tied up in the Japan Patent Office for 29 years,
and, when the patent is issued, in effect claims that it covers
old technology and does not pertain to products made today," said
Mr. Agnich. "The decision by the court calls into question the
availability of intellectual property protection in Japan. TI has
manufactured and operated in Japan for 30 years. We have had
Japanese lawyers and patent professionals working with the
Japanese Patent Office and the courts for decades. We
have played by Japanese rules, seeking to obtain recognition for
the Kilby invention within the framework established by Japan."

Fujitsu filed suit against TI in 1991 asking the court to
declare that the Kilby Patent does not pertain to its products.
TI filed a "Kari Shobun" (injunctive relief) action to stop the
use, production and sale by Fujitsu of products that infringe
TI's '275 Kilby Patent. Because of the similarity of the two
cases, the court heard them together. The court ruled that
Fujitsu's production of 1-megabit and 4-megabit DRAMs and 32K
EPROMs does not infringe the Kilby Patent.

The Kilby patent covers a fundamental invention of
integrating the elements of an electronic circuit in a single
piece of semiconductive material. TI believes the patent, which
expires November 27, 2001, applies today to essentially all
integrated circuits made, used or sold in Japan.

Speaking of TI's plans to appeal, Mr. Agnich added, "We
were initially rebuffed in the Japan Patent Office but we
persevered and we prevailed. We will persevere in the court
system and we hope to get justice there eventually, as well."

Existing TI semiconductor patent licenses held by other
companies cover thousands of patents in the semiconductor field
and therefore should not be affected by this decision.

TI engineer Jack Kilby invented the integrated circuit in
1958. Mr. Kilby was honored for his technological achievement in
1993 when he was named winner of the Kyoto Award, Japan's
equivalent to the Nobel Prize, for his invention of the
integrated circuit.
