ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

Palisades Plant

On November 21, 1994, Consumers Power Company issued the following press
release regarding it's Palisades Nuclear Plant:

JACKSON, Mich., November 21, 1994 -- Consumers Power Company
officials met today with staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) to review the condition of the Palisades nuclear plant's reactor
vessel. As the holder of a license to operate a pressurized water
reactor, Consumers Power, like all other utilities with pressurized water
reactors, is required to calculate and report to the NRC an analysis
relating to the continuing ability of the reactor vessel to withstand a
postulated "pressurized thermal shock" event during its remaining license
life.

The Company had previously received interim NRC staff concurrence
on its analysis demonstrating that the reactor vessel would meet
established requirements through the year 2004, but recently available and
evaluated test data has caused the Company to revise that forecast. The
Company's revised analysis, which concludes that the reactor vessel will
meet established requirements without any actions by the utility through
at least 1998, is currently being evaluated by the NRC. The NRC has
requested and the Company has agreed to continue its analysis and to
provide the NRC periodic updates of its findings.

"Because the plant is licensed to operate through the year 2007,
this new data has caused us to accelerate our development of options to
extend the life of the reactor vessel," said David W. Joos, senior vice
president of nuclear, rates and marketing.

The Palisades plant has a rated capacity of 780 megawatts of
electricity, enough to serve a community of more than 450,000 residents.

Consumers Power Company, the principal subsidiary of CMS Energy
Corporation, is Michigan's largest natural gas and electric utility
serving six million of the state's nine and one-half million residents in
all 68 Lower Peninsula counties.
