Summary: ROCHESTER TEL, NYNEX MOBILE FINALIZE JOINT VENTURE
PARTNERSHIP IN UPSTATE NEW YORK
Venture will be managed by Rochester Tel

Rochester, New York --July 8, 1994 -- Rochester Telephone
Corporation (NYSE: RTC) and NYNEX Mobile Communications
announced that the two companies have closed on a joint
venture to operate a cellular network in upstate New York
that will result in improved coverage and services for
customers. The upstate network, which covers more than
20,000 square miles and serves a population base of four
million people, began operating as of July 1.

"This partnership means improved service to our
customers and growth for both of our companies," said James
Whelehan, president and chief operating officer of wireless
operations for Rochester Tel and the joint venture. "When
combined with each company's cellular interests in New York,
our customers in central and western New York will have
virtually seamless coverage as they travel throughout the
state."

Whelehan said that the benefits to consumers will
include consistent rate plans across all markets,
centralized customer service and billing and anticipated
network improvements to enhance coverage. He said that the
company plans to roll out a variety of product enhancements over
the next few months.

"As a service provider, we intend to take advantage of
economies of scale and shared marketing and network
opportunities," Whelehan said.

Whelehan said that NYNEX Mobile's recent announcement to
combine its cellular operations with Bell Atlantic will not
affect the upstate New York system. The new entity formed
from the NYNEX/Bell Atlantic alliance will become Rochester
Tel's partner in upstate New York, he said.

The joint venture includes the Metropolitan Service
Areas of Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica-Rome, as
well as a northern New York Rural Service Area near
Watertown and Alexandria Bay (Jefferson, St. Lawrence and
Lewis Counties). Plans call for the addition later this
year of the Metropolitan Service Areas of Binghamton and
Elmira. As announced last December, NYNEX plans to purchase
the Elmira property and 41 percent of Binghamton. Rochester
Tel Mobile already has a 24 percent interest in Binghamton.

Rochester Tel Mobile also has an interest in and manages
a Rural Service Area that serves New York's Southern Tier
(Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, Genesee, Wyoming and Allegheny
Counties). Elsewhere in New York State, both parties have
an interest in Orange County/Poughkeepsie, and NYNEX Mobile
also serves the Albany area and greater New York City.

The partnership, a 50/50 joint venture with Rochester
Tel as the manager, had been agreed upon by the two companies 
in March of 1993. It received approval from the New York State
Public Service Commission late last year, and from the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) in April of this year. A
waiver of the Modification of Final Judgment, required to
permit NYNEX to participate in the operation of the
Rochester system, was issued by Judge Harold Greene on May
25. The joint venture will have in excess of 200 employees
located throughout central and western New York.

Rochester Telephone Corporation serves 1.5 million
customers through a network of 48 companies in 21 states.
Its principal lines of business are long distance, wireless
communications, telephone operations and business systems.
In addition to New York State, Rochester Tel has cellular
interests in Iowa, Illinois, Alabama and Georgia and serves
a total population base of 6.5 million people, of which 4.3
million are under Rochester Tel management.
