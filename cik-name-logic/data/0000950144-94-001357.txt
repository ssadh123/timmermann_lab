FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

UNION PLANTERS CORPORATION ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS

MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE -- Union Planters Corporation today announced net
earnings and record operating earnings for the second quarter of $18.4 million,
an increase of 26% over net earnings of $14.6 million for the second quarter of
1993. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were $.68, an increase of
15% over net earnings of $.59 per share for the same period in 1993. The
Corporation's return on assets for the second quarter was 1.06% compared to
.92% in 1993, and the return on common equity was 15.51% compared to 14.46%.
For the first half of 1994, the Corporation had operating earnings of
$35.9 million, or fully diluted operating earnings per common share of $1.33.
This compares to operating earnings of $28.0 million, or $1.16 per fully
diluted common share for 1993. Net earnings for the first half of 1993 were
$33.0 million and included a benefit of $5.0 million from the adoption of
required accounting changes. Returns on assets and common equity were 1.06%
and 15.40%, respectively, for the first half of 1994 compared to returns on
assets and common equity based on operating earnings of .91% and 14.53%,
respectively, for the same period in 1993.
As of June 30, 1994, total assets had increased from June 30, 1993
(as originally reported) approximately $900 million to $7.0

billion, total loans increased approximately $700 million to $3.3 billion,
total deposits increased approximately $400 million to $5.6 billion, and
shareholders' equity increased approximately $85 million to $517 million.
Shareholders' equity to total assets and the leverage ratio were 7.42% and
7.18%, respectively, at June 30, 1994.
Net interest income for the second quarter of 1994, increased to
$62.8 million compared to $59.2 million for the same quarter in 1993. The net
interest margin for the second quarter was 4.17% compared to 4.32% for the
second quarter of 1993 and compared to 4.13% for the first quarter of 1994.
Loan demand is continuing to increase and excluding the impact of acquisitions,
average total loans increased approximately 10% from the second quarter of 1993
and increased approximately 3% over the first quarter of 1994.
Noninterest income for the second quarter was $19.3 million compared
to $23.7 million for the second quarter of 1993. Second quarter 1993
noninterest income included securities gains of $2.5 million and a one-time
gain of approximately $900,000. Additionally, profits and commissions from the
origination, packaging and securitization of mortgage and SBA loans decreased
approximately $800,000 during the second quarter of 1994 compared to the same
period in 1993.
Noninterest expenses decreased $510,000 to $56.1 million for the
second quarter of 1994 compared to $56.6 million for the same quarter in 1993.
Expense reductions and nonrecurring one-time expenses in prior periods more
than offset the increase in expenses from acquisitions.
Asset quality improvements continued in the second quarter.

Nonperforming assets decreased $7.1 million from the first quarter of 1994 to
$21.8 million. Nonperforming assets at June 30, 1993 were $33.9 million. As a
result of the improvement the Corporation did not make a provision for losses
on loans during the quarter. The provision for losses on loans for the second
quarter of 1993 was $4.7 million. The allowance for losses on loans at June
30, 1994 was $85.6 million, or 2.57% of loans.
Last year's earnings have been restated due to the acquisition of
Bank of Weiner, in Weiner, Arkansas; Central State Bank in Lexington,
Tennessee; and First State Bank in Brownsville, Tennessee which were accounted
for as poolings of interests in 1993. 1994 earnings include the results of
Simpson County Bank in Franklin, Kentucky; Adairville Banking Company in
Adairville, Kentucky (merged with Simpson County Bank June 1, 1994); The
Peoples Bank of Elk Valley in Fayetteville, Tennessee; First Citizens Bank in
Franklin, Tennessee; Anderson County Bank in Clinton, Tennessee; First National
Bank of Shelbyville, Tennessee; First National Bank in Clinton, Arkansas and
Tennessee National Bank in Columbia, Tennessee (merged into Union Planters
National Bank). All of the 1994 acquisitions have been accounted for as
poolings of interests except Anderson County Bank and Tennessee National Bank.
Union Planters Corporation, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, is a
$7.0 billion multi-bank holding company with 43 banks and 239 banking offices
in Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Alabama.
