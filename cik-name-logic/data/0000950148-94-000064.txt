ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On February 3, 1994, Westwood One, Inc. ("WWO") acquired all of the
issued and outstanding common stock of Unistar Radio Networks, Inc. ("Unistar")
from Unistar Communications Group, Inc. for $16,589,235 and the assumption
of Unistar's indebtedness in the amount of $84,710,765. WWO acquired all
of Unistar's rights in, and obligations with respect to, the property and
assets owned, leased or used by it in connection with Unistar's radio network
business, which business includes, among other things, Unistar's radio
programming in a variety of formats provided to affiliate radio stations, and
the packaging of radio programming formats into "networks" offered by Unistar
to advertisers.

Funds to complete the acquisition were obtained from a new credit
agreement in the amount of $125,000,000 with The Chase Manhattan Bank, The
First National Bank of Boston and the Bank of Montreal.

In connection with the acquisition, WWO also sold to Infinity Network,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, 5,000,000
newly issued shares of WWO's Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$15,000,000 and a warrant to purchase up to an additional 3,000,000 shares of
Common Stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. 

Concurrent with the acquisition, WWO entered into a management
agreement with Infinity Broadcasting Corporation pursuant to which Infinity
will manage the business and operations of WWO for an annual base management
fee of $2,000,000 (adjusted for inflation), an annual cash bonus payable in the
event certain cash flow targets are achieved and warrants to purchase up to
1,500,000 shares of Common Stock. Additionally, a voting agreement was entered
into among WWO, Norman J. Pattiz and Infinity Network, Inc. pursuant to which
the Board of Directors will be reconstituted into a nine-member board, and
providing for Mr. Pattiz to vote his shares of Class B stock on any matter to
be presented to the shareholders in accordance with the recommendation of the
majority of the full Board of Directors.
